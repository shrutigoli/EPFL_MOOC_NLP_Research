1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,340
Welcome.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,070
I'm Maggie Montgomery, from the World
Health Organization.

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,820
And, here today to talk about the
evaluation

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,390
and the validation of household water
treatment technology.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,850
So, I want to thank, Dr. Johnston for
inviting me.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,920
And let's get started.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,190
So there's going to be three main things
I'd like to talk to you about today.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,490
The first is why is it important

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,420
to assess the performance of household
water treatment.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,600
And I'll talk just briefly about the fact

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,760
that household water treatment, the main
benefit is health.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,118
And so it's important that we know how
well.

13
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:40,050
Household water treatment technologies
remove pathogens so we

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,220
have some indication of the protection of
health.

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,820
And second, I'll talk about the WHO

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,470
global standards on the performance of
household water treatment.

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,750
And give a bit of background about how
they were developed.

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,140
And lastly, I'll talk about what WHO is
doing to implement these standards.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,570
Specifically,

20
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,880
discuss the WHO International Scheme

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,481
to evaluate household water treatment
technologies.

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,240
There's two main reasons why it's
important to

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
assess the performance of household water
treatments technology.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,000
The first is to understand if these
technologies are achieving

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,165
the objectives of improving health, which
requires, first of all that they

26
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,590
remove the pathogens that are causing

27
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,340
the diarrhoeal disease in a specific
population.

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,250
And in some cases, we know specially which
pathogens are causing that disease.

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,710
For example, in a cholera outbreak, it's
very well known that

30
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,508
is the bacterium vibrio cholerae that is
causing the diarrhoeal disease.

31
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:44,530
But in other cases, for example, people
living with HIV AIDS, who are more

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,010
susceptible to diarrhoeal disease, it
could be

33
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,370
a suite of pathogens that are causing this
disease.

34
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,450
And in all cases, it's important that the

35
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,395
devices that are being used with these
specific populations

36
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:00,750
are removing the pathogens we are most
concerned about.

37
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,040
And if we don't know exactly which
pathogens those are, it is

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,990
prudent to make sure that these devices
remove a suite of pathogens.

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,010
The second reason why assessing household
water treatment performance is

40
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,050
important is that government especially, as
well as implementers and funders

41
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,820
need to know that the devices that
they are investing

42
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,810
in are achieving the aims that they set
out to achieve.

43
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,850
And this requires a rigorous evaluation of
household water treatment.

44
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,590
Now, in many countries where household
water treatment is most needed, 

45
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,650
Where the water quality is poor and the
diarrhoeal disease burden is

46
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,040
high, governments don't have the
resources,

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,850
nor the capacity to do such evaluations.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,200
And lastly, I just wanted to emphasize
that while today's talk

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,940
is going to be focused on the performance,
realizing the health

50
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,160
benefits from household water treatment
also requires that users correctly and

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,120
consistently use household water treatment
when their water quality is compromised.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,930
So in order to facilitate the evaluation
of household water treatment

53
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,870
WHO came out with global recommendations
on how to assess performance.

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,190
Now, these global recommendations, the
goal is to protect

55
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,240
the health of the users and also to ensure
that

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,510
more household water treatments products

57
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,880
that achieve minimum performance standards
are

58
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,040
being distributed and used to those that
most need safe water.

59
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,880
Now specifically the recommendations look
at three main classes of pathogens.

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,080
And these three classes of pathogens, I
know you've already talked

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,270
about with Dr. Johnston and hopefully you
understand well at this point.

62
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,660
But these are the three main classes that
cause diarrhoeal

63
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,680
disease in humans and they are viruses
bacteria and protozoa.

64
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,100
From these three classes of pathogens we
derived

65
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,160
targets and what I mean by targets we

66
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,640
derived, what are the minimum amounts of
removal

67
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,900
that need to be achieved in order to

68
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,780
achieve a certain minimum amount of risk
in a population.

69
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,870
Now these targets were derived based on
what has already been done in the WHO

70
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,540
guidelines for drinking water quality. And
these guidelines

71
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,940
use what is called quantitative microbial
risk assessment.

72
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,360
So quantitative microbial risk assessment
are basically models that allow

73
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,730
us to predict what will be the health
consequences in a population if they

74
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:31,640
ingest a certain concentration of
pathogens with a certain frequency.

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,510
So for these models we obviously had to
pick specific pathogens within each of

76
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:42,290
these, classes of viruses, bacteria and
protozoa to come up with an estimate.

77
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,140
Now from that estimate we also decided.

78
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,800
What was the minimum amount of risk we're
willing to accept and I'll talk

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,930
about that in the next slide, that allowed
us to then develop our removal target.

80
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,410
We also used a tiered approach.

81
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,940
So rather than setting one very high bar

82
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,760
for household water treatment, we
recognized that even

83
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,480
devices that maybe are not the best but

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,800
do provide some protection and even
limited protection,

85
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,240
can have a very significant impact in
populations where the concentrations

86
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
of pathogens are very high and the disease
burden is very high.

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,010
So this tiered approach was done to
acknowledge the fact

88
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,510
that even lesser performing devices can
still have an health impact.

89
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,040
It was also created because we recognized
in some situations it's just simply not

90
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,930
economically feasible to have the very top
device, and cheaper

91
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,780
and perhaps less protective devices can
still have an important impact.

92
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,340
Lastly, the recommendations provide some
information on the laboratory

93
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,510
protocols, or how you would actually go
about doing experiments

94
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,280
to test the performance of these household
water treatment devices.

95
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,910
Before I present the performance
standards,

96
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,565
I want just to briefly highlight what

97
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,800
log-removal is and what it actually means

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,700
when we're talking about concentrations of
pathogens.

99
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,380
So let's say, for example, we start with
100

100
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,680
cryptosporidium before we put the water
through a filter.

101
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,900
We put the water trough the filter and
filtering we have 10 cryptosporidium.

102
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,450
So that means we've removed 90
cyrptosporidium pretty

103
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,040
simple math, we can equate that to a

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,480
percentage and we say we have 90% removal
and that is equivalent to 1 log removal.

105
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,110
Now let's say with that same source water
we still have a 100 cryptosporidium.

106
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,160
But after filtering we use a better
filter, a more highly performing filter.

107
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,170
We only have one cryptosporidium remaining
in the water after it's been filtered.

108
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,100
This means we, we've removed 99
cryptosporidium.

109
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,163
Or achieved a two-log removal.

110
00:06:58,163 --> 00:07:00,850
Assessing performance.

111
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,880
So based on the quantitative microbial
risk models I spoke of earlier, we were

112
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,240
able to develop specific reduction targets
for

113
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,530
each of the three classes of pathogens,

114
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,030
based on allowable risk.

115
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,080
Now the most stringent requirements were
the category where

116
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,480
we're allowing the least amount of risk in
a

117
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,770
population, specifically ten to the
negative six DALYs per

118
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,120
person per year, it is a highly protective
category.

119
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,880
Now in this category

120
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,216
devices must achieve at least four log
removal of bacteria, at least

121
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:41,210
five log removal of viruses and at least
four log removal protozoa.

122
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,920
Now you'll notice, that for the viruses,
the

123
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,140
log reduction is even greater, because we
know viruses

124
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,710
are more likely to cause infection and
disease with

125
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,370
just a single virus, compared to the other
pathogens.

126
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,920
Now for the protective category, we're
allowing

127
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,030
a slightly less conservative risk in the
population.

128
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,800
It's 10 to the negative fourth DALYs.

129
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,530
And consequently, the log removal doesn't
have to be quite as high.

130
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,510
Two, at least two for bacteria, at least

131
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,432
three for viruses and at least two for
protozoa.

132
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:23,220
The final category "Limited protection"
are actually technologies

133
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,840
that achieve at least two of the targets
for

134
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,200
the classes of pathogens in protective.

135
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,190
Now, these may be technologies that do
really well for

136
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,950
two of the classes, but not on the third.

137
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,750
In populations where we are very sure of
the main

138
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,600
pathogen that's causing disease, they
could be a very effective option.

139
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,570
Now, for each of these classes of
bacteria, viruses, and protozoa,

140
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,380
we had to chose one specific organism to
represent the class as a

141
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,050
whole, in order to develop the models and
come up with the specific log-reductions.

142
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,160
So we choose pathogens that we know in
human

143
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,950
populations do account for a significant
proportion of diarrhoeal disease.

144
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,990
And bacteria specifically it's
campylobacter, virus

145
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,420
is rotavirus, and protozoa was
cryptosporidium.

146
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,990
Now what are some

147
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,880
examples of technologies that are already
being used in the

148
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,070
field and have been tested quite
rigorously in the lab.

149
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,450
That meet these performance standards.

150
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,270
Well for highly protective, the number one

151
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,788
technology or actually it's a method, is
boiling.

152
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:34,790
This is by far the oldest method we have
and it's very efficacious in the removal,

153
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,730
but the problem with boiling is

154
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,150
recontamination, so that's an important
issue to consider.

155
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,120
Ultra filters, I know you've just
learned about filtration, are

156
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,760
also very efficacious as well as a
combination of approaches.

157
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,310
So you may do filtering followed by
chlorination

158
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,170
in order to achieve a higher level of
protection.

159
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,870
In the middle category we have

160
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,080
membrane filters as well as many
flocculant-disinfectant.

161
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,510
And lastly in limited production category
some examples include chlorine which we

162
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,290
know is very effective against bacteria

163
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,420
especially cholera, but fairly ineffective
against protozoa,

164
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,620
especially cryptosporidium.

165
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,400
Ceramic filters and some bio-sand filters

166
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,870
also fall into this limited protection
category.

167
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,010
Now you may wonder why did we have three
levels of performance.

168
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,600
Well there's two main reasons.

169
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,460
First of all, we know in populations where

170
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,070
there is a high burden of diarrhoeal
disease and

171
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,400
a high load of fecal contamination in

172
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,310
the environment and therefore in the
drinking water.

173
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,480
Even devices that achieved the protective
or limited

174
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,900
protection level could have a significant
impact on health.

175
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:54,670
We also know that in many of these areas,
economics and costs are huge barriers.

176
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:00,640
And, sometimes the highly protective
devices may also be cost-prohibitive.

177
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,460
So we don't want to prevent other, maybe
lesser-performing but still having

178
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,550
some protection devices, such as
protective

179
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,138
and limited protection from reaching those
populations.

180
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,310
Nuts and bolts of testing.

181
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,150
So how do we actually

182
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,950
test these devices and what kind of water
do we use

183
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,210
to see that we're actually achieving a
certain level of performance.

184
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,650
Well we want to really mimic the types of
waters that

185
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,200
we find in the environments and
communities that would use these devices.

186
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,010
So, in order to do this,

187
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,860
we've developed two types of waters.

188
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,340
The first is a general test water.

189
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,400
Now this is water that represents high
quality groundwater or rainwater.

190
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,980
It will have a very low turbidity, so
there's not

191
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,940
a lot of particulates in the water, and a

192
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,680
temperature that is fairly consistent with
the ambient temperature. It

193
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,570
is the non-stressed phase of testing, so
it's not technology specific.

194
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,050
We also though, want to see how these
devices will perform when we have

195
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,290
really turbid or contaminated water like
this river that you see here in Lao.

196
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,710
Many people are still using surface water

197
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,150
and this challenge water is supposed to
represent

198
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,560
such surface waters like rivers or ponds,
so the

199
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,410
turbidity is very high as well as the TOC.

200
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,040
Now this is the stressed phase challenge
phase of testing and depending on

201
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,300
the different product, we may vary

202
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,370
the conditions, as different products will
fail

203
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,010
under different conditions,

204
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,480
depending on whether or not it's a filter

205
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,650
or a chemical additive or some combination
of approaches.

206
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,400
We've talked about why it's important to

207
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,800
assess the performance of household water
treatment.

208
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,210
And we've also talked about the global

209
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,740
recommendations on performance of
household water treatment.

210
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,990
The third thing I want to talk about

211
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,740
is the WHO Scheme to evaluate household
water treatment technologies, which

212
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,400
is specifically how WHO and governments

213
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,880
are working to implement these
recommendations.

214
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,010
There's two main objectives to this
scheme.

215
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,890
The first is to promote and coordinate the
independent testing and

216
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:16,200
evaluation of household water treatment
products based on the WHO criteria.

217
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,620
I would like to stress the word

218
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,680
independent because often we find that
laboratories,

219
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,560
especially in particular countries, do not
have

220
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,100
the ability to provide independent and
objective

221
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,820
evaluations.

222
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,050
The second, is to support national
governments

223
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,060
in building the technical capacity of
research institutions.

224
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,210
So, improve the ability for governments to
assess local products, to

225
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,630
do complimentary testing in the field of
household water treatment products.

226
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,850
Especially after they've been in use for
some time.

227
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,820
And this is all linked to WHO's greater
work in water quality,

228
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,120
on applying the WHO guidelines on drinking
water quality.

229
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,612
In summary, I'd like to stress two main
points.

230
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:02,652
First hopefully by now you've understood
that the assessment

231
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:06,872
of household water treatment performance
is important for protecting health.

232
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:08,632
Now, I spoke only about the

233
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:11,582
microbiological performance of household water
treatment.

234
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:14,612
The chemical performance of household water
treatment also

235
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:18,092
is important and is something that WHO
recognizes,

236
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:20,192
needs to be addresses, but hasn't been
developed

237
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,742
yet in terms of a set of global
guidelines.

238
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,922
I also want to make sure you leave

239
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:28,642
by remembering that is equally important
that these

240
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:32,592
products are used correctly and
consistently by the

241
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:35,162
groups that are most at risk for
diarrhoeal disease.

242
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:39,972
So young children, people with HIV/AIDS,
those in emergencies

243
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:42,512
or in cholera outbreaks are just a few
examples.

244
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:47,552
Secondly, the WHO International Scheme to
Evaluate

245
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:50,032
household water treatment aims first of
all to

246
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:52,862
inform and to provide objective
information about

247
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:55,892
performance but it also hopes to spark
innovation.

248
00:14:55,892 --> 00:14:57,092
And already we're seeing that

249
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:59,902
manufacturers are trying to develop
technologies

250
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:03,932
that not only are highly protective but
also are low cost,

251
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:07,742
easy to use and can be easily distributed

252
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:12,032
in places where water quality is
poorest.

253
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:14,992
And lastly, the scheme aims to build
capacity

254
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:18,212
so someday in the future, we can work

255
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:20,552
ourselves out of the job, and
governments

256
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,542
themselves can evaluate and regulate
household water treatment technologies.

257
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:28,962
So I would like to thank you for your
attention.

258
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:33,582
I'd like to point you to some additional
resources and information.

259
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:36,552
First of all, if you want to read the
performance recommendations

260
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:41,572
I spoke about, you can find them online at
this web address.

261
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,622
These are the recommendations.

262
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:46,702
Also if you want to learn more about the
scheme, you can go to

263
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:49,102
the website that presents all the
information

264
00:15:49,102 --> 00:15:53,502
about the scheme, their related protocols,
the laboratories.

265
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,507
And lastly, if you're just interested in

266
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:58,040
household water treatment more generally,
I refer you

267
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,952
to the WHO/UNICEF International Network on

268
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:03,292
Household Water Treatment and Safe
Storage,

269
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:07,392
which is working on a variety of issues,
to try to make sure household

270
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:12,322
water treatment, gets to where it's
needed, and used by those most in need.

271
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:12,972
So thank you.
