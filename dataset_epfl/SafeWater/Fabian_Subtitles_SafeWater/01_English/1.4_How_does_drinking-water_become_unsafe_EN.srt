1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,090
Now you know about some of the specific
pathogens that can cause diarrheal

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,890
disease, and that most of these pathogens
originate in human or animal feces.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, there's so many different pathogens
that

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,070
it's impractical to try and measure them
all.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,780
So what we do instead is we use

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,010
indicator species to indicate the presence
of fecal contamination.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,660
Today we'll talk about those indicator
species

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,530
and also look at a tool for charting

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,050
out pathways of transmission of diseases,
called the F-diagram.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,010
Finally we'll touch briefly on chemical
water quality

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,820
though it's not a focus of this course.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,440
It would be impractical and impossible
actually to directly

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,320
measure all the different pathogens that
could cause diarrheal disease.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,460
So instead we look for indicator species

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,040
that can show the presence of fecal
contamination.

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,610
Some characteristics of an ideal fecal
indicator are that, it should be something

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,882
that's universally present in the feces of
both human and animals in large numbers.

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,000
Those numbers should be higher than the

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
actual numbers of the pathogens of
interest.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,779
And the indicator should not be harmful or
pathogenic in itself.

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,170
It should be something that's readily
detected

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,000
using simple, inexpensive methods, and it
should

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,560
also persist in the environment, or water,
in a similar manner to fecal pathogens.

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,510
You wouldn't want it to actually grow in

25
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,210
natural waters because then you would get
misrepresentation.

26
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,730
And finally, if possible the indicator
should respond

27
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,030
to treatment in a similar fashion to
faecal pathogens.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,320
One of the most common indicator species

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,300
is a bacteria class called total
coliforms.

30
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,070
Total coliforms are bacteria that can
ferment lactose

31
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,900
and produce acid and gas at 35 degrees
Celsius.

32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,480
There are many different families of
coliforms.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,410
Citrobacter, Klebsiella, Hafnia, and
Enterobacter.

34
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,370
And for this reason, total coliforms is
not really useful as

35
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,389
a fecal indicator, because many of these
bacteria have non-fecal sources.

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,700
However total coliforms can be useful

37
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,160
for operational monitoring to demonstrate
for example

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,630
the effectiveness of treatment or overall

39
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,000
cleanliness and integrity in a
distribution system.

40
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,030
Thermotolerant coliforms as their name
applies can tolerate heat

41
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,539
and these are subset of the total coliform
class.

42
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,930
Thermotolerant coliforms are what used to
be called faecal coliforms, and

43
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,000
they can ferment lactose within 48 hours
at 44 degrees Celsius.

44
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,040
Feces contain a large number of
thermotolerant coliforms, but

45
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,840
there are some indications of non-faecal
sources of thermotolerant coliforms.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,600
Such as klebsiella and some species of
enterobacter.

47
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,015
Also there's evidence that thermotolerance
under some conditions can

48
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:09,800
grow or die off in water at ambient
temperatures.

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,679
So it's not a bad indicator, but it has
some limitations.

50
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,520
Escherichia coli, or E. coli, is

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,790
one specific species of Thermotolerant
Coliforms

52
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,460
that is generally agreed to be the most
suitable indicator of fecal contamination.

53
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,400
There's some possibility that E. coli might

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,960
grow in the environment in tropical
settings.

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,740
And it's only moderately persistent.

56
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,720
So the absence of E. coli

57
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,120
doesn't necessarily mean the absence
of faecal contamination.

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,580
However, on balance, considering all the
different

59
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,800
ideal characteristics some indicator
bacteria, E. coli

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,290
is considered to be the best
available option.

61
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,800
Indicator bacteria are usually reported in
terms of the

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,880
number of counts or colonies in a 100 mL
sample.

63
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,600
Many drinking water standards and WHO
guidelines are set to be no detectible E.

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,610
coli or thermotolerant coliforms in a 100
mL sample.

65
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,970
You can consider that water that has
higher levels of indicator

66
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,550
bacteria, is probably more likely to have,
higher levels of fecal contamination.

67
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,130
Though there is not a very clear
correlation

68
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,350
between indicator bacteria and pathogens
on the other hand.

69
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,470
Still water having very high levels of E.

70
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,310
coli, more than 1000 counts per 100 mLs
It's probably very risky for consumption.

71
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,790
Water having no detectable e coli in it,

72
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,060
however, might not be completely safe
because E. coli

73
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,110
is relatively less persistent and
robust

74
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,320
in the environment compared to some
pathogens.

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,840
For this reason, it would be preferable to
combine

76
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,500
a measure of water quality, such as an E. coli

77
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,320
measure, with some kind of assessment
of the system's safety, like a sanitary

78
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,910
inspection, which identifies a number of
risk factors at a water source.

79
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,020
Then by combining a water quality measure
on

80
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,540
the vertical axis and a water
management measure

81
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,040
on the horizontal axis, we can make a

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,482
risk matrix and prioritize areas, water
sources for interventions.

83
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,600
While E. coli

84
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,640
or thermotolerant coliforms are the
most commonly used indicator

85
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,580
species, other indicators might be more
relevant for certain purposes.

86
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,770
Viruses travel in the environment very
differently than bacteria, so one might

87
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,820
want to look at coliphage viruses that
required a bacteria host to survive.

88
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,130
As an indicator for viruses.

89
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,762
Faecal streptococci are more hardly robust
bacteria compared to E. coli

90
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:57,330
so they could persist longer in the
environment and

91
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,650
maybe be a better indicator of long term
faecal contamination.

92
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,200
Traditionally methods for enumerating
Faecal

93
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,780
streptococci have been more complicated.

94
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,430
But this is changing with the development
of new methods.

95
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,970
Finally, protozoa can be very resistant to

96
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,720
disinfection, to heat, to chlorine, to
ozone.

97
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,060
So E. coli

98
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,870
is not a good indicator for a
treatment efficacy, you'll see.

99
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,080
But some bacteria like Clostridium
perfringens

100
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,240
or some Bacillus species can form spores

101
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,040
which are roughly similar in size

102
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,210
and resistance to some protozoan
pathogens.

103
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,810
Now the pathogens that we're concerned
about, whether they're

104
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,700
viruses, bacterial or protozoa, they
mostly originate in feces.

105
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,700
But they don't cause health problems
unless they are ingested by a new host.

106
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,970
Which means taking them in through the
mouth, which is on their face.

107
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,930
So we can think about, how can pathogens
travel then, from feces to faces?

108
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,610
And there's a useful learning tool for
describing the different pathways.

109
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,730
It's called the F-diagram.

110
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,990
Here's a nice picture of the F-diagram

111
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,010
developed by WEDC in Loughburough, the
United Kingdom.

112
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,210
And it's called the F-Diagram because many

113
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,980
of the intermediate phases in the
environment

114
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,890
where a contamination can take place have
words that start with the letter F.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,155
So if we start of course with feces, how
can we get to

116
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:34,060
faces, well we can go through fluids which
is the subject of this course.

117
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,510
And actually the nice thing about this
diagram is that you can

118
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:43,308
see what the blue star where the water
related pathways are.

119
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:48,810
So between feces and fluids you have water
source protection and after the fluids

120
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,580
to the host you have a transport storage
and treatment of water.

121
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,530
Besides the fluids, you have fingers,
which

122
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,420
can directly contaminate fluids or foods
or faces.

123
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:09,440
And also flies, remember the trachoma
which is caused by flies landing on faces.

124
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,580
Fields, here, having poor sanitation, is
a major risk factor.

125
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,250
And flooding again if there's poor

126
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,250
sanitation can lead to exposure to
pathogens.

127
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,900
Now let's focus in on those pathways

128
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,460
between feces and faces that involve
water.

129
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,400
We can think about a safe water chain

130
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,280
with different stages where contamination
could be introduced.

131
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,560
Contamination could occur at the water
resource itself

132
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,380
or during delivery to the consumer, fecal
matter can

133
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,350
also be introduced during the collection
and transport

134
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,290
of water if the source is outside the
home.

135
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,570
When water is stored inside the household
it could become contaminated.

136
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,540
And finally the drinking water vessel itself,
a cup

137
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,740
or a glass might be dirty and introduce
fecal matter.

138
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,420
Now let's look at an illustration of these
different stages in a safe water chain.

139
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,520
First the water resource itself can be

140
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,790
contaminated from contact with human or
animal feces.

141
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,962
Surface water often contains faecal
bacteria but even

142
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:21,260
groundwater aquifers can be contaminated
by inadequately managed sanitation.

143
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,600
Even if the water resources is clean or if
water is purified at

144
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,610
a treatment plant, it can become

145
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,810
contaminated during delivery to the
consumer.

146
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,650
For example in a piped water supply, if
there is not continuous pressure

147
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,700
in the distribution system, contaminated
water may

148
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,210
enter the pipes through cracks or joints.

149
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,220
Another example though, could be an
improperly constructed rising main on

150
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,420
a borehole, or suction hand pumps, which
are primed with unsafe water.

151
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,640
The point of collection itself can be
contaminated.

152
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,760
Think of a communal tap or borehole spout,
which

153
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,480
is handled and contacted by adults,
children and even animals.

154
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,640
And when the point of collection is
outside the

155
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,680
home, people must use containers which
themselves may be dirty.

156
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,580
And people often rinse containers and wipe
them with their hands before filling them

157
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,280
up, but if their hands are not clean this
may not help at all.

158
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,080
The containers must then be transported
back

159
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,320
to the household giving another
opportunity for contamination.

160
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,090
Open containers are especially vulnerable,
because it's easy to

161
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,910
contact the water with hands during
lifting and carrying.

162
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,880
And also dust or insects can enter an
uncovered container.

163
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,570
Once the water is take to the household,
it is

164
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,870
often transferred to another container,
and may be stored un-hygienically.

165
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,670
In open containers or on the floor

166
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,530
where children and animals can introduce
pathogens.

167
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,230
Point of use water treatment at this stage
offers the possibility

168
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,370
of inactivating pathogens introduced at
earlier points in the water chain.

169
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,360
But, even after storage, contamination
possibilities exist.

170
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,800
Water may be retrieved from storage
containers using an unclean

171
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,630
dipper or ladle, especially if the storage
container is uncovered.

172
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,760
Finally, the drinking vessel itself, a
cup, or a glass,

173
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,980
or, perhaps, a gourd, could be full of
fecal contamination.

174
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,070
Again, people may wipe the drink vessel
with their hands

175
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,510
before using it but this might actually
the glass dirtier.

176
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,680
So, there are many opportunities for
contamination between the original

177
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,780
source of drinking water and the actual
point of consumption.

178
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,490
A big advantage of household water
treatment is

179
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,010
that it offers the possibility of removing
any

180
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,440
contamination that is introduced at the
water resource,

181
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,410
the delivery system or through collection
and transport.

182
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,450
Many household water treatments don't
prevent re-contamination so it

183
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,150
is important to have safe storage after a
treatment step.

184
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,230
And likewise, good hygiene, especially
washing hands with soap

185
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,470
is important to minimize the possibility

186
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,490
of clean drinking water becoming
contaminated

187
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,160
just before consumption by using a cup or
glass that is faecally contaminated.

188
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,920
So in this module, we have talked about

189
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,756
different indicators of faecal
contamination and how E. coli

190
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:28,420
the preferred indicator bacteria.

191
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,140
We've shown you the F-diagram,

192
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,340
which illustrates different pathways
between feces

193
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,910
and faces, that lead to exposure

194
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,230
to pathogens, including through drinking
water.

195
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,420
And we've talked about different stages
along

196
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,430
the safe water chain from catchment to
cup.

197
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,000
Where drinking water can become
contaminated.

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,600
Now in the next module, we'll introduce
those

199
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,793
treatment technologies for household water
treatment and safe storage.
