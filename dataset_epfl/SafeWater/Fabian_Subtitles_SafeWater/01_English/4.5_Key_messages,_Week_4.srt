00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,860
This week we looked at a range

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,970
of different ways that HWTS interventions
can be implemented.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,550
We started by considering approaches that
seek to

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,540
either maximize profits, or social goods,
like reducing disease,

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,900
and how social businesses combine some of
the

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,290
aspects of those two approaches. 
But whichever

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,630
approach is taken, basic questions of
demand, supply,

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,760
and financing need to be taken into
consideration.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,740
Next, we looked at targeted approaches
where by integrating with other kinds

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,690
of interventions, it's more possible to
reach the vulnerable people efficiently.

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,780
So, the examples we looked at here were in
schools, through education programs.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,280
And with the health sector, through either
maternal and

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,570
child health initiatives, like this
antenatal care project in Malawi,

14
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,621
or HIV AIDS management programs.

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,990
And in both cases there are, 
synergies that can be had.

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,110
Both interventions can gain if for
example,

17
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,280
in the health care example, it was shown

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,270
that people sought more health care when

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,420
the program was tied with an HWTS
intervention.

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,590
And at the same time, uptake rates were
very high.

21
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,590
And there are a variety of reason for
this.

22
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,760
It could be that the people are
particularly

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,570
vulnerable and willing to adopt a new
behavior.

24
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,925
Could be that the communication channels
are

25
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:41,920
well-trusted whether its teachers or
healthcare workers.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,720
But, for whatever reason, there's evidence
that this kind of

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,790
integrated approach can yield benefits 
for both interventions.

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,685
We next considered a very specific type of

29
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:59,090
targeting vulnerable populations, that of
HWTS in emergencies.

30
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,000
We had a guest lecture from Dr. Daniele
Lantagne at Tufts University in the USA

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,850
and she talked about some of the

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,160
experiences evaluating HWTS in a range of
countries.

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,540
And one of the key things from her
findings

34
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,190
were that preparation is key in advance of
the emergency.

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,450
And also that you have to have that
combination

36
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,880
of unsafe water and effective treatment
and consistent and

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,570
effective use in order to realize health
gains and

38
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,780
we'll come back to that message in next
week's modules.

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,970
Finally, we looked at some of the
different

40
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,030
roles that government bodes can play in
HWTS interventions.

41
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,880
Different kinds of government bodies at
different levels.

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,190
And took as a frame work, the

43
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,730
human rights consideration of,
responsibilities of governments

44
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,680
to respect, to protect and to fulfill

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,840
rights, and in particular, with relation
to HWTS.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,940
We saw how that fulfilling responsibility
could

47
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,250
involve facilitation through information
collecting and coordination.

48
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,020
Could also involve promotion and
evaluation of technologies.

49
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:16,220
And finally, provision of services,
especially targeting the vulnerable

50
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,928
people who have no other ways to access
safe water.

51
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:27,400
We then gave an example of how national
plans and strategies can

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,618
bring together these different roles of
government into a coherent package.
