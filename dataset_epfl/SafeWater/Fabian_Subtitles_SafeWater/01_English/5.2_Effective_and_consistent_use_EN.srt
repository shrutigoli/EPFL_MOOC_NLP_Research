1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,200
We've seen several times now that there
are

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,140
three elements necessary to realize health
gains through HWTS.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,690
People have to be drinking unsafe water.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,580
They have to have access to an effective
option for treatment.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,210
And they have to apply that treatment
effectively and consistently.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,370
This last bit is tricky.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,110
HWTS is not like vaccination where you do
something

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,580
once and then you have a long term
protection.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,750
It's also not like many chemicals where
roughly speaking if you

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,550
reduce the dose by half, you reduce the
disease burden by half.

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,850
Household water treatment is different, in
that it has to be done

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,880
consistently and correctly, over and over
again, to realize the health gains.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,650
And this poses particular challenges.

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,430
First, unsafe water.

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,080
There's actually plenty of it out there.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,570
The Joint Monitoring Program of WHO and
UNICEF

17
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,300
reported that in 2011, 768 million people
were

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,170
using unimproved sources of drinking
water, such as

19
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,870
unprotected wells or springs or open
surface water.

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,420
But even among those using an improved
source, like tap water, a bore

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,900
hole, rainwater collection, improved
springs and

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,610
wells, drinking water is not always safe.

23
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,280
Either the resource itself may be
contaminated, or

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,070
water can become contaminated thru
collection, transport,

25
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,670
and storage, as we saw in one of those
animations from the first week.

26
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,050
It's been estimated that around 1.8
billion people are actually

27
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,810
drinking water which contains measurable E
coli, or thermotolerant coliforms.

28
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,440
So, there is plenty of unsafe water out
there.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,320
And, in the discussion on targeting
vulnerable groups, we talked

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,870
about strategies for reaching those with
particularly poor water quality.

31
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,830
Obviously, you have to apply an effective
treatment option.

32
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,710
And, Maggie Montgomery described to us,
the

33
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,245
WHO scheme for evaluating household water
treatment options.

34
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:12,250
And remember, the WHO in that document has
defined

35
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,120
three classes of effectiveness based on
log reduction values.

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,550
Where to be 

37
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,880
highly protective, a technology must be
able

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:30,670
to reduce bacteria by at least four logs,
five for viruses, and four for protozoa.

39
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,560
The protective level is a little bit less

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,720
stripped by two orders of magnitude, and
the

41
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,590
interim level applies when a technology
meets the

42
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,000
protective criterion for two of the three
pathogen classes.

43
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,200
But an option which works well in a
laboratory

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,130
evaluation may perform completely
differently in the real world.

45
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,810
There are differences of course in the
person applying the treatment but

46
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,360
also in the environment, the water
quality, the containers used, et cetera.

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,510
So it's useful to distinguish between
efficacy

48
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,500
which is how well something works under

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,280
ideal controlled conditions, and
effectiveness which is

50
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,439
how well it works in the real world.

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,710
The WHO scheme will measure efficacy, not
effectiveness.

52
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,890
And there's a good example of the

53
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,710
difference between the two in Ecuador,
where a

54
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,730
long term research project has
examined

55
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,850
household water treatment with chlorine,
among other things.

56
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:35,480
Now, chlorine is highly effective against
bacteria and particular against E. coli.

57
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:42,100
And the evaluation team, led by Laura
McLaughlin confirmed this with their own

58
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:49,360
tests in 2009, finding LRVs of three to
six, depending on the indicator organism.

59
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,580
So the efficacy was good.

60
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,330
But the evaluation team also found that
LRVs

61
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,680
were much lower, around one, in actual
households.

62
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,240
And that there was no significant
difference in

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,340
LRV between households applying
chlorination and households that didn't.

64
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,550
Even the measured chlorine residual was
not significantly

65
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,760
higher in households which reported
chlorinating their water.

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,380
A similar study by the same group, and
this paper is by Karen Levy, found

67
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,780
that E. coli could be detected in around

68
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,620
half of the households reportedly
protecting, practicing chlorination.

69
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,150
And some of the factors they found that
correlated with poor LRVs were

70
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,880
high turbidity in water, higher
concentrations of E. coli in the raw water.

71
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,140
And there was also evidence of household

72
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,800
level contamination from poor water
handling and storage.

73
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,920
Even if a treatment is effectively applied
at the household level,

74
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,190
it has to be done consistently, day in and
day out.

75
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,670
And this is a major challenge both for
households to

76
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,330
actually do this and for researchers to
monitor and evaluate practices.

77
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,550
If you ask people if they have treated
their

78
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,960
water they may respond with what they
think you

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,750
would like to hear, especially if you've
been involved

80
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,600
in the team promoting HWTS in the first
place.

81
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:21,640
So self-reported HWTS practice is
subjective and probably more useful as an

82
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,890
indicator of knowledge, or perhaps
societal

83
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,410
expectations and norms than of actual
practice.

84
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,660
In some cases, there could be more
objective indicators.

85
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,860
And chlorine is the best example because
residual chlorine

86
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,059
can be measured easily and quickly in the
field.

87
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,930
Others have attempted to observe other
kinds of HWTS practice.

88
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,300
Like seeing if a household filter is wet,
or appears to be in regular use.

89
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,010
Or if SODIS bottles are in the household,
or present up on the rooftop.

90
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,850
Another objective indicator, though, is to
just measure

91
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,210
the E. coli levels in the raw water and

92
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,980
the stored water to see if there has

93
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,380
been some kind of improvement in microbial
water quality.

94
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,857
So objective indicators can help to
measure, effective

95
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:17,728
use, but consistent use is, is harder
still.

96
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:21,960
Consistent use, or sometimes people say
compliance

97
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,820
or adherence means only using treated
water for

98
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,960
drinking purposes, throughout the day, the
week,

99
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,350
the month, the different seasons of the
year.

100
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,390
And it's hard to measure this.

101
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,710
What you would really like to have would

102
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,130
be many repeat visits what's called a
longitudinal study.

103
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,360
And this is important but very
difficult and expensive to do.

104
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,630
And where it has been done, researchers
tend to find that people have

105
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,784
very different water treatment practices,
even different

106
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:56,220
self-reported practices from one visit to
another.

107
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,960
A related issue is the long-term use
sustainability of HWTS use.

108
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,460
And if an evaluation is done just a few
months after an intervention is complete,

109
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:14,650
it probably doesn't give a very accurate
picture of the long-term consistent use.

110
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,090
HWTS is special because you have to have
both effective use and

111
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,800
high compliance, or consistent use, or
adherence to get large health impacts.

112
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,180
This is the subject of an analysis by Joe

113
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,460
Brown and Tom Clasen, who used modeling to
look at

114
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,660
the relationship between water quality,
raw water quality, consistent

115
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,414
use of HWTS, and they use the term
adherence.

116
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,836
And health outcomes, expressed here as
DALYs

117
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,430
averted for hundred thousand persons per
year.

118
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,900
This graph shows that if the raw water is
of poor quality, high risk.

119
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,790
Let's look at classes A, B, and C.

120
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,390
Then there are large health gains to be
had.

121
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:05,829
Here's A, B and C, if HWTS is
always applied.

122
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:12,524
But if you take even 10% of your water
without treatment or have 90% adherence,

123
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:18,110
then in classes A and B, you have very
little health impact.

124
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,410
That's because even a little bit of highly
contaminated water,

125
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,310
consumed once in a while, can give you
diarrheal disease.

126
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,710
For class C water at moderate risk health
gains are less sensitive to compliance.

127
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:38,020
But there is still a big drop off and so
that if you drink water with about,

128
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,860
treated water about 75% of the time,
you're

129
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,419
getting about half of the possible
reduction in disease.

130
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,480
Now moderate and low risk waters are
relatively clean to begin with,

131
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,200
so there are not large reductions in
disease to be had at all.

132
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,660
Even if compliance is, is 100%.

133
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,950
Now this analysis assumed two log
reduction for all pathogens.

134
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,640
A similar study by Kyle Enger looked at
how compliance and

135
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,770
efficacy of treatment interact, again but,
to yield reductions in diarrheal disease.

136
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:22,530
This graph on the left shows that in order
to reduce diarrheal disease by 90%.

137
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,800
You could use a treatment that achieves
two log reductions either 100% or 99% of

138
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,740
the time or a treatment with three log
reductions that you use 95% of the time.

139
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,305
If you use the treatment much less than
that, you might achieve around

140
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:45,990
50% reduction in disease and the efficacy
of the treatment becomes less important.

141
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,590
Why use a treatment that reduces nine LRV

142
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,550
if you drink untreated water half the
time.

143
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,110
And the second graph shows the same point,
but

144
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,300
taking a more contaminated raw water as
the starting point.

145
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,769
Here, you need a three log reductions to
get even 90% reduction in disease.

146
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,150
Over the past few weeks we've seen some
really stunning examples

147
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,390
of how HWTS has been taken up consistently
in certain cases.

148
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,080
There were the biosand filters in
Cambodia, where nearly 90% of people were

149
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,340
using filters which had been distributed
from six months to eight years previously.

150
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,190
And here, use was defined by self-report
but confirmed

151
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,110
with inspection of the biosand filter to
see if

152
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,184
it looked like, if it was in use, if it
was functional, if it was wet, et cetera.

153
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,163
Then there was the LifeStraw Family,
filter in Zambia, part of the HIV/AIDS

154
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:48,140
intervention, where 96% of the women in
the study were still using the filter.

155
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,900
95% of them reported having drunk no
unfiltered water

156
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,628
or given any to their children on the
previous day.

157
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:58,750
And here compliance could have been even
higher

158
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,200
if rats hadn't eaten two of the filters.

159
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,930
There is another LifeStraw evaluation in
Congo which showed more modest compliance

160
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,480
with about 2 3rds of people classified as
consistent users after eight months.

161
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,160
But nearly all of them reported having

162
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,140
drunk some untreated water on the previous
day.

163
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,220
So this is maybe a medium compliance
example.

164
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,561
A study of SODIS in Zimbabwe looked at
three different indicators of SODIS.

165
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:33,890
Self-reported practice are calculated
through a detailed interview and drink

166
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:39,180
diary, and then observation by looking for
bottles on the rooftop.

167
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,330
Now, these three measures agreed fairly
well with

168
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,390
each other and for any of the indicators.

169
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,350
More than 2 3rds of the households which
had received household

170
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,450
visits were confirmed users more than two
years after the interventions.

171
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,880
Finally, chlorine treatment offers the
most objective

172
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,850
indicator of actual use by measuring
residual chlorination.

173
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,140
And the evaluation by Harshfield in Haiti
found 56% of

174
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,190
people practicing adequate chlorination up
to eight years after the intervention.

175
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,250
Of course, it's not always such good news.

176
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,430
And there are plenty of examples of low
uptake as well.

177
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,400
It's actually just as important to report
and

178
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,489
study these to learn about what didn't
work.

179
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,300
One example is the ceramic pot filters in
Cambodia where only 31% of people

180
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,810
were still using filters as reported in

181
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,410
an interview and confirmed by visual
inspection.

182
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,920
But here the usage was highly dependent on
the amount of time that had

183
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,680
passed since receiving the filter, and
usage was very high in the initial months.

184
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,200
It was breakage that was a problem.

185
00:12:46,748 --> 00:12:50,690
Before the LifeStraw Family filter, there
was the LifeStraw personal.

186
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,290
We didn't look at that one in the membrane
module, but its another membrane treatment

187
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,420
in which you suck water directly through a
filter into your mouth like a straw.

188
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,750
And in this evaluation in Ethiopia, only
about a third

189
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,580
of people reported using the filter in the
previous week.

190
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,170
And about one in eight people describe
themselves as consistent users.

191
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,250
This study is actually a classic

192
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,310
example of respondent bias for diarrheal
disease.

193
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,020
Because, these same households reported a
25% reduction in diarrhea,

194
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,490
which just isn't plausible with such low
levels of compliance.

195
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,570
Finally, a large evaluation of SODIS in
Bolivia found

196
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,210
that about a third of people were actually
practicing treatment.

197
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,840
Here defined by self-report and confirmed
by observation.

198
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,110
And in one of the earlier evaluations of
HWTS a study of

199
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,840
Pure in Guatemala, while Proctor and

200
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,960
Gamble was still considering a commercial
strategy.

201
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,140
This involved a long pilot and heavy
promotion of Pure.

202
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,676
But, six months after that
intervention, only

203
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:03,710
5% of the target households had actually
purchased sachets.

204
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,530
Then these last two examples are of
technical

205
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,370
innovations that were being piloted in the
field.

206
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,420
So, it's perhaps not fair to judge them as
mature products.

207
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,300
Both for the Mesita Azul in Mexico, the

208
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,238
ultraviolet system, and the chulli
pasteurization system in Bangladesh.

209
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:29,550
These both worked well technically, but
had fairly low uptake.

210
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,420
In fact, in Bangladesh only 21 out of 101
households reported using their chullis.

211
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,850
But on a repeat visit it was found that

212
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,550
17 of these households were either not
actually using

213
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,970
them at all or were using them incorrectly
by

214
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,140
passing the water through them without a
fire burning.

215
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,890
So here, only four households were

216
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,880
actually applying the technology
consistently and correctly.

217
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,130
Now, how can we explain this huge range in
compliance,

218
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,710
sometimes for the very same product in
different settings?

219
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,520
Well, household water treatment is a very
personal behavior.

220
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,670
So behavior change and theories of
behavior change are certainly important.

221
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,280
But there are also external factors
outside the

222
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,290
personal domain, such as availability of
supply chains,

223
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,851
the presence of a supporting policy
environment, et

224
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:28,450
cetera, that are also important in
determining use.

225
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,700
And these factors will be highly
contextual in

226
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,270
different settings and different
sub-populations within a given setting.

227
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,540
Let's take a look now at some of the
theoretical frameworks

228
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,130
that have been used to explain adoption
and uptake of HWTS.

229
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,310
A classic text in behavioral change is
Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations

230
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,880
Theory, first published in 1962 and now on
its fifth edition.

231
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,100
Rogers analyzed how innovations spread
through various

232
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,780
communication channels and came up with a
list

233
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,940
of five stages that people progress
through

234
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,660
as they decide to adopt a new behavior.

235
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,110
These are awareness or knowledge, here
that they

236
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,640
could treat their drinking water with some
technology.

237
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,660
People should then be persuaded that this
would be a good thing

238
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,209
to do before they will take a decision to
try it out.

239
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,710
But even then it has to implemented
regularly and people have to, in the end,

240
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,920
confirm that this is that they want to

241
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,800
do for the behavior to be adopted
sustainability.

242
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:39,250
Rogers also identifies five attributes of
innovations which help them to be adopted.

243
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,150
I think he liked the number five because

244
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,301
he also talked about five different types
of adopters.

245
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,110
But the five attributes then are that the

246
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,920
innovation should have an advantage over
the current practice.

247
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,180
It should be compatible with existing
values and needs.

248
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,779
It shouldn't be too complex either.

249
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,200
It's useful if an innovation can be

250
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,050
experimented with, trialed on a limited
basis.

251
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,150
People like to try things out.

252
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,280
And ideally they, and other people as
well, should

253
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,200
be able to observe the results of an
innovation.

254
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,910
And these factors together contribute to a
greater likelihood of uptake.

255
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,720
So that's one framework.

256
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,970
Here at Eawag, Professor Hans-Joachim
Mosler has developed a theory

257
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,020
of behavior change based on psychological
theory that's called RANAS.

258
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:39,350
And that stands for risks, attitudes,
norms, abilities, and self-regulation.

259
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,480
Professor Mosler defines factors which fit
into these five blocks, which together

260
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,310
can determine how likely people are to
adopt and sustain a new behavior.

261
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,860
In his studies, in his research, his team
first measures

262
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,810
which of these factors are most important
in a given context.

263
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,420
And then designs custom interventions to
influence the critical

264
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,570
factors, and so achieve better uptake and
sustained use.

265
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,550
Let's look at one more conceptual
framework

266
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,230
that was developed recently by Robert
Dreibelbis

267
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,770
and his colleagues, who published a
systematic

268
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,440
review of theories of behavior change in
wash.

269
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,810
And also developed a conceptual framework

270
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,940
taking elements from the different
contributions reviewed.

271
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,980
It's called IBM-WASH and it's not
sponsored by a major computer company.

272
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,200
It stands for the Integrated Behavioral
Model for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene.

273
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:42,015
The authors consider three classes of
factors, or dimensions.

274
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:46,030
Where the contextual factor, represents
background

275
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,520
factors like access to markets, the

276
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:54,960
policy environment, characteristics of the
household, and the environment, and so on.

277
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,830
And these factors are largely outside of
the control of

278
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,660
interventions, but have important
influences on HWTS, uptake, and use. 

279
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,420
The psychosocial dimension considers
factors like

280
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,800
those described in the RANAS model.

281
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,990
Which, in principle, could be targeted and
influenced by interventions.

282
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,410
Finally the technical dimension includes
the

283
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,490
specific characteristics of the HWTS
technology to

284
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,830
be applied, and how these are preferred or
not preferred by potential users.

285
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,730
Each of these three classes of factors,
these

286
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,880
three dimensions is considered to apply at
different

287
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,630
scales, five different levels, ranging
from the individual

288
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,770
up to larger groups and, eventually, the
entire society.

289
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,120
Here are a few reviews of behavior change
that are all available on the Internet.

290
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,049
The first comes from the Johns Hopkins
Center for Communication programs.

291
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:58,350
Here's the systematic review that led to
the IBM-WASH framework.

292
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,055
And here is a tool kit from Eawag, from
Professor Mosler and his group.

293
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:06,860
WHO and UNICEF have published a really
useful

294
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,820
tool kit on monitoring and evaluation of
HWTS programs.

295
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,570
You can download it by clicking on the
icon

296
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,820
or it's in the supplementary reading list
as well.

297
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:20,830
This tool kit is meant to provide an
overall framework for

298
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,240
planning, conducting, and utilizing
monitoring and

299
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,136
evaluation data to improve HWTS
programming.

300
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:33,080
And the tool kit provides a set of 20 core
indicators

301
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,010
that are recommended for monitoring
correct and consistent use of HWTS.

302
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,880
These core indicators are grouped into
five classes.

303
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,650
Reported and observed use, correct,
consistent use and storage, knowledge

304
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,320
and behavior, other environmental health
interventions, and water quality.

305
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,080
I encourage you to look at the full list
in the report.

306
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,610
But for today's module about effective and
consistent use, the most relevant

307
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,880
groups are the ones for correct
consistent use and water quality.

308
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,750
In the correct and consistent use group,
there are six different indicators.

309
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,680
A mixture of self-reports and
observations, demonstrations.

310
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,460
And again these indicators are somewhat
prone to bias.

311
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,909
But they can provide an upper limit for
actual practice.

312
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,710
The water quality indicators are more
objective.

313
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:37,220
These involve actual measurements of water
quality either for E. coli or

314
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,590
other indicator bacteria, or for residual
chlorine in the case of chlorination.

315
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,060
The raw water may also be tested.

316
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:52,820
So that for E. coli or thermotolerant
coliforms, an LRV could be calculated.

317
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,690
And some people include a certain level of
removal

318
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,935
as part of a definition for confirmed use
of HWTS.

319
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,990
This module has drawn heavily on a number
of publications, some of which you

320
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,600
have seen in previous lectures, and many

321
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,240
of these are freely available on the
internet.

322
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,670
On the PDF version, you can just click on

323
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:18,690
the hyperlink and get to the actual report
or paper.

324
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,420
These references are mostly about
compliance, either studies that have

325
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,830
measured actual use or models linking
compliance with health outcomes.

326
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,940
And these references, are more about
behavior change.

327
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,320
That could be a nice subject for an entire
MOOC or maybe several MOOCs.

328
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,500
So in conclusion, we saw two models that
predict that for HWTS to

329
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,870
lead to health gains, the technology

330
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,600
has to be applied effectively and
consistently.

331
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,880
Of course, the drinking water should be
unsafe as well.

332
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,400
And in order to get behavior change, it
may also be necessary

333
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,930
that people perceive the water as unsafe,
which is a very different thing.

334
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:06,380
Well, effective use can be measured and
should be measured when monitoring HWTS.

335
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,850
Consistent use is harder to monitor.

336
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,750
It typically requires multiple visits, and
it's

337
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,229
probably most appropriate at a research
level.

338
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,930
There are a range of different frameworks
for thinking about

339
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:24,020
and achieving and monitoring effective and
consistent use of HWTS.

340
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,790
Including the behavioral change elements,
but also other dimensions such

341
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:34,330
as the contextual or technical dimensions
in the IBM-WASH framework.

342
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,520
The important question though isn't which

343
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,610
framework is more accurate or
comprehensive.

344
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,480
But to recognize that consistent and

345
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,260
effective use is critical to realizing
health

346
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:50,150
gains through HWTS, and to take steps to
both promote and monitor actual use.
