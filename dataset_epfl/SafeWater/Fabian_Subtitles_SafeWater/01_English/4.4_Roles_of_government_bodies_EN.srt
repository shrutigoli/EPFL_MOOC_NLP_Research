1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,370
In our discussion of implementation
models,

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,930
we talked about the differences between

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,620
profit maximizing approaches and those
that

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,360
prioritize social goods, like disease
reduction.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,970
We looked at how different strategies
might be applied

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,710
by conventional, profit oriented
businesses,

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,970
or not for profit organizations,

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,160
or social businesses, kind of combining
some aspects of

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,190
both. But success of HWTS is not only
about

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,930
the private sector and NGOs, governments
have very important

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,220
roles to play, but which governments and
what roles?

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,690
Well, one important role of governments is
around national policies and regulations.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,710
And in fact, the international network for
HWTS,

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:54,520
has set targets around national policies
and regulations.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,220
First is that, by 2015, at least 30

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,170
countries should have established national
policies or regulations about HWTS.

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,120
And this one is on track.

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,380
There was a survey done a few years ago,
in 2012, which

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,650
found eight countries already with targets
and more than 22 with policies.

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,220
And the second target is to reach 50
countries by

21
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,530
2020, which have achieved countrywide
scale up of project based HWTS.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,740
And this second target, at least in 2012,
wasn't yet on track.

23
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,080
The international network for HWTS, which
was

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,160
introduced by Michael Forson a few weeks
ago,

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,230
made a global review of the policy and

26
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,030
regulatory environment around HWTS a few
years ago.

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,750
And they received responses from 46
countries, nearly half from Africa,

28
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,189
but with at least some responses from all
around the world.

29
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,320
In over half of these countries, the
ministry of health

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,658
was identified as the lead in issues
relating to HWTS.

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,853
And in several other countries, the
ministries

32
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:10,990
of water or environments were the leads.

33
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,270
But there were a number of other
government agencies

34
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,660
listed including the ministry of rural
development in Cambodia.

35
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,440
The Ministry of Social Affairs in Estonia
and

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,060
the Ministry of Housing and Construction
in Syria.

37
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,000
Regardless of which ministry is the lead,
HWTS is

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,050
a cross cutting issue and requires
coordination between different ministries.

39
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,980
Like the ones above.

40
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,940
But also, frequently, information on HWTS
is integrated into school curricula.

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,480
So, ministries of education must be
involved.

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,180
And if technologies are to be certified,
or endorsed,

43
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,069
National Bureaus of standards or other
regulatory authorities may be involved.

44
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,160
In fact, this survey found that more than
90%

45
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,510
of countries reported having a
collaboration between two ministries.

46
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,360
And in more than half of countries, three
or more ministries were involved.

47
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,240
Now, all that sounds great.

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,210
In practice, it can mean that progress is
slow, since everybody has to get on board.

49
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,780
So, nearly 2/3rds of the countries in that
survey

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,930
had established an inter-ministerial
committee to coordinate HWTS activities.

51
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,810
And that's mostly at the national level.

52
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,260
Many of these ministries have presences at
the regional district

53
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,000
and local levels or municipalities in the
case of large cities.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,670
Or there may be big gaps in knowledge and
capacity about HWTS.

55
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,480
But these government workers are the ones
who would need

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,440
to be involved with any field level
implementation of HWTS.

57
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,540
So, there are certainly multiple different
government

58
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,450
entities that could play roles in HWTS.

59
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,180
How can we classify or organize all the
different

60
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,290
roles that governments could play with
respect to HWTS?

61
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,150
Well, there are, of course, many different
ways, but one that I

62
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,890
like is to approach the role of government
from a human rights perspective.

63
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,320
There's been a lot written about the
responsibilities

64
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,480
of governments regarding human rights and
the UN

65
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,250
has recently recognized access to safe
drinking water

66
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,270
as a human right, so it seems appropriate.

67
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,486
And in the human rights framework, the
responsibilities

68
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:33,110
of government, states, can be divided into
three sets.

69
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,260
The obligations to respect, to protect,
and to fulfill rights.

70
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,000
Respecting rights means that governments
should not interfere,

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,720
either directly or indirectly, with a
human right.

72
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,110
And protecting rights means that
governments should

73
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,920
prevent other parties from interfering
with human rights.

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,230
For instance, the government could pass
laws or

75
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,920
regulations that prevent pollution of
drinking water resources.

76
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,150
In this last category, the duty to fulfill

77
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,560
human rights, that can be further broken
down.

78
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,760
States can facilitate a right by taking
positive measures that

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,300
help people to enjoy the right to safe
drinking water.

80
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,690
States can promote a right by, for
example, making sure that there's

81
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,050
adequate education around the importance
of safe water, and sanitation and hygiene.

82
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,740
And states are obliged to provide a right
when people are unable, for reasons beyond

83
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,780
their control, to realize that right on
their

84
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,219
own, and with the means at their disposal.

85
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,300
Let's take some concrete examples.

86
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,530
One important role that government can
play is about access to information.

87
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,180
Making sure that complete and correct
information

88
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,820
is available to those who need it.

89
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,250
Governments can make themselves aware, at
different levels and

90
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,770
in different sectors, about the links
between HWTS and health.

91
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,550
They can take stock of the existing

92
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,640
drinking water situation, especially
considering household water quality.

93
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,670
And see if people could benefit from using
HWTS.

94
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,690
National health and water coverage
statistics are available

95
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,990
in nearly all countries, managed by the
government.

96
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,910
But might not be widely known to all.

97
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,680
So a first step that governments could

98
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,130
support could be to do a situation
assessment,

99
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,210
a review of the situation, and compile

100
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,980
the relevant information in one
place.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,050
Another important role, that is another
kind

102
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,920
of facilitation, is the role of
coordination.

103
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:45,280
There are many different stakeholders
involved in HWTS, and governments can make

104
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,820
a really important contribution by
ensuring

105
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,780
that these stakeholders know about each
other.

106
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:56,379
This can be achieved through a survey of
ongoing HWTS activities and stakeholders.

107
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,560
And local universities or research
institutions could

108
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,170
be brought in to fill knowledge gaps,

109
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,980
and the government can host sector forums,

110
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,030
to share experiences in a very productive
way.

111
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,560
Another part of coordination is the
need for monitoring and evaluation.

112
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,440
This is a key responsibility of government

113
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,780
which might require establishing new
indicators and monitoring

114
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,490
systems, building up capacity, especially
at local levels,

115
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,330
and perhaps investments in new facilities
and equipment.

116
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,220
If we next consider promotion, HWTS will
definitely be

117
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,580
more credible if its promotion is endorsed
or led by governments.

118
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,790
A common action here is to support
development

119
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,540
and funding of a national communication
strategy and campaign.

120
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,540
Usually these are non-branded since
governments often don't want to

121
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,600
be seen as giving preference to one
commercial entity over another.

122
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,550
Governments, typically, are willing to
endorse or

123
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,950
promote only technologies that have been
verified.

124
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,760
And there's currently a real lack of
systems and capacity

125
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,170
for doing piloting and assessing of
technologies before scale up.

126
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,860
And ideally, there should be a range of
options available that

127
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,200
could be promoted for different audiences
and use some different circumstances.

128
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,740
WHO has recently launched a scheme for
evaluation

129
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,780
of household water treatment technologies
described in this report.

130
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,890
And we'll have a guest lecturer from
the

131
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,020
WHO go over the scheme in more detail next
week.

132
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,110
Finally, promotion of HWTS can be

133
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,550
linked with other health or development
priorities

134
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:53,420
as we saw the example of integration of
HWTS with education or health initiatives.

135
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,730
And these kinds of integrations often
require a supporting policy environment.

136
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,080
Finally, governments do have a

137
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,310
responsibility to provide services if
other

138
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,090
actors do not provide them in a way that's
accessible to all.

139
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,310
This doesn't mean that services have to be
provided for free,

140
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,530
but they do have to be available at an
affordable price.

141
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,200
So, there is a possible role for subsidy
of HWTS which could take different forms.

142
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,380
There could be direct subsidies in the
form of reduced

143
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,350
prices for products which might be
targeted only towards the poor.

144
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,640
Or there could be indirect subsidies.

145
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,780
For example, by supporting the costs of
promotion

146
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,950
through media or distribution through
human resources and institutions.

147
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,320
And a third kind of subsidy, an indirect
subsidy, could be to

148
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,300
relax the import duties on HWTS products
that have to be imported.

149
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,480
If government workers, from whatever
sector,

150
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,900
become involved with provision of HWTS
products

151
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,830
and services, they will typically need
substantial

152
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,800
support and capacity development at
different levels.

153
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,030
This is another aspect of government's
role

154
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,840
in creating an environment where HWTS can
succeed.

155
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,490
Well, there are a lot of different types,
obviously, of roles

156
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,850
that governments can play and of actions
that could be taken.

157
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,590
And a convenient way to package them
together in

158
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,370
a coherent framework is that of national
action planning.

159
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,010
And the HWTS Network has some guidance and
some

160
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,770
templates on elements that should go into
national action planning.

161
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,960
First of all, there should normally be
a background and rationale to have an HWTS

162
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,530
action plan that involves things like the
literature

163
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,460
review and assessment and diagnosis of the
situation.

164
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,120
Next, establishing an overall purpose,

165
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,320
which might be to reduce disease, since
there is a health focus.

166
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,790
And guiding principles, such as targeting

167
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,880
vulnerable groups to achieve the greatest
gains.

168
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,470
Another important principle to establish
is that HWTS is

169
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,920
not in competition with or replacing
conventional water supply.

170
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,250
But is seen as a complementary, short-term
measure until the long-term

171
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,510
goals of safe, sustainable water at home
can be achieved for all.

172
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,690
Certainly a concrete, element in a
national action plan should be a goal.

173
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,350
Which should be time based by some

174
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,420
certain year, and might have some specific
proportion

175
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,510
of the population, who don't yet have
sustainable

176
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,860
access to piped water supply in the house.

177
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,990
Who are practicing an effective HWTS
method,

178
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,860
in a way that makes the water safe

179
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,840
to drink or in compliance with national
standards.

180
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,060
Once that goal is established then, a
number of strategies and

181
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,590
action items can be determined, which will
be very context specific.

182
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,210
And another activity that's very context
specific is a

183
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:18,690
clear delineation of the responsibilities
of the different stakeholders involved.

184
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:24,420
Both the government stakeholders and the
non-government ones, including, private

185
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,075
sector, NGOs, universities, research
institutes, development partners, etc.

186
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:35,130
By now there are many countries, more than 22, 

187
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,730
that have established action

188
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,870
plans and policies for HWTS, but one nice

189
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,210
example I like to share is that of
Tanzania.

190
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:52,080
And in preparation for establishing an 
HWTS strategy and plan.

191
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,310
The first thing that was done was a sector
review.

192
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,590
A situation assessment.

193
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,060
Where there's very high mortality from
diarrhea.

194
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,150
This shows Tanzania ranking quite high in
the distribution

195
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:08,510
of countries, in terms of diarrheal deaths
per 100,000 population.

196
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,260
Also, there was a high use of unsafe
water.

197
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,620
These are national coverage estimates from
the

198
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,990
joint monitoring program of WHO and
UNICEF.

199
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,540
Showing really high and persistent use of
surface water

200
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,270
and other kinds of unimproved water in
rural areas.

201
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,590
And HWTS was being promoted in the
country.

202
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,350
It was aligned with government policies
but there was no

203
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,870
coordination mechanism, so there was
actually a lot of inefficiency.

204
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,530
So, the government hosted and convened an

205
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,510
international conference in February 2009,
led by

206
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,950
the relevant Ministries and supported by
the

207
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,750
International Network and some key
development partners there.

208
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,499
And they prepared a nice background
document to go into the meeting.

209
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,300
Laying out the reasons, the

210
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,760
justification to develop an HWTS sector
plan.

211
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,340
So, having done their homework, the
government of

212
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,470
Tanzania then hosted this workshop in
February 2009.

213
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,480
Brought in 108 people from many different
countries.

214
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,880
And set out four key objectives.

215
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,980
First, to learn from international
experiences, both

216
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,520
within the region and the broader global
community.

217
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,180
To review and strengthen national
initiatives on expanding HWTS.

218
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,510
To develop and strengthen partnerships,
both nationally and internationally.

219
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,100
And finally, to share experiences and
document the

220
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,200
different programs taking place within and
outside the country.

221
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,940
So a lot of the objectives here are around
information management and facilitation.

222
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,870
The conference had a number of actionable
outcomes, there were 15

223
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,998
specific action points that were
identified, I won't go into them here.

224
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:04,790
But there were five broad recommendations
that,

225
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,260
that were also endorsed through the
conference.

226
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,590
The first being that the ministry, the
lead ministry in this case

227
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,040
of health and social welfare, should

228
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,180
develop a national action plan, and
strategy.

229
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,320
That the ministry should strengthen those
international partnerships.

230
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,300
And also that the government, along with
partners and other

231
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,300
stakeholders, should allocate funds,
financial

232
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,110
resources, towards the strategic plan.

233
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,570
That the government should play

234
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,050
this information management and
coordination role

235
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,600
through strengthening the evidence base,
through

236
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,480
monitoring and evaluation, through
developing standards.

237
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,530
And then finally, that the government
should play the

238
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:50,070
overarching role of coordination and
networking in the HWTS sector.

239
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,780
These findings were shared in other
regional workshops.

240
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,480
And other countries in the region have
gone through similar processes.

241
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,530
So, that international conference really
set the ball rolling in Tanzania.

242
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,800
And within a relatively short period of
time, of just a few years, the country had

243
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,980
developed, finalized, and endorsed a
strategy and plan

244
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,159
for scaling up HWTS over this five year
period.

245
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,270
It included a national vision, and goal,
and target.

246
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,160
So, the vision being, to have communities

247
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,950
accessing safe drinking water at the
household level.

248
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:34,620
And a specific target to increase by 20%,
the usage of acceptable HWTS by 2016.

249
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,130
So that's a concrete, measurable, thing.

250
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,330
HWTS has been taken up in a number of
national policies,

251
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,470
including the National Heath Policy, the
Health Sector Strategic

252
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:52,060
Plan, but also the Environmental health,
hygiene and sanitation strategies.

253
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,280
And there are lists of specific actions
that

254
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,650
the government must take to achieve these
goals.

255
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,460
And I give here just a few examples of

256
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,090
the types of activities that government is
doing here.

257
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:12,760
Around facilitation, around coordination,
around monitoring and evaluation.

258
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:18,060
So, while it takes some time and some good
ground work to establish the

259
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,460
foundations, and develop a national
strategy and

260
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,570
action plan, that's really just the
beginning.

261
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,150
The implementation of the plan is where
HWTS

262
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,860
can really be scaled up and realize health
gains.

263
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,410
And here government play such critical
roles.

264
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,020
First, in securing the political supports

265
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,040
and the resources necessary for
implementation.

266
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,520
Government has to play this role of
coordination and

267
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,540
leading, and can also, provide adequate
financing and human resources.

268
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,960
On the implementation of the specific
measures identified in an

269
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,090
action plan, government has many

270
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,340
key roles, especially around building
awareness

271
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,320
in capacity at the lower levels.

272
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,250
And finally, all of these activities that
are implemented through an action plan

273
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,650
and strategy have to be continuously

274
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:16,100
modified, monitored, modified if necessary
and evaluated.

275
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,900
And here, governments, again, play
the central role and

276
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,060
one can think back to that human rights
framework and consider

277
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,840
that these actions should all be
implemented in a way that

278
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,090
is not discriminatory to any
particular group, including the poor.

279
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,590
And that though participation and
transparency more

280
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,300
long-lasting, sustainable results can
be achieved.

281
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,040
Going back to that survey that the
International Network

282
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,500
conducted of 46 countries about HWTS
policies and practices.

283
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,040
The survey identified key challenges
towards policy implementation, and the

284
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,174
the top one was around monitoring of use
and impact.

285
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,540
Other important ones were the lack of
regulation and

286
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,200
evaluation, limited awareness within
government of the role of HWTS

287
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,630
and limited coordination among ministries,
and today we've talked

288
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,390
about how government can contribute to all
of those challenges.

289
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,990
WHO also has a number of resources
available

290
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,140
through its Internet site that
specifically target these challenges.

291
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,970
For instance, there's a toolkit for

292
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,580
monitoring and evaluation to address this
challenge.

293
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,800
There's a scheme for evaluation of
household water treatment

294
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,830
options that gets at the regulation and
evaluation steps.

295
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,770
And there are specific guidances on other
topics such as integration with HIV

296
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:58,160
programs, national planning and
coordination in general.

297
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,000
So, there are a lot of rich resources that
can support governments in

298
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,979
developing and implementing these national
strategies and action plans.

299
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,690
And again, on the PDF version of these
slides, you'll be able to

300
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,940
hyperlink you'll be able to click on these
icons and get those reports directly.

301
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,830
So, to summarize then, we've looked at the
many responsibilities

302
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,700
and roles that can be played by government
agencies with HWTS.

303
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,290
We've looked at them through a lens of
human rights approach, thinking

304
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:38,310
about the responsibilities of government
to respect, to protect and fulfill rights.

305
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:43,350
And we've shown that fulfilling rights can
be broken down into facilitation, such

306
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:49,010
as collecting and managing information,
and in coordinating stakeholders,

307
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:55,180
promotion, establishing policies, and
strategies, action plans,

308
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:01,250
endorsing certain technologies, and
conducting public health campaigns.

309
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,690
And finally, provision of services,

310
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,710
especially targeting particular vulnerable
groups.

311
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,330
And we've seen how national strategies,
and action plans can bring together these

312
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:18,130
different responsibilities and roles of
government into a coherent package.
