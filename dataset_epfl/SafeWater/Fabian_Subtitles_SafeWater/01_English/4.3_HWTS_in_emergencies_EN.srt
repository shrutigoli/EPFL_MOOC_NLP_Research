00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,400
Hello and welcome to week four, module
three

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,570
of the Household Water Treatment and Safe
Storage MOOC.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,980
I'll be speaking today about household
water treatment in the emergency context.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,010
My name is Daniele Lantagne and I'm a

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,320
professor at Tufts University in the
United States.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,760
First, I'll describe the three types of
emergencies we'll discuss.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,020
The first type of emergency is natural
disasters.

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,350
These are earthquakes, eruptions,
landslides, tsunamis, floods or droughts.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,350
They're unplanned for.

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,740
The general health effects after
emergencies come after flooding, or

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,250
when populations are displaced and move
away from their homes.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,470
These types of emergencies are increasing
as

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,270
population increases, as more people live
in

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,180
unplanned settlements, and as climate
change exacerbates

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,630
the type and severity of the natural
disasters.

16
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,350
The next type of emergency we'll discuss
is outbreaks.

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,970
Outbreaks of particular diseases, and in
our case, where we're

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:09,360
concerned about diarrheal diseases, we
particularly are concerned with cholera.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,869
Cholera is on the rise, especially in Sub
Saharan Africa.

20
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,120
The last type of emergency is donor or
United Nations defined

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,435
and these are political emergencies, they
are complex emergencies or fragile states.

22
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:28,130
They're unlinked to particular health
needs, but they are context

23
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,050
in which the State cannot provide services
to its population.

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,141
After an emergency, we generally hear very
bold statements

25
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:42,680
about the health impact that we'll see at
that emergency.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,910
An example statement is this, which was

27
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,000
after the tsunami in Christmas of
2005.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,720
Which states, unless the necessary funds
are

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,370
urgently mobilized and coordinated in the
field, we

30
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,730
could see as many fatalities from
diseases, as

31
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,110
we have seen from the actual disaster,
itself.

32
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,520
Another quote,

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,390
and this is from a paper that addresses
some

34
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,680
of the myths of responding in disasters,
another

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,940
common myth about disasters, is the
affected local population

36
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,500
is helplessly waiting for the western
world to save it.

37
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,990
In reality, there are health needs in

38
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,330
emergencies and after disasters and
outbreaks and

39
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,810
in complex situations, and those health
needs

40
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,240
are linked to where the people are
located.

41
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,140
So, for example, we know that refugees,
and these are displaced populations that

42
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,760
move across an international border,
they're protected by international law.

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,650
And they often move into camp situations.
And there is quite an extensive literature

44
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,680
that establishes mechanisms to reduce the
mortality rate within refugee camps.

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,510
And the five intervention recommended to
reduce the mortality

46
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,300
rate are the provision of food, the
provision of

47
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,640
water, the provision of measles
vaccination, adequate access to

48
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,610
clinical care and providing health
information to improve people's health.

49
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,460
The second population of concern, that we

50
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,960
work with in emergencies, is internally
displaced persons.

51
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,180
These are people that have moved away from

52
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,200
their home, but not crossed an
international border.

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,550
These persons are not formally protected
by international law.

54
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:32,350
And their mortality tends to come from
increased rate of background diseases.

55
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,860
These people may move in to family
members,

56
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,510
they may be dispersed within the local
population,

57
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,220
they may move into camps. But the
mortality we see in IDP situations

58
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,490
is increased background diseases, whatever
those initial diseases were.

59
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,980
The last type of population in emergencies

60
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,450
is entrapped populations, populations that
are trapped and

61
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:01,090
do not have access to services by the
emergency around them, such as a war.

62
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,040
Very little is known about the health
needs of this particular population.

63
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,200
So, when we talk about bringing household
water treatment and safe storage to these

64
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,070
types of populations, effected by
emergencies, we

65
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,760
generally talk about providing one of five
options.

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,954
These options have been discussed in
previous sessions of this MOOC.

67
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:27,810
The first option is providing a filter,
such as a ceramic

68
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,730
filter, where water flows through the
porous media and is treated.

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,120
Chlorination is often provided in
emergencies.

70
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,240
It's sometimes recommended that
emergency-affected populations use SODIS

71
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,860
and put bottles of water in the sun.

72
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,680
Sand filters have also been provided in
emergencies.

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,080
And lastly, PuR, which is the Procter and
Gamble product. It's

74
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,410
a flocculant disinfectant product has
been

75
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,940
widely distributed in the emergency
context.

76
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,610
The two options most distributed in
emergencies are PuR, which is

77
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,410
often distributed when there's turbid
water and various types of chlorine.

78
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,650
Chlorine tablets, liquid chlorine, bucket
chlorination, there's a number of

79
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,940
ways to put chlorine in the water, in the
emergency context.

80
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,020
So, when we started working in household

81
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,766
water treatment in emergencies, the first
thing that

82
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:26,000
we did was we reviewed the existing
information

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,670
on household water treatment in the
emergency context.

84
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,980
And what we found is actually there's not
that much information out there.

85
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,190
There's a total of 30 papers and

86
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,880
that includes both peer-reviewed and gray
literature documents.

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,510
We also conducted a survey of implementers
in our review.

88
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,080
And the results of our review and survey

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,440
really highlighted that there's a large
data gap

90
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,880
in knowing how and what products and if

91
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,640
to implement household water treatment in
the emergency context.

92
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,070
What we did learn from our literature
review is

93
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,040
that household water treatment can be
effective in some emergencies.

94
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,812
That current products are targeted to high

95
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:12,431
risk emergencies, emergencies with risk of
diarrheal

96
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:15,973
disease, such as cholera outbreaks, or
emergencies

97
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:20,060
where the population is displaced or
flooded.

98
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,170
It generally, it's the product that
dominates the option selection.

99
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,220
So, for example, a responding
organization,

100
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,890
will have a product in its warehouse and

101
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,870
they'll just simply distribute that
household water

102
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,080
treatment product in the context of the
emergency.

103
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,060
So, the users don't really have much say
in what options they receive.

104
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,710
We learn that training is crucial to
uptake.

105
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,990
And the more trainings that are provided,
the more likely people are

106
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,130
to use the product correctly, and
that logistics are important.

107
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,320
That products needed to be stocked before
the emergency.

108
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,670
The products needed to be registered in
the country,

109
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,200
so that they were able to be legally
distributed

110
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,060
before the emergency, and that products
needed to be

111
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,480
distributed with all the materials
necessary to use them.

112
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,300
For example, in the particular case of
PuR, the PuR needs to be distributed with

113
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,940
two buckets, a stirring rod, and a cloth,
and a pair of scissors to open the sachet.

114
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,090
Because it cannot be assumed that
emergency

115
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,810
affected populations have access to all
those materials.

116
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,750
And lastly, in our review, we saw that
the, the dosage of

117
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,990
chlorine is very varied across the

118
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,680
context, and that establishing correct
chlorine dosage

119
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,610
is necessary to balance the issues of
taste and odor if there's too high a

120
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,350
dose with not having effective treatment
if there's too low a dose.

121
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,400
We definitely learned, in our review of
the literature and survey

122
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,730
of implementers, that more research is
necessary in the emergency context.

123
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,320
However, based on what we did learn, we
were

124
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,090
able to develop a document in collaboration
with the

125
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,652
International Federation of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies

126
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:05,790
entitled Household water treatment and
safe storage in emergencies.

127
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,000
This is a document, a booklet, that is
downloadable from the web.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,010
The address for the English version of the

129
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,910
document is included here on the
PowerPoint presentation.

130
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,910
And this document is in plain language,
it's meant for the

131
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:28,030
emergency responder who may not have much
experience with wash, 

132
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,470
with water sanitation hygiene products, to
learn how to respond with household

133
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:38,250
water treatment and safe storage products
in an emergency context.

134
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,018
After we completed our literature review
and survey of implementers

135
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:48,950
we also worked with UNICEF and Oxfam to
complete additional research.

136
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,420
And the research questions that we asked
in this research were, what role, if

137
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,500
any, should household water treatment and
safe

138
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,960
storage play in the emergency response
process?

139
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,160
And what are the factors associated

140
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,150
with feasible and potentially, sustained
implementation

141
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,930
of point of use water treatment,

142
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,060
household water treatment, in response to
emergencies?

143
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,430
We conducted evaluations of four
emergencies that

144
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,520
happened within the time frame of our
project.

145
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,720
When we setup our project, we did not know
what emergencies would occur.

146
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,090
We had an open protocol to go to these
four emergencies and evaluate all

147
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,710
the different household water treatment
products that

148
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,300
were distributed by any NGO in the
emergency.

149
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,170
In these evaluations, we conducted
household surveys, water quality testing.

150
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,060
We conducted focus group discussions, key
informant interviews.

151
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,970
We collected GPS points and we also looked
at cost analysis.

152
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,074
The four emergencies that occurred during
the time of our time to

153
00:09:58,074 --> 00:10:03,794
complete this evaluation, were first in
Jajarkot Nepal, there's an image

154
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:09,189
here of the hilly region of Nepal where
this cholera outbreak occurred.

155
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:14,295
We completed this evaluation in August of
2009.

156
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:20,990
The second emergency that we evaluated was
an earthquake in Pariaman, Indonesia.

157
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,070
Then we completed our evaluation in
October of 2009.

158
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:30,080
The third emergency that we evaluated was
a context where

159
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,970
there was both flooding, as can be seen
here in an

160
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,460
area of Kenya in the northwest section of
Kenya on the

161
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,790
Sudan border, Turkana, where there was
also an on-going cholera outbreak.

162
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,420
We completed our evaluation of this
response in January of 2010.

163
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,300
To give you context, this is a home of a
family that lives in Turkana, Kenya.

164
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,070
And the last evaluation we completed, was

165
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,850
actually in response to the Haiti
earthquake.

166
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,670
And we completed an evaluation of all

167
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,920
household water treatment and storage safe
storage

168
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,040
products that were distributed in response
to

169
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,190
the Haiti earthquake from February to
March 2010.

170
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,610
And so, we were really looking at what
happened

171
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,030
in the acute emergency situations the first
eight weeks after onset.

172
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,570
Were household water treatment and safe
storage products able to

173
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,850
effectively reduce the risk to households
of contracting diarrheal disease?

174
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,620
Now, in these four emergencies, three of

175
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,840
four actually have high diarrheal disease
risk.

176
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,145
And those are the places with cholera,

177
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:40,580
in Jajarkot and Turkana, with flooding in
Turkana.

178
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,580
And in Haiti, because the earthquake led

179
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,718
to very high internal displacement of a
population.

180
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:52,630
The one emergency we evaluated that would
not have high diarrheal disease risk

181
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,930
is in Indonesia, because the earthquake
did not lead to displacement or flooding.

182
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,660
So, we would not expect a high

183
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,380
diarrheal disease burden post emergency in
that context.

184
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,510
This is our summary data table which I'll
walk you through.

185
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,000
And it tells the information about
everything we learned

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,460
in response, in our evaluations in these
four contexts.

187
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,390
So, in the first column, we have the
country in which we responded.

188
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,780
And in the second column, we have the
household water treatment and safe storage

189
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:32,630
products that were distributed by any NGO
that we were able to find and evaluate.

190
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,380
So, I want to highlight that none of these
products that we

191
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,260
select or pre-select, we just evaluated

192
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,420
what other people had already,
independently, distributed.

193
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:49,250
So in Nepal, a local NGO was living in the
community and they

194
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,860
rented houses in the community and they
received

195
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,388
chlorination products, tablets and two
types of liquid.

196
00:12:56,388 --> 00:13:01,560
They received these chlorination products
from UNICEF and they distributed them

197
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,760
on a continuous basis, so for example, if
you ran out

198
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,160
of Aquatabs, you can go back and two weeks
later then,

199
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,830
you might get WaterGuard because that's
what UNICEF had sent that week.

200
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,950
They distributed this on a continuous
basis,

201
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,570
with training and ongoing training for the
users.

202
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,770
And this was in the context of cholera.

203
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,220
Now, in Indonesia, the distribution
was different.

204
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,340
These products, which were AirRahmat, a
liquid chlorine product and

205
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,480
a tablet chlorine product were both
distributed in NFI kits.

206
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,080
These are non food item kits.

207
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,890
They're a box that may have a stove, and a
blanket, and

208
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,990
a tent, and some pots and pans, and some
crayons for your kids.

209
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,530
And these NFI kits come with no training.

210
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,180
They're just distributed as a box.

211
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,340
Now, boiling was not promoted in Indonesia
by any NGO,

212
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,510
but was widely used by the population
because of previous training.

213
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,540
And so, we included it in our evaluation.

214
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,190
In Turkana, it was the same type of
situation.

215
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,100
Aquatabs and PuR were included in an NFI
kit distribution.

216
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:13,170
And people received a 30 minute training
the day the NFI kits were distributed, on

217
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,410
how to use the products and that was all
the training or follow-up they received.

218
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:23,610
In Haiti, there were quite different,
modes of distribution.

219
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,560
Aquatabs were distributed in NFI kits
within spontaneous

220
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,670
settlements, places where, where
internally displaced people settled.

221
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,990
But they were also distributed in a
separate

222
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,700
program that had existed in Haiti before
the emergency,

223
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,260
through community health workers in a
distributed network

224
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,270
of 200 community health workers in a rural
area.

225
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,010
And those community health workers visited
people's homes,

226
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,210
and provided ongoing education and access
to the Aquatabs.

227
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,040
In both cases for the filters, and this is
the first

228
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,440
time we see filters, we saw ceramic
filters distributed in Haiti.

229
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,660
Those were flown in from the Dominican
Republic, and

230
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,660
they were distributed with one training to
the household.

231
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,110
And then Biosand filters were distributed
over a

232
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,330
wide area through a network of priests,
and

233
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,670
a few households in each

234
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,810
of the priests' network areas
received Biosand filters.

235
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,750
What I'd like to point out here, of the
products that were

236
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,960
distributed in these emergencies, they're
primarily

237
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,460
chlorination products, and that has to

238
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,760
do with the fact that chlorination
products were warehoused in the country

239
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,100
beforehand, and are quite small and easy
to distribute in the emergency context.

240
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:46,480
Additionally, the only products of any
distributed in the emergencies, we

241
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,390
saw, and this is within the first eight
weeks of onset,

242
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,770
that were not available in country
warehouse before the emergency, were

243
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,600
ceramic filters in Haiti and some of the
Aquatabs in Haiti.

244
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,440
Every other product was stored in a
warehouse prior to the emergency

245
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,590
when it was used, then, to respond to an
acute emergency situation.

246
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,120
So now, I'd like to walk you through the
next three columns, to show you our data.

247
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,910
So, in Nepal, essentially, what we see is
30% of people reported

248
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:24,170
using the chlorination products in their
stored household drinking water.

249
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,550
And that's because we can't divide this up
by product really

250
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,870
because you might have received Aquatabs
two weeks ago and WaterGuard yesterday.

251
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,534
So, we're going to lump the stage together
and show that

252
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:37,844
about 30% of the households reported they
were using the chlorine.

253
00:16:37,844 --> 00:16:46,160
Now, about 65% of those households
actually had free chlorine residual in

254
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,120
their drinking water, when we did

255
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,480
an unannounced household survey.

256
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,750
Which means, really, in total, about 65%
of 30%, which is about

257
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:02,275
eighteenish percent of the population,
roughly a fifth, had free chlorine

258
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:08,600
residual in their drinking water, from the
products that were distributed.

259
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,150
We weren't able to test microbiological
indicators in this context

260
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,490
because we didn't have access to any
electricity at all.

261
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,320
And so, we simply left free chlorine
residual as the outcome of interest.

262
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,700
And that's the confirmed use, as the
presence of free chlorine residual,

263
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,910
and effective use is improvement of water
quality as measured by E. coli.

264
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,550
So, to sum up the Nepal data, about one
fifth of the

265
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,675
population had free chlorine residual in

266
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:39,460
their drinking water from the
intervention.

267
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,040
Now, in Indonesia, we have a very
different story from chlorination.

268
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,840
There was only 3% and 1% reported use

269
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,330
of the products that were distributed that
has to do

270
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,780
with lack of training, as well as a lack
of desire to use chlorine in that context.

271
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,800
Additionally, the tablets were only

272
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,480
provided with English written directions,
so

273
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,260
there were no appropriate directions on
how to use the product.

274
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,710
Because use was so low of these
distributed products

275
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,870
there was no ability to measure confirmed
or effective use.

276
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,040
However, 88% of the population reported
boiling.

277
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,820
Boiling was something they had done before

278
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,910
the emergency and they continued to do
afterward.

279
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:27,300
We tested untreated water from households,
from untreated storage household water.

280
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,700
And we also tested reported boiled stored
household water.

281
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,730
And we found that 27%, about a quarter

282
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,760
of the population, had safe drinking water
from boiling.

283
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,056
Their treated water was safe and their
untreated water was dirty.

284
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:48,650
Which meant they'd used boiling to move
from

285
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,590
dirty water to clean water and safe to
drink.

286
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,375
So, about a quarter of the population

287
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,010
effectively used boiling to treat their
drinking water.

288
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:03,166
In Turkana, which was a NFI kit
distribution, we also saw fairly low use.

289
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:07,300
And 13% of households reported using
Aquatabs, 6%

290
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,020
reported using PuR, because of the small
amount of

291
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,665
training and the complexity of using PuR,
less than

292
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:17,040
1% of respondents knew how to use PuR
correctly.

293
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,190
We confirmed these with free chlorine
residual in less than half of the

294
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,110
households that reported use actually had

295
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,350
free chlorine residual in the drinking
water.

296
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,000
And when we take it out to improving the
quality of their stored household water

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,110
from dirty to clean, only 5% 

298
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,150
of the surveyed households used
Aquatabs

299
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,620
to improve the quality of their water and
2% used PuR, which means 7% of

300
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,780
the households, targeted households, used
one of the

301
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,460
products to improve the quality of their
water.

302
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,740
In Haiti, we have a more complex story.

303
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,813
The tablets, the Aquatabs that were
distributed in the NFI context

304
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:02,975
in the spontaneous settlements 24%
reported use of that 62%,

305
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:07,870
about little over half had free chlorine
residual, but only

306
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:13,430
15% improved the quality of their water
from dirty to clean.

307
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,030
And so, we see a similar number, it's a
low use

308
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,970
when there is NFI distribution and no
training and follow up.

309
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,720
Now, we see much different numbers when we
move to the community health worker

310
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,210
program, where we see 75% in urban

311
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:38,644
areas and 92% of people in rural areas
reported using the

312
00:20:38,644 --> 00:20:45,440
the household water, the Aquatabs that
were distributed.

313
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,424
And of those families, 75% had free
chlorine residual in their

314
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:55,853
drinking water and 54% improved the
quality of their water with those

315
00:20:55,853 --> 00:21:00,748
Aquatabs in urban areas and 66%, 2/3rd's
of households use

316
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:06,460
those Aquatabs to improve the quality of
their water in rural areas.

317
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,130
And the reason for this increased
effective use, in rural areas,

318
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,588
is that the water, the untreated water in
rural areas, was dirtier.

319
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:18,480
So, more households had dirty water in the
rural areas

320
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,480
unless we're able to use the Aquatabs to
make it clean.

321
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,030
Now the ceramic and Biosand filter storage
are slightly different.

322
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,150
People really liked those filters and they
reported,

323
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,370
even with very little training or one
training,

324
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,260
72% of households
reported using

325
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,810
the ceramic filter, 53% reported using the
biosand filter.

326
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,860
However, the ceramic filters were
distributed

327
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,070
in an area next to an airstrip.

328
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,860
They were flown in, and

329
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,170
then they were distributed right around
that airstrip.

330
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,993
And those households actually already had
clean water.

331
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:55,821
So, the households were not able to take
dirty, untreated water and

332
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:59,200
make it clean, so the effective use was
quite low at 20%.

333
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,260
And the Biosand filters were installed by
local technicians who made

334
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,430
errors in installation, so that the

335
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,930
Biosand filters were not installed
correctly.

336
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,770
And so, they were not able to treat the
water effectively.

337
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,340
And so, the effective use was also quite
low at 8%.

338
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,266
So, as you can see here, the use is much
lower

339
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:23,850
than one might expect, and the effective
use was much lower.

340
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,270
The programs with the highest effective
use, Aquatabs with

341
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,850
community health workers in Haiti, and
boiling in Indonesia.

342
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,930
Both of those had existed before the
emergency, and people

343
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,260
were familiar and comfortable using those
products before the emergency.

344
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,790
And thus, were able to translate that

345
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,600
knowledge into using the products after
the emergency.

346
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,570
And then we have some issues with
knowledge

347
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,850
and training and also correct installation
and use.

348
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,120
So, to summarize up all this data in
a graphic.

349
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,460
We found that effective use happened when

350
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,040
people used an option that treated the
water.

351
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,160
And was effective at treating the
water.

352
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,442
When people actually had unsafe water,
that's an assumption in

353
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:09,910
emergencies, that everyone has dirty water
and that's not always true.

354
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,590
And when there was user demand,
familiarity and use.

355
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,220
People who knew the program before the

356
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,680
emergency were more likely to use it
after.

357
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,070
And when those three things came together,
we saw effective

358
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,840
use in household water treatment products
in the emergency context.

359
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,542
In summarizing up this presentation, I'd
like

360
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,146
to offer a few thought questions about
conducting

361
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,998
research in emergencies, such as, thinking
about,

362
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,320
what research is ethical to conduct in
emergencies?

363
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,550
What products or projects would you donate
to in an emergency?

364
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,160
What is success in the emergency context?

365
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,720
Should it be distribution?

366
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,560
Should it be reported use?

367
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,780
Should it be effective use?

368
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,510
And how do we find out what the
differences are between those metrics?

369
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,590
How should money be tracked in an
emergency?

370
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,630
How should we spend our money?

371
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,050
How do you balance the ethic of

372
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,195
humanitarianism, which is reaching out to
those most

373
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:07,730
affected, with the desire to scale project
up,

374
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,390
and meet the, and reach the most people?

375
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,890
How do we better apply lessons learned in
the development

376
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,580
context into our emergency response
projects with household water treatment?

377
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,040
And how do we link emergencies with
development projects, so that we really

378
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:27,640
offer a holistic household water treatment
strategy to the population of the country?

379
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,880
I'd like to thank you for listening to
this presentation

380
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,570
and end with a quote from a journal
article by Slim.

381
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,227
And say: "The notion that being
humanitarian and doing good are

382
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:40,440
somehow inevitably the same is a hard one
to shake off.

383
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,340
And I think that research can assist us

384
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,060
in aligning being humanitarian with always
doing good."

385
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,530
I'm happy to take questions, thank you for
listening today.
