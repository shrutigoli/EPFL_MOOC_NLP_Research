00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:07,150
Hello, my name is Rick Johnston,
and I started this course

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,523
when I was working 
in the Sandec Department at Eawag.

3
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:13,522
Now I work for the 
World Health Organization

4
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:18,672
in the WHO/Unicef Joint Monitoring Programme 
for Water Supply and Sanitation.

5
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:22,510
And I am Sara Marks, 
a research scientist at Eawag

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,112
and group leader of the Water Supply 
and Treatment group.

7
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:28,095
My team works in countries in Africa and Asia

8
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,144
to improve drinking water quality

9
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:33,327
through developing 
innovative treatment solutions.

10
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:36,457
And one way that people can improve 
drinking water quality themselves

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,000
is to treat it at the household level.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,861
And that's the topic of this course,

13
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:44,382
an Introduction to Household 
Water Treatment and Safe Storage.

14
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:47,320
This course is the first 
in a series of e-learning initiatives

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,930
jointly developed by Sandec and EPFL,

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,021
which will cover the full range 
of Sandec research activities,

17
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:58,279
Household Water Treatment, 
Sanitation Planning

18
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:01,279
Solid Waste Management 
and Faecal Sludge Management.

19
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:03,988
The first week, of course, 
is an introduction.

20
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:06,059
We'll start by exploring 
why it could be useful

21
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:08,669
to treat drinking water 
at the household level.

22
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,629
We'll talk about 
the global burden of disease,

23
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,485
discuss how drinking water 
can be contaminated

24
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:16,913
and get a brief introduction 
to the technologies

25
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:19,750
used in household water treatment.

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,418
In the second and third week 
we'll go through these technologies

27
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:24,667
in more detail

28
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,521
with examples of actual applications 
from around the world.

29
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,927
But the course 
is not only about technologies.

30
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:33,689
We'll also look 
at implementation strategies,

31
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,720
which are successful or not,

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,446
we'll consider 
how household water treatment

33
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:41,671
can be targeted 
to particular vulnerable groups,

34
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:45,031
such as in emergencies 
or through schools.

35
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:49,604
And in the final week we will look 
at monitoring and evaluation

36
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:52,918
both of the technologies 
and their implementation in the field.

37
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,932
We're looking forward to the course

38
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:57,842
and hearing your contributions 
on the online forum.

39
00:01:57,842 --> 00:01:59,682
So let's get started now

40
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:02,565
with the module about the diseases 
caused by unsafe water.
