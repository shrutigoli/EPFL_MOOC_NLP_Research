1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,430
So, we've made it through the first week
of the course.

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,610
We started by discussing the global burden

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,170
of disease following different disease
classification systems.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,480
We learned about the importance of
diarrheal disease, both in

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,810
terms of morbidity, expressed in DALYs,
and mortality or deaths.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,770
And we saw some different resources where
you can get information about

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,160
burden of dis, of disease from the World
Health Organization and from IHME.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,050
We also had an introduction to the
different water-borne pathogens, the

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,350
helminths, protozoa, bacteria, and
viruses, that

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,380
can cause disease in drinking water.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,850
We then looked at contamination pathways
which can

12
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,030
lead to people being exposed to fecal
pathogens.

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,120
Using the tool of the F-diagram, we
focused in on the water related pathways.

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,070
The safe water chain.

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,810
Moving from the water resource to the
point of consumption.

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,070
We also discussed fecal indicator bacteria
as a way of monitoring

17
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,190
a proxy of fecal contamination rather than
trying to directly measure pathogens.

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,560
Next, we had a first glance at the

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,790
treatment processes, sedimentation,
filtration

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,900
and different types of disinfection.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,560
Followed by safe storage.

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,730
These will be explored more in the coming
weeks.
