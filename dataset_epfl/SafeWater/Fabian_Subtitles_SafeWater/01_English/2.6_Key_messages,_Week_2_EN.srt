00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:06,579
Welcome to the end of the second week of
the course.

2
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:10,727
In this week we started off by looking at
the water safety framework of the

3
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:13,379
World Health Organization, and then got
into

4
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:16,750
exploring some of the first processes in
HWTS.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,900
Starting with sedimentation, and then
looking at three different

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,960
kinds of filtration: membrane filtration,
ceramics, and biological filtration.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,750
The water safety framework of the World
Health Organization

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,210
consists of five different steps, starting
with health based targets.

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,700
And then moving into a system

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,440
assessment, operational monitoring, and
management and communication.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,180
These three together are called water
safety plans.

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,090
Finally, water safety plans are confirmed
with verification monitoring.

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,800
We saw how this concept of water safety
plans, while normally applied

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,560
to community scale systems, can also

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,330
be useful in considering household water
treatment.

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:05,410
We also introduced a key metric which is
the Log Reduction Values, LRV, which is

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,040
just the base ten log of concentrations

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,810
of something before and after treatment,
usually pathogens.

19
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,130
Finally, we looked at four different

20
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,030
stages in household water treatment, and
spent

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,960
significant amounts of time looking at

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,130
the first two stages, sedimentation and
filtration.

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,940
Sedimentation is frequently required as a
pre-treatment step when the

24
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,789
raw water contains high levels of
turbidity, or suspended solids.

25
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,130
In some cases, gravity settling alone is
enough to remove

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,190
particles but in other cases, enhanced
settling is required through the

27
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,210
additional of chemicals called coagulants
which can either be naturally

28
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,767
occurring, derived from plant materials or
metallic salts, such as alum. 

29
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,620
Membrane filtration includes a wide range
of

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,410
different kinds of processes, from simple
cloth filtration,

31
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:05,960
to filtration through synthetic membranes,
micro-filtration, ultra-filtration,

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,350
nano-filtration, and reverse osmosis,
having increasingly small pore sizes.

33
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,420
Those pores are seen in comparison to the
sizes of inorganic particles but

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,840
also to microbes: bacteria, protozoa, and

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,210
copepods, and those smallest of microbes,
viruses.

36
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,860
The smallest the tightest of the membranes
like reverse osmosis can

37
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,360
even remove dissolved compounds, even
salts and some other small ions.

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,250
However, these synthetic membranes that
remove that, have very small

39
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,109
pore sizes need increasingly high pressure
to push water through the membranes.

40
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,990
Ceramic filtration is similar to membrane
filtration,

41
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,860
except that instead of passing through a

42
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,080
synthetic membrane, water is passed
through ceramics

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,870
made from clay and burn off material.

44
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,610
We looked at physical electrostatic, and
chemical mechanisms for removing microbes.

45
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,520
And saw that ceramic filters have good
removal of protozoa, pretty

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,050
good removal of bacteria, but variable to
low removal of viruses.

47
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,360
However, they are very user friendly, and
are

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,970
a rapidly growing segment of the HWTS
market.

49
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,920
Biological filtration, such as in the
biosand filter

50
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,530
shown here, also realize on physical and
electrostatic removal,

51
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,600
but the principal mechanism is biological
removal through

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,820
the formation of an active biofilm called
the Schmutzdecke.

53
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,870
Biosand filters also, like ceramic
filters, have good removal of

54
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,110
protozoa, modest bacteria removal, and
variable to low virus removal.

55
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,410
However, again they are user friendly and
easy to operate.

56
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,660
A key message from this week then, is that
household

57
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,270
water treatment is very similar to
conventional water treatment, in

58
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,320
that it uses some of the same processes,
each of

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,300
which can involve multiple mechanisms in
removing or destroying pathogens.

60
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,890
We've looked at sedimentation, methods to
reduce

61
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,750
the particles and turbidity in raw water.

62
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,900
Often as a pre-treatment step.

63
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:26,570
And also filtration mechanisms involving
physical and electrostatic mechanisms.

64
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,599
As well as biological and chemical ones.

65
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,490
However, filtration alone doesn't fully
remove pathogens from water.

66
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,310
And next week we'll look into more detail
at actual disinfection processes.
