00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:06,743
(Rich Johnston)
Welcome to the second week of this course!

2
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:09,435
Today we will talk about 
drinking water safety.

3
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:11,980
But first, what does water safety mean?

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,533
In fact, what does safety mean at all?

5
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:18,592
Is it safe to swim in a lake?

6
00:00:18,592 --> 00:00:20,742
To walk from your home to school?

7
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:23,318
Is it safe to eat 
a plate of chicken curry?

8
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:25,661
Is it safe to fly in an airplane?

9
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:28,842
Well, none of these things actually,

10
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:31,542
in fact, nothing in life at all 
is completely safe.

11
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:34,773
There is always some risk, 
however small,

12
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:36,544
that something can go wrong,

13
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:38,622
and that while doing 
any of these activities

14
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,462
your health can be harmed.

15
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:44,556
However once we acknowledge 
that all activity has some risk,

16
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:46,735
the critical question becomes:

17
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,396
What level of risk is acceptable

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,246
and how can problems be identified 
and controlled before they occur

19
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:58,354
to manage risks and keep them 
on an acceptable level?

20
00:00:58,787 --> 00:01:01,805
If you go on an airplane flight 
you are assuming

21
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:03,711
that the plane won't crash.

22
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:05,208
And why do you think that?

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,414
Because there are guidelines 
and regulations in place

24
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:10,917
to keep risks to acceptable levels.

25
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:15,384
The airplane pilots have to go 
through rigorous training program

26
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,644
long before they can fly a real plane.

27
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:21,714
The aircraft itself 
has to be regularly inspected

28
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:25,461
and preventive maintenance checks 
must be performed routinely.

29
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:29,470
There are auditing systems 
and inspections to make sure

30
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,784
that these safety measures 
are applied correctly.

31
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:35,637
And once the safety measures 
are all in place,

32
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:37,793
traveling by plane is very safe.

33
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,853
It's not ever 100% safe,

34
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:45,315
but on a major airline today the risk 
of being involved in a fatal accident

35
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,780
is much-much less that one in a million.

36
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:52,293
And most people would consider that 
to be a safe level of risk.

37
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:55,784
Well, the same concept 
applies to drinking-water.

38
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,570
The World Health Organization 
has a definition of safe drinking-water.

39
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:04,076
"Safe drinking-water is that 
which does not represent

40
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:07,756
any significant risk to health 
over a lifetime of consumption,

41
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:11,634
including different sensitivities 
that may occur between life stages."

42
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:14,548
Now notice, the definition does not say:

43
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:17,708
"does not represent 
any risk to health", it says:

44
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:21,359
"does not represent 
any significant risk to health".

45
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:24,662
The WHO guidelines 
for drinking-water quality

46
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:28,688
include recommended maximum levels, 
or guideline values,

47
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:30,968
for 90 different chemicals.

48
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:33,101
And these guideline values 
are normally set

49
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:35,585
to represent a tolerable level of risk,

50
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,611
which in the guidelines is taken as 
one DALY per million person-years.

51
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:44,226
Do you remember DALYs, 
disability-adjusted life years?

52
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:46,368
Well, this risk level means

53
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:48,777
that if a million people 
drink water for a year

54
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:51,186
with the chemical at the guideline value

55
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:53,340
then the chemical 
will cause health effects

56
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:57,347
with the disease burden of one DALY 
over that population.

57
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:01,117
And chemicals that cause cancer 
are treated in a similar way.

58
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,419
A lifetime of drinking-water 
at the guideline value

59
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:09,399
should cause no more than 
one excess cancer case per 100,000 people.

60
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:14,730
Now, this is not zero risk, 
but it is considered a tolerable level.

61
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:16,718
Put it another way,

62
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:20,167
risks smaller than this 
are considered not to be significant.

63
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:24,301
WHO guideline values of course 
are not national standards,

64
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:29,298
and it is up to each state to determine 
its own acceptable level of risk.

65
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:34,612
Now, health outcomes 
for water quality guidelines

66
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:38,344
linked to health outcomes
are two examples of health-based targets,

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,006
which define an acceptable level of risk.

68
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:43,539
There are other kinds 
of health-based targets,

69
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:48,370
such as performance targets, 
which specify a certain level of removal

70
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:53,256
for a contaminant or a pathogen, 
or specified technologies,

71
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,283
for example, saying that surface water

72
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:59,513
must always be filtered 
before further treatment.

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,898
Let's look a bit more 
at performance targets

74
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:04,188
since those will be important

75
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:06,308
in the context 
of household water treatment.

76
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,630
The main example of a performance target 
is a Log Reduction Value, or LRV.

77
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,438
This is the number of log units by which 
a chemical or other contaminant

78
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,918
is reduced through treatment.

79
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,913
Now, you can easily calculate LRV

80
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:25,438
by taking the ratio of the contaminant 
before and after treatment

81
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:28,282
and then taking the base 10 logarithm.

82
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:32,385
Now, if the concentration
is unchanged by the treatment

83
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:36,376
that means, there is no removal, 
and the LRV is zero.

84
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,537
It's also possible for a contaminant 
to increase during the treatment,

85
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:44,169
in which case the LRV is negative.

86
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,129
Hopefully that does not happen too much.

87
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:49,160
Now, if a hypothetical contaminant

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,100
was reduced from a million 
to half a million counts,

89
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,550
and here it does not matter 
what units are used

90
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,410
as long as they are consistent.

91
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,190
That would be an LRV of 0.3 
since 0.3 is the logarithm of 2 roughly.

92
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:08,321
And if were reduced 
to a 100 000, that's a 90% reduction,

93
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,571
that would be a 1 log reduction.

94
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:16,638
So you can see that if you talk about 
reducing something a hundred-fold, by 99%,

95
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:20,062
that would be a 2 log reduction.

96
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,466
And to go from 1 000 000 of something

97
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:26,530
to a single unit 
would be a 6 log reduction.

98
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:31,162
So performance targets can specify 
the amount of log reduction values

99
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:34,532
that should be achieved 
for a certain class of pathogens,

100
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:41,481
for example, a 3 log removal of bacteria 
would mean removing 99.9% of bacteria.

101
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:46,561
At the target of 5 log removal 
would be a 100 times more strict.

102
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:50,241
(Sara Marks) 
To find the total effectiveness

103
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,138
of a multistage treatment system

104
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:56,639
you will calculate the LRV for each stage 
as in a formula on the last side

105
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:59,802
and then simply add the LRVs together.

106
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,633
(Rich Johnston) So that's a quick 
introduction into health base targets.

107
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:11,755
Health base targets are one part 
of the water safety framework

108
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:14,895
describing the WHO Guidelines 
for Drinking Water Quality.

109
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:18,947
In brief, the other main components 
are System Assessment,

110
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:23,281
Operational Monitoring, 
Management and Communication,

111
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:27,570
and these are then confirmed 
by water quality testing, or Verification.

112
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:32,008
Idially the verification step is done 
by an independent authority

113
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,373
and not by the service provider.

114
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:36,569
Information from the verification step

115
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,447
can then feedback 
into setting of health-based targets

116
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:42,060
and acceptable levels of risks.

117
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:49,862
The three steps in the middle 
are the actions

118
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:52,092
that can be done 
by the water service provider

119
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:55,540
and taken together 
they can constitute a Water Safety Plan

120
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:58,243
for a particular water supply system.

121
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:01,989
First, in order to prevent risks 
we have to understand

122
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:05,235
all of the components 
of a water supply system

123
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:07,082
from catchment to consumer

124
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:09,842
by examining each step 
in the water supply chain.

125
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:14,646
Potential hazards can be identified 
as places where something could go wrong

126
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:17,807
or where microbial contamination 
could occur.

127
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:22,061
For each hazard a control measure 
can then be put in place,

128
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:24,726
which defines the acceptable performance.

129
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:27,852
Once control measures are established

130
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,844
system operators should routinely monitor

131
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:33,520
that the control measures 
are being applied.

132
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:36,879
And if anything goes wrong,
it is noticed quickly.

133
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:39,822
This might include testing for E. coli,

134
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,892
but it's more likely to include 
very simple actions

135
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:45,614
like keeping pumping logs up to date,

136
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,288
checking turbidity levels 
after filtration

137
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:50,488
or measuring residual chlorine,

138
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,532
as finished water leaves the plant.

139
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:55,415
Think of the airplane example.

140
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:58,053
You don't want the measure 
of air flight safety to be:

141
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:01,325
"Hey, the plane did not crash, 
it must have been safe."

142
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,145
You want the airline 
to be routinely monitoring

143
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:07,495
all of those safety measures
that they have put in place.

144
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:12,405
Management plans mainly describe 
the routine operations

145
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:14,833
that are done under normal conditions.

146
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,062
But it's also important 
to know what to do

147
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,964
when a problem or incident occurs.

148
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:23,195
Incident response plans 
should be developed

149
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:24,987
and should be well known by operators

150
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,581
so if there something bad happens,

151
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:29,353
the operators know exactly what to do

152
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:32,881
and unsafe water 
is not delivered to consumers.

153
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,978
Good records should be kept

154
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:38,665
of both routine operations 
and any incidents that occur.

155
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:41,845
And such information 
should be shared with consumers,

156
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,995
and there should be channels 
for consumers

157
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,126
to give feedback 
to the system operators.

158
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:54,035
There is a lot more to be said 
about Water Safety Plans.

159
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:57,009
In fact, it would be a good topic 
for a full MOOC,

160
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:01,253
but for our purposes Water Safety Plans 
are important as an example

161
00:09:01,301 --> 00:09:03,281
of how water safety 
can be conceptualized.

162
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,039
At a very simple level

163
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,717
the water safety framework 
consists of health-based targets

164
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,297
to define an acceptable level of risk.

165
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:15,600
Some systems for identifying 
and managing risks,

166
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,417
that's the Water Safety Plan Part,

167
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:19,673
and independent verification

168
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:24,345
that the risk management system 
is in fact working.

169
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:28,000
In this framework there is a need
for measuring water quality,

170
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:30,835
but mainly as a verification measure.

171
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,094
Most of the work to ensure water safety

172
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:38,238
is in the system assessment 
in the developing of control measures

173
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:42,333
and operational monitoring 
to make sure they are being applied.

174
00:09:42,737 --> 00:09:44,668
If you only do water quality measurements,

175
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:47,454
you can't be sure 
that the drinking water is safe,

176
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,850
even if you don't find any E. coli.

177
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:51,996
People often make the mistake that

178
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:55,151
if they've checked the drinking water 
for E. coli and did not find any

179
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,096
they assume that the water must be safe.

180
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:02,964
In fact, water without E. coli 
could be unsafe for several reasons.

181
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:07,946
First, contamination 
can be very variable in space,

182
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:10,304
if you collect your sample 
at the wrong place,

183
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,927
you could miss the problem.

184
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:16,227
Second, contamination 
can be very variable in time.

185
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:19,347
Maybe on the day 
that you do your quality testing

186
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:20,845
there is no contamination,

187
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:24,401
but the day before 
or even hour before there was,

188
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:25,981
and you were not testing then.

189
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:30,555
Finally, E. coli is not a perfect 
faecal indicator

190
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:32,673
but it is the best one available.

191
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,763
It's possible that treatment 
has killed all of the E. coli,

192
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:37,767
but some of the other pathogens,

193
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:42,019
for instance, cryptosporidium 
or rotavirus are still viable.

194
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:46,261
So to say "drinking water is safe"
you need both things.

195
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:49,532
You need to show that the water 
is free from contamination,

196
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,191
but also that there is a system in place

197
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:56,271
to proactively identify and prevent 
contamination from occurring.

198
00:10:57,067 --> 00:11:00,047
Water Safety Plans 
are fairly new concept,

199
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:01,480
but they are taking off rapidly.

200
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,440
There are currently over 20 countries

201
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:06,224
that require water safety plans 
and the regulations,

202
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,375
and many other countries 
are in the process

203
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:11,295
of including them in future regulations.

204
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:14,403
Water safety plans are typically applied

205
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:16,363
for conventional treatment 
and pipe supplies

206
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:19,417
at the level of the water supply scheme.

207
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:22,254
There are examples 
of rural Water safety Plans,

208
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:26,943
including for point sources, 
such as boreholes or protected springs.

209
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:29,323
But most of the experience today has been

210
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:33,161
with larger, professionally 
managed pipe systems.

211
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:37,226
An important concept 
from the system assessment step

212
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:41,060
of water safety planning 
is that of multiple barriers.

213
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,259
Remember, the main source of pathogens 
is faecal matter.

214
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:50,397
So multiple barriers can be put in place 
to prevent faecal material

215
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,196
from entering the drinking water supply

216
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:55,810
and to remove the pathogens 
that do make it in

217
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,997
using a variety 
of different treatment processes.

218
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:02,334
Different pathogens 
have different levels of resistance

219
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:04,404
to different kinds of treatment.

220
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,360
Also any single control measure 
can fail at some point.

221
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:11,754
So by including multiple barriers 
to remove pathogens

222
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:16,313
the risk of providing unsafe 
drinking water can be minimized.

223
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,545
Conventional treatment of surface water

224
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:22,141
typically follows this 
multiple barrier approach.

225
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,904
Before reaching the treatment plant

226
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:28,333
the water resource itself 
can be protected.

227
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,133
For example, the use of fertilizers, 
pesticides or other chemicals

228
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:35,564
may be restricted 
within the catchment area of a river

229
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:38,941
or an aqua-fer 
used for drinking water supply.

230
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:41,623
Within the treatment plant itself

231
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:44,433
a series of processes 
are normally followed.

232
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:47,276
Some kind of pretreatment step 
may be necessary

233
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:50,276
to reduce high levels of suspended solids

234
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:53,547
which could cause problems 
for subsequent treatment steps.

235
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,762
Storage reservoirs allow 
some sedimentation to take place

236
00:12:57,762 --> 00:13:01,973
and roughing filters or bank infiltration 
can remove many particles,

237
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:04,648
as well as improving 
of the microbiological quality

238
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:06,216
to some degree.

239
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,090
Coagulation and flocculation

240
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:13,579
remove turbidity for suspended solids.

241
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:16,223
By addition of a coagulant salt,

242
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:19,223
typically aluminium sulphide 
or ferric chloride,

243
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:23,133
which forms flocks that grow 
removing suspended solids,

244
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:25,714
as well as some dissolved compounds.

245
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:30,217
These flocks can settle out of solution 
in clarification tanks

246
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:32,959
or in some cases can float 
to the top of the tank,

247
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,765
where they can be removed.

248
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:38,566
Filtration can then remove 
any remaining flocks

249
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:42,336
or may be apply directly 
without a coagulation step.

250
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:45,289
Depending on the filter material 
filtration can be

251
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:48,089
an effective control measure 
for some pathogens,

252
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:51,485
especially larger ones 
like cryptosporidium.

253
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:56,801
Primary disinfection is an essential step 
in most treatment systems.

254
00:13:56,922 --> 00:14:00,259
To achieve the necessary levels 
of pathogen reduction

255
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:04,137
and to provide a safety net 
in case previous steps failed.

256
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:07,697
Chlorine is the most widely 
applied disinfectant,

257
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:11,657
but chlorine dioxide, 
ozone and ultraviolet light

258
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,197
are used in some cases.

259
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,886
Finally, after leaving 
the treatment plant

260
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,236
water suppliers can prevent contamination 
in the distribution system

261
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:23,760
by ensuring continuous pressure

262
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,760
so that contamination 
can't enter the pipes

263
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,280
and by maintaining 
a residual disinfectant,

264
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:30,735
if chlorine is used.

265
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,268
The same processes

266
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:35,099
that are applied 
at conventional treatment plants

267
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:38,257
can also be adapted and 
applied at the household level.

268
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:41,360
In fact, all of the household 
water treatment systems

269
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:46,434
use some combination of sedimentation, 
filtration and disinfection.

270
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:50,366
And they should be followed 
by safe storage

271
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:52,088
to prevent the contamination.

272
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:56,215
In the next several videos we'll look 
at examples of these processes

273
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:59,718
that are used in the main 
household water treatment systems.

274
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:04,239
The main difference 
between conventional treatment and HWTS

275
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,719
is not in the processes,

276
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:08,609
but in the point 
where the processes are applied.

277
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:13,506
HWTS requires households 
to take charge of their own water safety

278
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,834
by treating the water 
at the household level

279
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,044
and preventing the contamination.

280
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:19,614
Τhis is quite a challenge

281
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,664
since most households residents 
are not trained engineers

282
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:26,924
and don't necessarily even 
have a modern concept of germ theory.

283
00:15:27,353 --> 00:15:29,272
The concepts 
of the water safety framework

284
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:31,983
can be applied for HWTS.

285
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:34,870
But implementing something 
like a water safety plan

286
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:37,153
for household water treatment and storage

287
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:40,513
requires fundamental changes in behavior.

288
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:45,306
HWTS should not be seen 
as an alternative or competitor

289
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:47,574
to conventional water supply.

290
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:49,066
And the long-term goal should be

291
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:51,525
to extend access 
to safe drinking water supplies

292
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:54,827
at the household level 
to everyone, everywhere.

293
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:58,490
HWTS can represent a short-term strategy

294
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:03,591
to approved drinking water quality 
until that long-term goal can be reached.

295
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:08,264
So, in summary, we've heard today 
about the Water Safety Framework

296
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:11,553
described in the WHO Guidelines 
for Drinking Water Quality.

297
00:16:11,982 --> 00:16:14,290
The Framework consists 
of three main components:

298
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,675
Health-based targets, 
Water Safety Plans

299
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:20,353
and Verification monitoring -- 
independent verification.

300
00:16:20,422 --> 00:16:22,716
There are a lot of resources available

301
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,695
that describe water safety plans 
in much more detail,

302
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:28,146
if you're interested in learning more.

303
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:31,504
We also learned about 
one kind of health-based target --

304
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:33,733
Log Reduction Values, or LRV.

305
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:35,244
We'll come back to those

306
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,169
as we look at the different treatments 
and processes used in HWTS.

307
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:42,265
And we learned 
that the treatment processes

308
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:44,424
used in household water treatment

309
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:48,087
are the same that are applied 
in conventional water treatment plans.

310
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:51,136
The key differences are 
in the location of the treatment...
