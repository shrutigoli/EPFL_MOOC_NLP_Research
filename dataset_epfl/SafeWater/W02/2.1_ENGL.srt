1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,740
Welcome to the second week of this course.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,530
Today we will talk about drinking water
safety.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,980
Well first, what does water safety mean?

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,620
In fact, what does safety mean at all?

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,360
Is it safe to swim in a lake?

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,780
To walk from your home to school?

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,570
Is it safe to eat a plate of chicken
curry?

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,000
Is it safe to fly in an airplane?

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,680
Well none of these things actually.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,160
In fact, nothing in life at all is
completely safe.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,520
There's always some risk, however small,
that something can go wrong and

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,800
that while doing any of these activities
your health can be harmed.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,090
However, once we acknowledge that all
activity has some risk,

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,930
the critical question becomes what level
of risk is acceptable,

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,950
and how can problems be identified and
controlled before they

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,780
occur to manage risks and keep them at an
acceptable level.

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,990
If you go on an airplane flight, you are
assuming

18
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,480
that the plane won't crash, and why do you
think that?

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,850
Because there are guidelines and
regulations in

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,380
place to keep risks to acceptable levels.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,180
The airplane pilots have to go through a
rigorous

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,969
training program, long before they could
fly a real plane.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,720
The aircraft itself has to be regularly
inspected,

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,950
and preventive maintenance checks must be
performed routinely.

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,860
There are auditing systems and inspections
to make

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,200
sure that these safety measures are
applied correctly.

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,399
And when the safety measures are all in
place, traveling by plane is very safe.

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,140
It's not ever 100% safe.

29
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,620
But, on a major airline today, the risk of

30
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,770
being involved in a fatal accident is
much, much

31
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,380
less than one in a million, and most
people

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,480
would consider that to be a safe level of
risk.

33
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,360
Well, the same concept applies to drinking
water.

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,050
The World Health Organization has a
definition of safe drinking water.

35
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,790
Safe drinking water is that which does not
represent any significant risk to health

36
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,540
over a lifetime of consumption, including
different

37
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,070
sensitivities that may occur between life
stages.

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,110
Now notice the definition doesn't say,
does not represent any risk to health.

39
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,570
It says doesn't represent any significant
risk to health.

40
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,120
The WHO guidelines for drinking water
quality include recommended

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,900
maximum levels or guideline values for 90
different chemicals.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,630
And these guideline values are normally
set to represent a tolerable level of

43
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,768
risk, which in the guidelines, is taken as
one DALY per million-person years.

44
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,210
Remember DALYs?

45
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,700
Disability Adjusted Life Years.

46
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,090
Well, this risk level means that if a
million

47
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,900
people drink water for a year with the
chemical at

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,340
the guideline value, then the chemical
will cause health effects

49
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,890
with a disease burden of one DALY over
that population.

50
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,810
And chemicals that cause cancer are
treated in a similar way.

51
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,520
A lifetime of drinking water at the
guideline value should

52
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,869
cause no more than one excess cancer case
per 100,000 people.

53
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,950
Now this is not zero risk, but it is
considered a tolerable level.

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,500
Put another way, risks smaller than this
are considered not to be significant.

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,350
WHO guideline values of course, are not
national standards and it is

56
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,829
up to each state to determine its own
acceptable level of risk.

57
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,060
Now health outcomes or water quality
guidelines linked to health outcomes are

58
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,410
two examples of health-based targets,
which define an acceptable level of risk.

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,560
There are other kinds of health-based
targets such as performance targets

60
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,820
which specify a certain level of removal
for contaminant or a pathogen.

61
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,560
Or specified technologies.

62
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,850
For example saying that, surface water

63
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,550
must always be filtered before further
treatment.

64
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,230
Let's look a bit more at performance
targets, since those

65
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,690
will be important in the context of
household water treatment.

66
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,600
The main example of a performance target
is the Log Reduction Value or LRV.

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,440
This is the number of log units by which

68
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,780
a chemical or other containment is reduced
through treatment.

69
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,710
Now you can easily calculate the LRV by
taking the ratio of

70
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,370
the containment before and after treatment
and then taking the base ten logarithm.

71
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,855
Now, if the concentration is unchanged by
the treatment,

72
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,440
that means there's no removal and the LRV
is zero.

73
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,260
It's also possible for a contaminant to
increase

74
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,040
during treatment, in which case the LRV is
negative.

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,389
Hopefully that doesn't happen too much.

76
00:04:46,928 --> 00:04:51,840
Now if a hypothetical contaminant was
reduced from a million to half a million

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,120
counts, and here it doesn't matter what

78
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,130
units are used as long as they're
consistent.

79
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,800
That would be an LRV of 0.3, since 0.3 is
the logarithm of two, roughly.

80
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,670
And if it were reduced to 100,000, that is
a

81
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,980
90 percent reduction, that would be a log,
one log reduction.

82
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,760
So you can see that if we talk about
reducing something

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,514
a hundred fold by 99%, that would be a two
log reduction.

84
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,230
And to go from one million of something to

85
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,149
a single unit would be a six log
reduction.

86
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,250
So, performance targets can specify the
amount of log reduction

87
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,780
values that should be achieved for a
certain class of pathogens.

88
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,810
For example, a three log removal of

89
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,054
bacteria would mean removing 99.9% of
bacteria.

90
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,590
And a target of five log removal would be
a hundred times more strict.

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,950


92
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,960


93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,550
So that's a quick introduction to
health-based targets.

94
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,490
Health-based targets are one part of the
water safety

95
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,000
framework described in the WHO Guidelines
for drinking water quality.

96
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,930
In brief, the other main components

97
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,440
are system assessment, operational
monitoring, management

98
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,570
and communication and these are then

99
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,730
confirmed by water quality testing for
verification.

100
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,210
Ideally the verification step is done by
an

101
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,910
independent authority and not by the
service provider.

102
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,475
Information from the verification step,
and then feedback into

103
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,161
setting of health-based targets and
acceptable levels of risks.

104
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:41,745
[BLANK_AUDIO]

105
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,817
The three steps in the middle are the
actions

106
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:46,560
that can be done by the water service
provider.

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,160
And taken together, they can constitute a
water

108
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,150
safety plan for a particular water supply
system.

109
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,080
First, in order to prevent risks, we have
to understand all

110
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,790
the components of a water supply system,
from catchment to consumer.

111
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,930
By examining each step in the water supply
chain, potential hazards can be

112
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,570
identified as places where something could
go

113
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,870
wrong, or where microbial contamination
could occur.

114
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,410
For each hazard, a control measure can
then

115
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,560
be put in place, which defines acceptable
performance.

116
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,120
Once control measures are established,
system operators should

117
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,230
routinely monitor that the control
measures are being applied.

118
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,640
And if anything goes wrong it is noticed
quickly.

119
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,020
This might include testing for e-coli, but
it's more

120
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,720
likely to include very simple actions,
like keeping pumping

121
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,130
logs up to date, checking turbidity levels
after filtration

122
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,519
or measuring residual chlorine as finished
water leaves the plant.

123
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,900
Think of the airplane example.

124
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,250
You don't want your measure of air flight
safety to

125
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,240
be, hey the plain didn't crash, it must
have been safe.

126
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,850
You want the airline to be routinely
monitoring all

127
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,200
of those safety measures that they have
put in place.

128
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,190
Management plans mainly describe the
routine

129
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,620
operations that are done under normal
conditions.

130
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,810
But it's also important to know what to do
when a problem or incident occurs.

131
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,810
Incidence response plans should be
developed

132
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,820
and should be well known by operators

133
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,220
so that if something bad happens the
operators know exactly what to do.

134
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,620
And unsafe water is not delivered to
consumers.

135
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,020
Good records should be kept of both

136
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,890
routine operations and any instance that
occur.

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,420
And such information should be shared with
consumers and there should

138
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,029
be channels for consumers to give feedback
to the system operators.

139
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,990
There's a lot more to be said about water
safety plans.

140
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,150
In fact it would be a good topic for a
full MOOC.

141
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,180
But for our purposes, water safety plans
are important

142
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,010
as an example of how water safety can be
conceptualized.

143
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,030
At a very simple level, the water safety
framework consists

144
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,870
of health-based targets to define an
acceptable level of risk.

145
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:12,260
Some system for identifying and managing
risks, that's the water safety plan part,

146
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,830
and independent verification that the risk
management system is, in fact, working.

147
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,220
In this framework, there is a need for

148
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,290
measuring water quality, but mainly as a
verification measure.

149
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,760
Most of the work to ensure water safety,
is in the system assessment in

150
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,170
the developing of control measures, and
the

151
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,120
operational monitoring to make sure
they're being applied.

152
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,240
If you only do water quality measurements,
you can't be sure that

153
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,920
the drinking water is safe, even if you
don't find any E.coli.

154
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,075
People often make the mistake that if
they've checked drinking water for

155
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:52,080
E.coli, and didn't find any, they assume
that the water must be safe.

156
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,190
In fact, water without E.coli could be
unsafe for several reasons.

157
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,980
First, contamination can be very variable
in space.

158
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,920
If you collect your sample at the wrong
place, you could miss the problem.

159
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,030
Second, contamination can be very variable
in time.

160
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,200
Maybe on the day that you do

161
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,520
your water quality testing, there is no
contamination,

162
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,440
but the day before, or even the hour

163
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,112
before, there was, and you weren't testing
them.

164
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:23,960
Finally, E.coli is not a perfect fecal

165
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,160
indicator, though it is the best one
available.

166
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,320
It is possible that treatment has killed
all of the E.coli,

167
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,610
but some other pathogens, for instance

168
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,960
cryptosporidium or rotavirus, are still
viable.

169
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,190
So to say drinking water is safe, you need
both things.

170
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,910
You need to show that the water is free
from contamination, but also that

171
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,580
there is a system in place to

172
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,320
proactively identify and prevent
contamination from occurring.

173
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,360
Water safety plans are a fairly new
concept, but they're taking off rapidly.

174
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,160
There are currently over 20 countries that

175
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,050
require water safety plans in their
regulations.

176
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,410
And many other countries are in the

177
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,300
process of including them in future
regulations.

178
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,136
Water safety plans are typically applied
for conventional treatment and

179
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,568
pipe supplies at the level of the water
supply scheme.

180
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:17,318
There are examples of rural water safety
plans, including

181
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:21,820
for point sources, such as bore holes or
protected springs.

182
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,470
But most of the experience to date

183
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,020
has been with larger, professionally
managed pipe systems.

184
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,860
An important concept from the system
assessment step

185
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,729
of water safety planning is that of
multiple barriers.

186
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,240
Remember, the main source of pathogens is
fecal matter.

187
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,650
So multiple barriers can be put in place

188
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,980
to prevent fecal material from entering
the drinking water

189
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,900
supply, and to remove the pathogens that
do make

190
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,889
it in, using a variety of different
treatment processes.

191
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,290
Different pathogens have different levels
of

192
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,190
resistance, to different kinds of
treatment.

193
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,470
Also any single control measure can fail
at some point.

194
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,220
So by including multiple barriers to
remove pathogens, the

195
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,499
risk of providing unsafe drinking water
can be minimized.

196
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,920
Conventional treatment of surface water

197
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,330
typically follows this multiple barrier
approach.

198
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,660
Before reaching the treatment plant, the
water resource itself can be protected.

199
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,730
For example the use of fertilizers,
pesticides,

200
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,190
or other chemicals may be restricted
within

201
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,890
the catchment area of a river or an
aquifer used for drinking water supply.

202
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,280
Within the treatment plant itself, a
series of processes are normally followed.

203
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,960
Some kind of pre-treatment step may be
necessary to reduce high

204
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,020
levels of suspended solids, which could

205
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,240
cause problems for subsequent treatment
steps.

206
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,310
Storage reservoirs allow some
sedimentation to take place.

207
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,850
And roughing filters or bank infiltration
can remove many particles

208
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,120
as well as improving the microbiological
quality to some degree.

209
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,500
Coagulation and flocculation remove
turbidity,

210
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,360
or suspended solids.

211
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,850
By addition of a coagulant salt, typically
aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride, which

212
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,020
forms flocs that grow, removing suspended

213
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,250
solids as well as some dissolved
compounds.

214
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,140
These flocs then settle out of solution
in clarification tanks or, in some

215
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,279
cases, can float to the top of the tank
where they can be removed.

216
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,580
Filtration can then remove any remaining
flocs or

217
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,250
may be applied directly without a
coagulation step.

218
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,640
Depending on the filter material,
filtration can be an effective

219
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,920
control measure for some pathogens,

220
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,370
especially larger ones like
cryptosporidium.

221
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,280
Primary disinfection is an essential step
in

222
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,950
most treatment systems to achieve the
necessary

223
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,610
levels of pathogen reduction and to
provide

224
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,980
a safety net in case previous steps fail.

225
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,000
Chlorine is the most widely applied
disinfectant, but chlorine

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,409
dioxide, ozone, and ultraviolet light are
used in some cases.

227
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,780
Finally, after leaving the treatment
plant, water suppliers can

228
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,900
prevent contamination in the distribution
system by ensuring continuous

229
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,510
pressure so that contamination can't enter
the pipes and

230
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,950
by maintaining a residual disinfectant if
chlorine is used.

231
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,900
The same processes that are applied at
conventional treatment plants

232
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,440
can also be adapted and applied at the
household level.

233
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,600
In fact, all of the household water
treatment

234
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,360
systems use some combination

235
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,670
of sedimentation, filtration and
disinfection.

236
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:46,015
And they should all be followed by safe
storage to prevent re-contamination.

237
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,840
In the next several videos, we will look
at examples of

238
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,430
these processes that are used in the main
household water treatment systems.

239
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,190
The main difference between conventional
treatment and HWTS is not in

240
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,460
the processes, but in the point where the
processes are applied.

241
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,030
HWTS requires households to take charge of
their own water safety

242
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:12,710
by treating the water at the household
level, and preventing re-contamination.

243
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,340
This is quite a challenge, since most
household residents are not trained

244
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,770
engineers, and don't necessarily even have
a modern concept of germ theory.

245
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,690
The concepts of the water safety framework
can be applied for HWTS.

246
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,740
But implementing something like a water
safety plan for

247
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,830
household water treatment and storage
requires fundamental changes in behavior.

248
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,520
HWTS should not be seen as an

249
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,880
alternative or competitor to conventional
water supply.

250
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,590
And the long term goal should be to extend
access to

251
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,960
safe drinking water supplies at the
household level to everyone, everywhere.

252
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,510
HWTS can represent a short term strategy
to improve drinking

253
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,840
water quality until that long term goal
can be reached.

254
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,200
So in summary, we've heard today about the
water safety

255
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,910
framework, described in the WHO Guidelines
for drinking water quality.

256
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,550
The framework consists of three main
components: health-based

257
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,720
targets, water safety plans,

258
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,230
and verification monitoring, independent
verification.

259
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,560
There are a lot of resources available
that describe water safety

260
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
plans in much more detail, if you're
interested in learning more.

261
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,590
We also learned about one kind

262
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,130
of health-based target, log reduction
values, or

263
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,960
LRV We'll come back to those as we look at
the different treatment

264
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:37,200
processes used in HWTS, and we learned
that the treatment processes used in

265
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,590
household water treatment are the same
that

266
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,760
are applied in conventional water
treatment plants.

267
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,100
The key differences are in the location of
the treatment and

268
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,310
in the motivation and skills of the person
applying the treatment.
