00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,780
Membrane Filtration, passing water through
synthetic membranes to purify

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,090
it, is a rapidly growing field in drinking
water treatment.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,370
The vast majority of experiences in high


4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,050
income countries but increasingly membrane
filtration is being

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,830
adapted and applied in low and middle


6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,500
income countries, and even at the
household scale.

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,200
In this module, we will discuss different


8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,970
types of membranes and how they are
configured,

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,310
how they improve water quality and how


10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,560
they can be applied for household water
treatment.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,500
There are several different kinds of
processes involved in membrane filtration

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,250
which all have impacts on the quality of
the filtered water.

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,260
Perhaps the most obvious is a size
exclusion phenomenon

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,120
where particles are strained out through
either small pores in

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,150
the membrane itself, or they're collected
at a surface layer,

16
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,010
a cake that forms on the surface of the
membrane.

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,505
A second kind of process though is, an
electrostatic process.

18
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:09,300
Where particles that have a positive or


19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,450
negative charge interact with the
membrane's surface.

20
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,520
If the charge is the same, they will repel
each other and if the charge is,

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,539
opposite the particles can be attracted to
and absorbed on the membrane surface.

22
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,900
Finally, membranes are biologically
active.

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,150
And that can have large impacts on


24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,130
the removal both of pathogens and
dissolved compounds.

25
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,810
Different type of membrane filtration can
be defined on the basis of the pore size.

26
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,310
Or the size of materials that can pass
through the membrane.

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,910
Membranes with smaller pores will exclude
more particles, and even dissolved

28
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,920
substances, but will require more pressure
to force water through the membrane.

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,180
First, you can think about simple cloth
filtration.

30
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,116
Most cloths have an effective pore size of
around a 100

31
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:06,270
to 150 microns, about the diameter of a
strand of hair.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,510
Remember our cartoon of the sizes of
different pathogens?

33
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,590
Certainly viruses and bacteria can easily
pass

34
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,090
through cloth, and most protozoa as well.


35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,400
However, some pathogens are attached to
larger particles,

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,620
which could be removed by cloth, including
insect hosts.

37
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,690
The guinea worm larvae, which is


38
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,170
transmitted by copepods, little water
insects

39
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,960
around one millimeter in size, can be
effectively removed with cloth filtration.

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,340
Studies in Bangladesh have also shown that
cloth folded over four

41
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,750
to eight times has an effective pore size
of about 20 microns.

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,820
And cholera is also transmitted at least
partially through copepods.

43
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,780
So studies have shown that the use of
cloth

44
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,920
filtration can reduce cholera by about
half in Bangladesh.

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,869
Sand, silt, and clay are inorganic
particles that are defined by their size.

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,660
Particles smaller than two to four microns
are called clay.

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,990
Particles up to about 63 microns are
called silt.

48
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,130
And particles up to two millimeters are
called sand.

49
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,230
After that you get into gravel and
boulders.

50
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,850
Cloth filtration then can remove most
coarse and medium

51
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,770
sand, but doesn't do much for silt and
clay.

52
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,060
So, turbidity may not be very much reduced
by simple cloth filtration.

53
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,300
But most membrane filtration uses
synthetic

54
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,050
membranes made of different, plastic-like
materials.

55
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,030
There are four general types of synthetic
membranes which

56
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,765
have different pore sizes and therefore
operate at different pressures.

57
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:54,217
Micro-filtration membranes have pore sizes
of about 0.1 to five

58
00:03:54,217 --> 00:04:00,150
microns and require little pressure to
force water through the membrane.

59
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,860
By the way, let's talk briefly about units
of pressure.

60
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,372
The atmospheric pressure at sea level is
100 kilopascals,

61
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:15,802
which is commonly called one bar, or a
thousand millibars.

62
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:18,340
Now one millibar is roughly equal to


63
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,640
the pressure caused by one centimeter of
water.

64
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,160
So one bar, a thousand millibars equates
to about ten vertical meters of water.

65
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:31,607
One bar is also equivalent to 15 pounds


66
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:35,805
per square inch, roughly, if you prefer
PSI units.

67
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:40,770
Now micro filtration typically requires
less than one bar of pressure.

68
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,466
Since the pores are large it's easy to
filter water quickly and you

69
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:49,133
can typically get several hundred liters
per hour from a square meter of membrane.

70
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:53,582
[BLANK_AUDIO]


71
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:58,978
Micro filtration will usually remove
protozoa, like cryptosporidium and giardia

72
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:04,270
and depending on the membrane may also
remove bacteria like e coli and Shigella.

73
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,112
Viruses and chemicals would not be removed
except the fraction retained

74
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:16,167
on larger particles or absorbed onto the
membrane's surface.

75
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:20,460
Ultra filtration membranes have pore sizes
roughly from ten to

76
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,510
a hundred nanometers, where a thousand
nanometers equals one micron.

77
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,680
So these will completely exclude bacteria
and larger particles.

78
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,860
And may also remove viruses and larger
molecules like proteins.

79
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,650
Ultra filtration membranes require more
pressure, typically

80
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,760
around one bar but up to several bar.


81
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,430
Flux is depended on the operating pressure
but can typically

82
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,800
be around a hundred liters per hour, per
square meter.

83
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,960
Nano-filtration membranes go from about
one to ten

84
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,340
nanometers, so they should completely
exclude all pathogens, including viruses,

85
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,700
as well as larger molecules, having
molecular

86
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,278
masses from about 200 to a thousand
daltons.

87
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,690
Divalent metal cations, like magnesium,
which cause hardness in water,

88
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:23,090
can also be excluded by nano filtration
due to electrostatic effects.

89
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,600
So these membranes are often used for
water softening.

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,250
Operating pressures can go up to about ten
or 15 bar.

91
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,782
Finally, the tightest membranes are called
reverse osmosis, or

92
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:41,083
RO which can remove pretty much any kind
of ion.

93
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:46,581
RO is used for desalination, but requires
very high pressure, up to 80 bar.

94
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:52,389
[BLANK_AUDIO]


95
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,520
Membranes come in several different
configurations.

96
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,170
The first main configuration is flat
sheets, like sheets of paper, which can be

97
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,170
mounted on racks or can be wrapped around
a spacer in a spiral roll.

98
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,180
The second main class is hollow fibers, or


99
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,570
tubes, where water is passed either
through the inside

100
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,290
of the tube and collected on the outside,
or

101
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,670
from the outside and then collected on the
inside.

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,950
In both cases, one of the objectives is to
maximize

103
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,220
the surface area of membranes that can be
packed into a

104
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,780
treatment module, so you'll also maximize
the amount of water

105
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,510
that can be treated for a given size of
filter module.

106
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,246
Membranes can also be operated in a
dead-end

107
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:41,770
or cross-flow configuration, where dead
end means that

108
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,820
all of the water is put on top of the
membrane and pushed through the membrane.

109
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,720
In contrast, cross-flow, the water, passes
laterally

110
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,930
across the surface of the membrane, with


111
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,870
some of the water permeating through the


112
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,570
membrane to the clean side where it's
collected.

113
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,420
Perhaps the greatest challenge of membrane
filtration is that of membrane fouling.

114
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,840
A clean, new membrane will process a lot
of water with relatively little pressure.

115
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,980
But with time, particles build up on the
surface.

116
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,290
A layer forms, a cake layer, especially if


117
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,920
the membrane's operated in a dead end
mode.

118
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,990
And internal to the membrane, particles
can lodge in

119
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,290
pores or dissolved compounds can absorb
and restrict pore size.

120
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,790
So over time, flux decreases and you need
more pressure

121
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,040
to get the same amount of water through
the system.

122
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,720
The response to this is to do regular
backwashing, reversing the flow

123
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,270
of water to remove some of those
particles, especially from the surface.

124
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:54,350
Or to pass water across the surface in a
cross flow at a high velocity to scour it.

125
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,400
And that can remove what's called the
reversible fraction of

126
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,740
fouling, but typically there's still, some
irreversible fouling that remains.

127
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,280
That can be removed in part but not wholly
by cleaning the membrane with solvents

128
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,880
or with acids or bases, depending on the
compounds causing the fouling.

129
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,580
There are many examples of household
application of

130
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,360
membrane filtration, in high income and
middle income countries.

131
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,350
Typically, reverse osmosis, or nano
filtration

132
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,940
systems could be installed in the kitchen.


133
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,780
They would require electricity and,
usually an additional pump

134
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,740
to generate the pressure to pass water
through the membranes.

135
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,322
However, there's increasing development
of, applications using ultra-filtration

136
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:49,960
or micro-filtration membranes, that use
less pressure to treat

137
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,500
the water, and can even be applied in some


138
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,690
cases without electricity in low and
middle income settings.

139
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,270
One of the best known examples of these
schemes or these

140
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,540
technologies is the Lifestraw family,
which is produced by Vestergaard Frandsen.

141
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:14,480
The Lifestraw family, here you see their
Lifestraw family 1.0 model.

142
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,000
It uses an ultra-filtration membrane with
a 20 nanometer pore size,

143
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,050
which is small enough to exclude protozoa,
bacteria and also viruses.

144
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,940
It's operated in a, a dead end mode, using
hollow fiber membranes.

145
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,070
The membranes are found in the blue
cartridge here.

146
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,580
And you simply fill the, the blue
reservoir with raw water to be filtered.

147
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,380
There's a hose that connects the reservoir
to the filter, and it's about a

148
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,360
meter long so that provides the pressure


149
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
necessary to pass the water through the
membrane.

150
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,600
The system includes a, a red bulb for
manual backwash and it can produce

151
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,450
about nine liters of water per hour with a
lifetime of about 18,000 liters.

152
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,150
The system also includes a, a halogen


153
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,130
compartment where a chlorine tablet can be
put.

154
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,190
And this isn't for, for removal of
pathogens as much as

155
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,640
for preventing of membrane fouling and
minimizing the need for backwashing.

156
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,490
Vestergaard has been producing Lifestraw
filters since 2005.

157
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,510
First, in emergencies such as earthquakes
in Haiti and Pakistan.

158
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,630
But increasingly has been targeting
household routine

159
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,440
use and one of their largest experiences
to

160
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,280
date has been in western Kenya, where
880,000

161
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:42,000
of these Lifestraw 1.0 family filters were
distributed.

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,550
In subsequent models, we'll look more at
their

163
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,360
business model, but here we're focusing on
the technologies.

164
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:51,530
Vestergaard has recently developed a
second

165
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,730
generation Lifestraw family filter, the
Lifestraw 2.0.

166
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,910
Which has a similar membrane to the 1.0,


167
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,990
though it does include an 80 micron
pre-filter.

168
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,930
One of the big differences, though, is
that the 2.0

169
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,720
includes reservoirs, both a five liter raw
water vessel, dirty water

170
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,150
tank and a five liter reservoir for
filtered water which can

171
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,560
minimize the potential for
re-contamination

172
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,520
after passing it through the membrane.


173
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,589
It's a bit larger as well, so it has a,


174
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:29,394
a 30,000 liter lifetime compared to 18,000
for the 1.0.

175
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:33,219
One large application of the Lifestraw
Family Filter, is as

176
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:37,539
part of the Del Agua Health Program
being implemented in Rwanda.

177
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:40,737
And this is a combination of the Lifestraw
2.0

178
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:45,087
along with improved cook stoves to reduce
indoor air pollution.

179
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:52,263
They are targeting 600,000 poor households
throughout the country.

180
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:56,283
The Lifestraw family is a well known
application of ultra-filtration

181
00:12:56,283 --> 00:13:00,730
modules at the household level in low and
middle income countries.

182
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,390
But it's not the only one.


183
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:07,720
Here you can see some other examples of
microfiltration products Katadyn,

184
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:15,530
primarily targeting, backpackers and
sports enthusiasts.

185
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:22,090
Nerox, produces a microfilter that's used
in emergencies, as does Sawyer.

186
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,000
Then there are a number of ultra
filtration products out there.

187
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,680
One which my institution, EAWAG, has been


188
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,480
developing, is a gravity driven ultra
filtration

189
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,930
membrane which is a slightly different
approach

190
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,930
in that we allow a biological layer to


191
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,910
develop on the surface of the membrane, so
there's no need to do back washing

192
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,450
or cleaning and if you would like to hear
more about that, visit our website.

193
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,760
Then Lifesaver Systems has a bottle and a
jerrycan

194
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,410
version, Polymem and you've seen the
Vestergaard Franzen system.

195
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,020
Membrane filtration, like all treatment
process, has advantages and challenges.

196
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,950
One of the main advantages is that the
membrane provides an

197
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,209
absolute barrier to particles, as long as
system integrity is ensured.

198
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,480
Most of the membranes can exclude protozoa
and bacteria

199
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,396
easily, and the tighter membranes can also
exclude viruses.

200
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,940
However, the looser membranes, such as
microfiltration

201
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,500
and ultrafiltration have little effect on
chemicals directly.

202
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,371
Though some chemicals may be removed,
along with the

203
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:35,257
particles or it can absorb on to the
membrane's surface.

204
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:38,670
Membrane filtration can be very simple to
operate

205
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,150
though there is a need for backwashing and
cleaning.

206
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:46,496
One advantage is that membrane filtration
doesn't change the taste of

207
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:51,500
the water, though it does reduce turbidity
which, consumers often appreciate.

208
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,640
However, membrane filtration doesn't
provide

209
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,380
any residual, protection against
recontamination.

210
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,120
So especially if there's not a


211
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,860
safe storage container, they're vulnerable
to recontamination.

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,870
Some of the membrane filtration models
require electricity or high pressure.

213
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,040
And for all of them, supply chains are
necessary for

214
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,390
the initial purchase, but also for
replacement parts and services.

215
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,910
So in summary, we've looked at membrane
filtration as one type of the second

216
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,600
class of treatments of filtration, which
could

217
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,350
be followed by disinfection and then safe
storage.

218
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,650
We discussed cloth filtration, and how the
pores in cloths are quite large, so

219
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,940
the cloth is useful for removing large


220
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,980
particles, including copepods, but not
smaller ones

221
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,000
such as bacteria or viruses, and spent


222
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,110
more time looking at synthetic membranes,
especially

223
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,240
these four types of membranes, micro
filtration,

224
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,320
ultra filtration, nanofiltration and
reverse osmosis defined

225
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,110
on the basis of their pore sizes and
operating pressures.

226
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,340
And we saw which membranes could exclude


227
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,420
which kinds of particles and dissolve
compounds.

228
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,830
Finally, we concluded with a brief summary


229
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,970
of the advantages and challenges of
membrane filtration.
