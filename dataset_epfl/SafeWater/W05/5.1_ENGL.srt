[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,340
So, welcome.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,070
I'm Maggie Montgomery, from the World
Health Organization.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,820
And, here today to talk about the
evaluation

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,390
and the validation of household water
treatment technology.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,850
So, I want to thank, Dr. Johnston for
inviting me.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,920
And let's get started.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,190
So there's going to be three main things
I'd like to talk to you about today.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,490
The first is why is it important

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,420
to assess the performance of household
water treatment.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,600
And I'll talk just briefly about the fact

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,760
that household water treatment, the main
benefit is health.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,118
And so it's important that we know how
well.

14
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:40,050
Household water treatment technologies
remove pathogens so we

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,220
have some indication of the protection of
health.

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,820
And second is, I'll talk about the WHO

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,470
global standards on the performance of
household water treatment.

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,750
And give a bit of background about how
they were developed.

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,140
And lastly, I'll talk about what WHO is
doing to implement these standards.

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,570
Specifically.

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,880
Discuss the WHO International Scheme

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,481
to evaluate household water treatment
technologies.

23
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,240
There's two main reasons why it's
important to

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
assess the performance of household water
treatments technology.

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,000
The first is to understand if these
technologies are achieving.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,165
The objectives of improving health, which
requires, first of all that they

27
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,590
remove the pathogens that are causing

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,340
the diarrhoeal disease in a specific
population.

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,250
And in some cases, we know specially which
pathogens are causing that disease.

30
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,710
For example, in a cholera outbreak, it's
very well known that

31
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,508
is the bacterium vibrio cholerae that is
causing the diarrhoeal disease.

32
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:44,530
But in other cases, for example, people
living with HIV AIDS, who are more

33
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,010
susceptible to diarrhoeal disease, it
could be

34
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,370
a suite pathogens that are causing this
disease.

35
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,450
And in all cases, it's important that the

36
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,395
devices that are being used with these
specific populations.

37
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:00,750
Are removing the pathogens we are most
concerned about.

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,040
And if we don't know exactly which
pathogens those are, it is

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,990
prudent to make sure that these devices
remove a suite of pathogens.

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,010
The second reason why assessing household
water treatment performance is

41
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,050
important is that government especially as
well as implementers and funders.

42
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,820
Need to know that the, the devices that
they are investing

43
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,810
in are achieving the aims that they set
out to achieve.

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,850
And this requires a rigorous evaluation of
household water treatment.

45
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,590
Now, in many countries where household
water treatment is most needed, i.e.

46
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,650
Where the water quality is poor and the
diarrhoeal disease burden is

47
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,040
high, governments don't have the
resources,

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,850
nor the capacity to do such evaluations.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,200
And lastly, I just wanted to emphasize
that while today's talk

50
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,940
is going to be focused on the performance,
realizing the health

51
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,160
benefits from household water treatment
also requires that users correctly and

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,120
consistently use household water treatment
when their water quality is compromised.

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,930
So in order to facilitate the evaluation
of household water treatment

54
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,870
WHO come out with global recommendations
on how to assess performance.

55
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,190
Now, these global recommendations, the
goal is to protect

56
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,240
the health of the users and also to ensure
that.

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,510
More household water treatments products

58
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,880
that achieve minimum performance standards
are

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,040
being distributed and used to those that
most need safe water.

60
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,880
Now specifically the recommendations look
at three main classes of pathogens.

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,080
And these three classes of pathogens, I
know you've already talked

62
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,270
about with Dr. Johnston and hopefully you
understand well at this point.

63
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,660
But these are the three main classes that
cause diarrhoeal

64
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,680
disease in humans and they are viruses
bacteria and protozoa.

65
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,100
From these three classes of pathogens we
derived

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,160
targets and what I mean by targets we

67
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,640
derived, what are the minimum amounts of
removal

68
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,900
that need to be achieved in order to.

69
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,780
Achieve a certain minimum amount of risk
in a population.

70
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,870
Now these targets were derived based on
what has already been done in the WHO

71
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,540
guidelines for drinking water quality and
these guidelines

72
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,940
use what is called quantitative microbial
risk assessment.

73
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,360
So quantitative microbial risk assessment
are basically models that allow

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,730
us to predict what will be the health
consequences in a population if they

75
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:31,640
ingest a certain concentration of
pathogens with a certain frequency.

76
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,510
So for these models we obviously had to
pick specific pathogens within each of

77
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:42,290
these, classes of viruses, bacteria and
protozoa to come up with an estimate.

78
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,140
Now from that estimate we also decided.

79
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,800
What was the minimum amount of risk we're
willing to accept and I'll talk

80
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,930
about that in the next slide, that allowed
us to then develop our removal target.

81
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,410
We also used a tiered approach.

82
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,940
So rather than setting one very high bar

83
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,760
for household water treatment, we
recognized that even

84
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,480
devices that maybe are not the best but

85
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,800
do provide some protection and even
limited protection.

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,240
Can have a very significant impact in
populations where the concentrations

87
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
of pathogens are very high and the disease
burden is very high.

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,010
So this tiered approach was, was done to
acknowledge the fact

89
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,510
that even lesser performing devices can
still have an health impact.

90
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,040
It was also created because we recognized
in some situations it's just simply not

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,930
economically feasible to have the very top
device, and cheaper

92
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,780
and perhaps less protective devices can
still have an important impact.

93
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,340
lastly, the recommendations provide some
information on the laboratory

94
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,510
protocols, or how you would actually go
about doing experiments.

95
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,280
To test the performance of these household
water treatment devices.

96
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,910
Before I present the performance
standards,

97
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,565
I want just to briefly highlight what

98
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,800
log-removal is and what it actually means

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,700
when we're talking about concentrations of
pathogens.

100
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,380
So let's say, for example, we start with
100

101
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,680
cryptosporidium before we put the water
through a filter.

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,900
We put the water trough the filter and
filtering we have 10 cryptosporidium.

103
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,450
So that means we've removed 90
cyrptosporidium pretty

104
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,040
simple math, we can equate that to a

105
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,480
percentage and we say we have 90% removal
and that is equivalent to 1 log removal.

106
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,110
Now let's say with that same source water
we still have a 100 cryptosporidium.

107
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,160
But after filtering we use a better
filter, a more highly performing filter.

108
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,170
We only have one cryptosporidium remaining
in the water after it's been filtered.

109
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,100
This means we, we've removed 99
cryptosporidium.

110
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,163
Or achieved a two-log removal.

111
00:06:58,163 --> 00:07:00,850
Assessing performance.

112
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,880
So based on the quantitative microbial
risk models I spoke of earlier, we were

113
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,240
able to develop specific reduction targets
for

114
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,530
each of the three classes of pathogens.

115
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,030
Based on allowable risk.

116
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,080
Now the most stringent requirement were
the category where

117
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,480
we're allowing the least amount of risk in
a

118
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,770
population, specifically ten to the
negative six DALYs per

119
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,120
person per year, it is a highly protective
category.

120
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,880
Now in this category.

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,216
Devices must achieve at least four log
removal of bacteria, at least

122
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:41,210
five log removal of viruses and at least
four log removal protozoa.

123
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,920
Now you'll notice, that for the viruses,
the

124
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,140
log reduction is even greater because we
know viruses.

125
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,710
Are more likely to cause infection and
disease with

126
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,370
just a single virus, compared to the other
pathogens.

127
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,920
Now for the protective category, we're
allowing

128
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,030
a slightly less conservative risk in the
population.

129
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,800
It's 10 to the negative fourth DALYs.

130
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,530
And consequently, the log removal doesn't
have to be quite as high.

131
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,510
Two, at least two for bacteria, at least

132
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,432
three for viruses and at least two for
protozoa.

133
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:23,220
The final category, Limited Protection,
are actually technologies

134
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,840
that achieve at least two of the targets
for.

135
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,200
The classes of pathogens and protective.

136
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,190
Now, these may be technologies that do
really well for

137
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,950
two of the classes, but not on the third,
and

138
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,750
in populations where we are very sure of
the main

139
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,600
pathogen that's causing disease, they
could be a very effective option.

140
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,570
Now, for each of these classes of
bacteria, viruses, and protozoa.

141
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,380
We had to chose one specific organism to
represent the class as a

142
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,050
whole, in order to develop the models and
come up with the specific log-reductions.

143
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,160
So we choose pathogens that we know in
human

144
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,950
populations do account for a significant
proportion of diarrhoeal disease.

145
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,990
And bacteria specifically it's
campylobacter, virus

146
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,420
is rotavirus, and protozoa was
cryptosporidium.

147
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,070
Now what are some

148
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,880
examples of technologies that are already
being used in the

149
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,070
field and have been tested quite
rigorously in the lab.

150
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,450
That meet these performance standards.

151
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,270
Well for highly protective, the number one

152
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,788
technology or actually it's a method, is
boiling.

153
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:34,790
This is by far the oldest method we have
and it's very efficacious in the removal.

154
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,730
But the problem with boiling is re

155
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,150
contamination, so that's an important
issue to consider.

156
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,120
Ultra fi, filters, I know you've just
learned about filtration, are

157
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,760
also very efficacious as well as a comb,
combination of approaches.

158
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,310
So you may do filtering followed by
chlorination

159
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,170
in order to achieve a higher level of
protection.

160
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,870
In the middle category we have

161
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,080
membrane filters as well as many
flocculant-disinfectant.

162
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,510
And lastly in limited production category
some examples include chlorine which we

163
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,290
know is very effective against bacteria

164
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,420
especially cholera, but fairly ineffective
against protozoa.

165
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,620
Especially cryptosporidium.

166
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,400
Ceramic filters and some bio-sand filters

167
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,870
also fall into this limited protection
category.

168
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,010
Now you may wonder why did we have three
levels of performance.

169
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,600
Well there's two main reasons.

170
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,460
First of all, we know in populations where

171
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,070
there is a high burden of diarrhoeal
disease and

172
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,400
a high load of, of fecal contamination in

173
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,310
the environment and, and therefore in the
drinking water.

174
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,480
Even devices that achieved the protective
or limited

175
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,900
protection level could have a significant
impact on health.

176
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:54,670
We also know that in many of these areas,
economics and cost are huge barrier.

177
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:00,640
And, sometimes The highly protective
devices may also be cost-prohibitive.

178
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,460
So we don't want to prevent other, maybe
lesser-performing but still having

179
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,550
some protection devices, such as
protective

180
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,138
and limited protection from reaching those
populations.

181
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,310
Nuts and bolts of testing.

182
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,150
So how do we actually.

183
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,950
Test these devices and what kind of water
do we use,

184
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,210
to see that we're actually achieving a
certain level of performance.

185
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,650
Well we want to really mimic the types of
waters that

186
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,200
we find in the environments and
communities that would use these devices.

187
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,010
So, in order to do this.

188
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,860
We've developed two types of waters.

189
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,340
The first is a general test water.

190
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,400
Now this is water that represents high
quality groundwater or rainwater.

191
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,980
It will have a very low turbidity, so
there's not

192
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,940
a lot of particulates, in the water, and a
fairly, a

193
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,680
temperature that is fairly consistent with
the ambient temperature It

194
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,570
is the non-stressed phase of testing so
it's not technology specific.

195
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,050
We also though, want to see how these
devices will perform when we have

196
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,290
really turbid or contaminated water like
this river that you see here in Lao.

197
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,710
Many people are still using surface water

198
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,150
and this challenge water is supposed to
represent.

199
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,560
Such surface waters like rivers or ponds
so the

200
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,410
turbidity is very high as well as the TOC.

201
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,040
Now this is the stressed phase challenge
phase of testing and depending on

202
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,300
the different product, we may vary

203
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,370
the conditions, as different products will
fail.

204
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,010
Under different con, conditions.

205
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,480
Depending on whether or not it's a filter

206
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,650
or a chemical additive or some combination
of approaches.

207
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,400
We've talked about why it's important to

208
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,800
assess the performance of household water
treatment.

209
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,210
And we've also talked about the global

210
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,740
recommendations on performance of
household water treatment.

211
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,990
The third thing I want to talked about.

212
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,740
Is the WHO scheme to evaluate household
water treatment technologies with, which

213
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,400
is specifically how WHO and government

214
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,880
are working to implement these
recommendations.

215
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,010
There's two main objectives to this
scheme.

216
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,890
The first is to promote and coordinate the
independent testing and

217
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:16,200
evaluation of household water treatment
products Based on the WHO criteria.

218
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,620
I would like to stress the word

219
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,680
independent because often we find that
laboratories,

220
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,560
especially in particular countries, do not
have

221
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,100
the ability to provide independence and
objectives.

222
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,820
Evaluations.

223
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,050
The second, is to support national
governments

224
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,060
in building the technical capacity of
research institutions.

225
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,210
So, improve the ability for governments to
assess local products, to

226
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,630
do complimentary testing, in the field of
household water treatment products.

227
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,850
Especially after they've been in use for
some time.

228
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,820
And this is all linked to WHO's greater
work in water quality.

229
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,120
On applying the WHO guidelines on drinking
water quality.

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,950
I'd like to explain a bit about how the
scheme works and

231
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,910
in order to do that, highlight the scheme
actors and the components.

232
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,820
First of all, just wanted to mention that
WHO is hosting the

233
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,350
scheme secretariat and managing all the

234
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,970
different pieces and actors within the
scheme.

235
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,780
Providing advice to WHO is the Independent
Advisory Committee, so

236
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,510
this a group of experts who are reviewing
the test

237
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,880
protocols and the test results and
providing recommendations on how

238
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,780
products should be tested and what level
of performance they've reached.

239
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,040
There's also, of course, the
manufacturers.

240
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,120
And the manufacturers are submitting their
products for testing.

241
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,890
The designated testing laboratories,
currently we

242
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,710
have two, one in the United States

243
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,190
and one in the Netherlands, are doing the
actual testing of the products.

244
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,290
Now, at the same time, this scheme is very
interested in building up

245
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,970
a whole group of laboratories that

246
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,350
can do complementary testing especially in
countries.

247
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,440
Where household water treatment is most
often used.

248
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:02,750
Lastly, we have government, UN agencies,
donors, all those groups of entities that

249
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,660
are procuring, regulating and distributing
household water treatment devices.

250
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,800
And, finally, and perhaps most
importantly, we have the users.

251
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,290
And the, the scheme also aims to help
users make informed

252
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,520
choices about the products they're using
and the protection they're receiving.

253
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,010
There's three main steps to the scheme.

254
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,950
It's fairly simple.

255
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,600
The first are the submissions, and those

256
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,870
are received by WHO from the
manufacturers.

257
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,840
The second is the testing.

258
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,200
And as I mentioned the testing will

259
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,730
occur initially in these two designated
testing laboratories.

260
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,150
And lastly, we have the results and the
dissemination of those testings.

261
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,310
The overall aim of the scheme is to reduce
diarrhoeal

262
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,070
disease through safe or effective

263
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,140
microbially effective household treatment
technologies.

264
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,760
Now there's three main outcomes related to
this.

265
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,190
The first is to provide a publicly
available list of products tested.

266
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,120
And those summary results whether or not
the product passes or fails

267
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,860
to meet one of our three level performance
standards on the WHO website.

268
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,840
The second is to work with governments and

269
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,800
specifically the member states of the
World Health Organization.

270
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,220
To ensure that their national regulations
start to reflect some of

271
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,750
the recommendations the WHO has made in
regards to health risks.

272
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,030
And achieving specific levels of
performance.

273
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,100
And, lastly is to strengthen the national

274
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,870
capacity of research institutions, of
laboratories, in

275
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,980
order to enable them to test local
products as well as products in the field.

276
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,660
A number of capacity-building activities
are associated with this scheme.

277
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,020
The first is to train officials in
risk-based assessments.

278
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,770
So this could be related to house water
treatment, but it could be related.

279
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,230
To community water supplies as well and
for them to understand how they

280
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,910
can address these risks and manage these

281
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,510
risks to provide better protection for
health.

282
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,690
The second is I already mentioned is to
strengthen

283
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,589
the national laboratory capacity in terms
of skills and equipment.

284
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,540
The third is to align where possible, with
water quality surveillance efforts.

285
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,260
So we find more and more, there's work
going on to assess

286
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,920
water quality not only at the source, but
also in the household.

287
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,230
Lastly I just wanted to mention that
Ethiopia as

288
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,770
an example of a country that has already
begun.

289
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,500
Applying the WHO recommendations on
household water treatment

290
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,490
and recently they were able to use these
recommendations

291
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,990
to prevent a particular product from being
distributed

292
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,940
because it didn't meet the minimum
standards for WHO.

293
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,840
So we plan to work with more countries
like Ethiopia that are very interested in

294
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,050
improving the way that they assess these
products

295
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,990
and ensuring that those products that are
distributed.

296
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,690
Meet the minimum standards.

297
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:01,720
In summary, I'd like to stress two main
points.

298
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,760
First hopefully by now you've understood
that the assessment

299
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,980
of household water treatment performance
is important for protecting health.

300
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,740
Now, I spoke only about the

301
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,690
microbiological performance of house water
treatment.

302
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,720
The chemical performance of house water
treatment also

303
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,200
is important and is something that WHO
recognizes.

304
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,300
Needs to be addresses, but hasn't been
developed

305
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,850
yet in terms of a set of global
guidelines.

306
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,030
I also want to make sure you leave

307
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,750
by remembering that is equally important
that these

308
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,700
products are used correctly and
consistently by the

309
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,270
groups that are most at risk for
diarrhoeal disease.

310
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:42,080
So young children, people with HIV/AIDS,
those in emergencies

311
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,620
or in cholera outbreaks are just a few
examples.

312
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,660
Secondly, the WHO International Scheme to
Evaluate

313
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,140
household water treatment aims first of
all to

314
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,970
inform and to provide objective
information about

315
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,000
performance but it also hopes to spark
innovation.

316
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,200
And already we're seeing that

317
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,010
manufacturers are trying to develop
technologies

318
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:06,040
that not only are highly protective but
also are low cost.

319
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,850
Easy to use and can be easily distributed

320
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,140
in places where water quality is its
poorest.

321
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,100
And lastly, the scheme aims to build
capacity

322
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,320
so someday in, in the future, we can work

323
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,660
ourselves out of, out of a job, and
governments

324
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,650
themselves can evaluate and regulate
household water treatment technologies.

325
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,070
So would like to thank you for your
attention.

326
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,690
I'd like to point you to some additional
resources and information.

327
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,660
First of all, if you want to read the
performance recommendations

328
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,680
I spoke about, you can find them online at
this web address.

329
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,730
These are the recommendations.

330
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,810
Also if you want to learn more about the
scheme, you can go to

331
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,210
the website that presents all the
information

332
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,610
about the scheme, their related protocols,
the laboratories.

333
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,615
And lastly, if you're just interested in

334
00:19:57,615 --> 00:20:00,148
household water treatment more generally,
I refer you.

335
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:03,060
To the WHO/UNICEF international Network on

336
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,400
Household water treatment and safe
storage.

337
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,500
Which is working on a variety of issues,
to try to make sure household

338
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,430
water treatment, gets to where it's
needed, and used by those most in need.

339
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,080
So thank you.
