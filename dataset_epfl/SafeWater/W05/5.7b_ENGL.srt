00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,152
Hello.

2
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:08,235
Welcome to this module
on Local Treatment Solutions.

3
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:10,107
My name is Juliette Ndounla.

4
00:00:10,107 --> 00:00:12,709
I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Sandec,

5
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:16,474
the Department of Water and Sanitation
in Developing Countries,

6
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:21,022
at the Swiss Federal Institute
for Aquatic Science and Technology.

7
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:27,200
Today I will present a case study
of water quantity and water quality issues

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,371
from Dschang,
a small town in Cameroon,

9
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,162
here in the west region

10
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:38,841
and from some villages
of the Yitenga province

11
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:41,753
in Burkina Faso, around here.

12
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:46,242
As we can notice,

13
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:49,242
in several rural
and pre-rural areas in Africa,

14
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:51,879
as well as in many developing countries,

15
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,382
people face the challenge
of unsafe drinking water

16
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:57,182
for their daily activities.

17
00:00:57,385 --> 00:01:01,879
This water could be collected
from wells, rivers, lakes,

18
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,477
and directly from rainwater.

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,943
River and well water
may be readily available,

20
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:14,845
but polluted with biological
and chemical contaminants,

21
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:17,683
especially during the rainy season,

22
00:01:17,683 --> 00:01:20,424
due to runoff water and floods.

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,509
Considering the water quantity issue,

24
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,000
it can be noticed that water supply

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,812
is not equally distributed
within these countries.

26
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:32,243
In the south,

27
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:37,458
water is usually available
in enough quantity,

28
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,838
particularly in Cameroon,

29
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:42,601
which is situated
near the Equatorial line.

30
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:46,897
However, this water is subject
to high contamination levels,

31
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:49,799
especially during the rainy season,

32
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,756
while the north of both countries

33
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:56,204
is subject to serious water shortages

34
00:01:56,204 --> 00:01:58,354
during the drought,

35
00:01:58,354 --> 00:02:00,661
the [inaudible] of the dry season.

36
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,749
The water quality issue--

37
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:09,351
We noticed the presence
of total coliforms,

38
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:12,855
<i>E. coli</i>, coliforms,
and salmonella bacteria

39
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:17,120
in several drinking water sources
from these countries.

40
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:22,132
The consequence of these is
the serious outbreak

41
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:28,012
of water-related diseases,
such as typhoid, cholera, and dysentery.

42
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:31,594
These were noticed, recorded
in both of these countries,

43
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:36,030
as a consequence
of unsafe drinking water supply.

44
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:39,143
As presented in the previous slide,

45
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:42,476
Dschang is situated in
the western region of Cameroon.

46
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:47,185
In Dschang, water is available
all year long.

47
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:52,134
However, as the water table
is near the surface

48
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:54,347
in [inaudible], in Dschang,

49
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:57,536
the people from such places use,

50
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:02,725
regularly, unimproved wells,
as the one present here,

51
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:07,727
using a car wheel
for the well superstructure.

52
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:14,789
These traditional, unprotected wells
are regularly contaminated

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,475
with air and surface pollution,
and runoff water.

54
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,340
The presence of shoes and leaves

55
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,903
could be noticed in such water,

56
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:36,635
also heavy contamination of bacteria

57
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:40,309
such as salmonella typhi,

58
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:42,209
entamoeba histolytica,

59
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,128
[inaudible],

60
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:48,777
lead to water-related diseases

61
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:53,010
such as typhoid or dysentery.

62
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:59,378
These water-related diseases
and several other gastroenteritis

63
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:04,598
are regularly experienced
by well-users in Dschang.

64
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:10,885
The turbidity of this water is regularly

65
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:16,379
more than 100 NTU,
[inaudible] here.

66
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:21,364
To reduce the health vulnerability
when using water

67
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:23,474
from your unimproved well,

68
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:26,154
the owner uses traditional filters

69
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:29,558
made with locally available materials
such as sheet metal,

70
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:32,910
old nylon sacks,

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,762
old mattresses under
the old nylon sacks, and stones.

72
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:44,162
This homemade filter shown here
reduced the water turbidity

73
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:48,891
to less than 13 NTU,
as it can be observed here.

74
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,773
However, this filter process

75
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:56,427
cannot make this water
completely safe for drinking purposes.

76
00:04:57,153 --> 00:04:58,852
To be safe for drinking,

77
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:03,213
this water will require
additional disinfecting steps,

78
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:07,892
such as solar disinfection
or chlorination.

79
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:14,736
In Burkina Faso, <i>Moringa Oleifera</i>
is used as the local solution

80
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:17,720
for water purification in some villages.

81
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:23,665
<i>Moringa Oleifera</i> is a tropical tree
from which seed can be ground

82
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:26,894
to a powder and used
as a natural coagulant.

83
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:33,081
People from the villages situated
around the Yitenga-Pouytenga dam

84
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:37,508
often use <i>Moringa</i> seed powder
for their drinking water purification,

85
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:40,464
especially to reduce turbidity.

86
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:46,189
The <i>Moringa</i> seed powder process
and efficiencies in water purification

87
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:52,173
has been scientifically
evaluated and recommended.

88
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:57,708
This method is more efficient
than using a homemade filter,

89
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,656
shown in the previous slide,

90
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:03,468
and the steps are simple
and easy to practice.

91
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,374
The purifying principle of clarification

92
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:14,249
not only diminishes
chemical contamination

93
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,335
but also harmful bacteria.

94
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,957
Remaining on local solutions
used by village people,

95
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:24,815
we find also in the Yitenga region

96
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:28,809
that some people
were using aluminum sulfate

97
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:31,142
for their water purification.

98
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:37,021
However, aluminum is expensive,
and if improperly used

99
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:41,673
may be linked to health problems
or environmental pollution.

100
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:47,726
Using <i>Moringa Oleifera</i> instead
to purify water

101
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:51,681
efficiently replaces
such chemical products.

102
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,637
The <i>Moringa</i> process
for water purification--

103
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:59,836
First they begin with the grinding
of dry seed into powder.

104
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:08,016
The powder should be put after
in a small quantity of water,

105
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:12,366
approximately 250 ml,

106
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:17,438
and shaken for approximately
five minutes.

107
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:22,302
Then after, this small quantity
of water is put

108
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:28,608
in the water to be treated,
here it's 20 liters,

109
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,714
and rapidly stirred for two minutes,

110
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:40,021
and after slowly stirred
for 10-15 minutes,

111
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:46,661
before leaving the water undisturbed

112
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,017
for approximately one hour,

113
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:52,937
or until the water is clear,

114
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:56,578
depending on the initial turbidity
of the water.

115
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:00,763
When all the impurities are settled down

116
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:07,844
the water should now be filtered,
and put in a safe container

117
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:13,777
before being drunk
by the family members.

118
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:18,945
The main recommendation
for the <i>Moringa</i> seed dosage

119
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:23,121
is to consider the water source,

120
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:28,214
as water from marine sources will need
a different amount of <i>Moringa</i> powder

121
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:33,994
because the impurities present
will not be the same.

122
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:37,087
It's also recommended
to make a jar test

123
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:42,662
to help in evaluating the correct amount
of the powder needed.

124
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,239
However, this table provides
the general guidelines for the dosage.

125
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:56,066
In the presence of low turbidity,
less than 50 NTU,

126
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:02,782
the recommendation is to use
one seed per four liters,

127
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:06,899
and in the presence of extreme turbidity,

128
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:10,485
more than 250 NTU,

129
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:15,213
you would need two seeds
per liter of water.

130
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:19,584
Like many other water treatment processes,

131
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:24,074
the use of <i>Moringa Oleifera</i> seed powder
in water treatment

132
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:26,463
also has some limitations.

133
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:29,065
It could lead to secondary infection

134
00:09:29,065 --> 00:09:34,173
if the process of shaking or stirring
is not well handled.

135
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:37,692
This process of shaking and handling
should be followed closely

136
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:40,528
to activate the coagulant properties,

137
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:43,997
because if the flocculation process
takes too long

138
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:48,140
there is a risk
of secondary bacteria growth

139
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,326
during the flocculation.

140
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:55,844
The treated water
could also face recontamination

141
00:09:55,844 --> 00:10:00,413
if the settling process
is not well handled.

142
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:04,461
It should be noticed that the sediment
at the bottom of the water,

143
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:07,686
after settling,
contains some impurities.

144
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:13,307
so care must be taken to use
only the clear water on the top,

145
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:15,930
and not allow the sediment

146
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,496
to recontaminate the clear water
after the treatment.

147
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:27,779
We should also consider that <i>Moringa</i>
does not provide residual disinfection,

148
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,390
so there is a possibility
of recontaminating the water

149
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,928
through contact with hands
during the transfer

150
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,093
of the treated water in a safe container.

151
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:45,598
Care should be taken during this transfer.

152
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:50,402
Finally, we should notice that

153
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:55,149
the <i>Moringa</i> treatment
[cannot be] 100% effective in removing

154
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:59,742
of pathogens in the water
during its treatment.

155
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:06,374
It's important to consider combining
this natural coagulant process

156
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,241
with additional steps
of water disinfection.

157
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:14,025
In conclusion,
recall that local populations

158
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:18,180
in developing countries struggle
to handle their safe water production.

159
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:23,391
They may even need to use
local available materials for filtering,

160
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,245
as we've seen in Cameroon,

161
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:29,486
or use <i>Moringa</i> seed powder
in water purification,

162
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:32,004
as we saw in Burkina Faso.

163
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:37,280
However, they still need training
and recommendation,

164
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,895
in both cases, for safe and sustainable
household water treatment.

165
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:49,107
This water, treated at the household level
for drinking purposes,

166
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:53,841
still needs additional disinfecting
treatment, as we saw previously.

167
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:59,326
Some of those steps will be
solar disinfection or chlorination.

168
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:02,562
Additional information
on <i>Moringa</i> process details

169
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:06,203
for water purification can be found
at the links below.

170
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:09,568
However, if there are still
some questions and queries

171
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:12,845
about one of the case studies
presented here,

172
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:15,249
[inaudible],
just let us know

173
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:18,134
through a question in the course's forum,

174
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:22,282
and it will be a pleasure for us
to answer it.

175
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,835
Thank you for following us.
