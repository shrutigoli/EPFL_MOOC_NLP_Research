00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:07,994
This week we've explored monitoring
and evaluation of HWTS

2
00:00:07,994 --> 00:00:09,633
from a variety of angles,

3
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:11,663
from the validation
of specific technologies

4
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:15,286
to understanding why effective
and consistent use of HWTS

5
00:00:15,286 --> 00:00:17,699
is important for achieving
health improvements.

6
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:19,940
We've also examined how to choose

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,419
among the many treatment
and storage approaches,

8
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:25,052
especially in terms of cost-effectiveness.

9
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:28,303
During this module we'll look
at how some of these important issues

10
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:32,575
are being confronted within
a rural water supply program in Nepal.

11
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,232
In this case study you'll see how
drinking water quality goals were defined,

12
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:39,770
how water quality data was collected
in remote communities

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,471
with very limited resources, and finally,

14
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:45,615
how this information is being used
to choose an effective and viable

15
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:47,860
water treatment and storage strategy.

16
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:50,115
The Water Supply Treatment group
here in Sandek aims

17
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:52,515
to merge research
with development cooperation

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,950
to improve the lives of people
in the global South

19
00:00:55,243 --> 00:00:57,551
so our objectives are really twofold:

20
00:00:57,551 --> 00:00:59,771
we plan and implement
water supply projects

21
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:02,596
in cooperation
with our partner organizations,

22
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,457
and we also conduct systematic research
and share our study results

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,902
at conferences and also
in peer-reviewed publications.

24
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:12,003
(water splashing)

25
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:13,835
We learned about

26
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:18,039
the Helvetas Swiss intercooperation
Water Resource Management project,

27
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,167
or WARM, in Nepal.

28
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,070
For many years now, Helvetas
has been working throughout Nepal

29
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,835
to identify water resources

30
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:28,566
and foster effective, equitable
and efficient use at the local level.

31
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:32,891
This is mainly done
through a participatory process

32
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:35,016
which leads to a Master plan

33
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:38,746
and this plan is then adopted and owned
by the community members themselves.

34
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:41,991
In the WARM project
there's a specific goal

35
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:46,037
to integrate household water treatment
and safe storage, or HWTS

36
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:49,644
to improve the health and hygiene
of people living within the program area.

37
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:52,050
To ensure sustainability of the project,

38
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,282
promotion and implementation
of HWTS will harness local markets,

39
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,694
and also focus on meeting
household demand for these products.

40
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:03,166
So now, Helvetas
and Sandek are working together

41
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,397
to conduct a study across the program area
to better understand

42
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:09,880
what sort of treatment strategy
can work well in this setting.

43
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,735
Overall, the main objective of the study
is to devise one or more

44
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:16,404
effective water treatment
and safe storage solutions

45
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,082
for the WARM project area.

46
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,072
This includes assessing
drinking water quality at taps

47
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:23,377
and in storage containers within homes.

48
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,206
Often, in communities
where households are extremely remote

49
00:02:26,206 --> 00:02:28,937
and where data on water quality
is quite lacking.

50
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:31,549
Water quality information was needed

51
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:34,879
to understand the extent
to which treatment was required,

52
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,704
and also to assess the impact
of possible water treatment intervention.

53
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,306
We also needed to understand
behavioral aspects

54
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:45,124
of household water management,
such as individuals' perceptions

55
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,376
about the quality
of their drinking water source

56
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,267
and also whether households are currently

57
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:51,872
using any treatment
or safe storage practices.

58
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,665
Finally, since Helvetas is focused
on a market-driven approach

59
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:57,523
to implementing HWTS,

60
00:02:57,523 --> 00:03:00,359
we undertook a survey
of local market conditions

61
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,729
as well as customers' priorities
for future investments,

62
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:06,588
and their willingness to pay
for water treatment technologies.

63
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:11,351
A researcher is not
a businessperson, indeed.

64
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:13,073
We also have to keep in mind

65
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:15,387
that at certain times
and in certain contexts,

66
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:17,026
there could be alternatives

67
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:20,046
that are more suitable
than market-based interventions.

68
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:26,064
Let us recall that our ultimate objective
is the general health of the population.

69
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:32,277
Are we replacing the role of government
by placing priority on what sells?

70
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:36,343
In which context should one leave
the provision of safe water

71
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:40,263
to the government, with water quality
as a subject of consumer protection?

72
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:44,686
So what does this study
look like on the ground?

73
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:49,087
Mostly it's a lot of time spent
collecting and processing water samples,

74
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:51,880
sometimes under very
challenging conditions.

75
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,026
We aim that a testing procedure
that meets the WHO guidelines,

76
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:57,992
suits the field conditions,

77
00:03:57,992 --> 00:04:00,884
and keeps costs for consumables
at a reasonable level.

78
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,643
The membrane filtration method
performed best,

79
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:06,379
but other quantitative methods

80
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,012
like the Multi-Tube
or Most Probable Number method

81
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:11,479
are still several times more expensive.

82
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:16,687
I think we have two challenges
here in the Chinese domain

83
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:19,576
From my side, first is the electricity

84
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:24,207
because in the case of remote Nepal
you don't have sufficient electricity.

85
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:27,184
If you conduct this kind of analysis,

86
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:32,476
you have to make sure you have
24 hour electricity for your incubator.

87
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:36,822
The second one is the study area,
because in the case of Nepal,

88
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:41,861
you have hilly mountains, or sometimes
you have to walk maybe two, three hours

89
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:46,940
to reach the area, so that one is
the most challenging for me.

90
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:51,788
It was necessary to build an incubator
for the compact dry plates

91
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:56,869
using a solar voltaic array, and also
using special lightweight materials

92
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:59,846
so that the incubator
could be carried to communities

93
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,842
across this mountainous terrain.

94
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:03,563
For the behavior study,

95
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:06,112
we held in-person interviews
with hundreds of people

96
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:07,846
to understand more about their daily life

97
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:09,643
and their needs regarding water.

98
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:12,830
We asked questions about
their main priorities and concerns,

99
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,822
because sometimes,
as water researchers, it's easy to forget

100
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:19,797
that there's more to worry about
than a clean drinking water supply.

101
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:23,977
There's also employment, access
to health care, electricity, food security

102
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:25,324
and the list goes on.

103
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,339
So the survey also looked closely

104
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:30,099
at how people perceive
the quality of their own water,

105
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:31,836
whether they believed it presented

106
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:34,439
a health risk to them
and to their families,

107
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,751
and also how they treated
their water supply currently, if at all.

108
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:43,344
All of this information is important
for planning a viable HWTS strategy

109
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,404
because if demand
for a treatment product is very low,

110
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:47,714
it can't really be expected

111
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,408
that people will be willing
to change their behavior

112
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:53,054
and treat their own
drinking water consistently.

113
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:59,889
We can learn from people's demand
for similar products, services or proxies;

114
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,599
their consumer preferences,

115
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:04,778
and their general approach
to health issues and other risks.

116
00:06:05,678 --> 00:06:08,899
Why don't they currently
treat their water?

117
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,111
We tried to find out

118
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:13,491
whether they simply dislike the products
currently available on the market,

119
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:16,478
or they just do not perceive
their water as risky.

120
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,861
How many times does one
have to suffer from diarrhea

121
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:25,103
before he or she starts boiling
or filtering their water

122
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:26,803
several times a day?

123
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:30,892
To investigate the contextual factors,

124
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:33,650
we interviewed doctors,
pharmacists, merchants,

125
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,772
NGO and government representatives,

126
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:38,536
and also consumers,
like patients and households.

127
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:41,808
We combined these interviews
with structured observations

128
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:46,315
and data from health institutions
and markets to understand the low priority

129
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:50,458
that most households currently place
on preventing diarrhea.

130
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:54,435
Pharmaceuticals are often
available at no cost.

131
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:56,942
People seem to prefer using them
for severe sicknesses

132
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:59,961
while overlooking
minor digestive disorders

133
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,766
and preventative options.

134
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:06,485
Yet, exposure to pathogens also has
long term effects like stunting,

135
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:08,897
and can generally impair
the immune system.

136
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:12,076
This is a connection
that most households do not seem to make,

137
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:15,420
and we can observe a similar attitude
among Western city dwellers

138
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,368
suffering from smoke, but choosing
not to wear protective masks

139
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:21,233
despite the known health hazards.

140
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,829
The results from our study
are still coming out,

141
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:27,529
but already we're seeing
a very interesting story.

142
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:31,032
We know that in many cases,
the water at the point of collection

143
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:33,951
is relatively free of fecal contamination

144
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:38,261
but on the other hand, some taps have
very high concentrations of <i>E. coli</i>

145
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:41,989
and this presents a real
health risk to the local community.

146
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:44,360
This heterogeneity in quality is important

147
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,348
because nearly all
of the water points visited

148
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:51,948
are classified as an improved water source
according to the definition used

149
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:54,903
by the Millenium Development goals.

150
00:07:54,903 --> 00:08:00,268
Yet, we see that this categorization is
not enough to reliably ensure

151
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:02,856
a safe drinking water
source in this setting.

152
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,540
We're also learning that households

153
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,646
generally do not practice water treatment
or safe storage consistently.

154
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,221
Most households perceive
their water source to be relatively clean

155
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:16,718
and the risk to health
to be relatively low,

156
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:18,136
so really, it makes sense

157
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:20,786
that they're not motivated
to treat their own water.

158
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,115
The market study has also revealed

159
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:26,949
that despite the availability
of many HWTS products locally,

160
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,363
they are not actually
prioritized by households

161
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:32,732
when they consider the many other things
that they could spend their money on

162
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:35,596
such as food, housing, soap and toilets.

163
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:39,062
All of these items were typically
a higher priority investment

164
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:41,083
among survey respondents.

165
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,017
In the next phase of this study
we'll work closely with Helvetas

166
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:54,066
to develop a strategy for improving
household water quality

167
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,925
based on the results
from this baseline evaluation.

168
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,966
It's clear that a market-driven approach
will need to confront many issues,

169
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:05,503
including highly variable water quality
at the point of collection,

170
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:10,838
also relatively low demand
for HWTS products among water users.

171
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:14,694
So, possible strategies could include
an information campaign

172
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:17,162
to raise awareness among water users,

173
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:22,912
or maybe testing innovative technologies
like passive chlorination at the tap,

174
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:26,035
possibly even promotion
of a really aspirational product

175
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:29,341
of some kind, which households
might value more.

176
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,134
Finding a sustainable solution
really requires constant dialogue

177
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:34,708
with our partners, and especially,

178
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,696
the potential customers
who will be using these products.

179
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:39,305
Our team is really excited to see

180
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:41,891
how this project will unfold
going forward.
