1
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:07,528
I'm happy to introduce
our guest lecturer, Dr. Batsi Majuru,

2
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:10,401
a technical officer
at the World Health Organization.

3
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:13,634
Today she'll introduce
the International Scheme to Evaluate

4
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:17,588
Household Water Treatment Technologies
which aims to promote and coordinate

5
00:00:17,588 --> 00:00:20,618
independent testing
of household water treatment products

6
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:22,721
based on WHO performance criteria,

7
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:26,412
and also to support governments
in building technical capacity.

8
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:29,159
Hi, I'm Batsi Majuru.

9
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,845
I work with Dr. Maggie Montgomery
on the international scheme

10
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:35,383
to evaluate household water
treatment technologies.

11
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:39,379
I'm going to be sharing
more about this scheme in this session.

12
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:43,623
We're going to take a brief look
at how the scheme works

13
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:47,763
and who is involved,
and we're also going to be talking

14
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:52,364
about what the scheme is doing
beyond lab testing of products â€”

15
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:54,144
the capacity-building activities

16
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:56,332
that are being conducted
in various countries.

17
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,587
The scheme is made up
of several components.

18
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,310
WHO acts as the scheme secretariat

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,030
and coordinates all activities
under the scheme.

20
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:11,961
The scheme works together
with an independent advisory committee

21
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:15,732
of experts in water microbiology,
environmental science,

22
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:19,296
and epidemiology who provide
advice on test protocols

23
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:23,694
and processes and recommendations
on the level of performance.

24
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:27,795
There are currently
two designated testing labs

25
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:30,923
that are in the United States
and in the Netherlands.

26
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:34,393
Work is ongoing to expand testing
to other national labs

27
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:36,393
to conduct complimentary testing.

28
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:38,402
We will discuss this briefly later.

29
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:42,456
The manufacturers are 
a key component of the scheme,

30
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:45,845
as they are the ones who submit
the products that are to be tested.

31
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:51,551
Their interaction is
only through the scheme secretariat

32
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:55,801
at WHO to ensure independence
throughout the evaluation process.

33
00:01:57,655 --> 00:02:01,761
Ultimately, the results from the testing
are meant to guide governments

34
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:05,681
and procuring entities in the selection
of household water treatment products.

35
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:12,899
Last, but certainly not least,
are the users of the products.

36
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,360
In terms of how the scheme evaluation process works,

37
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:22,635
manufacturers submit
an expression of interest

38
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:29,040
for the evaluation of a specific product,
or in some instances, several products.

39
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,828
This information is then reviewed
by WHO and the advisory committee

40
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:37,108
and recommendations are made
on the testing to be conducted.

41
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,868
The product is then tested at one
of the two designated testing laboratories.

42
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,048
The results from the testing
are shared with the manufacturer

43
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:49,918
and also made publicly available
at the scheme webpage.

44
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:55,132
Ultimately, these results
are meant to guide procuring entities

45
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:58,804
and governments in the selection
of household water treatment products.

46
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:03,274
So this hopefully gives you a flavor
of how testing under the scheme works.

47
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:06,828
In the following slides, 
we're going to talk

48
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:10,415
about what the scheme is doing
beyond lab testing.

49
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:13,568
WHO is also working 
to strengthen the capacity

50
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,118
of resource-constrained countries
to regulate and evaluate

51
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:20,076
household water treatment products
to ensure that users

52
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:23,624
are provided with products
that actually protect health.

53
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:28,406
Many countries do not have
health-based standards

54
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:31,157
to assess and regulate
household water treatment products,

55
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:34,547
and those that do often do not have
the structures in place

56
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,168
to allow for an independent review
and assessment process.

57
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:43,502
Therefore, WHO is working to strengthen
regulation of these products

58
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:48,383
and as an example, 
countries such as Ethiopia,

59
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:52,924
are working to provide training
on risk-based assessments,

60
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:57,959
establish certification processes,
and develop protocols for evaluation

61
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,221
of household water treatment technologies.

62
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:04,894
This would enable national labs
to conduct their own complimentary testing.

63
00:04:05,565 --> 00:04:09,316
The second area of capacity-building
under the scheme is

64
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:13,678
assessing locally produced products,
such as ceramic filters,

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,423
chlorine solutions,
and bio sand filters.

66
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:20,010
The quality of these products
is highly variable,

67
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,586
and harmonized manufacturing processes

68
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:26,094
can have a positive impact
on improving the quality.

69
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:29,527
The scheme is working with partners
in the international network

70
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:31,436
on household water treatment
and safe storage

71
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:35,916
to strengthen quality assurance
and quality control procedures

72
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,240
in these local manufacturing factories.

73
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:41,486
An example of such quality
management processes

74
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:44,121
is the Best Practices Recommendations
for the Manufacturing

75
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:46,637
of Ceramic Pot Filters that was developed

76
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:48,961
by the Ceramics 
Manufacturing Working Group.

77
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:52,971
This is a certification process
that is currently being finalized

78
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:55,292
and has been piloted in several countries.

79
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,886
The certification process
focuses on the efficacy of the filter

80
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:04,088
in removing E. coli and an assessment
of the manufacturing processes

81
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:07,655
at factories, including 
raw materials that are used,

82
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:11,646
mixing and molding processes,
and quality assurance tests

83
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:13,398
such as flow rate.

84
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,559
The scheme is working with
the Ceramics Manufacturing Working Group

85
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:19,690
to expand the application
of this certification process

86
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,994
to other countries.

87
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:25,141
Here is an example 
of some of the findings from assessments

88
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:29,530
that have been conducted
under this ceramics certification process

89
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,877
from four factories.

90
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:34,977
You can see from these pictures
that the filters

91
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:40,063
from factories two and three
are of poor quality

92
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:43,296
compared to those
from factories one and four.

93
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:46,597
The third and final area
of capacity-building

94
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:50,400
is field-monitoring the evaluation
of household water treatment products.

95
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:53,015
Testing under the scheme

96
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:58,010
is limited to lab performance or efficacy.

97
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:03,450
However, to protect health,
products not only need to be effective

98
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,502
in removing pathogens or be efficacious

99
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:10,582
but also be used correctly
and consistently over time.

100
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:14,438
The scheme is working with countries
to assess ongoing performance

101
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:17,632
in the field and use of products

102
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:19,574
as well as establish platforms

103
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:22,753
for national consumer feedback
on these products.

104
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:26,840
I hope that has given you a flavor
of what the scheme is doing,

105
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,821
both in terms of evaluating products
and building capacity in countries.

106
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,545
If you would like to find out more
about the scheme,

107
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:36,921
you can visit our website
where you will be able

108
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:40,145
to see the list of products
that are currently under evaluation,

109
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:43,927
the harmonized test protocols
that we use in testing the products,

110
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:47,895
and the work that we are doing
to build capacity in countries.

111
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:52,651
In summary, we have talked 
about testing under this scheme,

112
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:55,121
how it works and who is involved.

113
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,222
The main point to remember
is that this testing is aimed

114
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:03,063
at ensuring that in the first instance,
products are selected

115
00:07:03,063 --> 00:07:06,127
that are actually capable
of removing or inactivating

116
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:10,387
pathogens in drinking water,
but we also recognize

117
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:13,617
that health impact can only be achieved

118
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:16,979
through correct and consistent use
of effective products.

119
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:22,516
Linked to this effort is capacity-building
that WHO is doing to ensure

120
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:25,767
that in the places where the products
will be used most, there are

121
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:29,947
regulations in place and mechanisms
to assess and monitor

122
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:33,717
the performance of products 
over time. Thank you.
