1
00:00:04,894 --> 00:00:08,065
So, welcome!
I'm Maggie Montgomery

2
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:09,983
from the World Health Organization

3
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:13,625
and here today to talk about 
the evaluation and validation

4
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,601
of household water treatment technologies.

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:18,646
So I want to thank Dr. Johnston 
for inviting me,

6
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:20,630
and let's get started.

7
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,704
So there are going to be 
three main things

8
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:24,928
I would like to talk to you about today.

9
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:27,853
The first is why is it important 
to assess the performance

10
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:29,475
of household water treatment.

11
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:31,556
And I will talk just briefly about the fact

12
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:34,816
that for household water treatment 
the main benefit is health,

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,115
so it's important that we know

14
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:39,973
how well household water treatment 
technologies remove pathogens,

15
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,764
so we have some indication 
of the protection of health.

16
00:00:44,123 --> 00:00:47,018
And secondly, I will talk 
about the WHO global standards

17
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:49,437
on the performance 
of household water treatment

18
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:52,181
and give a bit of background about 
how they were developed,

19
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,338
and lastly, I will talk about 
what WHO is doing

20
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,096
to implement these standards,

21
00:00:57,096 --> 00:01:01,019
specifically discuss 
the WHO international scheme

22
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,592
to evaluate household 
water treatment technologies.

23
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:08,148
There are two main reasons 
why it's important

24
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:11,902
to assess the performance 
of household water treatment technologies.

25
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,386
The first is to understand

26
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:19,483
if these technologies are achieving 
the objective of improving health,

27
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:23,010
which requires, first of all, 
that they remove the pathogens

28
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,800
that are causing the diarrheal disease 
in a specific population.

29
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,483
In some cases we know specifically 
which pathogens are causing the disease,

30
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:35,305
for example, in a cholera outbreak 
it's very well known

31
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:40,076
that it's the bacterium <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>
that is causing the diarrheal disease.

32
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:43,935
But in other cases, for example, 
people living with HIV/AIDS

33
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:46,422
who are much more susceptible 
to diarrheal disease,

34
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:49,915
it could be a suite of pathogens 
that are causing this disease,

35
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:54,988
and in all cases it's important 
that the devices that are being used

36
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:57,141
with these specific populations

37
00:01:57,141 --> 00:02:00,845
are removing the pathogens 
we are most concerned about,

38
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:03,625
and if we don't know exactly 
which pathogens those are,

39
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,640
it's prudent to make sure

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,372
that these devices 
remove a suite of pathogens.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,505
The second reason why assessing

42
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,721
household water treatment 
performance is important,

43
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,835
is that governments, especially,

44
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,835
as well as the implementers 
and funders need to know

45
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:21,562
that the devices 
that they are investing in

46
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:24,722
are achieving the aims 
that they are set out to achieve,

47
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:28,470
and this requires a rigorous evaluation 
of household water treatment.

48
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:32,022
In many countries where 
household water treatment is most needed,

49
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:34,274
i. e., where the water quality is poor

50
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:36,150
and the diarrheal disease burden is high,

51
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:38,880
governments don't have 
the resources nor the capacity

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,896
to do such evaluations.

53
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:43,835
And lastly, I just wanted to emphasize

54
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:47,525
that while today's talk is going to be
focused on the performance

55
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:50,799
realizing health benefits 
from household water treatment

56
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:54,816
also requires that users 
correctly and consistently

57
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:56,547
use household water treatment

58
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:58,874
when their water quality is compromised.

59
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,540
So, in order to facilitate the evaluation 
of household water treatment

60
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:09,134
WHO came out with global recommendations 
on how to assess performance.

61
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,906
Now these global recommendations,

62
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:14,482
the goal is to protect 
the health of the users

63
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:19,084
and also to ensure that more 
household water treatment products

64
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:21,940
that achieve a minimum 
performance standards

65
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,313
are being distributed and used 
to those who most need safe water.

66
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,870
Specifically the recommendations 
look at three main classes of pathogens

67
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,658
and used three classes of pathogens --

68
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:35,538
I know you've already talked about 
with Dr. Johnston,

69
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:38,085
and hopefully 
you understand well at this point,

70
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:42,055
but these are the three main classes 
that cause diarrheal disease in humans,

71
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,003
and they are viruses, 
bacteria and protozoa.

72
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:50,462
From these three classes of pathogens 
we derive targets,

73
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:53,605
and what I mean by targets we derived,

74
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:56,952
what are the minimum amounts of removal 
that need to be achieved

75
00:03:56,952 --> 00:04:02,181
in order to achieve a certain 
minimum amount of risk in a population.

76
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:06,984
Now, these targets were derived
based on what has already been done

77
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:10,328
in the WHO guidelines 
for drinking water quality

78
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:12,741
And these guidelines used, 
what is called,

79
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:15,569
quantitative microbial risk assessment.

80
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:18,199
So quantitative microbial risk assessment

81
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,103
are basically models 
that allow us to predict

82
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:24,366
what will be the health consequences 
in a population

83
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:30,276
if they ingest a certain concentration 
of pathogens with a certain frequency.

84
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:35,693
So for these models 
we had to pick specific pathogens

85
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:40,218
within each of these classes 
of viruses, bacteria and protozoa

86
00:04:40,218 --> 00:04:42,163
to come up with an estimate.

87
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:44,969
From that estimate we also decided

88
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:48,064
what was the minimum amount of risk
we were willing to accept,

89
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:50,413
and I'll talk about that 
in the next slide

90
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:54,196
that allowed us to then 
develop our removal targets.

91
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,314
We also use a tiered approach,

92
00:04:57,315 --> 00:05:00,284
so rather than studying one very high bar

93
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:02,030
for household water treatment

94
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,511
we recognized that even devices

95
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,171
that maybe are not the best,

96
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:10,902
but do provide some protection, 
and even limited protection

97
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:14,864
can have a very significant 
impact in populations

98
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:18,166
where the concentrations 
of pathogens are very high

99
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,196
and the disease burden is very high.

100
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:23,895
So this tiered approach was done 
to acknowledge the fact

101
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:28,073
that even lesser performing devices 
can still have a health impact.

102
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:31,555
It was also created because we recognize,
in some situations

103
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:34,717
it's just simply not economically feasible

104
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:38,181
to have the very top device, and cheaper,

105
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:44,241
and perhaps less protective devices 
can still have an important impact.

106
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:48,321
Lastly, the recommendations 
provide some information

107
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,267
on laboratory protocols

108
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:54,132
or how you would actually 
go about doing experiments

109
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:56,203
to test the performance

110
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:58,756
of these household 
water treatment devices.

111
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,767
Before I present the performance standards

112
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:06,602
I want just briefly highlight 
what log removal is

113
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:08,662
and what it actually means 
when we're talking

114
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,897
about concentrations of pathogens.

115
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:14,487
So let's say, for example, 
we start with 100 cryptosporidium

116
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:17,027
before we put the water 
through a filter.

117
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:19,036
We put the water through the filter,

118
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:22,454
and after filtering 
we have 10 cryptosporidium.

119
00:06:22,454 --> 00:06:27,195
That means we removed 90 cryptosporidium.
Pretty simple math.

120
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:29,753
We can equate that to a percentage,

121
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:31,967
and we say we have 90% removal,

122
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,706
and that is equivalent to 1-log removal.

123
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:41,429
Let's say with that same source water,
we still have 100 cryptosporidium,

124
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,857
but after filtering -- 
we use a better filter,

125
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,858
more highly performing filter --

126
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:49,656
we only have 1 cryptosporidium 
remaining in the water

127
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:51,074
after it has been filtered.

128
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:53,844
This means we've removed 
99 cryptosporidium,

129
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:57,246
or achieved a 2-log removal.

130
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:02,612
Assessing performance: 
based on the quantitative

131
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:05,606
microbial risk models 
I spoke of earlier

132
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:08,858
we were able to develop 
specific reduction targets

133
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:10,904
for each of the three classes of pathogens

134
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:13,431
based on allowable risk.

135
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:18,896
Now the most stringent requirements 
were the category

136
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,257
where we're allowing least
amount of risk in a population,

137
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:25,585
specifically 10 to the negative 6 
DALYs per person per year

138
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:27,785
is the highly protective category.

139
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,819
Now, in this category 
devices must achieve

140
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,242
at least 4-log removal of bacteria,

141
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,224
at least 5-log removal of viruses

142
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,520
and at least 4-log removal of protozoa.

143
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,821
Now, you noticed that for the viruses 
the log reduction is even greater,

144
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:50,479
because we know viruses are more likely 
to cause infection and disease

145
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,719
with is a single virus,
compared to the other pathogens.

146
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:58,598
Now, for the protective category 
we are allowing

147
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:02,761
a slightly less conservative risk 
in the population,

148
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:08,109
it's 10 th the negative 4
DALYs and consequently the log removal

149
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:10,410
does not have to be quite as high,

150
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:14,570
at least 2 for bacteria, 
at least 3 for viruses

151
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,858
and at least 2 for protozoa.

152
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:21,335
The final category, limited protection,

153
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:25,813
are actually technologies 
that achieve at least 2 of the targets

154
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:28,852
for the classes 
of pathogens in protective.

155
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:31,848
Now these may be technologies 
that do really well

156
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:33,909
for two of the classes, 
but not on the third.

157
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:38,800
And in populations where we are 
very sure of the main pathogen

158
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,381
that's causing disease

159
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:42,735
they could be a very effective option.

160
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:49,443
Now, for each of these classes 
of bacteria, viruses and protozoa

161
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:53,701
we had to choose one specific organism 
to represent the class as a whole

162
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,013
in order to develop the models

163
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:57,485
and come up 
with the specific log reductions,

164
00:08:57,712 --> 00:09:01,841
so we chose pathogens that we know 
in human populations

165
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:05,893
do account for a significant proportion 
of diarrheal disease.

166
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:10,625
And bacteria, specifically, 
it's campylobacter, viruses rotavirus,

167
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,265
and protozoa was cryptosporidium.

168
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,493
Now, what are examples of technologies

169
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:18,217
that are already been used in the field

170
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:20,479
and have been tested 
quite rigorously in the lab

171
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:23,032
that meet these performance standards?

172
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,857
For highly protective,
the number one technology,

173
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,845
or actually its' a method, is boiling.

174
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:31,332
This is by far the oldest method we have,

175
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:34,404
and it's very efficacious in the removal,

176
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:37,500
but the problem with boiling 
is recontamination

177
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,849
so that's an important issue to consider.

178
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:43,578
Ultra filters, I know, 
you've just learned about filtration,

179
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:47,667
are also very efficacious, 
as well as a combination of approaches,

180
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,705
so you may do filtering 
followed by chlorination

181
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:54,407
in order to achieve 
a higher level of protection.

182
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:57,996
In the middle category 
we have membrane filters,

183
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:01,128
as well as many flocculant disinfectants.

184
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:04,332
And lastly, in the limited 
protection category,

185
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:07,332
some examples include chlorine,

186
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:11,552
which, we know, is very effective 
against bacteria, especially cholera,

187
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:16,816
but fairly ineffective against protozoa, 
especially cryptosporidium.

188
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:20,231
Ceramic filters and some biosand filters

189
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:23,860
also fall into this 
limited protection category.

190
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,988
Now, you may wonder why did we have 
three levels of performance.

191
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,777
Well, there are two main reasons.

192
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:32,682
First of all, we know, in populations

193
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,462
where there is a high burden 
of diarrheal disease

194
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:38,934
and a high load of fecal contamination 
in the environment

195
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:40,850
and therefore in the drinking water,

196
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,387
even devices that achieve the protective 
or limited protection level

197
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:47,807
could have a significant impact on health.

198
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:50,840
We also know that in many of these areas

199
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,936
economics and costs are huge barrier,

200
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:58,286
and sometimes 
the highly protective devices

201
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:00,409
may also be cost prohibitive.

202
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,501
So we don't want to prevent other, 
maybe lesser performing,

203
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:06,638
but still having some protection devices,

204
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:09,993
such as protective and limited protection
from reaching those populations.

205
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:14,055
Nuts and Bolts of Testing.

206
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:17,191
So how how do we actually 
test these devices

207
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,252
or what kind of water do we use

208
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:23,571
to see that we are actually achieving 
a certain level of performance?

209
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,569
Well, we want to really mimic 
the types of waters

210
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,462
that we find in environments 
and communities

211
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:29,845
that would uses these devices.

212
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:33,718
So, in order to do this 
we've developed two types of waters.

213
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:35,905
The first is a general test water.

214
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:39,381
Now, this is water that represents 
high quality groundwater

215
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:42,591
or rainwater and will have 
a very low turbidity

216
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:45,725
so there's not a lot
of particulates in the water,

217
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,340
and a temperature 
that is fairly consistent

218
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,207
with the ambient temperature.

219
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,969
It is the non-stressed phase of testing,

220
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:56,570
so it's not technology specific.

221
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:00,899
We also, though, want to see 
how these devices will perform

222
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,376
when we have really turbid 
or contaminated water,

223
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:06,731
like this river you see here in Lao.

224
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:09,467
Many people are still using surface water

225
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:12,804
and this challenge water
is supposed to represent

226
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:15,492
such surface waters 
like rivers or ponds

227
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:18,407
so that turbidity is very high,

228
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:20,821
as well as the TOC.

229
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:25,163
Now, this is a stressed phase 
or challenge phase of testing

230
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,018
and depending on the different product

231
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:31,157
we may vary the conditions, 
as different products

232
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:33,897
will fail under different conditions

233
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:37,753
depending on whether or not 
it's a filter or a chemical additive,

234
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:39,792
or some combination of approaches.

235
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:43,740
We've talked about 
why it's important to assess

236
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,617
the performance 
of household water treatment,

237
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:47,847
and we also talked 
about recommendations

238
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:50,569
on performance 
of household water treatment.

239
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,399
The third thing I want to talk about 
is the WHO scheme

240
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,970
to evaluate household 
water treatment technologies,

241
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,654
which is specifically how WHO 
and governments are working

242
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:03,787
to implement these recommendations.

243
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:06,589
There are two main objectives 
to this scheme.

244
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,839
The first is to promote and coordinate

245
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:11,435
the independent testing and evaluation

246
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:15,771
of household water treatment products 
based on the WHO criteria.

247
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,205
Now, I would like to stress 
the word "independent"

248
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:21,527
because often we find that laboratories,

249
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:25,258
especially in particular countries 
do not have the ability

250
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:29,826
to provide independent 
and objective evaluations.

251
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:33,158
The second is to support 
of national governments

252
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:36,455
in building the technical capacity 
of research institutions.

253
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:40,788
So improve the ability for governments 
to assess local products,

254
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:42,951
to do complementary testing

255
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:45,674
in the field of household 
water treatment products,

256
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,909
especially after they've been in use 
for some time.

257
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,534
And this is all linked 
to WHO's greater work

258
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:54,516
in water quality on applying 
the WHO guidelines

259
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:56,385
on drinking water quality.

260
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,466
In summary, I would like 
to stress two main points.

261
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,922
First, hopefully by now
you've understood that the assessment

262
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:04,922
of household water treatment performance

263
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:06,891
is important for protecting health.

264
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:10,635
Now, I spoke only about 
the microbiological performance

265
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,205
of household water treatment.

266
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:14,454
The chemical performance 
of household water treatment

267
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:19,404
also is important and is something
that WHO recognizes needs to be addressed

268
00:14:19,404 --> 00:14:20,757
but has not been developed yet

269
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,423
in terms of a set of global guidelines.

270
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,082
I also want to make sure 
you leave by remembering

271
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:28,877
that it's equally important

272
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:31,978
that these products are used 
correctly and consistently

273
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:35,571
by the groups that are most 
at risk for diarrheal disease,

274
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:40,014
so young children, people with HIV/AIDS, 
those in emergencies

275
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:42,795
or in cholera outbreaks 
are just a few examples.

276
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:48,944
Secondly, the WHO international scheme 
to evaluate household water treatment

277
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:51,101
aims, first of all, to inform

278
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:53,899
and to provide objective information
about performance.

279
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:56,203
But it also hopes to spark innovation,

280
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:57,483
and already we're seeing

281
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:00,140
that manufacturers are trying 
to develop technologies

282
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,627
that not only are highly protective,

283
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:05,361
but also are low cost, easy to use

284
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:08,761
and can be easily distributed in places

285
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:11,747
where water quality is at its poorest.

286
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,012
And lastly, the scheme aims 
to build capacity,

287
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:20,102
so some day in the future 
we can work ourselves out of the job,

288
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:21,776
and governments themselves

289
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:24,805
can evaluate and regulate 
household water treatment technologies.

290
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:28,916
So I would like to thank you 
for your attention.

291
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:33,579
I would like to point you to some 
additional resources and information.

292
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,682
First of all, if you want to read

293
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:37,842
the performance recommendations 
I spoke about,

294
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,745
you can find them online 
at this web address.

295
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,813
These are the recommendations.

296
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:46,632
Also if you want to learn more 
about the scheme

297
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:50,225
you can go to the website that presents 
all the information about the scheme,

298
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:53,422
the related protocols, the laboratories.

299
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:55,782
And lastly, if you are just interested

300
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:57,778
in household water treatment 
more generally,

301
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:01,279
I refer you to the WHO UNICEF 
International Network

302
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,641
on Household Water Treatment 
and Safe Storage,

303
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,847
which is working on a variety of issues

304
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:09,794
to try to make sure household 
water treatment gets to where it's needed

305
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,188
and used by those most in need.

306
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:14,341
So, thank you.
