00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,430
Hello, I'm Victor Vergara, Lead Urban
Specialist from the World Bank.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,300
We're going to talk a little bit
about the key challenges to

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,080
urban infrastructure. We'll be focusing
on some very core challenges.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,460
We'll be looking at demographic
challenges, socioeconomic challenges,

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,780
technological, environmental
and financial.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,640
Let me then begin by talking
about the demographic challenge.

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,620
To anyone that has been in 
developing and emerging cities,

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,200
you know that a critical factor 
is the rapid rate of population

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,470
growth and the difficulty of
providing infrastructures at

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,210
the same pace of that growth; in fact,
infrastructure is always lagging behind.

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,550
The rate of population
growth is fundamental.

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,870
At the same time, you have the
overall population number;

13
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,680
the large population living in 
cities and the needs to increase

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,730
the efficiency in urban
infrastructure; so, both the rate and

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,480
the overall size. In that context,
you have a combination of

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,770
factors that yields the fact that
you have a risk of marginalizing

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,820
and the extensions of slums.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,700
That is that cities generally
and sadly grow through slums -

19
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:28,200
slum creation - and this fact is
in fact what we want to address,

20
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,420
by reducing slum formation and
increasing the ability of the

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,910
city to accommodate growth, in
places where basic services are

22
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,720
indeed provided. The demographic
challenge is fundamental.

23
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,980
In many places however, many cities
don't have good population

24
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,330
estimates, and even the very basic
data is missing on population.

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,620
The next is the socioeconomic
challenges, and here we have many

26
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,590
challenging issues. The first is
the need to have progressive

27
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,820
policies; policies that are
pro-poor, and that they address

28
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,620
the fundamental preference for the
vast majority of the population

29
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,870
that is in fact needing assistance.

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,160
Policies also need to
be gender-sensitive.

31
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,720
In our cities, most of the cities
have been designed for and

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,600
by men, and it's reflected in
the way that infrastructure is

33
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,290
 structured and provided. A new
generation of urban planners

34
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,690
is emerging, that is taking into
consideration the needs of

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,810
everybody, including and foremost
the female-headed households,

36
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,460
which in fact define in many ways the
cities and the household structures.

37
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,780
In this way, we need to provide
affordable housing for different

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,450
groups of citizens. There needs
to be a housing policy that

39
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,510
enables housing markets to work
for everyone, including those

40
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,770
that have limited resources
through subsidies, subsidies that

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,830
motivate the efficient provision of
housing, close to where people work.

42
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,830
There's also the issue of safe
drinking water, fundamental.

43
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,660
The issue of mobility; without
adequate transport, cities cannot

44
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,630
grow properly. It's
fundamental infrastructure.

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,070
However, transport and
mobility is a derived need.

46
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,470
It is not the need, it is not the
fact that should define a city.

47
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:35,460
Land use should take into account
and have as its backbone transport.

48
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,880
But it shouldn't be the other way
around; transport should not

49
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,370
be defining the way a city
is shaped and formed.

50
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,040
Larger prerogative should be used for
defining how the city should grow.

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,690
The fundamental issue is waste,
and wastewater management.

52
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,130
In many cities around the world,
the first thing that people

53
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,510
talk about is whether or
not the city is clean.

54
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,210
And it really is all about the
foundation of public health:

55
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,940
if you have a city that is not clean,
you have problems of public health.

56
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,140
And finally, the issue of energy.

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,090
Cities require energy to run.

58
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,120
And if you don't have availability
of energy throughout

59
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,550
the city, productivity is very low.

60
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,520
All this comes together in the
need and access for employment

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,650
- access to jobs, which is fundamental
as a socioeconomic challenge.

62
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,320
Technological challenge?

63
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,040
Fundamentally, cities without
infrastructure: how do you retrofit

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,650
a city that does not have
the right infrastructure?

65
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,720
Our estimates, and others'as well,
come to the conclusion that

66
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,350
retrofitting a city can cost
between three to eight times as

67
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,340
much, or even more, than designing
a city property from the outset.

68
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,300
It is bad business to create bad
cities, with infrastructure

69
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,020
that is not proper. The other issue
is aging urban infrastructure.

70
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,210
When infrastructure is not
maintained regularly and it ages,

71
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,670
and actually there is no asset
management system, cities come

72
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,230
into problems very quickly.

73
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,920
And the fundamental issue of
technology and infrastructure

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,600
is the interdependence of
different infrastructures.

75
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,410
A holistic view of infrastructure
- one cannot consider simply

76
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,900
one service without
considering the others.

77
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,470
Good urban planning, good city
management, require services

78
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,500
to be thought through as
in a holistic manner.

79
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,240
Next, environmental challenge,
which is linked to infrastructure.

80
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,650
But I'll focus on a couple of points.

81
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,750
First, the resilience of urban infrastructure
to face environmental shocks.

82
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,000
Many of us remember the problems
that New York city faced several

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,780
years ago with superstorm Sandy.

84
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,190
A city that was once heralded
to be in many ways stormproof

85
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:05,440
- it wasn't the case. The storm
came through and it devastated

86
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,530
the city, and it created a great
deal of reflection on something

87
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,090
that the Regional Plan Association
calls "fragile success".

88
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,610
It is important also to address
the issue of climate change,

89
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,090
and the reduction of carbon
emissions of cities.

90
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,260
We all know that this is a big
issue now that the international

91
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,730
community is trying to address it
through dialogue and the consensus.

92
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,260
The role of cities is fundamental.

93
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,570
The last challenge (and we should
always look at finance last,

94
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,030
not first, because finance follows
function) is that we need

95
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,040
to provide more and better
infrastructure, typically with limited

96
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,190
financial means. We need creative
financing, we need to leverage

97
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,490
existing local financing, we need
to ensure that we are in fact

98
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,010
leveraging the increased value
of land as cities grow.

99
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,830
We also need to manage the
competing needs of available land,

100
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,570
and in many cases this is land
that is unserviced, that has

101
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,780
unmet basic needs and it is very
complicated to prioritize among

102
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,040
services, between water, mobility,
housing and other services.

103
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,320
And fundamentally, we need to
generate a sustainable revenue

104
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,340
stream for the operation and
maintenance of urban infrastructure.

105
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,280
In many cases, you have approaches
where capital expenditures

106
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,850
are in fact well-conducted, the
infrastructure is provided,

107
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,080
however, there is not enough revenue to
actually maintain that infrastructure.

108
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,950
And, without that maintenance, it
decays, it comes into disrepair

109
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,850
and the services begin to collapse.

110
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,640
We see this sadly in many of our
emerging cities, and principally

111
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,520
in our metropolitan areas, where
there is limited coordination

112
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,620
among local governments.

113
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,400
So let me try to summarize what
we have been discussing.

114
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,660
Several challenges contribute to
the quality of urban services

115
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,260
as it relates to infrastructure:
the demographic challenge,

116
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,300
with the rate of growth as the
principal issue to address;

117
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,020
the socioeconomic challenges, with 
the imperative to have progressive

118
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,210
policies that address poverty
at cities as the center stage

119
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,450
there; technological challenges -
how do you address the provision

120
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,770
of infrastructure once the city
is already built, without right

121
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,520
of ways, without the ability
to actually introduce it?

122
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,330
-; environmental challenges,
climate change and resiliency;

123
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,980
and finally financial challenges,
finance follows function,

124
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,790
and cities look the way
they are financed.

125
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,220
Let's then consider that as the
contributing factors for

126
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,640
the quality of services, but, 
without better management for urban

127
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,200
infrastructures, you will not be
able to translate meeting those

128
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,010
challenges into quality
urban services.

129
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,980
I hope this introduction
has been useful.

130
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,660
We will look at it in greater
detail with the rest of the MOOC,

131
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,100
so I hope you enjoyed it.

132
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,010
Thank you.
