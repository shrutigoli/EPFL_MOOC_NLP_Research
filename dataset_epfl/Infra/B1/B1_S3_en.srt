1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,050
Welcome back. So far, you have
heard about the main challenges

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,460
that urban systems face.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,620
In this session, I will now
explain the basic features

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,700
of a city's main infrastructure system.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,290
We will first talk about transport,
then we will address housing

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,510
and green infrastructures; from
there we will move to energy

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:36,250
infrastructures, to water and wastewater,
to waste, to telecommunications

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,090
infrastructures; and finally, I will
show how all these infrastructures

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,750
are related to each other.

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,910
Let's start with transport.

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,290
In a city, there are basic
transport infrastructures: trains,

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,170
tracks, roads, suburban trains,
trains that cross the city,

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,930
trams that are inside the city.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,340
Only all these tracks are
physically located in the city.

15
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,160
The next element is the vehicles
that use these tracks.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,580
On the train tracks, we have:
trains, suburban trains, urban

17
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,180
trains, metros, trains
that cross the city.

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,690
On the tram tracks, of course, we
have trams, and, on the road,

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,710
we have several things like cars,
like taxi, like public buses,

20
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:40,620
like private buses, bikes, and sometimes
also passengers, they use the roads.

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,990
A third element is the stations.

22
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,860
That's where people move from one
transport mode to the other:

23
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,710
train stations, where people change
from the bus to the train,

24
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:01,110
from the bus to the bike, and of
course also airports, where

25
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,620
people are changing from the train
or from the road to the air

26
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,470
transport; usually, those ones
are located outside of the city.

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,170
If we move to housing and green
infrastructures, there are several

28
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,720
types of housing infrastructures:
there are typical houses of

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,860
course, but there are also factories,
industrial constructions,

30
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,480
and we see increasingly, especially in
emerging countries, gated communities.

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,030
Those are entire areas that are
private, that are closed off,

32
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,150
but they are located
physically within a city.

33
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,720
As for green infrastructures, this
is something that is gaining

34
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,470
attention more recently, mainly
because of climate change, and

35
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,660
the use of the functions that these
green infrastructures have for a city.

36
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,090
Typically, we hear about parks
- what would New York city be

37
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,850
without Central Park, for example?

38
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,750
Many cities do have parks, some
have urban forests rather at

39
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,380
the periphery of the city, but there
are also things like biological

40
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,790
corridors, where animals actually move
through the cities, birds or bats.

41
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,560
.. Then, increasingly, we see
vegetalization: houses are vegetalized,

42
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,570
roofs are vegetalized, trees are
planted, entire alleys of trees.

43
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,780
Green infrastructures are equally
important infrastructures

44
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:47,100
as all the other ones, as they
have a main function for a city.

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,120
Energy infrastructures are
basically electricity, cable, gas,

46
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,980
tubes which come into the city
from outside of the city.

47
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,950
The energy, the electricity or
the gas is produced far away

48
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,770
and is then transported into the city.

49
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,750
Now, the house. There are two types
of consumers of these energies:

50
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,700
typically, there are household
consumers and industrial consumers,

51
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,010
factories that buy a big amount
of electricity or gas.

52
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,740
Now, there is a little
generation in the city.

53
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,960
Often, it starts with backup generation
in case the electricity system fails.

54
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,200
Especially, the industrial consumers
or the hospitals, for example,

55
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:47,480
are capable to bring in generators
for backup, sometimes households,

56
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,400
but rarely. Increasingly, also, we
see some sort of self-generation,

57
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,470
through renewable energy, through
solar panels on the rooftops,

58
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,710
but, overall, the energy generated
within the city remains very limited.

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,500
Now, the drinking and the
wastewater are a very interesting

60
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,580
infrastructure in cities. Let's
start with drinking water.

61
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,370
Drinking water is generally
abstracted out of the ground.

62
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,050
We call this the river basin.

63
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,200
Then the drinking water needs to
be prepared before it can be

64
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,340
distributed again to household
consumers, individuals like you

65
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,050
and me, or industrial consumers,
which actually use up bigger

66
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,700
amounts of water. Now, once the
water has been used, it turns

67
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,920
into wastewater, it is collected
again - in most of the cities

68
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,540
it is collected - and then, it is
treated by wastewater treatment

69
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,370
plants and finally it is discharged.

70
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,850
After which it goes back into
the river basin, and the whole

71
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,830
what we call water cycle starts again.

72
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,760
Now, waste, and I should actually
talk about consumption first,

73
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,750
because before things turn into
waste, they are consumed, and

74
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,850
this way they are consumed by households
and again by industrial customers.

75
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,960
This waste is then
collected and treated.

76
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,860
Generally, it is treated already
to a certain extent inside

77
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,260
the city or outside the city, but
definitely the landfill,

78
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,560
where the waste is then deposited, is
generally located outside of the city.

79
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:52,350
Now, increasingly, we see recycling
and energy generation, such

80
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,520
as district heating or sometimes
even electricity that is produced

81
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,520
out of the treatment plants, or
gas is even produced out of

82
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,570
the landfills for electricity. There
is a little energy production

83
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,080
that is coming out of waste.

84
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,920
Communications infrastructures
are equally interesting.

85
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,940
Historically, communications,
telecommunications infrastructures

86
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,330
are basically copper cables
in the grounds in the city.

87
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,460
In some cities, you still see the
telecommunication cables above

88
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,400
ground, but this is becoming
increasingly rare.

89
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,080
Now, the new infrastructure,
telecommunications infrastructure,

90
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,800
that is replacing the copper
cables is the fiber.

91
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:53,340
And the fiber is put in along big
alleys, and then it is connected

92
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,570
either to households or to mobile
towers, to WiFi stations,

93
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,130
to WiMAX stations, and offered
as public or private WiFi.

94
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,470
The households can be connected
to different things: they can

95
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,100
be connected to the physical
telecommunications network,

96
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,820
to the copper cables, or they 
can be connected to the WiFi,

97
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,940
to the fiber directly. But
increasingly, households people are

98
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,210
getting connected directly to mobile.

99
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,480
They have a mobile phone - and in
some countries they only have

100
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,980
a mobile phone - and then they
are connected to mobile towers,

101
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,000
which in turn are
connected to the fiber.

102
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,150
All these infrastructures are of
course related to each other.

103
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:51,770
The first thing we see is that when in
the ground several infrastructures

104
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,590
are put together, that it happens,
that cables are put together

105
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:04,160
with fiber, with copper cables,
with electricity cables; tubes

106
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,990
are put together: water tubes,
wastewater tubes, gas tubes,

107
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,590
sometimes also electricity
cables are put in there.

108
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:17,290
And of course, in tunnels, we find
a lot of things that go together,

109
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,690
and in roads of course, also the
road is shared with the tram,

110
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:33,270
with the buses, with the cars, with
bicycle lanes, with the people walking.

111
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:41,420
All these infrastructures have to
be planned together, for optimal

112
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,090
use of the space that is
available in the city.

113
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,600
They not only have to be planned,
but they have to be used together,

114
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,440
because often it is cheaper
to put them together.

115
00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:00,710
Let me say in conclusion that
I have tried to offer you an

116
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,310
understanding of the different
types of infrastructures

117
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,380
that are available in a city.

118
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,180
What we will do, in the next
session, is look at the different

119
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,230
dimensions that pertain 
to these infrastructures.

120
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,700
They have economic dimensions,
technical dimensions, social

121
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,130
dimensions, and we will go into them,
into each of them, in the next session.
