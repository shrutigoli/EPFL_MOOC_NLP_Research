00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,250
Welcome back to this last
session of the first block.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,200
In this session, I will talk
about the two main perspectives

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,060
from which urban infrastructure
systems can and should be analyzed

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,670
in an intellectually coherent manner.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,390
These are the public policy perspective
and the public economy perspective.

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,260
Both perspectives are coherent
and both perspectives are based

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,240
on a series of assumptions.

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,590
Let's first talk about the
public policy perspective.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,860
The public policy perspective
caters to the citizen before it

10
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:52,550
caters to the customer. And the
citizen is entitled to receive

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,250
public services in terms of their
accessibility, their quality,

12
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,950
their affordability and their equity.

13
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,030
This means for example that public
transport should be close

14
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,670
to where people need it.

15
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,310
It is in good quality, it is
reliable, it is affordable.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,250
The poor people can also afford
it and it is provided in an

17
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:22,280
equitable manner, meaning that citizens
all around the city have access to it.

18
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:29,390
Now, if these services cannot be
self-financing, then public

19
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:36,830
money subsidies can be paid or will be
paid to offer these public services.

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,060
That is, the money is not
really the first focus.

21
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,770
The focus is the services, and,
if the money is not sufficient

22
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,830
by what the customers pay, the public
authorities will pay the difference.

23
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,060
So, the underlying assumption of
this public policy perspective

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,630
is that the public services
should be maximized.

25
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,920
The citizens who live in a city
should be receiving the best

26
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,700
possible public services. Of
course, there are financial limits

27
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,440
you have to consider, but, before all,
it is the services that are important.

28
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,580
The way of providing these services is
also coherent with this approach.

29
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,160
It is basically political steering
that guides because those

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,760
are political objectives. The
services are provided in a way

31
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,610
that politics control them.

32
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,220
Historically, this is
the case of ownership.

33
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:50,180
We talk here about integrated
municipal public enterprises like

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,070
a public transport entity, a public
energy entity, a public water company.

35
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,760
They own the services, they
provide the services and they own

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,410
the infrastructure. In some
countries, we talk about integrated

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,970
even utilities where the water
and the energy company and even

38
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:17,510
a transport company sometimes are
integrated in one big municipal service.

39
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,920
Now, increasingly, the same public
provision of the services

40
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,520
can be rendered by way of contract.

41
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,440
You may have private operators or even
public operators for that matter.

42
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,780
But the political steering occurs
from the fact that the public

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,870
authorities contract
with this operator.

44
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,140
They fix the objectives that the
operator has to reach, again

45
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,530
as I said, before in terms of
accessibility, quality, affordability

46
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,660
and equity. And if the operator
does not make enough money from

47
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,520
these services, he is then subsidized
by the public authorities.

48
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,020
This public policy perspective contrasts
with the public economy perspective.

49
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,120
It must be said that this public
economy perspective has emerged

50
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,180
more recently, around the end of
the 1980s, the early 1990s,

51
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,190
in the general context of
liberalization and globalization.

52
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,940
But this perspective is equally
coherent as the previous perspective.

53
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,150
Now, at the end of that perspective,
we have the customer before

54
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,880
the citizen and the idea is that
the public services that are

55
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,110
delivered are first of all
catering to customers.

56
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,930
And the customers should
pay for these services.

57
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,150
So, they can be profitable or at least,
covering the costs of providing them.

58
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,760
This is a basic principle
of this perspective.

59
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,500
There are, of course, services
which cannot be profitable.

60
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,190
We have seen previously in the
course - we have talked about

61
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,390
the public goods, for example, like
street lighting which nobody

62
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,090
is prepared to pay for.

63
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,760
In other words, from an economic
point of view, this means that

64
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,680
there are market failures.

65
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:32,140
In this case, the public economy
perspective allows for subsidies

66
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,020
but it allows for subsidies only
in the case of market failure.

67
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,680
The assumption here is totally different
from the previous perspective.

68
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,890
The assumption is that economic
growth should be maximized and

69
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,970
the infrastructure services are
participating in the economic

70
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,470
growth of a city. If the company
that provides these services

71
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,980
is doing well, this will ultimately
be beneficial for the entire

72
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,770
city and for the welfare of all
the inhabitants of the city.

73
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,170
In terms of way of providing,
we also have a very different

74
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,510
approach from the previous one.

75
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,580
Since the goal is somehow the
customer, the competition is seen

76
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,890
as the best way of
providing these services.

77
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,670
And that means that there should
be some sort of competition,

78
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,570
let's say, between water companies
or between transport companies.

79
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,690
And it is the competition that
actually guarantees the efficiency

80
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,160
and the quality of the services.

81
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,340
Of course, since we are dealing with
infrastructures here, competition

82
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,940
is always accompanied by regulation.

83
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,030
And regulation means that, to
make sure that the competitors

84
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,070
are not discriminated against, they
can use the physical infrastructure

85
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,340
to provide the services.

86
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,350
And therefore, there is another
principle that is important

87
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,680
here, it is this
principle of unbundling.

88
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,010
In order to create competition,
of course, you have to separate

89
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,800
between the services which are
competitive and the infrastructure

90
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:25,150
which remains monopolistic and that
calls for all kinds of regulations

91
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,990
to make this happen.

92
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,750
We have clearly seen two different
perspectives or on how to

93
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,970
govern and how to approach the
infrastructure systems in a city.

94
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,930
The public economic perspective
based on markets and competition

95
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,710
and the public policy perspective
based on integrated municipal

96
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,940
companies or contract. Now, to
conclude this first block which

97
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,740
was about basically introducing to
urban infrastructure systems,

98
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,300
we have seen how these systems
are structured, their different

99
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:10,010
dimensions, we have talked about
economic dimensions and others.

100
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,890
And just before, we have looked at
the different ways, the different

101
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,950
perspectives from which they can
be approached in a coherent way.

102
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,600
The next block will be about managing
these same urban infrastructure systems.

103
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,450
Stay tuned.
