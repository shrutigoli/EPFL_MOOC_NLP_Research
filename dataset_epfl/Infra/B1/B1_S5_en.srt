00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,150
Hello! My name is Vincent Lusser,
I work at the Town and Country

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:15,890
Planning Department of the republican
state of Geneva in Switzerland.

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,760
I'm sure you have heard
about Geneva before.

4
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,420
Geneva is very well known around
the world for being one of

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,850
the places where world
governance is located.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,670
Just think about the Red Cross,
think about the United Nations,

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,160
the World Trade
Organization, many NGOs.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,980
Geneva is also known for its business
location, with many international

9
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,140
companies having
headquarters in Geneva.

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,820
At the same time, Geneva
is a very small city.

11
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:57,360
It likes to think of itself as the
smallest of world metropolitan areas.

12
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,190
Looking at how we organize our
territory - this is of course

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,670
a big challenge because our canton
is small, the territory is

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,300
small, and half of it is still
very much green, meaning it's

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,580
agricultural land, vineyards,
forests, rivers, places that people

16
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,770
really cherish and like, and
this is half of our territory.

17
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,150
The challenge for Geneva is really
to think: how can we continue

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,540
to be a very successful town?

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,950
How can we continue to be a world leader
in terms of international governance?

20
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,320
How can we continue to
attract economic growth?

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,450
And at the same time, how can we
maintain our quality of life,

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,060
keep our heritage, keep our
agriculture, keep all the things

23
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,620
that also make Geneva a nice place
to live, not just an interesting

24
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,420
one to work in?

25
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,500
We've seen how Geneva is being
very successful at the moment,

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,810
with Lausanne and this
Lake Geneva area.

27
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,330
Of course, this means, then, that
there is growth of population,

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,990
there is growth of activity,
there is growth of transport.

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,800
But now, when we look at the
situation on the ground, we see

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,200
that, in terms of housing, we
already had a very tense market,

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,620
even before the growth went up again.

32
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,300
And in terms of transports, we
have a very simple problem.

33
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,070
We have Lake Geneva and the Rhone
river; getting from the left

34
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,240
bank to the right bank has been
a problem for Geneva since

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,350
the time of Julius Caesar, and 
especially so, since the right bank

36
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,040
of the river is very well connected
by rail, but the left bank,

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,340
the French side, is not very well
connected, with subsequently,

38
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,880
a lot of car traffic and a lot
of traffic jams inside Geneva

39
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,280
every day, and every evening,
when people leave.

40
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,590
Adding to this, like most cities
now around the world, we have

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,080
a big ambition to become more
sustainable in the way we live,

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,210
in the way we move, in the way
we work, in the way we build.

43
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,450
Hw can we do more, and still
depend less - typically, depend

44
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,550
less on fossil fuels, on which,
just to remind you, fifty percent

45
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,760
of the energy consumed in Geneva
is consumed by buildings.

46
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:21,140
This is a huge factor, when looking at
the sustainable development issues.

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,220
So, faced with these challenges, what's
the current thinking in Geneva?

48
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,770
Firstly concerning housing,
again we want more housing,

49
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,510
but we do not want to expand
significantly on the green belt.

50
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,430
We still have about three, four
percent of the green belt that

51
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,120
we can build, and we're doing that.

52
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,520
But the major, let's say, long term
solution, will be to construct

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,360
more dense areas inside the
already built up urban areas.

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,470
This is of course a very difficult
process because you're basically

55
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:00,650
talking about transforming little
one-family homes, villas dating

56
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,530
back to the 1950s and 1960s, into
more urban development areas;

57
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,240
and people don't like when you
come into their areas and you

58
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,240
want to basically tear down their
houses and build something new.

59
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,430
The other opportunity we do have
is Praille Acacias Vernets,

60
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,880
which is a huge area inside Geneva.

61
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,810
Think of the Docklands, think
of Lyon Confluence in Lyon.

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,330
This is an area which will gradually
develop from an industrial

63
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,290
area into a new downtown
Geneva, new urban center.

64
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,870
Another challenge here is that this
is a quite successful industrial

65
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,490
area today, so there too, we
don't have a wasteland, we have

66
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,290
something which is very much built
up and which we need to gradually

67
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,060
transform into something more urban.

68
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,340
Looking at transport now, as I
said to be the major challenge

69
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,620
is to get from the left bank to the right
bank of the river and of the lake.

70
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,720
Geneva is now taking a strategic
step into urban railways.

71
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,190
That is something many European
cities have done; Zurich, Basel

72
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,540
have done it in the last decades.

73
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,530
And now Geneva is getting on board.

74
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,800
We are building sixteen kilometers
of new track from central

75
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,480
Geneva to France, and this will
connect two hundred and thirty

76
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,850
kilometers of railway network,
connecting basically, the Vaudois

77
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Geneva and French sides of the
area together with a rail link.

78
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,610
And this rail link is a major agent
of urban development as well.

79
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,070
Because, around the stations, we
are building new public spaces,

80
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:47,860
businesses, housing. In Geneva,
we call it the project

81
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,910
of the century for Geneva.

82
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,760
Geneva wants to reduce its
dependence on fossil fuels.

83
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,810
We have quite an innovative
project which is already working,

84
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,590
which is using the lake water to
cool the buildings in the summer,

85
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,200
and to heat them in the winter time.

86
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,520
This system already connects the
United Nations area in Geneva,

87
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,050
up to the airport, and after a
successful test, we want to develop

88
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,840
that in other city areas.

89
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,600
We are also testing the territory
in Geneva for opportunities

90
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,180
to develop a geothermal project.

91
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,350
We know that the underground in
Geneva looks a lot like

92
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:34,290
the underground in Munich, where
geothermal projects had been used

93
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,940
successfully over the last decades.

94
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,300
But we don't know yet so much
about the underground, because

95
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,480
we have never explored the underground
for oil, unlike other European areas.

96
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,080
We have a lot to explore and to
discover in terms of energy.

97
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,620
One point which will certainly
interest you in term of a new

98
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,360
energy network is that energy always
implies a different organization

99
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,410
of the territory. I
mean, just think of it.

100
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,690
We use the wood, we had
to distribute wood.

101
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,070
Today we use oil, we have pipelines,
we have a lot of lorries

102
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,300
running around with oil products.

103
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,490
Tomorrow, we need to distribute
perhaps hot water, or cool water

104
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,670
from the lake, and this is
creating new networks which have

105
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:27,460
to be included in the urban and town
planning, whether add of any buildings.

106
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,980
So in a way, while you're still
developing new energy concepts,

107
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,440
you need already to include them
in the planning of the urban

108
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,380
areas that you're
developing around them.

109
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,200
To sum it up, I would like to say we
have five strategic orientations.

110
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,580
The first is to go a step up in
production of housing, by having

111
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,130
ten major development projects.

112
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,710
Some of them must still need an
agricultural land, the last

113
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,380
three to four percent. But most
of them will be actually inside

114
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,690
the built up areas. Densifying
Geneva, building this Praille

115
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,030
Acacias area into an urban area,
is really a priority, and will

116
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,810
yield significantly more than 
the smaller projects that we had

117
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,570
across the city so far.

118
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,930
The second strategic orientation
is to say while doing that,

119
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,840
we want to keep an agricultural area.

120
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,070
Not just for fun and enjoyment, but
we think that the food production,

121
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,720
also in terms of sustainable
development, needs to be staying

122
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,950
close to the city. Close to the
city or even inside the city

123
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,350
in the new city projects. That's
something we still need to

124
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,420
explore, but it's something which
today says to us that it's

125
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,020
important to keep that plant
and to keep it for the future.

126
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,020
The third big area
concerns transports.

127
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,530
I was talking about the cross
border rail link, from the left

128
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,170
bank to the right bank, which
will really not only give us

129
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,830
a transport system from across 
the lake, but it will develop

130
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,610
the urban areas around the stations.

131
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,750
That's also one of the
key strategic projects.

132
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,320
Right underway it's going to
start building next year for

133
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,380
the public spaces, and the rail
project is already well underway,

134
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,620
and due to be opened
at the end of 2019.

135
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,360
But this rail link, of course,
implies other issues, such as

136
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,380
having a cross national transport
system, which again will raise

137
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:40,290
issues about ticketing, pricing
and how you can travel from

138
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,500
one country in one area to the
other without actually realizing

139
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,320
you're crossing borders.

140
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,150
The fourth point concerns energy.

141
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,100
Of course, developing solar energy
using the lake's water to

142
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,750
cool or heat the buildings,
developing geothermal projects,

143
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,190
that's all very important. At the
same time we must never forget

144
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,350
that fifty percent of the energy
in Geneva is used by buildings.

145
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,890
Of course, it's an old city,
many buildings are not very up

146
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:11,540
to date, and we must absolutely improve
the insulation of these buildings.

147
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,540
For instance, there's a new law
in Geneva which says that you

148
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,080
have to change your old windows if
they are not up to energy levels.

149
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,050
We've made some exceptions, for
old buildings in the historic

150
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,980
part of town, but all the other
buildings will have to basically

151
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,120
get up to standards in the
next couple of years.

152
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,240
To sum it up, all this would not work
if it's not consistent beyond Geneva.

153
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,820
As you know, we're a small city,
we are very much connected

154
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,750
to Lausanne and to the neighboring
French cities, so, together,

155
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,900
we have a Greater Geneva Agglomeration
project which won a European prize.

156
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,220
It won a prize because it was a
successful attempt to create

157
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:01,350
a common, consistent vision, each
in their own country and canton,

158
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,890
but still a common vision on how
to develop the territory, how

159
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,770
to preserve natural areas, how to
develop urban strategies for

160
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,190
transport, but also how to deal
with issues linked to education,

161
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:22,090
health, economy, and
also cultural issues.

162
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,760
This gives you, together, a
broader view of how Geneva wants

163
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,720
to keep these different subjects
together very much in a spirit

164
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,990
of sustainable development, with
its environmental, economic,

165
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:46,310
and social aspects. But, of
course, all the most intelligent

166
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,900
thinking will never produce any
housing, if it doesn't solve

167
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,580
the very practical issues on the way.

168
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,470
The practical issues on
the way, it's money.

169
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,910
That's one big issue.

170
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,450
Sometimes, it is linked
to issues of taxation.

171
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,270
For instance, in Geneva today,
people are taxed where they work,

172
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,830
not where they live.

173
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,270
Communes that accept new housing
actually accept cost factors.

174
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,200
Communes have a tendency
to want more activity.

175
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,560
They want offices, they want industry.

176
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,860
For them, having new people coming
to live is more of a cost factor.

177
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,690
So we are rethinking
the taxation system.

178
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,540
We are also creating a fund,
whereby the commune would build

179
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,000
will get support from the
communes who don't build.

180
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,050
And there's a way to finance
especially these equipments like

181
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,990
public spaces, ambitious,
beautiful public spaces, they are

182
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,360
very difficult to finance, and
often they hold up the projects

183
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,690
when they take place. Then, of
course, like any government,

184
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,070
the Geneva government has a
set of priority investments.

185
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,890
Currently, we have been investing a
lot over the last years in Geneva.

186
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,190
We have a new maternity ward, which
is the biggest in Switzerland,

187
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,620
which was completed this year.

188
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,610
We are expanding other parts of
the hospital in Geneva,

189
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,910
which is an hospital of regional importance.

190
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,690
We are building our rail network
link, which is a major cost

191
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,570
factor but a great investment
in the future of Geneva.

192
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,180
So then, getting the finances of
the transport systems synchronized

193
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,380
with the finances of the urban
project is quite a challenge,

194
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,740
because people want transports to be
there, when the first inhabitants

195
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,850
move into a built up area.

196
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,100
Second challenge I often see is that,
today, we live in a very complex world.

197
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,290
We have seventeen public policies
in Geneva, which means

198
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,800
we have seventeen areas in
which we want to excel.

199
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,580
We don't want to just build
housing or transport.

200
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,360
We want to preserve the environment,
we want to make social

201
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,310
development, we want to
invest in education.

202
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,050
And sometimes these public policies
- I wouldn't say they clash,

203
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,960
but you have to make choices, and making
choices is sometimes a challenge.

204
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,900
You have to work on your
project governance.

205
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,130
You have to be sure that all the
people from different public

206
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,440
administrations come together
with a common view in a common

207
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,220
set of objectives, and that is
very much - I would say it's

208
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:26,800
very much a diplomatic project, as
much as a purely urban project.

209
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,760
And then, of course, as we
discussed, if you want to densify

210
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,340
urban areas, which means to
eventually tear down some homes

211
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,020
to build new ones, this is a very
difficult undertaking with the neighbors.

212
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,730
The term "not in my back yard",
you know - the NIMBY syndrome

213
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,480
is very much alive worldwide,
and it's in Geneva.

214
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,730
The difference in Geneva is that
we have a particularly rich

215
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,700
system of local democracy, which means
you have a lot of opportunities

216
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:01,760
to oppose urban projects, it's very
difficult to expropriate people too.

217
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,650
This will add time, and in Geneva
I would say that the projects

218
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,230
may actually take more time that
they may take in other countries,

219
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,960
because of this very much
developed local democracy.

220
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,080
Developing dialog processes, 
with the local authorities,

221
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,360
with the communes, with the people
who live in these areas, also

222
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,680
with the associations who preserve
nature, who want more traffic,

223
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,970
who want less traffic, who want
higher housing or lower housing.

224
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,680
.. This is a complex dialogue
project which we have started

225
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:42,790
to organize in a standardized,
in a quite developed way.

226
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,380
And this is perhaps something
that we don't think about when

227
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,640
we think of building towns.

228
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,370
But, eventually, it's a question
of saving, perhaps, years of

229
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,960
delay, to develop this kind of
dialogue with the people.

230
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,620
So, in a way, the experience we
have every day is that developing

231
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,950
an urban project is perhaps less
of a technical challenge.

232
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,610
It's less of a challenge in terms
of urban design or architecture,

233
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:24,210
then a challenge in terms of social,
political, and institutional dialogue.

234
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,120
I think that's an interesting
learning point for us.

235
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,410
Basically, it means that building
towns is a political project.

236
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,620
It's something that involves deep
discussions inside society,

237
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,960
not just money and technical skills, to
do something which is well designed.
