00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,700
Hello and welcome. My name is
Matthias Finger, I'm a professor

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,370
of management of network industries
at École polytechnique fédérale

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,100
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,750
This is the course about managing
urban infrastructures.

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,140
As you know, cities are
faced with huge challenges.

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,690
More than half of the world's
population currently lives in cities.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,730
Cities are big polluters, cities
are the consumers of the majority

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,750
of the resources, they have
transportation problems, water problems

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,660
and plenty of other big
challenges ahead of them.

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,370
In this course, we will talk about
that in four different blocks.

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,080
In the first block, we will offer
you an introduction to urban

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,490
infrastructures. The second block,
we will offer the foundations

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,280
of managing the urban
infrastructure systems.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,100
And the third and the fourth block,
we will talk about two particular

15
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,570
urban infrastructures, namely
energy and transport.

16
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,420
Now, in this first block, you will
learn about the urban infrastructure

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,530
systems and the challenges that
they are confronted with.

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,610
This first block is structured
into five sessions.

19
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,190
The first session is a general
introduction, it is done by

20
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,210
a guest speaker, Mr. Victor
Vergara from the World Bank.

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,560
The second session will be about the
main urban infrastructure systems.

22
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,120
I will present to you how these systems
work and how they are structured.

23
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,010
The third session, we will talk
about the main dimensions

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,680
of urban infrastructures. The fourth
session will give you the

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,080
point of view of a practitioner that
deals with all these challenges

26
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,860
in his daily life. And the fifth
session, we will then look

27
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,900
at the different analytical
perspectives from which one can

28
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,950
look at these urban infrastructure
systems and their management.
