1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,740
Welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,180
In this third session, we will
talk about the main dimensions

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,790
of managing urban
infrastructure systems.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,600
And in doing so, we will
proceed in three steps.

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,330
We will first outline our overall
framework of management and

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,620
governance, then we will talk
about the five dimensions

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,270
that apply: technical, economic,
jurisdictional, social, environmental.

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,290
And then, I will come back to the
overall framework, and basically

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,770
define cities as a dynamic
complex sociotechnical system.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,650
Now let's start with our framework.

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,530
So, you have the overall urban
infrastructure system, and in

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,260
that system you have primary
infrastructures: those are

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,590
that ones we talk about in this course.

14
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:07,360
Transport, energy, wastewater,
drinking water, waste, housing,

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,620
telecommunications, green
infrastructures: those are our primary

16
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,780
infrastructures and that is where we
focus our management efforts on.

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,220
There are basically three objectives,
three performance indicators

18
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,630
we are looking at: we want these
systems to be efficient,

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,040
we want these systems to be sustainable
and we want these systems

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,800
to be resilient. Those are
basically the essential goals that

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,560
management of these
infrastructures pursues.

22
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,520
Transport has to be efficient, we don't
want to waste our time in traffic.

23
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,110
Energy, for example, has to be
sustainable and city systems

24
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,890
have to be resilient, because,
for example, after a storm,

25
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,420
we want them to function, we want
transport or water sewerage to

26
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,870
function again smoothly after that.

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,080
There are secondary infrastructures
like health infrastructures,

28
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,020
education infrastructures, nutrition,
cultural infrastructures.

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,720
We do not talk about them in this
course, but, of course,

30
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,690
they are important for the overall
functioning of a city and they

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,980
actually function because the
primary infrastructures function.

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,780
The last element of our framework
is basically the goals that

33
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,720
this whole urban system pursues.

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,910
The urban system wants to provide
a good quality of life for

35
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,090
the inhabitants; the city wants
to be attractive; and the city

36
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,570
wants to be competitive
internationally.

37
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,270
All of this together aims at
these three overall objectives.

38
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,870
We, however, focus on the primary
infrastructures, on the management

39
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,390
of these, and their performance
objectives that are efficiency,

40
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,770
resilience, and sustainability.

41
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,950
Let's talk about the different dimensions
of the urban infrastructure systems.

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,910
Important to mention is, first, the
physical infrastructure layer.

43
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,400
We have seen that in the last
session, when I showed these maps

44
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,940
of each of the cities. For example,
we have roads, we have tracks,

45
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,370
we have cables, we have pipes,
we have green infrastructures

46
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,510
- parks -, we have buildings.

47
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,560
This is a purely physical layer
of an urban infrastructure.

48
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,320
On the basis of this physical layer,
there are services possible,

49
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,530
and I think that's the real originality,
the difference of infrastructure

50
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,990
systems, and we'll see it again when
we talk about their economics.

51
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,730
You have to have a physical layer,
and then, on the basis of

52
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,840
the physical layer, you can
provide services, you can provide

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,350
transportation services or mobility
services, as we call them now.

54
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,490
We can provide energy services,
housing services, water services,

55
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,850
environmental services,
communication services, all of this

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,710
is possible because of the physical
infrastructure and all together,

57
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,560
the physical infrastructure layer
and the services layer together

58
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,090
benefit the citizen and the customer.

59
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,780
Technically, these are networks:
there is a transportation network,

60
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,230
there is a telecommunications
network, there is an electricity

61
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,500
network, there is a gas network,
there is a water network, and

62
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,080
these networks technically are
basically composed of two things:

63
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,020
lines, pipes, cables and nodes,
where these things are connected

64
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,820
to each other, or transformed
from one to the other.

65
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,150
The city is composed of a series
of networks, some of which

66
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,740
are related to each other
as we have seen before.

67
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,350
In any case, they are huge, they
are complex and they need to

68
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,950
be ultimately managed as networks.

69
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,420
Let's go to the next I mentioned,
the economic dimension, and

70
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:46,510
the originality of the economic
dimension builds on the technical

71
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,020
dimensions just presented.

72
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:56,060
The first economic characteristic
of urban infrastructure systems

73
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,930
is the fact that they have sunk costs.

74
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:08,090
By sunk costs, we mean the fact
that these infrastructures have

75
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,490
to be built for a long time,
the costs are put somehow into

76
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,570
the ground, the money cannot be
used for anything else than

77
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:23,000
these infrastructures. They are
there for a long time, you cannot

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,890
recuperate that
investment immediately.

79
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,270
Building on the sunk costs is the
whole second economic concept:

80
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,920
economies of scale.

81
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:41,060
You have massively invested into
an urban highway, into a metro,

82
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:47,750
and then economies of scale means
that you basically need to

83
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,710
use that infrastructure optimally
more, to bring as much transport

84
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,940
onto the metro system, because
the more you use it, the lower

85
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,950
the marginal cost is.

86
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,510
So, the more transport services you
have on the transport infrastructure,

87
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,660
proportionately the cheaper the
cost of that transport is.

88
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,580
And so, you have huge economies
of scale, meaning that you have

89
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,740
companies, once they have invested,
or once the city has invested,

90
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:27,250
it will force it to basically use
that infrastructure to the optimum.

91
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,270
The third element is, of course, a
consequence of that: that is market power.

92
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:39,110
These sunk costs and economies
of scale of course favor big

93
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,720
companies, not
necessarily competition.

94
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,080
Historically most of these things
are actually monopolies.

95
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,280
By virtue of the technical nature,
the sunk costs, the economies

96
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,250
of scale, these companies, the
urban infrastructure companies,

97
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,480
necessarily have market power, and
have all kinds of possibilities

98
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,910
to discriminate against competitors
who may want to enter the market.

99
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,570
But often competitors are almost
impossible, because who would

100
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:20,830
invest into a second water
pipeline next to the first one?

101
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,760
And the fourth big element here,
in economic dimensions,

102
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,880
is the fact that we are dealing
here with public goods.

103
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,460
Of course, there is a price for these
services, for these infrastructure

104
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:42,940
services, but many of these services
are produced so as to allow

105
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,180
the economic development
of the city itself.

106
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,960
It may be commercially viable,
but some of these services, as

107
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,380
we'll see later, are not commercially
viable, simply because

108
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,620
they have to be provided for
public service purposes.

109
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,780
In purely economic terms, of
course, public goods are things

110
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:14,630
that no economically rationally
behaving actor, enterprise,

111
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,810
would provide, because they
cannot really get paid for it.

112
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,930
But these services are essential
for the overall city to function

113
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,170
and to prosper.

114
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,840
The jurisdictional dimension is
particularly important as most

115
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,320
of the cities of the world, 
most of the agglomerations or

116
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,320
the metropolitan areas are actually
composed of several cities,

117
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,390
and the infrastructures cut
across these different cities.

118
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,910
You have a transportation system,
a road system, a metro system,

119
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,080
that covers different cities.

120
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,010
If you go from one part of Paris
to the other, you will cross

121
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,900
several municipalities, which
are cities in themselves.

122
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,130
And this is the case of the
infrastructure and the services,

123
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,980
and this is a particular challenge
for managing urban infrastructure

124
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,970
systems because you have to
coordinate different organizations,

125
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,560
different operators.

126
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,490
There are basically three challenges
here: one is interconnecting

127
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,590
these systems, so cities have
their own water systems, but at

128
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,940
some point they grow together,
you have to interconnect them.

129
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,970
You have to make things interoperable,
so, for example, a tram

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,090
in one city starts to run on the
tracks of another city, these

131
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,780
things need, of course, to be
interoperable; a bus in one city

132
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,490
will operate in another city of
the big agglomeration area but

133
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,460
it's not necessarily interoperable,
because the ways you go

134
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,180
out of the bus, the height
does not correspond.

135
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,920
You have many things of that sort where
you have to create interoperability,

136
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,140
mainly by way of jurisdictional,
by legal decisions.

137
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,890
And finally, you have to manage
these systems as a whole.

138
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,610
It does not make sense to have,
I don't know, three different

139
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,690
cities in the big agglomeration
of Paris or London and manage

140
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,310
each of them separately, this is
a huge jurisdictional challenge.

141
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,940
Now, the social dimension.

142
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,500
There are positive and negative
aspects in the social dimension.

143
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,970
Among the negative aspects, of
course, there is the equity issue,

144
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,260
the exclusion issue.

145
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,760
For example, you build a highway
right through the city, through

146
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,330
areas where these rather
poor people live.

147
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,640
They cannot cross the street anymore,
they cannot use the highway,

148
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,100
and so, basically, this
is an equity issue.

149
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,090
You create all kinds of exclusion
and there is much of

150
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,480
that in the infrastructures.

151
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,110
But on the other side you also
have positive aspects: if you

152
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,560
have a very good transportation
system, you can transport

153
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,740
the people working or living at 
the periphery of the city to

154
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,820
the center of the city, where the jobs
are, and actually favor inclusion,

155
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,800
and favor a more equitable
development of the city.

156
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,310
So, infrastructures clearly go both
ways: they can favor inequity,

157
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,190
and they can favor equity
at the same time.

158
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,220
That is something managers of
urban infrastructures always have

159
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,290
to watch out for. Very similarly,
the environmental dimension

160
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:03,300
is very similar to that, because
you have negative impacts of

161
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:09,920
infrastructures, you have CO2
emissions from buses, from other

162
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,090
transport, you have pollutants,
you have noise, you have land

163
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,290
use from housing and things like that.

164
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,080
But on the other hand, you also
have positive aspects, like

165
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,920
energy efficient buildings, green
infrastructures, clean energy.

166
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,810
As we have seen in the very beginning,
the city is a place where

167
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:41,730
most of the pollution is created,
but this is also where actually

168
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,380
urban infrastructure managers can
make a difference by reducing

169
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,150
pollution, by reducing greenhouse
gas emissions, and infrastructures

170
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,640
play a key role in that.

171
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,390
And the management of infrastructure,
this is one of the challenges

172
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,930
of the managers of infrastructures.

173
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,830
Now to conclude, we come
back to our framework.

174
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,340
The city, we said, is a complex
sociotechnical system: you have

175
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:16,750
technology, you have jurisdictions,
or rules if you want, institutions

176
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,410
as we call them. And we have seen
that there are big jurisdictional

177
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,230
problems in the sense that often
there is not one single jurisdiction

178
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,570
that covers the whole
metropolitan area.

179
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,130
And then, there are huge economic
dimensions of that: some of

180
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,580
the infrastructures are making
money, some are losing money,

181
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,340
some are lucrative, some
are non-lucrative.

182
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,770
So, those are the three basic
elements: the social dimension,

183
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,140
and the environmental dimension
cut across all this, cut across,

184
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,800
the jurisdictional, the
economic, and the technology.

185
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,880
All that together leads to the performance
of the urban infrastructure system.

186
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,030
Are the infrastructures efficient?

187
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,560
Are they sustainable, is the
energy system sustainable?

188
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:13,750
Are they resilient, meaning can
they recover after a major shock?

189
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:20,660
This is basically the framework, the
way we look at urban infrastructure

190
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,710
management. We look at the
jurisdictional aspect, the economic

191
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,460
aspect, the technology, the
social and the environment, and

192
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,280
see how all these things managed together
in the different infrastructures

193
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,650
lead to efficiency,
sustainability, and resilience.

194
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,310
At the very end of course, what
is important is the quality

195
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,060
of life in the city, the
attractiveness of the city for

196
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,650
the firms and for the inhabitants,
and the competitiveness of

197
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,800
the city in international comparison.

198
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,270
Now, in this session we have seen
the different dimensions of

199
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,980
urban infrastructure systems,
and in the next session we'll

200
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,770
now hear from a practitioner how
this all plays out in reality.
