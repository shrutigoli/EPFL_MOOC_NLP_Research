How are your infrastructures

00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:36,986
We are here at Geneva Railway Station.

10
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:40,261
Geneva is a minor city,
but it is a global hub,

11
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:43,803
important for corporations,
international organizations.

12
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,416
It is, therefore, crucial

13
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:49,253
that infrastructure operations
function perfectly,

14
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:51,407
especially transportation.

15
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:54,955
This creates the attractiveness,
the competitiveness,

16
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:58,001
and the quality of life
that the citizens deserve.

17
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,015
But providing excellent
infrastructure services is challenging.

18
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:09,031
Three big challenges can be identified:
money, time, and system.

19
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:13,075
Money is important
because it takes a lot of money

20
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:14,786
to develop the infrastructures,

21
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:17,513
it takes a lot of money
to maintain the infrastructures--

22
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:19,587
this money has to be found.

23
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,598
Time is important because infrastructures
take a long time to be built,

24
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:27,397
and they will be there for a long time.

25
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:29,862
This requires careful planning.

26
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:31,693
And system is important

27
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:35,079
because infrastructures
depend upon each other.

28
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,394
Housing depends on roads,

29
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,730
roads depend on energy,

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,211
and so we need a systemic approach

31
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:46,329
to deal with urban infrastructures
and urban infrastructure services.

32
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:51,393
State-of-the-art management
of urban infrastructure services is key,

33
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:55,489
but this management is challenging,
for a series of reasons.

34
00:01:56,105 --> 00:02:00,983
The first reason is because operations
are often regulated.

35
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:05,515
The second reason is because there is
a lot of private-sector participation,

36
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:09,693
which requires coordination
between the public and the private.

37
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:12,166
The third reason is
the jurisdictional challenge,

38
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,322
because the city does not correspond
to the agglomeration,

39
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:18,807
and therefore public authorities
need to be coordinated.

40
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:20,711
And the fourth reason is

41
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:22,896
the systemic nature
of the infrastructures.

42
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:26,588
There's often an infrastructure provider
and a service provider

43
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:28,493
that has to be coordinated.

44
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:33,759

<i>In order to obtain
a certificate of this course,</i>

50
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:53,150
<i>the participants have to pass
four graded quizzes,</i>

51
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:56,790
<i>and complete four mandatory assignments,</i>

52
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,373
<i>plus a final exam.</i>

53
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,802
<i>In addition to the graded assignments,</i>

54
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:06,325
<i>students have the option

55
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:08,706
<i>about management of energy,</i>

56
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:11,724
<i>or management

<i>in the city of their choice.</i>

58
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,374
<i>This optional case study will be graded</i>

59
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:20,661
<i>by way of a peer-reviewed
evaluation process.</i>

60
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:25,197
<i>If you decide to take up
this optional challenge,</i>

<i>you will be asked to review
the works of two of your peers,</i>

62
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:31,626
<i>in addition to writing the case study.</i>

63
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:37,990
<i>The best case studies will be evaluated
by our jury at IGLUS,</i>

64
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,095
<i>and the authors of the three best cases</i>

65
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,311
<i>will receive a tuition waiver to enroll</i>

66
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:47,814
<i>in our IGLUS Professional
Executive Program</i>

67
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:50,439
<i>as of Fall 2016.</i>

68
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:55,524
Our course builds on a global action
research project called <i>IGLUS</i>.

69
00:03:55,943 --> 00:04:00,251
IGLUS stands for Innovative Governance
of Large Urban Systems.

70
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:03,488
In this project, as in this course,

71
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:07,278
we work with a series of partner firms
and partner universities.

72
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:11,252
We are the Chair,
Management of Network Industries

73
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,541
at École Polytechnique Fédérale
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

74
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:17,644
We think that managing
urban infrastructures

75
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:20,426
is the challenge of the 21st century,

76
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,450
and we hope
that you will join this course,

77
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,965
and by doing so become part
of addressing this challenge.
