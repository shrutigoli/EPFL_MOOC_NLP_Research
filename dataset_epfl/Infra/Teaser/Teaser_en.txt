How are your infrastructures functioning in the city?
<i>How is your transportation system doing?</i>
<i>Is it working?</i>
<i>Is water running from your taps?</i>
<i>Is waste collected?</i>
<i>Is electricity produced by renewable resources?</i>
<i>Do you have access to greens, and parks?</i>
We are here at Geneva Railway Station.
Geneva is a minor city, but it is a global hub, important for corporations, international organizations.
It is, therefore, crucial that infrastructure operations function perfectly, especially transportation.
This creates the attractiveness, the competitiveness, and the quality of life that the citizens deserve.
But providing excellent infrastructure services is challenging.
Three big challenges can be identified: money, time, and system.
Money is important because it takes a lot of money to develop the infrastructures, it takes a lot of money to maintain the infrastructures-- this money has to be found.
Time is important because infrastructures take a long time to be built, and they will be there for a long time.
This requires careful planning.
And system is important because infrastructures depend upon each other.
Housing depends on roads, roads depend on energy, and so we need a systemic approach to deal with urban infrastructures and urban infrastructure services.
State-of-the-art management of urban infrastructure services is key, but this management is challenging, for a series of reasons.
The first reason is because operations are often regulated.
The second reason is because there is a lot of private-sector participation, which requires coordination between the public and the private.
The third reason is the jurisdictional challenge, because the city does not correspond to the agglomeration, and therefore public authorities need to be coordinated.
And the fourth reason is the systemic nature of the infrastructures.
There's often an infrastructure provider and a service provider that has to be coordinated.
<i>This is a self-paced course, so you can enjoy your learning journey</i>
<i>about management of urban infrastructures</i>
<i>at your own pace.</i>
<i>This edition of the MOOC will be open</i>
<i>from February 15, 2016 onwards.</i>
<i>In order to obtain a certificate of this course,</i>
<i>the participants have to pass four graded quizzes,</i>
<i>and complete four mandatory assignments,</i>
<i>plus a final exam.</i>
<i>In addition to the graded assignments,</i>
<i>students have the option to write a 7 to 10 page case study</i>
<i>about management of energy,</i>
<i>or management of urban transportation systems</i>
<i>in the city of their choice.</i>
<i>This optional case study will be graded</i>
<i>by way of a peer-reviewed evaluation process.</i>
<i>If you decide to take up this optional challenge,</i>
<i>you will be asked to review the works of two of your peers,</i>
<i>in addition to writing the case study.</i>
<i>The best case studies will be evaluated by our jury at IGLUS,</i>
<i>and the authors of the three best cases</i>
<i>will receive a tuition waiver to enroll</i>
<i>in our IGLUS Professional
Executive Program</i>
<i>as of Fall 2016.</i>
Our course builds on a global action research project called <i>IGLUS</i>.
IGLUS stands for Innovative Governance of Large Urban Systems.
In this project, as in this course, we work with a series of partner firms and partner universities.
We are the Chair,
Management of Network Industries at Ã‰cole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale in Lausanne, Switzerland.
We think that managing urban infrastructures is the challenge of the 21st century, and we hope that you will join this course, and by doing so become part of addressing this challenge. â™ª (music) â™ª
