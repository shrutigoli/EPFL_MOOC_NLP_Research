1
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:08,893
Let us now briefly conclude this course.

2
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:14,993
We have talked about the importance
of managing urban infrastructures.

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,041
We have given you the different features
of managing the urban infrastructures.

4
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:25,010
And we have shown you especially
two particular cases:

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,894
urban energy, in particular, electricity,

6
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,572
and urban transport,

7
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,240
what are the main challenges there

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,201
and what should be done
by urban infrastructure managers

9
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:37,980
to address these challenges.

10
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:42,049
Now all what we have done
in this course

11
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:47,197
is part of a broader research
and education endeavor

12
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:48,332
that we are doing.

13
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:49,428
It is called IGLUS -

14
00:00:49,428 --> 00:00:52,490
Innovative Governance
of Large Urban Systems.

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,739
If you are interested in it,

16
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:57,669
if we have triggered
your interest with this course,

17
00:00:57,669 --> 00:01:00,980
so please follow us
on IGLUS.org

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,426
I also would like to take this opportunity

19
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:09,511
to thank a series of people
who have helped us realize this course.

20
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:15,012
First, the partners who have
contributed to lecturing in this course.

21
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:18,864
I would also like to thank
four collaborators

22
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:20,989

26

And, most of all,
I would like to thank you

27
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,892

29
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:39,571
in a follow-up MOOC
on managing urban infrastructures.
