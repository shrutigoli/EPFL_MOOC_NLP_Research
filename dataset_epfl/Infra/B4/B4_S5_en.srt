00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,640
Hello, and welcome back
to this last session of our fourth block

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,472
on Urban Transport.

3
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:17,680
In this session we will talk
about the big challenges

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,997
and opportunities that arise
for urban transport management,

5
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:25,282
and these challenges and opportunities

6
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:28,527
basically arise
from three different angles.

7
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:34,150
The first angle is the urban sprawl
and the corresponding mobility needs

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,049
that are created
because of urban sprawl.

9
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:43,033
The second type of big challenges
arise from the environment,

10
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,643
especially from climate change.

11
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:50,282
The third type of challenges,
and especially opportunities,

12
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:54,341
arise from the information
and communication technologies

13
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:59,558
that have been developed
so rapidly over the past 28 years

14
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,390
and have entered
the whole transportation sector.

15
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:09,413
Now, each of these challenges

16
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:13,143
will be opportunities for managers 
to address them,

17
00:01:13,143 --> 00:01:18,094
and what we will briefly show here
in this last session

18
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:20,249
is how they will address this.

19
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,757
Now, let us first talk about urban sprawl

20
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:25,146
and the corresponding mobility needs.

21
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:31,294
It is clear that mobility has become
a driver of urban sprawl.

22
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:35,481
Think about the development
of the American cities

23
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:40,179
after the Second World War
with overall car use.

24
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:44,396
The whole housing system
has been developed

25
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:49,307
outside of the city because of big roads

26
00:01:49,307 --> 00:01:53,890
and because of cars becoming available,

27
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,493
and it is clear that mobility,
the ability to move,

28
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:03,154
has been driving the overall urban sprawl.

29
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:10,664
On the other hand, the mobility needs
have increased because of urban sprawl.

30
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:15,358
Once the people live outside of the city,
far from their workplaces,

31
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:19,281
they have to move back into the city
and by doing that, create

32
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,893
all kinds of mobility problems,

33
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,426
transportation problems,
congestion problems.

34
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,170
A few examples here.

35
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,737
In India the number
of motorized vehicles on city streets

36
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:38,365
is growing at an annual rate
of more than 20%.

37
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:40,248
Imagine what that means:

38
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:45,834
20% more cars every year
on the streets of the city.

39
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:49,640
You can calculate by when
the whole city will be clogged.

40
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,854
In Mexico, for example,
two new cars enter into circulation

41
00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:58,360
for every newborn child.

42
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:02,639
Those are figures of 2011
but it hasn't improved ever since.

43
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:11,578
I think that the urban sprawl
and the related growing mobility needs

44
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:16,034
are the main challenge
of urban transportation managers

45
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:17,541
in the years to come.

46
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:23,893
It is simply not possible
to continue to develop mobility,

47
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:28,509
especially by way of private cars,
further into the future.

48
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,646
What can they do
to address this challenge?

49
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:41,614
The main challenge will be here

50
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:47,822
to resist investing into further
urban road infrastructure

51
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:50,985
to put ever more cars onto the streets.

52
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:56,359
Sooner or later this will lead
to collapse, to traffic collapse.

53
00:03:57,324 --> 00:04:00,729
What should they do instead?

54
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,854
Resisting is one thing,

55
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:05,726
doing something positive
is something else.

56
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:09,203
What do they have to do instead?

57
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,804
I think the first big task is to do

58
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:17,351
an integrated transport
and housing planning.

59
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:21,534
As we saw before, urban sprawl
and mobility are closely related.

60
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:25,788
It makes no sense to plan
these things separately,

61
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:31,577
to plan housing building separately
from planning transport,

62
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:35,852
or to plan transport separately
from how housing is planned.

63
00:04:36,824 --> 00:04:42,553
The second big task
of urban public transport managers

64
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:47,643
will be to actually increase
the share of public transport

65
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:50,339
in the overall mobility mix.

66
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:56,042
This has two aspects: one is
to incentivize use of public transport.

67
00:04:56,042 --> 00:05:01,165
We have seen that before; public transport
needs to become more efficient

68
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:06,667
and more attractive,
so that the inhabitants of a city

69
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:12,735
actually find it attractive
and efficient to use it.

70
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,491
The other aspect is, of course,
to disincentivize the use of the car

71
00:05:19,491 --> 00:05:26,118
to make it more difficult to use the car
by creating bus lines,

72
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,684
reducing the available space for cars,

73
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:33,066
reducing the available space for parking,

74
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,255
creating bicycle lanes, things like that.

75
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:44,081
But this incentivization, of course,
needs to go hand in hand

76
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:49,262
with the development of other
public transport opportunities.

77
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:53,791
It makes no sense to disincentivize
the use of the car

78
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,818
and then not offer any alternative.

79
00:05:56,818 --> 00:06:02,300
This will only make the transport
more difficult for the users.

80
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:07,783
The second big challenge
are the environmental challenges,

81
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:13,682
and here, especially climate change,
the emissions but also

82
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:16,964
the overall pollution reduction

83
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:21,151
is just another driver, another pressure

84
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:26,014
for urban transportation managers
to develop public transport,

85
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:31,471
to make it more attractive,
to make it more efficient,

86
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:34,552
to incentivize the use
of public transport,

87
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:38,672
to disincentivize the use
of the private car.

88
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:43,115
In addition to that, of course,
there are also other things

89
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,906
that urban transport managers need to do,

90
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:51,626
namely, to create public transport modes
that are less polluting,

91
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:56,612
that are more energy efficient,
that use cleaner technologies,

92
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:02,414
for example, by favoring
electric vehicles, electric buses,

93
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,663
or even electric taxis for that matter.

94
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:09,069
And here, the second big aspect also

95
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,480
is the creation of what we call
"soft mobility",

96
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:19,041
to create dedicated bike lanes,
to create public bicycle offerings,

97
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,233
to create dedicated pedestrian ways.

98
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:28,893
These are not really alternatives
to the urban mobility

99
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:34,393
but they are certainly useful
complements to urban mobility.

100
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:39,643
Often the big problem here
is the last mile.

101
00:07:42,023 --> 00:07:47,110
You get to a metro station
but your house is still 500 meters away

102
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:50,723
or your office is still 500 meters away

103
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:58,534
and easily accessible bicycle
will make all the difference

104
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:02,984
and allow you to have
an integrated mobility chain

105
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:09,835
where soft mobility is complementing
the traditional public transport modes.

106
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:14,499
The third big challenge
that urban transport managers

107
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:19,360
have to face are the ICTs,
but the ICTs are actually

108
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,745
really an opportunity for them.

109
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:28,825
The ICTs have the unique potential
to address the two big challenges

110
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:31,591
that transport managers have to face:

111
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:38,486
namely, discouraging the car use,
and the ICTs, how can they do that?

112
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,957
They can do that by creating
mobility pricing schemes

113
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:47,016
which can incentivize
better mobility behavior.

114
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:50,137
For example, you pay
for congestion pricing,

115
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:54,452
you pay for entering into the city,

116
00:08:54,452 --> 00:09:00,500
you pay more at certain peak hours
than you pay at low peak hours,

117
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,927
and the way the ICTs technologically allow

118
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:11,966
for pricing the mobility of the people

119
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:14,295
who move around in the city.

120
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:20,829
Then this money can be used
to generate the necessary investments

121
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:24,920
to develop or to subsidize
public transport in the city.

122
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,486
The second thing that the ICTs can do

123
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,388
is to make public transport
more attractive.

124
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:38,697
Clearly, the ICTs
can improve the intermodality,

125
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:42,978
that is, the moving from one
transport mode to the other.

126
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:47,619
They can do that by having
a more integrated planning,

127
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:52,074
either for the users,
who can now plan their travels

128
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:54,632
across the different modes smoothly.

129
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:59,105
Sometimes the app will also give you
an indication of alternatives

130
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:04,547
in case there is a problem with a train
or in case there is congestion,

131
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:09,568
but they better allow for better
integrated planning of the city.

132
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:15,273
For example,
across different jurisdictions

133
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:20,380
because thanks to the data
that you now have generated,

134
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,759
you can actually plan
the whole mobility much better.

135
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:32,485
Secondly, it improves intermodality because
the ICT improve integrated ticketing,

136
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:37,792
so you can now buy a ticket
that crosses all the transport modes,

137
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,730
or actually, get rid
of the ticket altogether

138
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,619
because you are billed on your credit card

139
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:46,882
or some other urban integrated ticket,

140
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:51,260
which allows you to use
all the transport modes

141
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,854
and this ticketing you actually
can combine back

142
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,301
with what I said before,
with mobility pricing.

143
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:06,318
Then the ICTs can create new services
such as car sharing services,

144
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:10,655
bicycle sharing services,
ride sharing services, that is,

145
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:17,155
those are services that complement
the traditional public transport modes

146
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:22,073
but allow the users

147
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:25,708
to move much more easily across the city.

148
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:31,280
In this last session we have now seen

149
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:36,016
the big challenges of urban transport

150
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:40,882
and what the urban transport managers
can and should do

151
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:43,038
to respond to these challenges.

152
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:47,352
We have seen that the ICTs
are a big opportunity

153
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:49,572
in doing precisely that.

154
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:55,811
We will now say a few words
to conclude the overall course.

155
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:57,337
Stay tuned.
