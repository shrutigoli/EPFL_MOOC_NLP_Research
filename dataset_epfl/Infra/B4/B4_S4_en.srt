1
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:18,332
The big challenge to cities
in the mobility sector is definitely

2
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:21,045
that their population is growing.

3
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:23,106
More people are coming to the cities

4
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:27,025
and they have to travel around the city.

5
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:30,438
Therefore, the mobility network
has to adapt itself

6
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:33,527
and has to accommodate
these additional people.

7
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:37,642
This can't be done in private car traffic

8
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:40,900
because roads are already saturated.

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,116
More traffic will lead to even more
congestion and more problems

10
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:50,268
and also more environmental
and social damage

11
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:54,262
through pollution and noise,
and more accidents.

12
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:58,638
Therefore, the solution is really
in building more capacity,

13
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:04,054
more lines and more offering

14
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:07,093
in the public transport system,

15
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:13,165
especially in the mass transport
aspect of it in the metro lines,

16
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:19,518
in the suburban rail, in trams,
and in higher capacity bus lines.

17
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:25,785
We need this additional capacity
to accommodate the additional people

18
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:32,100
and also move current car drivers
into the public transport system

19
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,855
in order to improve the city life
and the quality of life for the citizens.

20
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:43,720
Now, after the investment
in mass transit systems

21
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,841
which really will create the backbone
for the whole mobility system in the city,

22
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:54,110
we can then add to that
combined mobility solutions

23
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,525
in walking, cycling, car sharing,
other forms of transport

24
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,775
which are much cheaper to realize

25
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:06,028
and will offer
the last-mile solution for the cities

26
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:09,377
on top of a public transport system.

27
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,265
It is important to realize this as well,

28
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:18,384
but they can't be the only solution.
They can't be alone.

29
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:23,049
They have to come on top
of big infrastructure investments

30
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:24,946
in public transport capacity,

31
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:30,408
which is really the main solution
to the challenge of the city in mobility.

32
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:50,081
The realization of integrated
mobility system in a city poses,

33
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:53,535
of course, how to bring together
all these different actors

34
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:55,992
and work them together efficiently,

35
00:02:55,992 --> 00:03:00,261
and this is a very complex problem
because there are a lot of actors

36
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,430
coming into the field of mobility.

37
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:07,615
The traditional operators
of different modes of transport,

38
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:12,183
the planning side,
of course, from the city,

39
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:17,372
and the new operators
from the combined mobility solutions:

40
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:22,938
bike sharing, car sharing,
and other associations as well

41
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:25,870
that are important to be integrated.

42
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,219
Therefore, how to work
together efficiently

43
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,851
is really the challenge that poses,

44
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:36,165
and I am convinced that even
the best city planning department

45
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:41,674
can't do everything by itself,
but has to delegate some competence

46
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:48,132
and some, even, freedom of management
to the different players

47
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:50,871
and treat them as partners,

48
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:53,775
and work together with them as partners.

49
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,695
Of course, there needs to be
some formal arrangement

50
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,598
in the form of a contract

51
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:05,621
that regulates the main aspects,
financing aspects and performance aspects

52
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,282
that then can be followed on

53
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:13,924
and measured concerning
if these different actors

54
00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:16,957
make a good job or not.

55
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:20,490
An important part in that,
that I am convinced,

56
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,968
is that these contracts,
objectives and arrangements

57
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:26,739
have to be made public.

58
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:31,785
They have to be fully transparent
to the citizens, and to the users,

59
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:34,271
to the passengers of public transport

60
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:38,488
in order for them to follow up
what your goals are

61
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:44,704
and if the different actors
make a correct job in realizing this

62
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:48,146
and if this is not the case,
there have to be consequences,

63
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:52,235
financial consequences
in the form of incentives and penalties

64
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:58,473
and even if everything goes wrong
and no corrective action is efficient,

65
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:02,591
they have to be changed,
and I think it is important

66
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,907
even for us as operators,
public transport operators,

67
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:10,454
to know that we can be replaced
if we don't do a good job,

68
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:16,275
but we have to have a certain freedom
in achieving our goals,

69
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:20,393
and we have to know, of course, our goals
for several years ahead

70
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:23,551
in order to be prepared and to plan ahead

71
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:26,993
and be able to realize them well.

72
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:41,640
In order to realize all these
important objectives and goals

73
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,924
for an improved and more efficient
public transport network,

74
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:51,642
we need, of course, everybody
to work together towards that goal.

75
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:57,247
People have to realize that the priority
should be public transport

76
00:05:57,412 --> 00:06:01,925
as a backbone, as a base
for the success of their city,

77
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:05,791
economically, socially,
and environmentally,

78
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:09,393
meaning at the end, also
for the quality of life in the city.

79
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:15,595
So, city managers, city politicians,
but also other levels of government

80
00:06:15,595 --> 00:06:20,459
on a regional, national level,
have really to come together

81
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:23,218
and define together public transport

82
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:27,355
as a priority for the success
and for the future of their city

83
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:32,368
and if that is done, then the conditions
can be set accordingly,

84
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:38,064
and the laws can be put right
in order to allow for public transport

85
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:43,546
to be developed and to be financed
and to be successful in the future.

86
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:46,953
I believe that this is happening right now

87
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:51,968
and people are coming together
and are seeing that the priority

88
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:58,082
should be on public transport development
in order to become a successful city.
