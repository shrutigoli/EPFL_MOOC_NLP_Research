1
00:00:05,457 --> 00:00:08,921
Now, here we want to talk
about the main features

2
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:11,765
of urban transportation management.

3
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:17,133
We will do so by distinguishing
between the performance dimension,

4
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:22,812
the management of the different
transportation modes and infrastructures,

5
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:25,951
and, at the end,
we will actually ask the question

6
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:30,469
of who is really in charge
of the urban transportation system.

7
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,575
Now, the main performance dimensions.

8
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:37,994
There are actually
two such dimensions, and those are:

9
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:43,651
this is the performance of the urban
transportation system as a whole.

10
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:47,877
We're not talking here
about the performance of the bus,

11
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:49,672
or the taxi, or something like that.

12
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,749
We're talking about the performance

13
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:55,486
of the overall
urban transportation system.

14
00:00:56,427 --> 00:01:00,212
Now, the first criteria
really is efficiency--

15
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:03,763
how efficient is that system?

16
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:07,328
How much time do you actually need?

17
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:12,667
How much time do you spend
in the urban transportation system?

18
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,918
This relates to congestion,

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,479
the congestion of the overall system,

20
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,522
and, of course,
also about the reliability,

21
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:25,729
the plannability of that.

22
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,492
You may take a little longer,

23
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:31,231
but you are sure it's going
to take you that much time,

24
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:34,617
is different from, say, "Okay,
sometimes it takes me half an hour.

25
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:37,081
Sometimes it takes me one hour."

26
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:42,295
So this is the time efficiency
of the urban transportation.

27
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:45,815
Then there is an energy-efficiency issue.

28
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:49,895
We have seen that 30%
of global energy consumption

29
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:55,073
is actually used by transport,
by urban transport,

30
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,511
and 25% of the CO2 emissions of a city

31
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:01,881
stem directly from transport,

32
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:07,586
so the efficiency question here is
how much energy do you consume?

33
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,434
Can you reduce that?

34
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:12,509
Can you get the same
transportation service

35
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:16,503
with less energy consumed,
and can you pollute less?

36
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,567
And the third efficiency criteria,
of course,

37
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:22,539
is the economic criteria of cost.

38
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:27,407
How cost-effective is
your urban transportation system?

39
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:31,788
Compared to how much you pay for it,

40
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:35,533
how many services
do you actually get out of it?

41
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:38,973
And, as we know,
there are two types of payments.

42
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:43,171
There are prices for the transport,
and then there are subsidies

43
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:45,806
by the public authorities
for this transport,

44
00:02:45,806 --> 00:02:50,125
but in both cases
it's an efficiency question, of course.

45
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:55,056
The second important criteria is

46
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:58,656
the attractiveness of public transport,

47
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:02,169
of urban public transport
vis-Ă -vis the car.

48
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:10,315
It is given that urban public transport
should substitute,

49
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,185
as much as possible, the car,

50
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:20,558
and here the question is,
how accessible is urban public transport?

51
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:24,068
Do you have a bus stand all...

52
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:27,928
The generally agreed idea today is
that somehow,

53
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:30,223
within five-minutes' walking distance,

54
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:34,968
you should have the ability to access

55
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:41,034
a bus or a metro, or a bike stand,
or something like this,

56
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:46,399
and so the accessibility is one
of the first criteria of attractiveness.

57
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:50,264
The second criterion is the affordability:

58
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:54,367
how affordable is that system?
And affordability--

59
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,715
as we have discussed before,
in a previous block--

60
00:03:57,715 --> 00:04:01,220
affordability is very much related
to social criteria.

61
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,268
It may be affordable for rich people,

62
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:05,237
but not affordable for poor people.

63
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:09,871
You want to make urban public transport
affordable for everyone.

64
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:14,472
The third element here is
the intermodality.

65
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:18,338
What sense does it make
to buy a ticket for the bus,

66
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:21,471
then to get out, wait for a train,
buy another ticket,

67
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:23,979
and use the credit card for your bike?

68
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,610
Ideally, you would like
to have one ticket.

69
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,051
Ideally, you would have
to have everything nicely--

70
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:34,238
all the different modes
nicely interconnected,

71
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:37,561
and that will make
your urban public transport system

72
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:40,887
much more attractive vis-Ă -vis the car.

73
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:44,225
If you have to take the car
before you can take the bus,

74
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:46,451
and before you can take the train,

75
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,676
then that is not
a really attractive system,

76
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:51,922
because probably you will have a problem

77
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:54,708
finding a parking space somewhere.

78
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,769
And the fourth criterion here
is convenience,

79
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:00,885
and by convenience we mean,
is the bus clean?

80
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:04,482
Is the train clean? Is there A/C?

81
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:09,541
Are you harassed?
Is the bus driver friendly?

82
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:10,937
These kind of things.

83
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:14,635
So basically two things
that are important here:

84
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:18,783
you want the urban
transportation system to be efficient--

85
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:22,450
in cost, time, and energy terms,

86
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,174
and you want it to be attractive.

87
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,683
And the management
of the urban transportation system,

88
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:36,132
how it is managed, will decide
how well-performing it is,

89
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:40,673
how attractive it is,
how efficient it ultimately is.

90
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:43,929
So the management is the function by which

91
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:48,649
attractiveness and efficiency
of urban public transport is created.

92
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:53,849
Now let's look at the different
management functions.

93
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:58,957
And here we will already see
how difficult it is to achieve that.

94
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:03,701
Now, we have operations.

95
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,137
So basically it is operations
of the vehicles,

96
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:11,427
operations of the interfaces,

97
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:14,760
operations of the infrastructures.

98
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,120
There are technical aspects to that.

99
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,548
There are timetables
that need to be operated.

100
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:24,138
There are human resources
that need to be managed.

101
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:27,256
And then there's everything
that relates to the customers,

102
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:30,544
to the customer relations:
the fares need to be collected,

103
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:33,145
the complaints need to be handled,

104
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:35,539
the customers need to be informed,

105
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:38,032
they need to have
a hotline, things like that.

106
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:42,514
So first management function:
how well is the operations

107
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:46,430
of that urban
and infrastructure system done?

108
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:51,173
And, as we will see later,
each mode, each operator,

109
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:55,014
has their own operations--
there is no overall operations.

110
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,233
We have talked about maintenance,

111
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:02,560
the maintenance of infrastructures,
vehicles, and interfaces.

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,215
And here, of course, you have to maintain

113
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,426
every single infrastructure separately,
every vehicle separately,

114
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:12,708
every interface, every station separately.

115
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:16,629
But the challenge, of course,
for management of urban infrastructure,

116
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:20,876
transport infrastructures,
is how to coordinate all this.

117
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:26,775
So when you repair
the tramline in the street,

118
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,533
you don't want to block the street
during the day.

119
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,307
You want to block it during the night,

120
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:35,876
in order not to hamper
the other transport modes--

121
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,448
coordination of maintenance.

122
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:42,154
And the third one is, of course,
planning, as we have seen.

123
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,601
Infrastructures need to be planned.

124
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,900
Interfaces need to be planned.

125
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,983
New vehicles need to be bought.

126
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:54,459
Again, these different things
need to be coordinated

127
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:56,982
among each other in order to make

128
00:07:56,982 --> 00:08:01,646
the urban transportation system
efficient and attractive.

129
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,015
Now, how is this concretely done?

130
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:10,027
We have the different transport modes,

131
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:13,170
and the different
transportation infrastructures,

132
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:18,313
and each of them has, actually,
their own management logic.

133
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,843
Let's start with the roads.

134
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:24,278
We have seen that the roads
are the biggest chunk

135
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:27,978
of the urban transport infrastructure.

136
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:32,432
So most of it are roads,
and how are roads managed?

137
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:36,763
Roads are generally
not only planned, but maintained,

138
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:42,230
and often even managed,
by a city road department

139
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,586
that operates the road,
that plans the road,

140
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:47,256
that maintains the road.

141
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:50,803
It's a separate department in each city.

142
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:54,725
Remember, we have talked
about jurisdictional challenges,

143
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:57,336
and most of the major cities of the world

144
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:01,078
are not composed of one city,
but they're composed of several cities.

145
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:05,658
So each of these cities has
their own road department.

146
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:10,151
Now, taxis are running on the road,

147
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:11,988
they are using the road.

148
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:18,350
So taxis are basically private operators

149
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:24,523
licensed by a public authority,
a local taxi authority.

150
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:28,141
Again, we have probably,
and you have experienced that:

151
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,431
cities' agglomerations,

152
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:33,651
metropolitan areas with several cities,

153
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:39,027
each of them having their own
local taxi authority, licensing,

154
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:42,095
their own taxi company or companies.

155
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:45,410
Then we have buses:

156
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:50,800
minibuses, public buses,
and private bus companies.

157
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:56,501
This is maybe the most coordinated thing
you can find in the city.

158
00:09:56,983 --> 00:10:01,718
There is a local
transport authority, generally,

159
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:07,927
and this local transport authority
licenses or controls

160
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:10,941
the different bus operating companies,

161
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:14,653
and hopefully makes
some sort of coordination

162
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:18,706
among these bus companies
when they plan the timetables,

163
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:20,458
or the tickets,

164
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,498
or the intermodal links
with other transport modes.

165
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:28,691
But the local transport authority 
is a different authority

166
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:30,623
than the local taxi authority,

167
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:35,048
and is a different authority
than the city road department.

168
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:37,513
And, again, in the case
of metropolitan areas

169
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,438
where you have different cities,

170
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,882
you will have different
local transport authorities.

171
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,271
The effort, of course, being

172
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:49,034
to creating one single one
in a metropolitan area.

173
00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:51,891
And then you have
the other transport modes.

174
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,581
You have trams.

175
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:57,039
Now trams are companies in their own,

176
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,278
which own their own tracks,

177
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,621
which basically organize themselves.

178
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:06,918
They manage themselves,
they operate, they maintain,

179
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:09,149
and they plan for themselves,

180
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:14,669
not necessarily, rarely coordinated
with any of the other authorities.

181
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,030
The same goes, actually,
for the agglomeration metro operator,

182
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,781
which owns the tracks
and operates the metro,

183
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:28,016
but is not necessarily working
under the local transport authority.

184
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:32,411
And then we have, thirdly,
the national train operator,

185
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:35,390
which crosses the city,
and has stations in the city,

186
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,587
operates the tracks
and even the railway stations,

187
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:41,121
but this operator is a national operator,

188
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:44,402
not a local, metropolitan operator.

189
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:49,034
Each of these operators:
the train operator, the tram operator,

190
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:51,897
the metro operator,
the transport authority,

191
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:55,724
the taxi authority,
the city road authority,

192
00:11:55,724 --> 00:12:02,205
they all function separately
and are not necessarily coherent.

193
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:05,576
So you see the challenge of providing

194
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:09,719
an efficient and an attractive
public transport system

195
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:16,095
with such a fragmented type of operators.

196
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:20,053
Let me illustrate that, again,
in another format,

197
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:23,426
by asking who actually is in charge.

198
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,599
So, who is in charge?

199
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:30,958
We have the different transport modes:

200
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,498
cycles, cars, buses,
trams, metros and trains,

201
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:39,078
and we have different ways
of coordinating:

202
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:42,477
competition, tendering,
and monopoly, as we have seen.

203
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:46,860
Let's start with bicycles,
a new addition to the city.

204
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,663
But bicycles, we may have
a public bike provider by the city.

205
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:57,417
The city provides public bikes,
which can be free, or not free.

206
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,700
There may be, in parallel to that,

207
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,228
a private, or several
bike-sharing companies

208
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:05,599
operating inside the city.

209
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:10,489
The bike-sharing company
probably has a license, and is tendered,

210
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,601
whereas the public bike provider is there

211
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:15,924
by virtue of a monopoly of the city.

212
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:18,244
They may compete against each other.

213
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:24,597
As for the cars, we have
different types of cars operating,

214
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:30,127
and I'm not even talking now
about Uber and new types of taxis

215
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:34,503
and vehicles operating in the city,
car-sharing and all that.

216
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:40,410
But, basically, we can have
private car-sharing companies.

217
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,030
They are competing against each other,
and are basically unregulated.

218
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:51,332
Then we have private car-rental companies,

219
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:55,414
which are competing against each other,
and are not regulated.

220
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:58,705
And then we have taxi companies,
private taxi companies.

221
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:02,339
As we have seen,
they are generally tendered

222
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,367
and licensed by a local authority.

223
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:08,318
All of them provide car services.

224
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:13,168
As for buses, we have
private minibus companies,

225
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:16,789
private bus companies,
public bus companies.

226
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,382
As we have seen before,
all of these are generally

227
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:26,680
somehow coordinated
by a city transport authority,

228
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,019
but some are tendered,
some are there by virtue

229
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,484
of being publicly owned by the city.

230
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:40,121
The tram, as we have seen before,
is generally a public tram company,

231
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:43,432
a monopolistic public tram company,

232
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:48,825
which can or cannot operate
under local transport authority.

233
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:52,588
The same goes for the metro company,

234
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:56,049
which can be a public company,
a city-owned company

235
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,754
or a private metro operator.

236
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:02,478
It has a license,
it is authorized by someone,

237
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:07,105
but not necessarily operating
under the control

238
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:11,117
of the transport authority of the city.

239
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:16,305
And then we have
a public transport authority,

240
00:15:16,305 --> 00:15:20,690
a public transport company,
which can basically own all the three:

241
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,920
the bus, the tram, and the metro,

242
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,604
but it doesn't necessarily
have to be the case.

243
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:31,127
And then for trains, we basically have
a public train company

244
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:32,846
which is nationally owned.

245
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:36,250
So, I ask you, who is in charge?

246
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,292
Who is in charge of the urban
public transport system?

247
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:46,202
So, what have we seen?
We have seen a basically

248
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:51,035
fragmented and uncoordinated
urban transport system,

249
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:56,795
and this contrasts very much
with the thing I have presented

250
00:15:56,795 --> 00:16:01,064
in the previous block,
namely urban electricity.

251
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:06,200
We have, historically,
one urban electricity operator,

252
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,952
which is getting a little bit fragmented
because of competition,

253
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:14,607
but basically it's one operator
of the urban electricity system.

254
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:19,663
In the case of transport,
we have nothing like it.

255
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,377
So, who can then make urban transport

256
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:26,877
more efficient and more attractive?

257
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:32,243
We have seen that these are
the two main performance criteria

258
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:34,895
that one should strive at.

259
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:37,169
Now, you may say the city should do that,

260
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,947
but the city, we have seen,
is several things.

261
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:44,411
It is a transport authority.
The city is a road department.

262
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:47,002
The city is a taxi licensing authority.

263
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:50,004
The city may be the tram owner,
the metro owner.

264
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,535
The city, in terms of transport,
is not necessarily

265
00:16:55,535 --> 00:17:00,386
a coherently operating thing
which can, by itself,

266
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,769
create efficiency and attractiveness
of urban public transport.

267
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:09,482
So then, who can speak
for the mobility needs

268
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:12,010
of the urban transport customers?

269
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:14,721
When we talked about the criteria before,

270
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:17,150
I showed you
that what the customer wants

271
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,991
is convenience, intermodality,

272
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:24,131
time efficiency,

273
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:28,516
energy efficiency, things like that.

274
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:34,262
It is difficult to imagine
how the mobility needs

275
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,575
of the urban public transport user

276
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:42,791
can actually be satisfied
with such a fragmented system.

277
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:49,064
So in the next session
we will hear from an expert about this,

278
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:52,251
and in the session thereafter,
we will hear from a CEO

279
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:55,832
of one of the operators in a city context,

280
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:59,973
an urban bus operator,
how this all looks like.
