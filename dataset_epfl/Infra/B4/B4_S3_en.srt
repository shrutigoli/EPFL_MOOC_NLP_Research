00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:09,278
Hi, I am Robert Paaswell.
I am a Distinguished Professor

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:16,464
Today I am going to talk about managing
urban transportation systems.

3
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:18,954
Urban transportation systems are 
complicated.

4
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:25,154
We all know of urban traffic, trucks,
cars, buses, everything in city streets.

5
00:00:25,154 --> 00:00:28,996
I am going to concentrate on urban public 
transportation,

6
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:34,525
which is the most complex and probably
one of the most money-consuming

7
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:37,155
aspects of public transportation.

8
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:42,511
of what urban modes are.

9
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:40,225
I am going to go through an overview,
a quick overview,

10
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:11,768
of Civil Engineering at the City College
of New York

11
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:46,561
Who owns the urban modes? 
Who owns the public transportation system?

12
00:00:46,644 --> 00:00:48,744
Who owns the streets?

13
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:51,923
What are the roles of social contracts?

14
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:53,563
We provide public transportation

15
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:55,613
because we feel 
there is a public need for it,

16
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:59,239
and we want to know what creates that need
and who is responsible for it.

17
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:03,884
And then, once we get into who owns it,
and the fact that it is public,

18
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:06,725
we have to get into political issues.

19
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:10,753
Public transportation is big business

20
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:14,513
and there are political interests
involved in it.

21
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:17,350
But let me start first with the job.

22
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,823
Urban public transportation
is very simple.

23
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:26,416
The job is to meet the demand
of the people who want to travel.

24
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:32,649
And so the role of the public 
transit manager is to provide trips.

25
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:36,059
Or, as we say in the 
public transportation jargon,

26
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:38,157
we have to "meet service".

27
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:41,277
So the public transit manager
every day gets up

28
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:44,334
and gets a sheet on his or her desk,

29
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:47,307
that says, "Have I met service"?

30
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,999
Do I have enough vehicles
and enough person power--

31
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:54,384
bus operators, conductors, maintainers,

32
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:55,754
to meet that service?

33
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:58,183
And if I don't, why don't I?

34
00:01:58,548 --> 00:02:02,298
The service that you have
is a function of urban demand.

35
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,502
How many people want the service?

36
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:07,776
What kinds of trips are they taking? 
Are they business trips, working trips?

37
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:10,108
So where do they start
and where do they end?

38
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:12,859
Where should I have my routes?
How often should I put out

39
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:17,739
the number of buses or rail cars,
or light rail cars that I need?

40
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,887
So once you have a sense of demand,

41
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:22,957
you then know the equipment 
that you need.

42
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:25,970
When you know how often 
you have to provide that equipment,

43
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,480
you know the number of drivers you have,

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,930
and once you have all the equipment,
you know everything else.

45
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:34,848
Once you understand demand,
which is the big outside figure,

46
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:36,569
once you know 
where people are coming from,

47
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:38,935
and where they are going to 
and when they are coming

48
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:41,638
and when they want to go,
and what you need for that,

49
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:42,941
you pretty much know

50
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:46,231
that you are going to have 
to establish funding to pay for that,

51
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:50,531
and so you have to work 
on a couple of budgets--

52
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:53,634
an operating budget and a capital budget.

53
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:57,024
You need to understand that
if you are going to provide service

54
00:02:57,054 --> 00:03:00,457
you need to have the funds 
in order to provide that service.

55
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:03,061
And finally you are going to have 
to have a system of management,

56
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:04,791
to manage the system.

57
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,172
And I will talk about that 
in a few minutes too,

58
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:10,142
but you are going to have to have an overall chief

59
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:13,352
somebody that says, "this is the way
we are going to operate service today"

60
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:16,875
and you are going to have 
to have an organization

61
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,665
that is designed to provide that service.

62
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:21,239
You are going to have 
to have bus operators,

63
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:23,872
you are going to have 
to have bus maintainers,

64
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:26,591
you are going to have 
to have people to clean the station,

65
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:30,431
you are going to have to have people 
to buy the equipment, to plan the routes,

66
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:32,586
to organize the system.

67
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:35,402
So you find that transit organizations

68
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:37,702
become very complex organizations

69
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:39,817
because there are a lot of things to do

70
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:44,783
in order to, very simply, 
have your bus at your bus-stop

71
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,803
when you want it in the morning.

72
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:52,005
In the United States we have 
different kinds of ownership models

73
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:54,298
but the primary ownership model 
in the United States

74
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:56,798
is a Public Authority,

75
00:03:56,798 --> 00:04:02,398
and a Public Authority 
is a unit of state government ususally.

76
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:05,467
It operates like a corporation

77
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:08,546
It has got a board of directors 
or a board of managers

78
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:10,896
that is usually appointed 
by a public official

79
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:12,452
or a set of public officials.

80
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,282
In some cases they might be elected
by the population.

81
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,720
And their job is to set the oversight

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,250
and operating conditions 
of the organization

83
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,602
and to basically hire the general manager,

84
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:27,142
the person that is going to manage 
all the operations.

85
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:31,247
And then the general manager's job

86
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:34,918
is to provide the service

87
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,747
and reporting to the board are 
what we call operating units.

88
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:43,088
For example, in New York City, we have 
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,

89
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:46,122
which is like a holding company in a sense.

90
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:49,511
It sets the rules, 
it negotiates the budget,

91
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:53,901
it sets the hours of operation, 
the fare policy and everything else.

92
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:56,615
But the New York City Transit

93
00:04:56,615 --> 00:05:03,385
provides the buses and rail cars,

94
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:08,494
and the whole personnel system

95
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:12,764
to maintain that to provide the service.

96
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:19,229
One of the reasons 
that you have an oversight body

97
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,304
is that the public demands accountability
for its public transportation systems.

98
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:28,534
It wants to make sure that 
whoever is operating the public transit

99
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:30,919
does it with the public in mind

100
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,339
and is not, in a sense, 
taking advantage of the public

101
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,599
but is meeting 
the public demand for service

102
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:39,599
at times and places that they want,
contracting out for services,

103
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:43,389
something that is done in Europe

104
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,457
and something that we are beginning 
to look at in the United States.

105
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:47,537
It has come later.

106
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:51,301
But you recognize that 
when you are contracting out for service,

107
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:54,268
the person who is providing the service

108
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:57,268
is looking for a profit, 
if it is a private sector.

109
00:05:57,268 --> 00:06:00,158
In this they need a profit.
In the public sector there is no profit.

110
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:03,338
But there are pluses and minuses 
on both sides.

111
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:07,626
Public transportation 
has always been considered a public good,

112
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:11,334
but the amount that the public pays 
for that public good

113
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:14,919
is depending on politics of the region.

114
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:23,179
In the European Union the general feeling
is that the public should pay

115
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:27,651
the full and true operating costs
of the service,

116
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,371
not the capital cost, not the cost 
to build the system

117
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:32,160
but the true operating cost.

118
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:37,812
In the United States the fares are set 
at politically acceptable levels,

119
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:40,778
levels that the politicians,

120
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,324
the people that control the system
whether it is a governor or a mayor,

121
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:47,174
or some local unit of government,

122
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:52,038
feels that it is a reasonable fare 
for someone to pay

123
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,308
so that they can get to work

124
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:57,384
they can get to the hospital,
if they are seniors,

125
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:05,424
they can carry out activities 
without any kind of hinderance.

126
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:07,557
And as a result the fares 
in the United States

127
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:11,877
only reach about thirty to fifty percent
of the operating costs,

128
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:14,915
so operating costs in the United States

129
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:16,425
have to be subsidized.

130
00:07:16,425 --> 00:07:20,977
Public transportation 
is inherently a political entity.

131
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:26,143
It is up to the local managers 
of the public transit system

132
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:29,603
to convince the funding agencies,

133
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:32,603
the people who are going 
to provide the subsidies

134
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:35,821
that these are necessary 
for the levels of service

135
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:40,052
that everything is priced right, 
the oversight is in place

136
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:42,136
you are buying things, 
you are bidding packages,

137
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:45,326
everything is within reason 
will work well,

138
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:46,876
and you can only meet the demand

139
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:50,205
if you get the subsidy 
to complete the subsidy

140
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:53,365
plus the fares and meet 
the total operating needs.
