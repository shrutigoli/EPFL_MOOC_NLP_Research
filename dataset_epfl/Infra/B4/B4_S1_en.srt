00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,524
Hello and welcome to this fourth block.

2
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:11,192
In this block, we will talk

3
00:00:11,192 --> 00:00:14,469
about the management of urban
transportation systems,

4
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,223
the challenges these systems face,

5
00:00:17,743 --> 00:00:22,109
and all this more or less
in the context of efficiency.

6
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:29,887
Now, this block is composed
of five different sessions.

7
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:33,346
So in the first session, very briefly,

8
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:38,639
I will introduce you to the main features
of the urban transportation--

9
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,735
the building blocks
of the urban transportation systems.

10
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:46,951
Then we will talk in the second block
about managing these systems.

11
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:52,928
We will hear from an expert
on what the challenges are

12
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:56,159
for managing these urban
transportation systems,

13
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,856
and then we will hear from another expert

14
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:03,690
what the challenges are
from an operator's perspective.

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,107
Finally, I will talk about
the broader challenges

16
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:09,382
and the opportunities that arise

17
00:01:09,382 --> 00:01:13,499
in the context of the new things
that are recently happening,

18
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:17,911
that are recently <i>affecting</i>
urban transport.

19
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:24,661
Now, the first block, as I said,
is basically about the basic--

20
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,074
the main features
of transportation in cities.

21
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:31,722
It is quite simple,
but it is, nevertheless,

22
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:34,285
essential to understand these features.

23
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,986
I would like to first talk briefly

24
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:40,002
about how transport
relates to the structure of the city

25
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:42,516
and then about
the physical infrastructure:

26
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:45,786
the transportation modes
and the interfaces.

27
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:52,225
Transport is clearly the most structuring
infrastructure of a city.

28
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:56,606
Remember when we talked about energy,
and electricity in general,

29
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:59,732
we said that this
is the lifeblood of the city.

30
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:02,513
But transport
is the structure of the city.

31
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:07,140
And it basically has two elements.

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,637
One is housing.

33
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:13,420
Housing, or the built environment
more generally,

34
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,606
is closely related to transport.

35
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:22,136
The way the city is structured
in terms of housing

36
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:26,639
will determine what kind of transport
you can develop.

37
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:33,287
So if you think, for example,
of a medieval Italian city,

38
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:37,044
what kind of transport
infrastructure possibilities

39
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:39,304
do you actually have there?

40
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:42,596
What kind of mobility possibilities
do you have there?

41
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:45,692
Or if you take a big city

42
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:49,320
that has been developed
after the second World War,

43
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,484
the houses are structured,
the way the houses are arranged,

44
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:58,124
structures transport
very very differently.

45
00:02:58,124 --> 00:03:01,314
but it also works the other way around.

46
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,815
So if you have a good transport offer,

47
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:07,381
let's say a very good
metro system into suburbia,

48
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,660
that will affect the way
the housing is being developed,

49
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,564
or the industrial and the commercial
development that happens.

50
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:18,610
You build shopping malls
where the metro stations are.

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,420
Transport is also a significant driver
of urban energy consumption.

52
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,138
We have seen in the last section

53
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:31,544
that transport consumes
25% of the energy

54
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,254
that goes into a city.

55
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:41,481
And so whatever you do with transport,
it affects energy consumption,

56
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:43,314
and it will affect pollution.

57
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:49,546
Now let's quickly go into
the basic infrastructures of transport.

58
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:54,740
There are underground
transport infrastructures,

59
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,323
like metro tracks, like train tracks.

60
00:03:58,323 --> 00:04:00,576
Then above the ground--

61
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:03,077
the majority of the things
are above the ground,

62
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,285
like surface train tracks
or surface metro tracks.

63
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:11,106
But the big chunk of the city
is taken away by roads.

64
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:14,221
Yet, on the roads you have several things.

65
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,512
You have the tram tracks,
you have the light metro tracks,

66
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:20,375
that take off some space from the road.

67
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:23,874
You have dedicated bus lanes on the road.

68
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:27,294
You have sidewalks that are on the road,

69
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:33,847
and then you have, sometimes,
dedicated bicycle lanes on the road.

70
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:38,877
So this, together, makes the basic
infrastructure of the city.

71
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:43,385
Now, on top of that,
you have the main transportation modes

72
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,451
that use these infrastructures.

73
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:49,752
So you have public buses, trams and metros

74
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:53,292
that use the road
or the underground tracks.

75
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:58,787
You have cycling 
that uses the sidewalks or the street,

76
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:01,341
because there may be no sidewalks,

77
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:08,106
you have driving cars
which basically use up most of the roads,

78
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:12,692
but are recently being pushed back
by other transport modes,

79
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:16,180
you have taxis that use the roads

80
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,607
and you have pedestrians
that use the sidewalks, if they exist,

81
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:25,224
or also the road,
in which case this is dangerous.

82
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,244
And then you have, of course,
the trains and the metros

83
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:33,045
and the trams that use the surface tracks.

84
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:37,608
Now, the third element here
are the interfaces.

85
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:42,191
And the interfaces take other space -
infrastructure space.

86
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:43,551
You have bus stops.

87
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:46,169
Bus stops use a piece of the road,

88
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:50,974
but we know that actually bus stops
often use a piece of the sidewalks

89
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:54,045
or even of the bicycle lanes.

90
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,870
We have cycling stands,

91
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,180
we have parkings,
which use up a lot of space in the city,

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,660
because actually most of the time
the car stands still.

93
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,896
It drives into the city in the morning,
it drives out in the evening again,

94
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:13,396
and during the rest of the day it occupies space

95
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:18,399
without actually any
active productivity of the space.

96
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,175
Taxis use taxi stands,
pedestrians use sidewalks,

97
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:27,691
and then we have stations
above and under the ground.

98
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:31,880
Those are the main interfaces,
and all these things together

99
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,626
make up for the transportation
infrastructure of a city.

100
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,764
In this session, we have basically
looked at the main features.

101
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:43,119
It is quite trivial.

102
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,874
You have the key elements here,

103
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:50,360
but it is essential to understand
how things are then managed from there.

104
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,625
In the next session,
I will talk about the management

105
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,920
of these urban transport
infrastructure systems.

106
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,350
Stay tuned.
