Let us now briefly conclude this course.
We have talked about the importance of managing urban infrastructures.
We have given you the different features of managing the urban infrastructures.
And we have shown you especially two particular cases: urban energy, in particular, electricity, and urban transport, what are the main challenges there and what should be done by urban infrastructure managers to address these challenges.
Now all what we have done in this course is part of a broader research and education endeavor that we are doing.
It is called IGLUS -
Innovative Governance of Large Urban Systems.
If you are interested in it, if we have triggered your interest with this course, so please follow us on IGLUS.org
