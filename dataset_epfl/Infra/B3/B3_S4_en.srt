00:00:05,186 --> 00:00:07,403
Hello, and welcome back.

2
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:12,688
In this session we want to talk
about the challenges

3
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:16,090
to managing urban electricity systems,

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,890
and these challenges come
from three different angles,

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,680
from three different perspectives,

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,490
and all these challenges affect
the management functions

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,430
that we have identified:

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,430
the grid management,

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,591
the grid reinforcement,

10
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:35,901
the grid development,

11
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:39,235
the customer relations,
and the purchasing.

12
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:43,467
Each of these challenges
affect these functions differently.

13
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:48,127
The three challenges are basically
the market liberalization,

14
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:51,280
the electricity market liberalization,

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,753
environmental challenges,
and climate change in particular,

16
00:00:55,753 --> 00:01:00,571
and then the role of the information
and communication technologies.

17
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:02,956
Let's look at each of them separately,

18
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:07,569
and let's start with electricity
market liberalization.

19
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:12,278
So, in many countries,
electricity markets have been liberalized,

20
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:15,272
or are in the process
of being liberalized.

21
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:19,074
Basically, liberalization means

22
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:24,551
that the infrastructure and the services
are being unbundled.

23
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:29,898
It means that the producer
can now compete for different customers,

24
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:34,879
the customers can buy electricity
from different producers.

25
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:38,598
They are still obliged
to be hooked to the network,

26
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,334
they have no choice
on the infrastructures,

27
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,734
but they have a choice on the energy,

28
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:47,953
the electricity they buy,
and from whom they buy it.

29
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:52,172
This change, this market liberalization,

30
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:54,642
has substantial challenges

31
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:58,926
for the urban electricity
infrastructure managers.

32
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:02,315
Let us start with electricity purchasing.

33
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,215
Basically, the challenge here
is that the retail prices

34
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:11,828
become competitive,
and the customers can now switch,

35
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:15,893
so if you are
an urban electricity operator

36
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:18,723
that has a series of customers,

37
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:21,319
and some of them go away,

38
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:25,678
that means that you have
to professionalize your management

39
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:29,225
in order to keep these customers,

40
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:33,481
perhaps to offer them new services,
like energy savings,

41
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:37,624
and things like that,
in order to retain these customers.

42
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:41,766
You may actually even want
to buy customers from other cities,

43
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:44,499
but I think that's
a little bit another story.

44
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,051
Now, the second challenge here

45
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:51,035
is that you have to change
the customer relations,

46
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:54,899
and you have
a shrinking customer base,

47
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:00,708
and especially the lucrative customers 
are leaving you.

48
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:04,418
The big industrial customers
are leaving you,

49
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:09,275
and you have to make sure
that you can keep these customers

50
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:13,105
with all kind of services,
additional services.

51
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:17,218
Sometimes even metering
and billing is being liberalized.

52
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:22,172
This means that you can lose
even technical activities.

53
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:26,968
Metering is actually
a very lucrative technical activity

54
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:28,872
and if you lose it to the competitor,

55
00:03:28,872 --> 00:03:32,082
you lose an additional
source of revenue.

56
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:36,115
It means customers
must be treated differently,

57
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,636
and managed more proactively.

58
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:42,707
Non-paying customers now
really become a problem,

59
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:45,415
because you cannot cross-subsidize

60
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:49,095
from paying customers 
to non-paying customers,

61
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,252
and actually they must be disconnected,

62
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:54,669
which creates a challenge
with the political authorities

63
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:58,855
if you disconnect a customer,
and social tariffs,

64
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:02,265
which the political authorities
may allow you to do,

65
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:04,459
or may force you to do,

66
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,150
must now be compensated
by the political authorities.

67
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,432
In terms of grid management,
what this means

68
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:18,322
is that there is an increased complexity
because of unbundling.

69
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,142
You, as a grid operator,

70
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:25,163
are no longer necessarily informed

71
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:30,163
about all the energy activities
that are going on on your grid,

72
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:34,291
and therefore managing the grid,
balancing the grid,

73
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,582
becomes a more demanding activity.

74
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:42,391
The second big challenge
is our environmental challenge,

75
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:45,853
in particular,
greenhouse gas emissions,

76
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,653
climate change.

77
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:53,088
Overall, the consumption
of fossil fuels must be reduced,

78
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:59,047
including the consumption of fossil fuels
for electricity production.

79
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:04,458
And not only that, overall energy
and electricity consumption

80
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:08,492
must be reduced 
if we want to address

81
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:13,049
these environmental challenges,
in particular climate change.

82
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:15,888
What does that mean for the manager

83
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:20,552
of urban infrastructure,
electricity infrastructure systems?

84
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:25,399
It basically means that in terms
of operations and managers

85
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:31,244
you will have more intermittent production
because of renewables,

86
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:35,294
and therefore you will have
more balancing needs.

87
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,677
It will be more complicated to balance

88
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:42,317
the urban electricity system.

89
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:47,153
In terms of grid development,
it means that self-production

90
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:49,728
will probably force you to add

91
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:53,048
new grid developments

92
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:57,040
to the existing grid,
and that can be a challenge.

93
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,287
This is mainly a financial challenge,

94
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:04,258
because you need to find the money
for these grid reinforcements.

95
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:08,871
And there's also, of course,
a regulatory issue.

96
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:12,316
And if there is less
electricity consumption

97
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:15,932
due to energy efficiency measures,
for example,

98
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:19,852
it is easy to understand
that the grid costs will actually,

99
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:23,483
the proportionate grid costs
will actually increase.

100
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:28,977
There is less electricity to bill,
less customers,

101
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:31,967
less electricity
to bill the grid costs to,

102
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:34,795
which will be another financial challenge.

103
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:39,815
In terms of energy purchasing, 
you now have to look also

104
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:44,456
to buy electricity
from non-renewables.

105
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:46,718
And you have to add a mix,

106
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:51,589
you have to find producers

107
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:55,098
with certificates that will sell you

108
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:59,394
renewable electricity
produced from renewables.

109
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:03,392
In terms of customer relations,
it means that consumers

110
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:06,343
are now also becoming producers,

111
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,135
and that's a different relation.

112
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:12,002
It's not just the consumer
you are selling something to,

113
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:16,184
you are also now a consumer, a buyer,

114
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:18,474
from the same customers,

115
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:21,915
and that creates new challenges

116
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:27,002
in terms of how to manage
the relationships with your customers.

117
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:30,805
And also, here, I think you have to find

118
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:34,190
new business models for energy savings.

119
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,880
Basically, you want to try--

120
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,847
I mean, if electricity consumption
must be reduced,

121
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:45,597
then that means that you actually
need to make money

122
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:49,696
from energy savings,
and that is a new challenge

123
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:52,399
in terms of business models, and it is--

124
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,497
We do not have any answer yet
how to respond to that challenge,

125
00:07:57,497 --> 00:08:01,359
but it will be a challenge,
and it already is a challenge

126
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:04,079
for urban electricity managers.

127
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:09,251
The third challenge are the information
and communication technologies.

128
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,910
We have already seen that the information 
communication technologies--

129
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,802
we have seen that in the second block--

130
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:23,218
that they can make the usage
of the infrastructure more efficient,

131
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:26,412
they can involve the users more actively

132
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:28,662
in the management of the infrastructures,

133
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:31,588
and actually they can allow
for the development

134
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:35,029
of new infrastructure services,

135
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:37,738
in this case energy services.

136
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:41,982
Now let's look at what that actually means

137
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:45,289
for the managers
of urban electricity systems.

138
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:48,869
In terms of operations and maintenance,

139
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,530
it means that actually,

140
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:56,541
thanks to the whole 
smart metering and ICTs,

141
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:01,884
the balancing energy
can actually become commercialized.

142
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:04,163
There are companies that--

143
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:10,884
There are customers
that can now sell their ability

144
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,572
to balance the system, for example,

145
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:16,141
by turning off their fridge,

146
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:19,101
by turning off machines.

147
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:23,698
So in case there is a need
for balancing energy,

148
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:27,926
the customers can become
more actively involved in balancing.

149
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:33,953
Overall, I think the ICTs
will make the electricity system

150
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:38,280
much more resilient because
of the different measuring points

151
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,203
and the coordination that is allowed
thanks to the ICTs.

152
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:49,236
In terms of grid development,
it is clear that the ICTs,

153
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:53,326
as I said before, is a means
to increase energy efficiency

154
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:57,631
and actually will reduce
the need for grid development.

155
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:03,203
In terms of energy purchasing,
we have already talked before,

156
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,109
you can now also purchase energy

157
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:09,364
from your consumers,
who become producers,

158
00:10:09,364 --> 00:10:11,918
at least in the case of balancing energy,

159
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:13,731
as we have seen before.

160
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:19,573
So it's clearly a new service
that the ICTs allow for.

161
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:22,119
And in terms of customer relations,

162
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:25,748
this allows for much
more flexible pricing,

163
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:29,378
peak load pricing, all kinds of prices

164
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:33,113
that are related to the usage
of the infrastructure

165
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:37,127
to the energy price, things like that.

166
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:41,769
ICTs also offer the opportunity

167
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:46,033
to develop new services like the energy--

168
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:49,171
We already saw
energy services companies,

169
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:54,042
the service to operate one's own
internal energy system,

170
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:57,009
not necessarily in the household,
but in a supermarket,

171
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,719
in a big industrial area.

172
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:03,161
Now in this block, in this session,

173
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:07,659
we have now seen
the three main new trends

174
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:13,727
that will affect the management 
of urban electricity systems.

175
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,654
In the next session, we will hear
from a practitioner

176
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:21,279
how he looks at all these things.

177
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,383
Stay tuned.
