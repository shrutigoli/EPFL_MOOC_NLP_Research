1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,330
Let's first of all define the
energy sector, because this is

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,760
a very wide area, the energy sector.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,810
First of all, energy sectors, I
will take it as the transformation

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,460
of natural resource.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,430
So, you transform gas and you
produce heat and the heat is the energy.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,900
Or, you use gas or coal,
and you produce electricity.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,930
The electricity is the energy part.

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,200
The thing before
that, it is utilities.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,640
So energy sector, we are
talking about electricity and we are

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
also talking about
heat, or cooling, also.

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,380
The second thing is
about the infrastructure.

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,620
These infrastructures,
related to energy, are long term

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,170
plants. So, therefore, when you
decide to put in place an infrastructure,

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,800
you are not deciding to put it in
for a few months or for a few years.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,930
You are looking at fifty,
sixty, seventy year ahead.

16
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,220
So, that means once the
infrastructure is in place, well, it is there.

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,910
So, therefore, if you want to
change things, it is all about

18
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,820
adapting. And that
takes me to the third

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,770
point related to energy sector
on infrastructure, it is, when

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,720
you talk about energy
sector, it is about production.

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,540
The production, obviously, of
the heat or the electricity.

22
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,000
It is about distribution,
transport and distribution.

23
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,740
And then the third, it is usage.

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,220
So, energy sector, I
will look at it that way.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,140
So, let's now look at cities.

26
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,690
You have mature cities and you have
got developing cities, new cities.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,320
In mature cities, the cities
which have started to grow during

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,150
the industrial revolutions,
clearly you already have infrastructure.

29
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,300
And the infrastructure is
related to the decision which was

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,950
taken at that time, was very
much related to "Am I going to

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,780
be independent?" or "What type
of system do I need to put in

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,210
place?" And for example, in
France, in the 1970s, basically,

33
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,450
the nuclear was the decision.

34
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,120
So, they decided to
produce electricity mainly out of

35
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,950
nuclear power plants.

36
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,690
So, if you want to adapt to
it, clearly you can adapt to it,

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,700
but you are not going to
change the complete system.

38
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,440
But, you will be able to
introduce all the solutions which are

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,500
biomass solutions for instance,
or even gas powered solutions.

40
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,490
But, you are clearly adapting.

41
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,520
You are not starting from scratch.

42
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,820
For developing cities,
you've got a clean sheet of paper.

43
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,060
So, it very much depends how you
want to build an infrastructure.

44
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,570
But, bear something: in mind the
cities are part of a bigger system.

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,690
In most countries, it's not
up to the cities to decide how

46
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,500
the energy structure
within the country.

47
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,240
So it's very much regional
and sometimes national issues.

48
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:04,480
So, the thing is about what type of

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,540
structure we're talking about
and the maturity of the cities.

50
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,360
Thus, these other things to
bear in mind when you are thinking

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,390
about implementing an energy
solution, energy plant for your city.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,610
And the main challenge is
a challenge of governance.

53
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,580
Clearly, a city is part of a system.

54
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,460
So, therefore, if you have a
national policy, for example, in

55
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,590
France, you have nuclear,
nuclear is the main production, then

56
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,050
clearly, the city haven't
got anything to say about that.

57
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,670
So, they need to adapt to it.

58
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,360
So, governance is important.

59
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,280
And also, the way,
the actors within that

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,070
governance interact with each
other, because the producer will

61
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,280
obviously produce the energy.

62
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,080
But and after, it
needs to be distributed.

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,930
And again, distributing can be in
private hands or in public hands.

64
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,220
And then, you've got the
commercialization of the energy.

65
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,160
So, these are the type of
things that needs to be organized.

66
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,920
And that is the issue when you
need to be thinking about it,

67
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,320
but the cities most of the time have
to adapt to these types of systems.

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,760
The other thing is
related to public and private.

69
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,340
Clearly the public is
a political decision.

70
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,260
Most of the time, as far as
energy concerned, it's linked to

71
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,260
independence, It needs to
make sure that basically, they

72
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,640
are autonomous, and usually, at
country level, or regional level.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,400
So again, the cities have got
very little to do about that.

74
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,920
To give you an example, in
Canada, there is a lot of biomass.

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,580
And us, we see more and more.

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
.. we're involved in project
where we are producing electricity

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,870
out of biomass. And that's just
to make sure that you are less

78
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,790
dependent on oil. But also,
it's very good for the environment.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,870
So, you kill two birds with one stone.

80
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,380
But, that's just an example
of the type of things which can

81
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,930
be done as far as
production and independence.

82
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,940
So, that's the public part.

83
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,550
Now, clearly the private is
also important because it can

84
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,080
provide a lot of
technologies, a lot of ideas.

85
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,390
Usually, private companies they
are involved in many countries

86
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,570
which means that they are
capable of having a breadth of

87
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,110
technology. Again, an example:

88
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,690
in some parts of the
world, we are used to geothermal

89
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,440
technology and some other
part, we will be involved in solar,

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,560
in some other part again, on
production side, biomass, also

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,110
gas combined, CHB, all these
types technologies are usually

92
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,020
adapted to one particular
market, and that's cities obviously,

93
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,540
in that market.

94
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,150
So, the fact of combining
private, the knowledge of private

95
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,860
with public in my
opinion, you get the both worlds.

96
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,760
You get the new
technology up to date, as also

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,240
private companies are very much
involving research and development

98
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,530
program, less so in
public, and obviously, the public

99
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,810
entity. And there are a lot of
mechanisms which do exist nowadays

100
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,920
to provide the right
framework for that interaction between

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,680
public and private. Such as
public-private partnership, PPP,

102
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,950
private finance initiative, PFI,
all these types of legal frameworks

103
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,930
do exist now. So, I think if, in a
city, it's possible to investigate

104
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,340
this type of a model, clearly, best of

105
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,210
both worlds'idea.

106
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,790
I mean that's a great challenge.

107
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,720
Because, clearly, the
citizens are getting more involved

108
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,900
into all the system, and in
particular, with smart technology.

109
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,440
In the old days, you would
build an energy plant distributed

110
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,150
and more push. And in the
other hand of the side, you would

111
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,310
have a consumer, citizen which
bought the volume of energy and

112
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,780
that would be it. Now, with
new technology, the consumer is

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,450
much more aware of what is going on.

114
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,510
And he has the ability to
choose, not only in terms of price

115
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,210
with different diversity of
supplies, but also in terms of usage.

116
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,330
The usage is important because
it determines the price and the

117
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,760
risk for producers. So,
therefore, all the tariffs are usually

118
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,460
used or structured to.

119
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,670
.. really, tried to
make use the energy in

120
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,330
some part of the day or
some part of the year.

121
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,070
It is cheaper than others.

122
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:06,090
So, being aware of the usage
is clearly an element for the

123
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,270
citizen to reduce his bill and
also reduce his Co2 footprint.

124
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,220
And the citizens have much
more aware of these things.

125
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,000
So, smart technology is pushing that.

126
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,550
The real challenge is that
when you have already existing

127
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,540
infrastructure. Then, you have
to adapt Infrastructure which

128
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,660
have been put in place maybe
thirty, forty years ago, which

129
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,480
were necessary and
still necessary and lack

130
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,580
flexibilities in order to
give the complete flexibility

131
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,320
that the citizen wants nowadays.

132
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,000
So, these are the real challenges.

133
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,330
So, it is all about citizen.

134
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,000
It is in the center but it is
much easier to design a system

135
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,900
when there isn't
existing infrastructure.

136
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,000
And it is more complicated for
mature country who have to adapt

137
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,380
existing infrastructure,
decisions which were taken thirty,

138
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,650
forty years ago, which
obviously are structuring now

139
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,520
the system for the citizen.

140
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:16,000
One example is clearly that, with
the information which is available

141
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,060
now on Internet of objects tomorrow,

142
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,310
the citizen can see his
consumption, can see that tomorrow

143
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,840
the washing machine will be able
to decide when it starts because

144
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,370
it starts when the
tariff is the cheapest.

145
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,590
And clearly, we have
intelligent meters now which are able

146
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,690
to do these things. So,
really, we're talking about rupture,

147
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,930
really, a change of paradigms as
far as the citizen is concerned.

148
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,040
So, that's really the real

149
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,840
good things. Another
element also, it is now with

150
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,400
the smart grids. Citizen
can produce energy, they can

151
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,400
become producers themselves.

152
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,350
And clearly, when you have an
existing infrastructure, it's

153
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,770
much trickier to integrate
that to an existing infrastructure

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,100
than to start from scratch.

155
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,120
So, really big changes in the energy
sector, in my opinion, into the future.

156
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,700
And the citizen will become.

157
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,790
.. is not longer consumer, is
an actor in his consumption and

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,330
tomorrow is a producer, and in
fact, today, he is a producer

159
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,290
in some countries.

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,860
Resilience is not a new
thing, it has happened.

161
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,400
Human being by
definition is resilient.

162
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,100
Since it appears on the planet,
we are still here on we're growing

163
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,580
and we are really a major element of

164
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,190
the planet. So,
resilience is not a new thing.

165
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,000
But either for cities, two
phenomena which affect the resilience

166
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,250
is, first of all, the
growing urbanization.

167
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,470
More and more of the world
population are living in cities.

168
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,070
That means in effect that you
have got more people into a city

169
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,810
putting pressure on
resource and infrastructure.

170
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,010
So, clearly, that is
one major impact on the

171
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,400
resilience. The
second is climate change.

172
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,640
Climate change, as you might
have seen, more and more, we are

173
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,000
having natural catastrophes.

174
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,900
And these natural
catastrophes are happening more often and

175
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,220
when they happen, the
intensity is that's much higher.

176
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:34,530
That, combined with the organization,
are the real challenges of resilience.

177
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,650
So, when you talk about cities
being resilient in twenty years,

178
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,710
I guess there are cities
already resilient because you have

179
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,110
systems who are resilient.

180
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,420
For example, hospitals usually
have backup, with backup generators

181
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,060
in case of power cut.

182
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,000
So, these types of things,
this technology, do exist.

183
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,870
But, it doesn't mean
that you are not at risk.

184
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,000
In 2012, New York was hit by Sandy.

185
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,280
And part of New York,
if not most of New York,

186
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,280
had a power cut, because
the power supply was affected

187
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,630
by the natural catastrophe.

188
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,200
But except one
part, who had a complete

189
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,310
system, smart grid, with
capacity to produce a CHB which we

190
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,530
run in New York University.

191
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,920
And that, in effect, meant that
they still had the electricity.

192
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,820
So, resilience is a matter of
putting system, anticipating

193
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,130
what can happen in the future.

194
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,550
Taking into consideration the
growth of urbanization and the

195
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,500
risk of natural catastrophe.

196
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,740
To conclude on these
issues of energy sectors and

197
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,620
cities, first of all, decide on
your governance, that's important.

198
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,620
Secondly, put the
citizen in the center.

199
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,650
Design a system which is
efficient and also resilient,

200
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,840
and resilience is taking care of
the future, shocks the urbanization

201
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,130
and also natural catastrophes.

202
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,470
And last, but not least, think about
the planet, it needs to be sustainable.
