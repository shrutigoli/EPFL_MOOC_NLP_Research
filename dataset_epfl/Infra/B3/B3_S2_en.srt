1
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:06,734
Welcome back.

2
00:00:07,372 --> 00:00:11,765
Now in this session I will talk
about the key elements

3
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:14,616
of the urban electricity system.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,882
What is important here is
the electricity infrastructure,

5
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:22,698
the consumption of electricity,
the production of electricity,

6
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:25,393
and all kind of intermediaries

7
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:30,651
that have now emerged
in recent years in urban electricity.

8
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,649
Of course, production comes first,

9
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,119
as you know, because electricity
has to be produced,

10
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:43,938
but the reason why I nevertheless
start with electricity infrastructures

11
00:00:43,938 --> 00:00:48,368
is because the electricity utility,

12
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:51,140
in the city, is mainly concerned

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,556
with the infrastructure
and its operations.

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,921
So, how does that infrastructure
exactly work?

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,605
The electricity is produced
outside of the city,

16
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:05,506
comes into a city by way of cables,

17
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:10,834
either above-the-ground cables,
or underground cables.

18
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:18,102
The trend, of course,
is to put electricity underground,

19
00:01:18,102 --> 00:01:21,380
but there is still a lot of above-ground

20
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,328
high-voltage or medium-voltage electricity
coming into the city.

21
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:32,517
This electricity is then transformed
to lower voltage levels,

22
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:36,471
and fed into distribution cables

23
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,113
which, again, can be
above or under the ground.

24
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:44,613
Their characteristic is that
they go directly

25
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:46,927
to each of the households

26
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:49,816
where then electricity is consumed.

27
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:53,029
The important element is
this transformer here,

28
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,679
and in many cities
you can see transforming stations

29
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,490
right in the heart of the city,

30
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,993
where the high-voltage electricity

31
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:05,265
is transformed
into low-voltage electricity.

32
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,322
As I said before,
this is the core business,

33
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:14,607
the core activity,
of the urban electricity utility.

34
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:18,886
It operates the grid,
and we will say later what that means

35
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:23,326
in terms of challenges,
operating the electricity grid.

36
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:26,419
It operates the high-voltage grid,
the medium-voltage grid,

37
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:31,550
the different transformers,
and the distribution cables.

38
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,221
Now, let's talk about consumption first.

39
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:38,832
So, at the end of the line,

40
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:41,351
connected to the grid,

41
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:46,037
usually to the distribution grid,
to the low-voltage grid,

42
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:49,558
are the households,
the individual consumers.

43
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,664
What is also connected to the grid,

44
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:55,899
and, generally, at a higher voltage level,

45
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:59,732
are the industrial,
or the commercial consumers:

46
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:04,005
factories, shopping malls,

47
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:06,729
big bus stations,

48
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:10,179
they are all connected
to the electricity grid,

49
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:13,136
and they're consuming the electricity

50
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:16,186
that is being brought into the city

51
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,737
by way of the different cables.

52
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:25,116
Now, in terms of production,
we have already seen

53
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:29,271
electricity is generally produced
outside of the city.

54
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:33,427
It is generally produced,
traditionally it is produced

55
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:36,477
by big generation plants:

56
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:40,437
fossil-fuel plants, coal plants,

57
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:43,776
gas plants, nuclear-power plants,

58
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:45,087
and you easily understand

59
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:48,712
why these production generation plants

60
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:52,948
cannot be located inside of the city--
they are polluting,

61
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:54,659
or they have other risks,

62
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,004
and therefore they are often
quite away from the city,

63
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,242
and that energy is then
brought into the city.

64
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:06,249
Now there is some back-up generation

65
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:08,977
inside the city,

66
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:13,561
especially hospitals, some factories.

67
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:18,995
Particularly vulnerable,
sensitive industries

68
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:22,637
that cannot afford electricity cuts

69
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:26,850
have their own back-up generation capacity

70
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,830
in case there is a blackout,

71
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,557
or there is another problem
in electricity distribution.

72
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:36,640
The main characteristic
of back-up generation

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,774
is that it is purely for internal use.

74
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:45,337
It is generally not used
to feed electricity back into the grid.

75
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,880
For this we see other things
emerging in recent years,

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,279
and this is self-generation.

77
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:57,841
Companies are self-generating,
and increasingly with solar energy.

78
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:00,241
Solar panels on their roofs,

79
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:05,177
the households are starting
to generate their own electricity,

80
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:08,078
which they sometimes consume.

81
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:11,515
But sometimes, when they produce too much,

82
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:13,597
they feed it back into the grid,

83
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:16,380
and that creates all kind of problems

84
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,097
for managers of urban electricity
infrastructure systems,

85
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:26,326
because they have to deal
with this kind of self-generation.

86
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,707
They have to feed it,
they have to manage it

87
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:33,050
inside the broader grid
and stabilize the grid.

88
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:38,385
Now let's talk about intermediaries.

89
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:43,040
So, historically,
the households, the companies,

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,958
the firms, the industrial consumers,

91
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:50,419
they buy their electricity
from their local utility,

92
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:56,231
the same one that manages
the grid and the distribution.

93
00:05:57,081 --> 00:06:00,496
The local utility here is a reseller.

94
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:04,080
Very rarely does
the local electricity utility

95
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,568
actually produce electricity;
it buys it itself

96
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,716
from a generation plant, from a producer.

97
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:16,179
But it acts as a reseller and,
historically, it had a monopoly.

98
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:21,430
It was the only one allowed
to sell electricity to the households.

99
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:28,075
But now, with liberalization,
in Europe, the United States,

100
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:30,838
and many other emerging countries,

101
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:35,387
electricity markets
have actually been liberalized.

102
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:38,250
This means that the households,

103
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,535
and the industrial
and commercial consumers

104
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:45,166
have the possibility
to buy their electricity

105
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:49,095
from someone else
than the utility as a reseller.

106
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:52,036
So there are other resellers popping up,

107
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,077
and the consumer actually has a choice

108
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:58,197
from whom to buy its electricity.

109
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:00,294
So we have some competition here--

110
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,902
and we have seen earlier in the course

111
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:05,748
about competition
in utility services provision--

112
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,636
and this competition,
it is important to understand,

113
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:13,751
is about the energy,
about the electricity.

114
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:18,085
It is not competition
about the distribution.

115
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,830
Just as a little explanation here,

116
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,060
in the final household price,

117
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,770
what you, as a final consumer,
pay to somebody,

118
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,699
is basically three things.

119
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:34,804
You pay the use of the infrastructure.

120
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,257
This is monopolistic.

121
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:40,457
You pay it to the local utility,
and it is regulated.

122
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,059
Then you pay the electricity
that you consume,

123
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:51,939
usually about a third to half
of the costs of what you pay.

124
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:57,110
This is competitive, you can choose,
and you pay it to the reseller,

125
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,446
which can or cannot be your local utility.

126
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:05,252
And then you pay taxes
to the local administration,

127
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,273
to the local authorities,

128
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:09,447
and there you do not have a choice.

129
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:15,063
Now, as liberalization goes on,

130
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:19,844
we see a new type of actor emerging,
and those are traders.

131
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:23,947
Now traders are not really affecting

132
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:27,484
the way the urban
electricity system works,

133
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:29,338
but of course they are important,

134
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:32,595
because now the utility, as a reseller,

135
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:37,284
can either buy directly
from a power-generating plant,

136
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,914
or it can buy
its electricity from a trader,

137
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:43,721
which operates basically in the same way

138
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:46,304
as a financial trader operates.

139
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,547
But this is not really at the center

140
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:52,231
of what we study here,
in urban infrastructures.

141
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:57,299
And the last element,
which is also a very recent edition

142
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,006
to the whole urban energy
and electricity system,

143
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:04,620
are so-called "energy services companies."

144
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:07,318
They may be resellers--

145
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:11,221
that is, they sell you electricity
as a household,

146
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:16,838
but they also sell you
the services to save electricity,

147
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:19,312
and to save energy more generally,

148
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:22,303
so as to consume less electricity.

149
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:24,240
And they make their money

150
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,737
by way of the energy
that you have been saving.

151
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:33,560
Again, we will not talk very much
about that in the future,

152
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,651
but it's certainly a new phenomenon

153
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:38,885
in urban electricity infrastructures.

154
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:43,366
What have I done in this session?
I have tried to explain to you

155
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:46,468
how the urban electricity system works.

156
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:50,174
In the next session,
I will talk about the management of it,

157
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,926
what all this means
in terms of management,

158
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,756
and what the main challenges are
for management.

159
00:09:55,998 --> 00:09:57,179
Stay tuned.
