00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,676
Hello, and welcome to this third block.

2
00:00:08,435 --> 00:00:12,654
In it we will talk about the management
of urban energy systems.

3
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:15,829
We'll talk about the challenges
these systems face,

4
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:20,621
and how to address these challenges
in the context of sustainability.

5
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,785
Sustainability is particularly
relevant here,

6
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:28,831
because all the energy problems of cities
pertain to sustainability.

7
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:32,701
This block is structured
into five sessions.

8
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:36,506
In the first session, we will broadly talk

9
00:00:36,506 --> 00:00:40,000
about the relationship
between energy and cities.

10
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:44,223
From there, we will focus
in particular on electricity.

11
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:47,684
First, we will understand
the electricity system,

12
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:49,372
in the second session,

13
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:51,648
and in the third session we will then see

14
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:54,806
how to manage these electricity systems.

15
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:59,107
The fourth session addresses
challenges and opportunities,

16
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:00,877
especially in the context

17
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:04,034
of the information
and communication technologies

18
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:06,399
that bring about these challenges,

19
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,306
but also bring a lot of new opportunities

20
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:13,669
for urban energy,
and electricity in particular.

21
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:18,653
Finally, we will hear
from an urban energy expert

22
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:23,540
who practices urban energy
management every day.

23
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:26,110
Now, energy and cities.

24
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:33,366
It is crucial to understand
that energy is the lifeblood of a city.

25
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:36,477
Without energy, the cities don't work.

26
00:01:36,857 --> 00:01:40,925
Energy is crucial for transport,
for buildings,

27
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:44,788
for water, for waste water,
for telecommunications,

28
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:49,739
for lighting, for housing,
for plenty of things

29
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:53,854
without which the city
simply will not function.

30
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,214
The first thing that is important here

31
00:01:57,214 --> 00:02:01,993
is the consumption of primary energy.

32
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:08,077
The cities consume 70%
of the world's primary energy,

33
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:11,739
and this proportion is still growing.

34
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:16,267
So this means that it is--

35
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:19,892
You know that the city's currently about--

36
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:24,283
a little bit more than 50%
of the population live in cities,

37
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:27,317
but it consumes 70%
of the world's primary energy,

38
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:32,170
so this is proportionately much higher.

39
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:35,578
And when you look
where this energy is consumed,

40
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:40,520
you will actually see that most
of this primary energy is consumed

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,437
in transport, 30%,

42
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:47,674
and in housing/buildings, 45%.

43
00:02:47,674 --> 00:02:50,696
And the 25% make up for the rest.

44
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:53,616
So this is a very--

45
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:58,074
If you want to have
an impact on sustainability,

46
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:00,360
and reduce energy consumption,

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,549
the first two things to do
as a manager of urban infrastructures

48
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:09,427
is go attend to the consumption of energy

49
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:11,959
in transport and in housing.

50
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,330
Now, if we look at how that works exactly,

51
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,630
in terms of infrastructures,

52
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,951
so most of the energy is consumed
in transport and in housing:

53
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:26,758
in heating, in lighting,
and appliances, and things like that.

54
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:29,337
Where does this energy come from?

55
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:32,755
Most of it is primary energy,

56
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,255
fossil-fuel energy,

57
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:37,431
coal, gas and oil,

58
00:03:37,431 --> 00:03:42,546
that is directly transported
into the city,

59
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:45,738
either to fuel the buildings,

60
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:48,937
or to fuel the buses, the cars,

61
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,408
and all the other transport modes.

62
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:57,098
So there is no real infrastructure
involved in that,

63
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:02,242
except maybe for the roads
on which this energy is transported.

64
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:06,235
A proportion of this primary energy,
namely gas,

65
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:10,522
is delivered into the city
from outside the city

66
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:15,462
by way of gas pipelines,
and then distributed in the city

67
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:19,156
by way of gas distribution pipelines.

68
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:23,830
Now in the rest of this block

69
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,140
we will talk about electricity.

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,035
We'll not talk about energy in general.

71
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:32,396
But electricity, as you all know,

72
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:35,019
is produced by primary energy.

73
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:39,249
So most of the electricity
today in the world

74
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:45,024
is still produced
from fossil-fuel sources:

75
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,078
coal, oil, or gas.

76
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,555
This is then converted into electricity.

77
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:55,315
Electricity is not
a primary energy source.

78
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:57,528
It is a vehicle.

79
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:02,891
And there are other
primary energy sources,

80
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:07,631
like nuclear, or wind, or hydro, or solar.

81
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:12,584
They also are transformed
into electricity.

82
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:16,701
Most of that transformation
is happening outside of the city,

83
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:21,772
and then transported into the city
by way of an electricity grid,

84
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:26,783
and from there distributed
inside the city.

85
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:31,342
And this is what we are going
to look at from now on.

86
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:36,391
In conclusion, what I have shown
is the importance of energy in cities.

87
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:41,549
We are looking now
at the electricity dimension of energy,

88
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:45,998
and first what I will do is
to basically talk about

89
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:50,382
how the electricity system
inside a city works.
