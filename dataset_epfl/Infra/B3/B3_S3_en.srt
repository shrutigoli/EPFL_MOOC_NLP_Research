1
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:07,215
Welcome back!

2
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:12,423
In this session we will now talk 
about the concrete management

3
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:15,573
of the urban electricity utility.

4
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:25,503
And this is generally done historically 
by an electricity managing utility,

5
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:30,210
which is integrated and operates the grid

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,616
as well as the selling of the electricity

7
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:39,646
In most of the countries 
this utility is standing alone,

8
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:42,265
but in some countries 
it is the same utility

9
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:46,017
that also manages the gas, 
the water, the cables

10
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:49,447
and sometimes even urban public transport.

11
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:55,452
The utility is generally 
traditionally a public entity

12
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:57,327
owned by the municipalities.

13
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:03,277
As of recently with liberalization, 
with market based approach,

14
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,173
some of the activities 
have been outsourced

15
00:01:07,803 --> 00:01:09,937
to private operators,

16
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:13,113
especially electricity selling 
and purchasing.

17
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:14,513
But we will see that.

18
00:01:15,937 --> 00:01:21,217
Now, what I will do concretely here 
is to proceed in four steps.

19
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:26,096
So, what are the major managing tasks 
in operations and management

20
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:31,283
of the urban electricity grid 
in terms of grid development,

21
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:35,203
in terms of customer relations 
and in terms of energy purchasing.

22
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:39,124
Let's first talk about the grid.

23
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:42,635
The biggest challenge

24
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:48,182
that urban electricity 
infrastructure managers confront

25
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:52,484
is the challenge of balancing 
demand and supply.

26
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:56,835
You know that electricity cannot be stored.

27
00:01:56,835 --> 00:02:01,005
That means there needs always 
to be the same amount of electricity

28
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:04,646
being fed into the grid
as being consumed.

29
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:07,449
So the big challenge is 
to make that balance.

30
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:11,468
If there is too much electricity, 
there is a blackout,

31
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:14,711
If there is not enough electricity, 
there is a blackout.

32
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:16,761
That is the big, big challenge.

33
00:02:18,302 --> 00:02:23,552
This challenge is exacerbated 
by self-generation.

34
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:30,547
So you all know that electricity 
is not consumed in the same amount.

35
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:32,219
There are peak hours.

36
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:38,079
During the day there is more electricity 
than there is produced.

37
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,294
And that creates an inbalance

38
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:46,474
at some certain peak hours 
during lunch time, during evening time.

39
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:53,625
All this balancing activity 
is exacerbated by self-generation,

40
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:58,087
which has to be factored in 
when balancing the electricity.

41
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:02,747
And it is further exacerbated 
by intermittency.

42
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:09,293
That means, especially if you produce 
with renewable energies,

43
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:14,444
of course, solar energy 
cannot really be planned as well--

44
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:16,700
Solar electricity production

45
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:23,150
cannot be planned as well 
as nuclear electricity production,

46
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,132
which can be clearly forecasted.

47
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:33,942
So intermittency, renewables, all this 
exacerbates the balancing challenge

48
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:37,476
that urban electricity managers have.

49
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:43,551
And some of this actually 
requires grid reinforcement.

50
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:47,346
Historically the electricity grid 
is a top down grid.

51
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:51,919
You go from high voltage to medium voltage
to low voltage to consumers.

52
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,989
But with self-generation actually 
consumers also produce

53
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,116
and therefore you need 
to plan grid reinforcement,

54
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,731
and that helps me to make the link 
to the next big challenge,

55
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:07,233
which is the grid development.

56
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:11,203
Especially in the case of rapidly growing cities,

57
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:15,014
let us say, you add a new city 
or part of the city,

58
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:18,974
10,000 new inhabitants 
or 50,000 new inhabitants.

59
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:21,968
You need to develop new connections.

60
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:23,838
This needs to be planned,

61
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:28,798
the electricity needs to be brought
to these new areas

62
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:34,238
without destabilizing the rest 
of the urban electricity grid.

63
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:41,332
Grid development is especially 
a challenge for planning.

64
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:45,486
You cannot put these grids in overnight,

65
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:50,016
so you need to plan, you need to buy,

66
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:53,206
to ensure the financing,

67
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:55,486
and this is really the next big steps,

68
00:04:55,486 --> 00:05:00,533
and often the financing 
of the traditional grid activities

69
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:05,877
is not sufficient 
in order to generate the money

70
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:11,127
to roll out new grids 
to totally new areas.

71
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,649
So as a manager you have to make sure

72
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,749
that you get the finances 
to develop the electricity grid.

73
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:21,799
We have talked 
about public-private partnerships,

74
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:27,369
but alternatives are also to have 
the developers of these new cities

75
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:31,150
contribute to the financing 
of the electricity grid--

76
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,800
a new big management challenge.

77
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:41,547
The third big management challenge 
pertains of course to the customers,

78
00:05:41,547 --> 00:05:43,331
the way you relate to the customers.

79
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,531
Electricity must be metered, measured 
and then billed to the customers.

80
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:54,271
That is how ultimately 
the utility makes its money.

81
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:59,411
It better make sure 
that it is correctly metered

82
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:04,053
in order, for example, 
to avoid complaint by the customers

83
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:08,483
which have to be handled, 
and that is timeconsuming and annoying

84
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:14,398
and of course they have 
to be billed correctly, in time,

85
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:19,498
not too late, so as to generate 
the money that is required.

86
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:24,605
There are several more challenges here 
in terms of customer relations.

87
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:29,041
There are non-paying customers 
or customers that are paying too late.

88
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:34,434
At some point you have to decide 
as an electricity manager

89
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:38,040
whether you want 
to hook them off the grid or not,

90
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,661
whether that will cause you problems,

91
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:43,679
whether that is even 
politically allowed or not,

92
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:47,914
whether you want to offer paying plans 
to the non-paying customers,

93
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:51,959
but this is a big issue

94
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,129
because hooking off customers 
has also a cost.

95
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,423
There are things in some countries,

96
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:01,753
more rather in emerging countries 
and developing countries,

97
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:04,420
known as electricity theft.

98
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,510
People hook onto the electricity grid 
before the meter,

99
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:15,501
and actually consume electricity 
without paying for it.

100
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,606
It can be an important factor

101
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:21,076
which of course results in revenue loss.

102
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:25,764
But also it results in loss of predictability

103
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:29,346
when you try to balance 
the electricity system.

104
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:32,706
This must of course be addressed.

105
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:37,579
And in some cities, in some countries 
you actually have social tariffs

106
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,867
in the sense that some customers

107
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,558
do not pay the same amount of money

108
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:46,318
for the same amount 
of electricity consumed.

109
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,427
This has to be handled.

110
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:53,567
Social tariffs are ordered 
for political reasons.

111
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:59,034
They will result in a revenue loss 
for the electricity operator,

112
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:02,758
but the operator then has to go 
after the political authotities

113
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:05,972
to make sure that he is being compensated

114
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:09,928
for the social tariffs 
he is forced to offer.

115
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,525
Now, the fourth big management task

116
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:16,025
pertains to purchasing of electricity.

117
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:19,385
As I have already said,

118
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:24,205
the city is generally not producing 
its own electricity.

119
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:26,634
It is buying it from somewhere.

120
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:29,822
And it is important, as you understand,

121
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:33,102
that is makes the right buying decisions.

122
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:39,885
And this buying traditionally happens
by way of contract.

123
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:43,100
You are contracting with a producer.

124
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,990
We have seen that in the session before,

125
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,109
but this carries risk.

126
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,361
You may have the wrong contract.

127
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:53,884
You may buy electricity too expensively

128
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:56,023
when later it becomes cheaper.

129
00:08:56,473 --> 00:09:02,453
So buying the electricity, 
purchasing the electricity that is needed

130
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:08,372
for a whole city is actually 
a complex managerial task

131
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:11,969
which increasingly is made more complex,

132
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:15,039
because now you also have power exchanges,

133
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:18,485
traders, as we have seen before.

134
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:20,231
You can buy from them.

135
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:23,902
You may get actually a better price 
buying from traders,

136
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:26,674
but at the same time 
this carries more risks.

137
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:33,124
In other words, electricity purchasing 
is becoming a big managerial activity

138
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:36,891
of a local electricity utility.

139
00:09:37,548 --> 00:09:43,338
Now, we have seen previously, 
in previous blocks and sessions,

140
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:48,170
we have talked about the main dimensions

141
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,413
of managing urban infrastructure systems

142
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:55,647
So balancing would 
rather be a technical task,

143
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:58,434
pertain to the technical dimension 
of management,

144
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:01,425
the whole grid development

145
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:06,005
rather pertain to technical 
and economic dimensions

146
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:12,977
the managing the customers pertains 
to social and political dimensions

147
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:16,809
and the whole purchasing 
of course pertains to economic

148
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:19,179
and also to environmental dimensions.

149
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:22,108
For example, in the case 
where you are trying to buy

150
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:24,545
green energy, green electricity

151
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:28,775
because this is something 
that your customers may require.

152
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:34,761
In this session I have basically talked 
about the four main management functions.

153
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:42,112
And, very simplistically, they pertain 
to the grid, the development of the grid,

154
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:44,971
the maintenance of the grid, 
the operations of the grid,

155
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:50,967
and then they pertain 
to the energy itself, electricity itself,

156
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:53,727
the customers that consume it,

157
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:56,389
the traders, the sellers,

158
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:00,459
the producers of the electricity
that produce it.

159
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:07,592
These are both big management tasks 
of urban electricity managers.

160
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,870
Now, these functions will evolve, 
and we will see this in the next session.

161
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,347
These functions will evolve 
because there are new challenges.

162
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,659
What I have described before, 
is basically a relatively static view,

163
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,513
but there are new challenges 
on the horizon:

164
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:30,055
like climate change,
like information communication technologies

165
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:31,679
we have talked about,

166
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,483
and these challenges may actually

167
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:39,913
also be new opportunities for urban 
electricity infrastructure managers.

168
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:41,363
Stay tuned.
