1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,720
Welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,390
I have the pleasure of
receiving Christoph Rothballer, he's

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,380
an expert principal at
Boston Consulting Group.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,690
He's extremely knowledgeable
about questions of infrastructures

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,540
and public private partnerships.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,300
Among many other things, he has
led and recently completed the

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,290
World Economic Forum's
Strategic Infrastructure Initiative.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,360
Christoph, everybody talks about
the global infrastructure investment

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,040
gap, but how serious is that really?

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,360
I personally think it's
really one of the big global issues

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,900
and that view, I think, is
also shared by many of the global

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,680
institutions from the World
Bank all the way to the G20.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,230
And in fact we, within BCG,
we've done our own analysis and

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,960
estimated the annual
investment gap to be about one trillion

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,870
US dollars each year.
It's quite a massive gap.

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,700
One of the reasons behind that
gap - on the one hand you have,

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,410
in developed countries, an
infrastructure stock that's aging rapidly.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,210
For example, in my own
country, Germany, a third of the rail

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,950
bridge is a more than
a hundred years old.

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,840
And on the other hand, you
have, in the developing countries,

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,950
massive infrastructure needs,
just because of soaring population

22
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,710
numbers, also because of
urbanization and industrialization.

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,900
That's really driving the
infrastructure needs there.

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,040
And, on the other side, the
supply of infrastructure is quite

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,220
constraining because of
limited government budgets and also

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,260
some hesitance among the private
sector to invest in infrastructure.

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,450
There are also a couple of
other structural reasons such as

28
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,060
low construction productivity or
some of the issues in the early

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,520
permitting phases, land
acquisition phases of infrastructure,

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,120
all this constrains the
supply quite a bit as well.

31
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,400
And these infrastructure
limitations also have quite some repercussions

32
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,410
in social and economic dimensions.

33
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,570
On the one hand, they're very
immediate things such as all the

34
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,500
congestion that we're seeing
in ports, in the airports, that

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,910
a lot of people are suffering from.

36
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,820
But then, that also has an
impact on economic productivity.

37
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,910
For example, for Africa, it's
been estimated that, if they would

38
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,680
solve the infrastructure gap,
annual growth in GDP terms could

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,170
be two percentage points
higher per year, so that could make

40
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,230
quite an impressive impact.

41
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,520
But even on a social
dimension, infrastructure really makes

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,470
a difference, for example, there are
studies out there how infrastructure

43
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,320
increases, the number of
students that read at home at night

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,200
because of electricity at home or
how paved roads increase girls'school

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,700
attendance. All these studies
are there, so I clearly think

46
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,210
it's a big issue and it could
make a huge impact to the world

47
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,330
if that would be solved.

48
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,550
So how then can public-private
partnerships help address this challenge?

49
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,760
Think PPPs can address a
challenge in various ways.

50
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,100
The first thing is: PPPs
can save costs and that's

51
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,110
because PPPS bundle really
various activities across the life
The first thing is: PPPs
can save costs and that's

52
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,060
because PPPS bundle really
various activities across the life

53
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,230
cycle from construction,
design, operations and maintenance

54
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,560
into one contract and really
incentivize the contractor to optimize

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,820
whole life cycle costs.

56
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,890
It means that the contractor
has to design and built the asset

57
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,410
in a way that it can be
operated easily and also maintained

58
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,290
easily over the whole life cycle.

59
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,610
And that will really save money.

60
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,610
Secondly, the government
transfers certain risks through

61
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,450
the PPP to the private sector,
and these are typically the risks

62
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,610
that a private sector can
very well manage and control; for

63
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,840
example the risk of a
construction cost overruns, something

64
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,540
that the private sector can
manage very well and by this risk

65
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,460
transfer, government can save
money as it's not on their balance

66
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,580
sheet anymore.

67
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,890
Thirdly, I think PPPs also are a good

68
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,980
opportunity to introduce additional
innovation into infrastructure delivery.

69
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,250
And that can happen in two aspects.

70
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,750
The one is really on the
commercial side, so just imagine them

71
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,570
the many airports that out
there that have really innovated

72
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,850
a lot on the ancillary
business side, some of their best in

73
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,490
class airport nowadays do 50 %
or more of their revenues from

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,720
such businesses as
advertising, retail, hotels on site.

75
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,560
And that really reduces the
infrastructure funding burden on the government.

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,700
Secondly, there's also
technical innovation.

77
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,140
For example, in the UK there's a
good example how a PPP contractor

78
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,000
applied asphalt preservation
surface coating and therefore increased,

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,700
as said, lifetime by one third.

80
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,630
Again a clear impact and
that's directly incentivized through

81
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,970
the long term contracts of a PPP.

82
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,460
And not only that, PPP is also
typically faster in delivering

83
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,260
a project, there's good
evidence that the construction happens

84
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,860
faster because a private sector
wants to earn money with those

85
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:57,870
assets so they construct faster.
faster because a private sector
wants to earn money with those

86
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,560
assets so they construct faster.

87
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,580
And secondly, you can avoid
some of the pay-as-you-go financing

88
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,860
that we often see in the
public sector, that you build five

89
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,160
kilometers of road then you
wait until more money is there,

90
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,860
you build the next five
kilometers because a private sector

91
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,520
can tap into additional
financing resources, particularly those

92
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,710
from institutional investors, and get
all the construction done in one go.

93
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,360
All these macroeconomic
benefits of infrastructure typically

94
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,760
occur faster with PPPs.

95
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,180
And lastly, in some settings,
PPPs can also help to filter out

96
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,240
certain projects that are not
really viable because you have

97
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,760
this type of double due
diligence, first by the public sector,

98
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,250
then by the private sector, then
by the banks that are financing

99
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,930
the private sector
concessionaire so you really get rid of those

100
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,070
white elephant projects that we
sometimes see in traditional project delivery.

101
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,120
And through all those
mechanisms together PPPs can make quite

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,210
an impact in terms of costs
and in value for infrastructure

103
00:05:59,210 --> 00:05:59,730
delivery.

104
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,650
So, it's the governments that
initiate the PPPs, what do they

105
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,570
need to do in order to
get the PPPs to work?

106
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,660
Obviously PPPs are not an easy
undertaking, so there's quite

107
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,210
some things that governments
need to get right and that really

108
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,010
stretches across the life cycle
from project inception to project

109
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,490
preparation all the
way into implementation.

110
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,850
Let's start from the beginning.

111
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,730
I think the first thing they
need to get right is select the

112
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,940
right project for a PPP.

113
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,500
Because not every project is
conducive to PPP delivery, so they

114
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,470
first need to select projects
that make sense from an economic

115
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,140
environmental and
social point of view.

116
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,470
And secondly they need to make
sure or assess that the PPP delivery

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,240
really adds value or saves
costs for the government.

118
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,410
And once they've chosen the
right project, they need to prepare

119
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,640
it properly for that
type of PPP transaction.

120
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,270
There are many elements within
that project preparation phase.

121
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,920
That starts with the sound
and rigorous demands study.

122
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,770
We've seen so many demand studies
with inflated traffic forecasts,

123
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,970
particularly in the roads sector
30-40 %, more than it turned out to be.

124
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,780
You need to get a regressing
clear approach to land acquisition

125
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,910
and permits, to have all the
prerequisites, the legal prerequisites

126
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,340
for the private sector to
proceed with the project.

127
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,210
And you also need to get things
right around stakeholder engagement.

128
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,080
Then, in the next phase, you
need to write the right contract

129
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,720
and that is the most important element,
and there is really a risk allocation.

130
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,060
Their governments have to follow
obviously the fundamental principle

131
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,630
within PPPs of allocating risks to

132
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:45,500
the contractual party that
is best able to manage those.

133
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,790
And in many cases, risk
sharing is the right way to go about.

134
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,480
And then, once this contract
is finalized - obviously, they

135
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,030
have to organize a very
transparent and unbiased procurement

136
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,940
process and also stay involved
because PPPs are a partnership

137
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,340
over a long time horizon so
it's not a one-off transactions,

138
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,390
the public sector really
needs to stay involved over a long

139
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,710
time, support the private
sector and also monitor the private

140
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,390
sector and how they execute
construction and the operations and later on.

141
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,750
So, there are a lot of things I
need to do across the life cycle.

142
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,150
So PPPs are a partnership,
there are governments and there's

143
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,280
the private sector, you
talked about the governments.

144
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,310
What are the challenges
for the private sector?
the private sector, you
talked about the governments.

145
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,490
What are the challenges
for the private sector?

146
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,500
For a private sector, it is
also quite a challenging thing

147
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,070
such a PPP, if you compare
it to traditional contracting.

148
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,440
First, the new capabilities
that are required from the private

149
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,030
sector, because it's not only
the design in the construction

150
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,430
piece but all of the sudden
construction companies have to operate

151
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,690
and maintain an asset
for a very long time.

152
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,490
Often they might not have
these skills in house so they need

153
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,240
to form partnerships
themselves or consortia with operating

154
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,340
companies, also with
financiers, to do all this.

155
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,450
And orchestrating that
consortium can be a difficult task.

156
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,320
Secondly, it's really because the risks
are transferred to the private sector.

157
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,440
The private sector has to
become really sophisticated about

158
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,790
assessing, evaluating
and managing these risks.

159
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,180
And there is a multitude of
them, it could be the traffic going

160
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,540
up and down, it could be
macroeconomic conditions that change,

161
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,510
so really, having a plan for
risk management is very essential.

162
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:34,070
Thirdly, it's really the
financing piece that comes on top for

163
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,570
the private sector because
the public sector kind of shifts

164
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,100
those assets off the balance sheet,
the private sector needs to finance them.

165
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,640
And in times of Basel III
regulation, where a project financed

166
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,700
by banks is more difficult,
this can also be a challenge and

167
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,890
developing the type of skills
you need to structure an efficient

168
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,430
financing, developing the
relationships with the banks, developing

169
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,540
relationships with
institutional investors or even setting up

170
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,980
funds by their own, to bring
in third party money into those

171
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,990
assets, this is some of the
additional challenges that the private

172
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,580
sector is facing. And last
but not least, obviously, it's a

173
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,770
long term partnership as
we've mentioned before.

174
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,060
And that leaves the private
sector exposed to the long political

175
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,790
cycle over thirty years, and
we all know governments change

176
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,110
every four to five years, and
that leaves them with quite some

177
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,160
risk in terms of political and
regulatory risk which is obviously

178
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,170
something that's not easy to
manage for private sector firm.

179
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,460
Over time we have heard about
some negative examples of PPPS,

180
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,380
what are the disadvantages?

181
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,160
Yes, no, I fully
agree, they are clearly.

182
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,520
.. PPPs are not felt safe and there
are examples of not successful PPPs.

183
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,150
For example, in Bolivia, a
concession was terminated because

184
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,540
of stakeholder opposition; in
Spain, we've seen quite a few

185
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,250
road concessions being bankrupted
after travel or traffic went down.

186
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,760
And there are many
reasons behind that.

187
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,470
But, really, the disadvantages
of PPP come in different shades.

188
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,860
First, the public sector kind
of loses control over an asset

189
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,940
and that is particularly a problem
in a very dynamic urban environment

190
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,810
sometimes where things are
happening fast and you put out the

191
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,340
concession for thirty years and
then you lose kind of the margin

192
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,450
to maneuver as a public sector.

193
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,060
Secondly, also, PPPs have
higher transaction costs because of

194
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,020
their complexity, they are
more complex to structure and that

195
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,790
results in costs. Typically, for
PPP, you need to have a minimum

196
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,950
threshold of investment so
that it actually makes sense.

197
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,030
And thirdly, PPPs are
over 30 years and there's one

198
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,630
contract which is written
today, so they essentially incomplete

199
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,110
those contracts, they cannot
account for every circumstance

200
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,910
that might arise in the future.

201
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,940
There will always be some
disputes and many of those disputes

202
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,040
can be very costly, you have these
renegotiations and the likelihood

203
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,670
for such renegotiations is
relatively high and that can be quite

204
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,500
expensive in the end.

205
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,780
And then, lastly, also the
private sector might have higher

206
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,040
cost of financing themselves
than the public sector has, so,

207
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,050
really, the PPP needs to have
sufficient efficiency gains to

208
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,840
offset this disadvantage.

209
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,810
And taking this all together,
obviously, PPP, in some cases,

210
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,760
it might make sense, in others, not.

211
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,740
So, for each case, you need to
have a rigorous analysis of the

212
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,010
advantages versus the
disadvantages and then come to a conclusion

213
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,710
whether it makes sense.

214
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,090
So Christoph, we have talked in
the beginning about the global

215
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,290
infrastructure investment gap
but, you, personally, what do

216
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,640
you think the future of PPP is?

217
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,600
PPPs came up in the UK
in the 90s, then they

218
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,400
spread around the world, many
emerging countries are now adopting

219
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,650
PPPs as well. I think that
the global adaptation will

220
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,840
certainly go up, and there are
many PPP programs being set up

221
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,520
in countries from Colombia,
even in Paraguay, Philippines, lot

222
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,560
of countries are pursuing that
and are convinced that it will

223
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,840
have some benefits. But I think
there's also an element of learning

224
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,760
that we need to embed into
PPPs because, we discussed before,

225
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,140
some PPPs have failed. And I
think there are nicely established

226
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,570
best practices how you're
supposed to do PPPs but they're not

227
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,340
always supplied and in practice.

228
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,090
But again, the many
initiatives on the way to get that done,

229
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,830
for example, the World Bank
has a PPP certification program

230
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,620
for managers that they
are instituting right now.

231
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,590
And governments are doing a
lot, they are setting up PPP units

232
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,030
to spread these capabilities
more broadly within the public

233
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,760
sector to structure PPPs.

234
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,460
Also, many governments have
revamped their previous PPP programs,

235
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,230
for example, UK with PF2 or
Colombia with their 4G program.

236
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,130
I think there's a learning
process that needs to be done and,

237
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,720
I believe, through that
learning process some of the benefits

238
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,500
of PPPs could come out even clearer.

239
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:13,700
But I also have to say I think
the infrastructure gap is not

240
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,330
going to be closed by PPPs alone.

241
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,560
There's a lot of other things
that governments need to get right

242
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,170
and that starts with really
prioritizing the right projects,

243
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,140
also having the government
money either through taxation or

244
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,690
user charging to pay
for infrastructure.

245
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,550
Also, an optimization of the
operations and maintenance of government

246
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,730
owned assets is
something they need to do.

247
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,090
Another thing, becoming
smarter or more digitally apt in

248
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,530
infrastructure is
another key way forward.

249
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,880
So, I think PPPs is not the
one route to go, there are many

250
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,720
other things you need
to do as a government.

251
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,940
But I would say, in that
portfolio of opportunities, PPPs will

252
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,420
make a contribution, and if we
learn to make them even better,

253
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,660
it could be a lasting contribution.

254
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,730
Great. Thanks, Christoph,
so much for your insights!

255
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,760
Thanks for having me here.
