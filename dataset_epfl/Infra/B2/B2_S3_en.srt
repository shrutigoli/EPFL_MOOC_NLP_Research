1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,870
Welcome to this third session
of our second block dealing with

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,590
the management of urban
infrastructure systems.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,540
In this third session, we want to
talk about different dimensions,

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,120
the five main dimensions
that one has to look at.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,460
We have already talked about
the dimensions in the first block.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,050
But here, we talk about the
implications that these dimensions

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,450
have, the technical, the
economic, the environmental, the social

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,530
and the jurisdictional
dimensions, their implications on

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,760
the management of urban
infrastructure systems.

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,980
Let's start with the
technical dimensions.

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,780
Here we have four
important things plus another one.

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,680
First, there is the question
of interconnection between the

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,020
different infrastructures in
the same or across jurisdictions.

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,710
Let’s take the example of
water or wastewater pipes.

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,470
These pipes have to be
connected and you have to manage these

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,520
interconnections. They may have
been built at different types,

17
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:21,170
at different moments in
history, some out of metal

18
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,620
and some out of plastic, and you
have questions of interconnection

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,120
of the pipes. Then, you have
questions of interoperability.

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,290
Here, I think the
transport is a very good example.

21
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:40,250
You are operating buses
across different jurisdictions, so

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,200
the platform where the bus is
going to discharge the passengers

23
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,650
are different in the different
cities that you are operating

24
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,440
in, even though they are
part of the same agglomeration.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,660
As a manager, technically, you
have to manage that interoperability

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,260
and adjust that, or you may
use different electricity systems

27
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:09,100
in different locomotives
running on different tracks.

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,100
The third big
challenge is the capacity.

29
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,750
Infrastructures have always
limited capacity, there are only

30
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,790
so many cars that you can
put on the road, so many metros

31
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,260
after metros, trams that you
can put on the metro tracks, how

32
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,680
many trams, so much water that
you can put through the pipe.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,400
And there are
capacity crunches and you,

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,970
as an infrastructure manager,
have to deal with these crunches.

35
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,900
And then, there's the system.

36
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,650
Overall, we're talking about
urban infrastructure systems,

37
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,760
so energy is an entire system
across the whole agglomeration

38
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,410
or across the whole metropolitan area.

39
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,620
And if you have a blackout in
one end, you have to make sure

40
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,460
that it doesn't extend
to the rest of the system.

41
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,290
You have a pollution in the
water system in one part and you

42
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,210
want to make sure that the
rest of the system functions.

43
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:16,260
So, it's really to consider
the entirety of the system that'

44
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,410
s important. And the fifth
element here, technically, is, of

45
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,710
course, the interfaces, so
it's not just each infrastructure

46
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,410
in itself that has to be
technically managed - interconnection

47
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,250
(phon) -, it's also the interfaces
between the different infrastructures.

48
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,040
We all know that transport,
that telecommunications are using

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,940
energy and so, if the
interface does not work well, you may

50
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,570
not have electricity to run the
urban train or you may not have

51
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,730
electricity to run the
urban communications tower.

52
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,790
So, all the interfaces among
the urban infrastructure systems

53
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,380
are extremely important
from a technical point of view.

54
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,860
From an economic point of view,
we have equally important things

55
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,050
to consider as managers.

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,880
Of course, you want to manage in
the economically most efficient

57
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:29,970
way. And this is,
of course, a rational

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,420
economic behavior. You don't
want to have waste in energy, waste

59
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,470
in water: we know that water
leakages are very big, amounting

60
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,650
to 30%, 40%, 50% -
sometimes 70% of the water leaks in

61
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,580
water pipes. This is
economically inefficient, it's a technical

62
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,060
problem but it's
economically inefficient.

63
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,360
The second element to
consider is the profitability,

64
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,050
we have already talked about that.

65
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,720
You want to make sure that
the infrastructure services

66
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,960
that you are providing are
ultimately profitable so that

67
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,740
you can develop in further services,
that you can innovate - things like that.

68
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,080
Think about taxi, taxi system or

69
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,510
a waste management system.

70
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,040
You want to make sure that the
waste you are treating is generating

71
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,700
some sort of profit so that you
can invest in new technologies

72
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,060
to better treat your waste.

73
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,830
You receive subsidies, we have
seen that, in some cases some

74
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,190
urban services, public
services receive subsidies.

75
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,930
Typically, in transport, there
are a lot of subsidies, sometimes

76
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,270
even in water. As a manager of
urban infrastructure services,

77
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,960
you want to make sure that
these subsidies are used in the most

78
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,160
efficient way possible because, we
will see this later, you are accountable.

79
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,800
Let's talk about the
environmental dimension now.

80
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:14,050
Environment, as we have already
said, is a very important dimension

81
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,150
in urban systems. Cities are
good big polluters of the world

82
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,990
and, if you can actually make
improvements in environmental

83
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,270
aspects of your urban
infrastructures, you can have a big impact

84
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,740
on overall pollution. So here, let's

85
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,440
say, the overall goal must, of
course, be to operate your infrastructures,

86
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,370
to manage your infrastructures in
the least polluting way possible.

87
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,220
This means clean
buses, this means energy

88
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,790
generated from
renewables, things like that.

89
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,510
Whenever possible, given a
certain state of technology and

90
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,930
given the finances at hand, you
want to make sure that you have

91
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,080
paid attention to the pollution, that
your infrastructures are generating.

92
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,180
Overall you want to have
minimal environmental impact.

93
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,450
When you build roads, when you tear

94
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,540
down houses for the metro tracks or

95
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,910
mass transit tracks, the goal
should always be to have a minimum

96
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,380
environmental impact. Ideally,
you would want to have a zero

97
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,370
environmental footprint, zero
waste, zero pollution, zero greenhouse

98
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,590
gas emissions - something that
we call urban metabolism where

99
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,050
everything is totally
recycled, the waste is burned to create

100
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,910
distance heating and reused, and least

101
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,040
heavy metal
pollution, things like that.

102
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,370
But, of course, this is very
much dependent on the state of

103
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,500
technology which itself is
dependent on the finances

104
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,210
that you can mobilize to
buy that kind of technology.

105
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:15,360
We have seen several things
already, we have seen the stakeholders,

106
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,320
the users and the citizens are
particularly sensitive to equity.

107
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,430
And you know you should
provide urban infrastructure

108
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,550
services in equitable ways.

109
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,810
All the people should have
access to drinking water, not just

110
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,830
the rich people or the ones that live
in some parts of the city or others.

111
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,370
The same access to
transport or things like that.

112
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,470
There is the whole
question of affordability.

113
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,980
This is the question
actually that relates - I mean, for

114
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,010
some urban inhabitants, a bus

115
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,530
ticket is highly affordable
because they have big incomes; for

116
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,460
other ones, I know cases
where workers pay almost

117
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,410
half of their salary simply to
get to work from one end of the

118
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,680
city to the other. That
means it's not affordable.

119
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,230
So affordability is not an
absolute term, it's not the price

120
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,330
of the ticket, it's the
price relative to the money that

121
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,880
these people have at their disposal
to use was the infrastructure services.

122
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,570
There is a social dimension that
managers have to pay attention to.

123
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,470
And then, there is the whole
question of discrimination.

124
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,640
It's easy to put a landfill in
the area where poor people are,

125
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,660
where they cannot actually protest.

126
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,580
It's easy to build a highway
through parts of the city where

127
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,950
the people are disorganized.
It’s more difficult to put a highway

128
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,290
through a gated community for example.

129
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,820
This equitable,
non-discriminating approach to urban

130
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,260
infrastructure development is a
particularly important dimension

131
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,540
that managers have
to pay attention to.

132
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,600
Let's come finally to the
jurisdictional dimension.

133
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,410
We have already talked about
it, the fact that infrastructures

134
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,760
often operate across different
jurisdictions, they are developed

135
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,490
across different jurisdictions.

136
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,710
This is a political challenge
because you deal with different

137
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,050
political authorities, but it's
also a legal challenge because

138
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,940
you deal with different legal systems.

139
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,850
There's also the issue of
transparency because you're operating

140
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,350
in different
jurisdictions, you have to show how

141
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,560
you are operating, you have
to show your costs, you have to

142
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,730
show the way that the things are run

143
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,990
in the different jurisdictions -
building and operating the things.

144
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,100
Water, bus, taxi
concessions, you have to be transparent.

145
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,090
And ultimately you are accountable.

146
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,740
Often you are accountable to
different authorities even though

147
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,250
you operate in another authority,
you are accountable to customers,

148
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,060
you are accountable to investors.

149
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,800
And you have to fulfill the
contract, and this doesn't really

150
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,730
matter whether you are a public
operator or a private operator.

151
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,210
In conclusion, we have looked
at the five main dimensions that

152
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,110
impact the management of
urban infrastructure systems.

153
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,010
Those are all dimensions
managers have to pay attention to.

154
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,580
In the next session, we will
talk about the main schools of

155
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,360
thought for managing the large
urban infrastructure systems.

156
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,100
Stay tuned.
