1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,630
Welcome back. This will be
the second session of the second

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,080
module; that's the module that talks
about managing urban infrastructure

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,700
systems. In this second session,
we will talk about the stakeholders

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,970
- managing the stakeholders.

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,050
I think it's very important to
show that in addition to managing

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,920
the infrastructure itself, as
we've seen before in terms of

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,930
maintenance, operations and
planning, there are a series of

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,550
stakeholders, namely users and
citizens, operators and investors

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,960
and, of course, policy
makers, political authorities that

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,200
the urban infrastructure
managers have to be attentive to.

11
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,280
They have objectives, they
want certain things and, if you do

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,640
not satisfy them, then it's
not enough to just operate

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,660
your system; you basically
operate your system for someone.

14
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,990
Let's first talk
about users and citizens.

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,620
I would like to talk about
users first and then explain the

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,540
difference with the citizens.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,410
The users are the ones who use the
infrastructures - not necessarily

18
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,800
the infrastructures, but the
services that are provided on the

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,790
infrastructures. There are
two types of users: there

20
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,890
are businesses, and the
businesses think of a big

21
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,850
factory that consumes
water or electricity or gas.

22
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,910
They are big users, they are
necessarily connected to the infrastructure

23
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,430
systems and what they mostly
worry about is the price of the

24
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,510
infrastructure service, how
expensive is the electricity consumed

25
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,360
and what is the quality of the
water or the quality of the electricity

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,740
in terms of how many
electricity cuts you actually get.

27
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,080
This is what business users of
urban infrastructure services

28
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,700
are mostly worried about and
managers have to satisfy them.

29
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,800
And then, there are
individual users or households

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,050
generally. Households also
consume water, they pay for the water

31
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,360
services, they consume gas,
they consume telecommunications

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,240
services, they consume electricity.

33
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,750
And what they are worried about
is, of course, also the price,

34
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,140
or rather the affordability
of it compared to their income.

35
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,170
How much, what proportion of
their salary do they actually have

36
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,390
to pay for gas or
electricity or water, that's what users

37
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,180
of infrastructure
services are worried about.

38
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,520
They are, of course, worried
about the quality of the services:

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,130
is the water polluted? I mean,
maybe you can take a shower but

40
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,140
you cannot drink it.

41
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,420
You still have to buy bottled water.

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,370
It's the quality of the services
and, what they are particularly

43
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,420
worried about, and that's
different from the business users,

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,820
is the accessibility. If
they use a metro station,

45
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,990
how far away is it? How
accessible is the infrastructure services?

46
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,750
The bus is running, I don't
know, every ten minutes or does

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,770
it come every three hours?

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,040
This is a question of
accessibility and that's really what the

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,220
users, the individual
users, are concerned with and

50
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,630
what the managers of the
urban infrastructure services have

51
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,120
to pay attention to.

52
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,810
Now, there are the citizens, and
the citizens are actually different

53
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,930
from the users. In some cases
they are similar, all the users

54
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,770
are generally citizens, but
there are many citizens who do not

55
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,000
use this infrastructure.
Think of some rich people who will

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,160
never take the metro or the tram.

57
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,810
They are concerned as citizens
about the quality, the efficiency

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,860
of the transportation system
because, if people use the trams

59
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,760
or the metro, the street is
less congested and then they can

60
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,770
actually advance more
rapidly in their cars.

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,660
So, as citizens, they are
concerned about the infrastructure

62
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,020
systems but not necessarily as users.

63
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,500
They are concerned about the
efficiency of it, they are concerned

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,580
about the sustainability of it -
think about pollution or things

65
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,250
like that -, they're concerned
about the resilience of the urban

66
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,840
infrastructure systems.

67
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,720
If the metro system breaks
down and everybody has to take the

68
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,110
car and that's going to last
for three days, then everybody

69
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,360
is affected and, ultimately, this is
about the quality of life in the city.

70
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,890
So, again, managers have to
pay attention to that too, they

71
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,320
have to pay attention to
the users and to the citizens.

72
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,170
And we will come back to the
citizens when we talk about the

73
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,510
political authorities.

74
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,360
But let's first talk about
the investors and the operators.

75
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,200
On the infrastructure side,
the physical infrastructure side,

76
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,940
we basically talk about
operators but basically about investors.

77
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,220
Generally, it's the
public authority that has

78
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,580
invested, but even there, as a
manager, you have to pay attention

79
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,560
to the public authority who has
invested money in the infrastructure;

80
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,590
but it may be a private
investor and he wants to see the return

81
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,210
on investment, the ROI.

82
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,510
A private investor is particularly

83
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,940
worried about the
regulations that are behind it.

84
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,290
If you are in the West, what
are the regulated rates that you

85
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,630
can charge for the
usage of the infrastructure?

86
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,380
In return, we have already said
that many of these infrastructures

87
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,690
are regulated. It's not just a
price that you can fix, the price

88
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,630
is determined by some
political authority and, of course, the

89
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,810
investor is mainly
concerned about what that regulation

90
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,360
actually is. More generally,
the investor will be concerned

91
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,030
about the relationship he or she
has with the political authorities.

92
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,760
This is on the investment side
or it could be on the operation

93
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,700
side, for example, if a private
operator operates a wastewater

94
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,600
treatment plant or a
waste recycling plant.

95
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,120
These are the kinds of
things they would worry about.

96
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,030
On the infrastructure
services side, you have operators,

97
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,500
private operators, but
even public operators.

98
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,890
They are of course worried about
the profitability of the services

99
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:17,020
they are offering. You run a tram

100
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,670
or you run a bus or a
series of buses for that matter

101
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,110
is: how much money do you make?

102
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,310
And many of that is regulated again.

103
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,080
What price can you
charge for the ticket?

104
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,920
What price can you charge for
the water that you are selling?

105
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,530
A regulated price. That
regulation directly determines

106
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,200
how profitable your operation is.

107
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,670
Another important element
is the willingness to pay.

108
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,370
The customers pay. How
much are they willing to pay?

109
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,490
How much are they cheating?

110
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,760
If they are cheating, if they
are not buying their bus ticket,

111
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,040
let's say 5% to 10% of
the transport users that

112
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,250
can be factored into the cost of
the operator, but it's important

113
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,260
to know whether the public
authorities go after these people

114
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,150
or not, for example.   A third
element that is important here

115
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,450
is: how easy it is to operate.

116
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:28,480
Can you start a bus
business easily or how long does

117
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,080
it take for you to get an
authorization, to get all the paperwork

118
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,900
done? So, those are the things
that the operators of the services

119
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,040
are mostly concerned about.

120
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:47,010
And again, the managers of urban
infrastructure systems have to look at that.

121
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,800
Now, in terms of policy
makers, I will make a distinction

122
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,230
between several
layers of policy makers.

123
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,710
The most typical layer is, of
course, the city government.

124
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,860
You are operating a water
system in a city and you may

125
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,260
be even owned by the city or you
may have a contract with the city.

126
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,390
Now, what is the city worrying about?

127
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,540
The city will be worrying about
how much your operations cost,

128
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,240
especially if the city
has to give you subsidies

129
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:28,870
or it supports you in the
investments or on the maintenance

130
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,050
of the infrastructure.

131
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,470
A city government will also be
worried about the customer satisfaction

132
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,450
and the citizen satisfaction.

133
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,980
You, as an operator of
an urban infrastructure,

134
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,780
know that your political
authorities are extremely sensitive

135
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,780
to the fact that the citizens may
or may not be satisfied, because

136
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,900
that will determine whether you
get your contract renewed, whether

137
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,930
you get a subsidy, how much
you get as a subsidy, whether you

138
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,560
have penalties in your
contract, things like that.

139
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,340
Ultimately, the city government
is worried about the attractiveness

140
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,030
of the urban infrastructure
and the competitiveness of

141
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,020
the city, and that's something that
managers have to watch out for too.

142
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,550
In some areas, you have
actually a metropolitan

143
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,080
government or an agglomeration
government, we have already seen

144
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,990
the jurisdictional problems
before, you may not have that.

145
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,200
But, if there's a metropolitan
government, there are other things

146
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,040
that the metropolitan
government is attentive to.

147
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,540
Maybe your contract, as an
operator, is with the metropolitan

148
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,650
government, not with
the city government.

149
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,030
The whole thing will apply to
the metropolitan government.

150
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,090
And then you have two other
layers of government which may

151
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:55,390
be a regional government in
federalist states or it may be directly

152
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,390
the national government.

153
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,090
These are important because
sometimes, or at least in certain

154
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:06,280
countries, the investments
that are made are not directly

155
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,350
made by the city, but they are
actually made by the regional

156
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,720
government or by the
national government.

157
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,120
These governments that
invest or give subsidies

158
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,290
or even make contracts with
you are worried about the costs,

159
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,610
but ultimately, of course,
they're worried about the attractiveness

160
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,270
of the metropolitan area, of the
competitiveness of the metropolitan

161
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,600
area.

162
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,520
So, these are as many things that
the managers of urban infrastructures

163
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,010
have to look at. My main point
here is you don't just manage

164
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,480
the infrastructure itself.

165
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,430
You don't just manage the
operations, you don't just manage

166
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,290
the maintenance and the
planning, you also manage the major

167
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,760
stakeholders of these
infrastructures: the citizens, the users,

168
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,670
the operators, if they apply,
the investors and the different

169
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,290
levels of policy makers.

170
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,180
Now, having seen the different
stakeholders, what that means

171
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:18,050
for management, in the next
session we are going to come back

172
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,270
on the different dimensions of
urban infrastructure management

173
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,430
and what infrastructure
managers have to pay attention to.

174
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,510
We have talked, you remember,
about the economic dimensions,

175
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,910
the technical dimensions, the
social dimensions, the environmental

176
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,970
dimensions and the
jurisdictional dimension.

177
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,570
We are going to come
back to that, stay tuned.
