1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,590
Welcome back to the fourth
session of the second block.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,470
In it, we will talk about the
different, the three main schools

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,810
of management when it
comes to urban infrastructures.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,460
These schools are: the Public
Management School, what we call

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,980
the New Public Management
School; the Market Approach, and

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,630
I would also like to talk, at
the end of this presentation,

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,420
about a new phenomenon called
PPPs or Public-Private Partnerships

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,670
which has become one of the important
ways to manage urban infrastructures.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,480
Let's start first
with Public Management.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,460
Public Management goes
together with - you remember, in the

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,210
first block I talked about the
different intellectually coherent

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,350
approaches to look at
urban infrastructure systems.

13
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,970
The Public Management approach goes
together with the public policy approach.

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,330
Basically, what you have is an
integrated municipal infrastructure

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,020
which has both the
infrastructure and services that

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,120
it provides. And this
is owned basically by

17
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,480
the municipality, by the city.

18
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,890
It's an operator of the
infrastructure and the services owned

19
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:38,490
by the municipal
authorities, and this operator,

20
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,020
the water operator, the
energy operator, the gas operator,

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,200
the electricity operated, the
telecom operator, the public

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,890
transport operator,
sometimes even cable TV

23
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:54,900
and things like that, is
primarily serving the citizens.
transport operator,
sometimes even cable TV

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,510
and things like that, is
primarily serving the citizens.

25
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,880
Of course, they are also
customers but we are in the public

26
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,600
policy approach, so, really,
the focus is serving the citizens.

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,780
This operator is
commanded and controlled by

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,460
the municipal government, it is
owned by the municipal government;

29
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,700
the municipal government
decides how it is basically managed:

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:26,710
that's why it's
called public management.
the municipal government

31
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,460
that's why it's
called public management.

32
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,790
If the services this operator
provides are not satisfactory,

33
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,860
the idea goes the
citizens, by virtue of a

34
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,140
political process, will have
an influence on the municipal

35
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,410
government, either they will
vote them out of office or they

36
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,740
will explain to the political
authorities that they are not

37
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,490
happy with the services; and
then, the municipal government

38
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,350
will influence on the way the
infrastructure operating operator

39
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,020
is doing its job and even
maybe change the directors or the

40
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,100
managers of this operator. The
public management approach is

41
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,700
coherent in its own right.

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,780
It stems from a time
where urban infrastructure

43
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,570
services are mainly
monopolistic, where everything is under

44
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,560
control of the political authorities.

45
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,920
It is still the case in
many countries, and this

46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,630
model still operates
in many situations.

47
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,450
Let's move to something that has
been called the "New Public Management".

48
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,980
I would say that it is the
widespread model that we have, at

49
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,560
least in the
industrialized, the northern countries.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,830
Basically, what we have here is
a slight change to the previous

51
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,410
public management model.

52
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,040
We still have an integrated
municipal operator: water,

53
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,930
energy, transport, you name
it, that does the infrastructure

54
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,420
and the services but it has
a certain degree of autonomy

55
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,520
from the political authorities.

56
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,540
And the main focus of that
operator is now the customer

57
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,710
not necessarily the citizens.

58
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,180
The idea is that it
operates like a private company.

59
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,730
It's totally publicly owned but
it operates like a private company

60
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,960
and need some autonomy to do that.

61
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,060
The main idea behind this is
that there is a separation between

62
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,600
production of services
and provision of services.

63
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,030
The autonomized entity is
in charge of producing the

64
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,210
services, the political
authority is in charge of providing

65
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,470
the services. Here, you see
that this entity - and basically,

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,230
in between the political
authorities responsible

67
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,810
for providing the services and
the operator in charge of producing

68
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,900
the services, we have now
professional management.

69
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,400
Not political management like
in the previous school of thought

70
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,380
but professional management.

71
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,180
Again, if the customers, who
also happened to be citizens, are

72
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,210
not satisfied with the
services, they will let it be known to

73
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,460
the political authorities which
will then change to professional

74
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,350
management, which will then
change the way the infrastructure

75
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,700
services are provided. It's
somehow different with the public

76
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,960
management approach but it's
still a continuation of the public

77
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,320
management approach, basically
by saying that the services become

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,270
more professional, that the
customer is the first focus and

79
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,190
by making this distinction
between production and provision.

80
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,230
Now, let's go to markets.

81
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,890
This market based
approach, as the PPP approach

82
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:29,270
that we will talk about a
little later, is basically in

83
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,540
line with the approach
I have presented in the

84
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,250
last block which is called
the public economy approach.

85
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:46,180
There's a provision,
there's an operator that produces

86
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,060
the infrastructure services,
the water services, the energy

87
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,980
services, the transportation
services, and this producer

88
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,190
of the services is either
privatized - it's a private operator
services, the transportation
services, and this producer

89
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,480
of the services is either
privatized - it's a private operator

90
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,420
- or it's corporatized, that
means it's a shareholding company

91
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:12,070
which can belong to the public
authorities of that city or of any other city.

92
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:19,060
And things can be unbundled in
the sense that the infrastructure

93
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,620
may remain owned by the
municipality, the provision of the infrastructure

94
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,580
may be in the ownership of the
private operator but the basic

95
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,530
focus here is the customer.

96
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,340
This is supposed to be an
entity that operates like any private

97
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,200
company that is serving the customers.

98
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:47,190
Now, here, the main
mechanism to attribute,

99
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,190
the mandate to produce is competition

100
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,620
or tendering. We have already
seen in the last block that, because

101
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,180
of economic reasons, we deal
with monopoly, so you cannot always

102
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,240
create competition, you can,
for example, create competition

103
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,700
between transport operators
in a city but you cannot really

104
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,930
create competition in
the market among water

105
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,230
companies. Basically, what you
do is creating competition what

106
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,380
is called "for the market";
you tender the services, you make

107
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,000
a call and you ask the
companies to offer their services.

108
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,210
And then, you choose the best
which has either the best price,

109
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,580
the best quality, depending
on a series of criteria and the

110
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,880
public authorities choose
which of the operators is going

111
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,830
to be providing these services.

112
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,680
Now, this is of course
regulated; once you have privatized,

113
00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:00,210
autonomized the services, there
is a regulation of these services

114
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,630
and there is also, of course,
a regulation of the tendering

115
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,310
process to make sure you
actually obtain the best services

116
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,770
possible. The political
authorities control all this,

117
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,190
the municipal government
controls all this basically by defining

118
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,200
the regulation, by defining
the tendering procedures and by
the municipal government
controls all this basically by defining

119
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,760
the regulation, by defining
the tendering procedures and by

120
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,580
defining the criteria against which

121
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,810
the producer obtains

122
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,510
the contract to operate.

123
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:44,270
The political control
mechanism is still the same in

124
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,300
that the citizens have
chosen the municipal government

125
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,840
but the link between the
citizens and the customers is a little

126
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,480
bit more tenuous one.

127
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,570
It's not the customer that
directly influences the citizen,

128
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,970
the customer is supposed to
communicate directly with the operator

129
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,550
whether he or she is
satisfied with the services.

130
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,960
Now another version, a more, I
would say, more modern or more

131
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,350
adapted version today to the
market approach is what we call

132
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,280
public-private partnerships.

133
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,130
This has become a dominant model,
I would say, in public transport

134
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,780
on the one hand and
in waste water services

135
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,440
on the other.
Basically, we have again a

136
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,570
corporatized entity that produces

137
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,170
the services, and this
entity is related to the customer.

138
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,450
Now, this entity contracts with

139
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,840
the public authorities.

140
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,190
Generally, like in the market
model, the contract is tendered,

141
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,670
there is a
competition for that contract.

142
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,430
Something we call the PPP,
public-private partnership, contract

143
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,440
between an operator and the
municipal authority, the municipal

144
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,610
government that basically
decides what kind of services

145
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,910
it wants, how much it is
prepared to pay for these services

146
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,580
and in what quality it
wants these services.

147
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,070
The contracts are tendered
and we saw before that tendering

148
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,610
procedures are regulated.
Basically, the citizens influence

149
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,640
the government that contracts and
the customers are in relationship

150
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,310
with the operator that
provides the services.

151
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,930
This is the basic PPP mechanism.

152
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,150
Now let me briefly
explain two more things.

153
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,110
There are two types of
PPPs, and it's important

154
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,580
to understand the nature of those.

155
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,030
The first are called management PPPs.

156
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,570
These PPPs apply in the case
that the urban infrastructure

157
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,950
exists. Basically, it
doesn't need rehabilitation or

158
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,570
big investments. We see
a lot of management PPPs

159
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,950
in the case of public transport,
because the road infrastructure

160
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,020
- you will not ask the bus
operating company to invest into the roads.

161
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,800
Basically here, the
municipal government

162
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:53,140
tenders management PPP,
let's say, to a private

163
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,820
bus operator which can be an
entity that is owned by another

164
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,700
municipality, but offering the
services in this municipality.

165
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,680
There are, simply said, three

166
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,950
types of contracts: there are
management contracts, lease contracts

167
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:11,960
and concessions. The difference is in
terms of the length of the contract.
types of contracts: there are
management contracts, lease contracts

168
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,740
and concessions. The difference is in
terms of the length of the contract.

169
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,930
Management contracts typically
between one and four years, lease

170
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,520
contracts between four and
fifteen years, concession contracts

171
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,830
longer than fifteen years.

172
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,870
This again relates to
economics and also to the politics

173
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,910
of it. The shorter the
contract, the more controlled by the

174
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:44,490
municipal authority, but the
longer the contract, the more economic

175
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:50,430
sense it makes, because you can
acquire efficiency gains during

176
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,690
the lifetime of the contract.

177
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,980
And, of course, it also
depends very much on the technology

178
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,350
that is behind it, so water
and sewerage contracts are

179
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,080
in general longer term contracts
than public transport contracts.

180
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,600
Now, in the case that the
infrastructure is very deficient or

181
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,170
doesn't even exist and needs
to be rehabilitated before you

182
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,320
can actually produce a
service or needs even to be built to

183
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,210
before you can produce a
service, in this case, we use something

184
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,090
that's called financial PPPS.

185
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,410
And this means that the
private operator that will produce

186
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,800
the services will put up
the money, it's not the public

187
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,710
authority that builds the
water treatment plant or the water,

188
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,780
the sewerage treatment plant or
the waste management facility,

189
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,970
it's the private operator that
puts the money up, then builds,

190
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:06,000
it operates it in the
first case and once it has

191
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,520
operated it for a certain
period of time ten, fifteen, twenty

192
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,060
years, it transfers the
ownership to the municipal, to the public

193
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:21,330
governments, to the public
authority which then comes too on it.

194
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,200
More widespread is the second
version, in the sense that the

195
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,200
private operator builds the
water treatment plant, transfers

196
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,220
the ownership directly to the
municipal government, does not

197
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,860
own it any longer but in
exchange receives a management contract,

198
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,520
generally a lease contract of
ten, fifteen years in order to

199
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,610
operate it, and by doing so,
recuperate the money it has

200
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,000
invested into
building this infrastructure.

201
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,340
I think this is the widespread

202
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,070
model that is becoming more
and more widespread worldwide for

203
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:14,740
various reasons, but the main
reason is probably technology,

204
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,750
the costs of developing
the infrastructures which are

205
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,480
increasing. Let's
just take one example.

206
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,570
This is the water example.

207
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:30,080
Water is becoming more
and more polluted, the costs

208
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,320
of cleaning it are
becoming exorbitant, the municipal

209
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,970
authorities don't have the
money anymore to invest in these

210
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:45,400
infrastructures and are
increasingly recurring to financial

211
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,850
PPPs and then management PPPs,
BTO contracts, Bailed Transfer

212
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,160
Operate contracts, to
operate the urban infrastructures.

213
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,420
But here again, we keep the
distinction that I made previously

214
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,140
in the New Public Management
School between production of the

215
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,800
services, which is the operator,
the contracted private operator

216
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:14,980
and provision of the services
which remains the responsibility

217
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,020
of the municipal government.

218
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:22,250
That's the provision caters
to the citizens, the production

219
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,340
caters to the consumers.

220
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,380
In this session I have given you,
those are the three main schools

221
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,030
of thought, the PPP being basically
a form of market school of thought.

222
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,380
These are the schools of
thought that currently exist in the

223
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,320
management of urban infrastructures.

224
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,650
In the next session, we will do
an interview with a practitioner

225
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,560
who will explain you, from a
practical side, how these things work.

226
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,320
And then, I will come at the
very end of this block and say

227
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,290
a few words about the role of
the information and communication

228
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:04,510
technologies that are
actually substantially changing,

229
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,640
if not revolutionizing, the
provision of urban infrastructure

230
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,510
services.
