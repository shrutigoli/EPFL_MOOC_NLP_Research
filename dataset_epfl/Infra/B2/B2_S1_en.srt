1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,170
Welcome back. This will be the second
block of our MOOC on managing

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,520
urban infrastructures. In it, we
will talk about the foundations

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,800
of managing these infrastructures.

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,990
Now, this second block has
six different sessions.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,190
In the first session, we will talk
about what exactly the managers

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,200
do when managing urban
infrastructures.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,800
Then, we will talk about the
stakeholders that are related to

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,140
the performance of these
infrastructures and what the managers

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,200
do with the stakeholders. Thirdly,
we will come back to the

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,870
different dimensions of managing
urban infrastructure systems,

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,830
the ones we have already talked
about in the first block.

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,810
Then, we will talk about the
different schools of thought in

13
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,560
managing urban infrastructure systems.

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,950
Following that, we will have an
interview with an expert on

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:10,300
public-private partnerships, which
are one of the main new forms

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,820
of managing urban infrastructures.

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,280
And finally, we will say a few words
about the role of the information

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
and communication technologies in the
management of urban infrastructure

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,080
systems, which, as you know, are
growing more and more important.

20
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,600
Let's first move to the first session.

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,880
What do urban infrastructure
managers exactly do?

22
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,260
What are their main activities?

23
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:46,830
There are three big tasks: they have
to plan, they have to operate

24
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,480
and they have to maintain
these infrastructures.

25
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,830
These are technical tasks.

26
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,770
And basically, in this first
session, we will talk about them.

27
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,500
The first big activity of
infrastructure managers is to plan.

28
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,700
And planning comes in two forms
because those have two different

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,410
time horizons: planning for the
infrastructure itself and planning

30
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,100
for the services that are provided
on the infrastructures.

31
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,250
For the infrastructure itself,
let's take the example of

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,020
the transportation network, the 
metro network, the energy network

33
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,080
that you are going to put into
the city, or the water network.

34
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,850
You have to plan - a water network is
there for 80 years, you have to plan.

35
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,320
Where do you put the
wastewater treatment plan?

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,890
Which streets are you digging up?

37
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,900
Which tunnels are you digging?

38
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,530
But, even for green infrastructures,
you have to plan.

39
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,180
Where do we build the trees?

40
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,650
It is going to take twenty
years for them to grow.

41
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,600
Where do you put the parks?

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,510
This requires careful
long-term planning.

43
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,210
The second dimension of planning is
actually the services, pertains

44
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,080
to the services. So, you have
transport, vehicles that are running

45
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,710
on the infrastructure. Now, you
have to plan for the acquisition

46
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,460
of these vehicles. But the
time horizon is different.

47
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,610
They may have a lifespan of ten
years, fifteen years, twenty years.

48
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,280
And then, you are going to
sell them to somebody else.

49
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,690
It is another time
horizon for planning.

50
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,600
Yet, it requires planning.

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,020
When your vehicles are obsolete, 
when are you going to buy a new one?

52
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,480
Similarly for IT systems which
you are going to use for billing

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,580
the customers in water, in gas,
in electricity, for example.

54
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,520
We know that IT systems have a
relatively short time span.

55
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,370
Still, you have to plan which
ones to buy, when to buy them,

56
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,160
when to replace them, all
these kinds of things.

57
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,160
And, of course, you have to
coordinate between the two.

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,830
Precisely, because the lifespan is
different between the infrastructure

59
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,150
and the infrastructure services.

60
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,990
So, how are the new wagons
that you are going to buy?

61
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,240
How are you making them compatible
with the infrastructure?

62
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,280
You have to plan that.

63
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,270
You need to adapt them to the
old infrastructure, or you need

64
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,900
to upgrade the rail infrastructure
so that they will be compatible

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,330
with the new locomotives
that come on track.

66
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,430
These are the kinds of coordination
problems that infrastructure

67
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,760
managers face in terms of planning.

68
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,200
The second big task of urban
infrastructure managers is operations.

69
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,070
I mean, this is maybe the first
thing that people see is

70
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,960
the transport system working. 
Are the buses operating well?

71
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,780
Are they clean? Are they on time?

72
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,620
Are they coordinating?

73
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,280
Do you make your connections?

74
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,950
Things like that. Every day,
operations of transport, energy,

75
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,480
water, wastewaters, things like that.

76
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,180
This is, I would say, one of
the major tasks, and often

77
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,070
you have a series of crises in there.

78
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,890
So, managers are quite absorbed by
short-term operational questions

79
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,850
because that's where things go wrong.

80
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,630
Again, you also have
operations on the services.

81
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,180
You have to operate the vehicles,
not just the infrastructures,

82
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,310
but also the vehicles that are dear.

83
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,390
And you have to operate the
metering and the billing of water

84
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,780
services, or of energy services
- electricity and gas services.

85
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,280
Another big task of infrastructure
managers - of course, things

86
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,840
have to be coordinated
again between these two.

87
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,540
So, for example, if something
goes wrong on the track, maybe

88
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,110
there is a breakdown of a signal that
has an effect on the operations

89
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,210
of the train or if the locomotive
breaks down, then, you cannot

90
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,810
optimally use the infrastructure
that is available.

91
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,340
So again, also in operations, there
are big coordination challenges

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,730
for managers of urban
infrastructure systems.

93
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,290
And the third big challenge
is the maintenance.

94
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,210
Again, we distinguish between the
infrastructure and the infrastructure

95
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,030
services. Both have to be maintained.

96
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,640
The infrastructure has
to be maintained.

97
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,560
The tracks have to be
repaired regularly.

98
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,240
Usually, that happens in a night when
there is no transport running.

99
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,790
The electricity lines, if they get
disconnected, have to be repaired.

100
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,430
The water pipes have to be repaired.

101
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,630
The green infrastructures
have to be maintained.

102
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,300
You all know that trees will not
survive in cities, if there

103
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,780
are not watered regularly, if they are
not trimmed, and things like that.

104
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,870
This is all maintenance of
urban infrastructure systems.

105
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,480
And of course, you also have to
maintain the vehicles, you have

106
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,230
to maintain the metering systems, the IT
systems, all these kinds of things.

107
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,890
And again, the maintenance needs to
be coordinated among each other.

108
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,900
For example, you maintain the urban
transport, the train infrastructure

109
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,290
during the times when the
trains are not running.

110
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,860
This needs to be properly coordinated.

111
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,810
You maintain the locomotives,
not during the daytime when you

112
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,460
need them, but you maintain them
during the night,

113
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,710
when there are less transport services.

114
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,650
We have seen here, in this session,
the three main activities

115
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,270
of urban infrastructure managers.

116
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,430
Now, from here, we will
go to the stakeholders.

117
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:13,500
Because all this involves stakeholders:
users, citizens, authorities

118
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,490
and urban infrastructure managers
do not just have to manage

119
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,860
the infrastructures. They also
have to manage the stakeholders

120
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,550
that are involved in all
these infrastructures.
