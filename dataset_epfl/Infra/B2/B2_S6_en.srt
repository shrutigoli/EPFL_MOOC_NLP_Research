1
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:09,031
Welcome back to this last session
of the second block.

2
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:12,376
In it I would like to talk

3
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:16,790
about the role of the information
and communication technologies:

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,874
How these technologies

5
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:22,531
affect the management
of the urban infrastructure systems.

6
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:26,852
I am sure you have heard by now
about smart cities,

7
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:28,963
smart transport, smart water,

8
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:31,728
smart energy.

9
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:36,842
And this is clearly the result
of the growing role,

10
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:42,532
I would say, in the last 10 to 15 years,
in managing urban infrastructure systems.

11
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:44,791
I will talk about three roles basically,

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,124
three functions that the ICT plays.

13
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:53,500
They play a role in efficiency gains,
in empowered customer relationships,

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,230
role of the customer,

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,885
and in terms of the new services
that the ICTs allow.

16
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,292
Now, let's talk 
about efficiency gains first.

17
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:11,792
Now, basically, efficiency gains
and the role of the ICTs

18
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:13,946
is about information.

19
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:17,156
Managers of urban infrastructure systems

20
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:21,699
use information
to manage these infrastructures.

21
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:24,543
And, thanks to the ICTs,

22
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,593
they have more information available.

23
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:29,191
That is the basic principle.

24
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:32,461
And where does this information come from?

25
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:35,758
Thanks to the ICTs,
it comes from sensors,

26
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:39,636
from RFID chips
put into all kinds of things,

27
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,965
from cameras,
and of course from the data

28
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:50,624
that are so provided and then managed
in order to make better decisions.

29
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:53,539
So, basically, what do the ICTs do?

30
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:56,822
They duplicate or mirror, as I call it,

31
00:01:57,132 --> 00:01:59,965
they mirror the physical infrastructure

32
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:05,501
by way of a data infrastructure,
or data layer, if you want,

33
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:10,663
and then the managers
of urban infrastructure systems

34
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:15,480
can take better decisions
to operate their infrastructures,

35
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,475
to maintain their infrastructures,

36
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:19,821
and even to plan their infrastructures.

37
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,822
Let me just give one example.

38
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:26,854
You all know that the water pipes,
the drinking water pipes,

39
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,977
or the sewage pipes under the ground,

40
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:31,749
they have leakages.

41
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:35,384
We have huge leakages,
but thanks to sensors

42
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:39,729
we can now locate these leakages
much more precisely

43
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:46,654
and so we can intervene much more rapidly
in a much more targeted way,

44
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,675
not to create--

45
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:54,509
or create at least less disturbances
in the streets when we dig up the streets.

46
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:59,478
And by that, the whole system
can be managed

47
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:03,064
in a much more efficient way
than previously.

48
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:04,352
This is the first role

49
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:07,352
of the Information 
Communication Technologies.

50
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:11,447
The second role is about the customer.

51
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:19,032
So, we have now seen there is a data layer
coming on top of the infrastructure layer

52
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,916
or the infrastructure services layer.

53
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:26,070
And the customers,
they can take advantage--

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,163
It is not only the managers
that can use this infromation

55
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:32,031
to improve the services,

56
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:36,764
it is the customers that can use this data

57
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:40,544
to better use the infrastructure,

58
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:44,167
to better take advantage
of the urban infrastructure.

59
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:49,791
For example, by having
real time information about transport,

60
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:53,126
where are the congestions?

61
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:54,568
All these kind of things.

62
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,445
Let's talk about the third function

63
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:05,501
is the new services
that are being made possible

64
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,500
thanks to this data layer.

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,686
Again those are services

66
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:12,883
that are ultimately
going to be useful to the customers.

67
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:16,000
And these data,

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,185
not only can the customers use them,
as we saw before,

69
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:24,186
in the case of real time information
about congestion,

70
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:29,655
but they can use this information
for all kinds of new services.

71
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:34,132
Think in this case, for example,
about car or bike sharing,

72
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:41,631
where you know exactly
where things are available,

73
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,260
the next bike is available,

74
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,791
the next car is available,

75
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,027
and there are companies now

76
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:49,291
that can offer car
and bike sharing services

77
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,916
thanks to the data layer
that has been created.

78
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:56,353
So, basically we have these three things,

79
00:04:56,353 --> 00:05:02,415
and we will talk in more detail
about this later

80
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:04,500
at very concrete examples.

81
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,384
Let me conclude this second block.

82
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:14,654
It has been quite a long block
with quite a lot of information.

83
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:17,402
And we have given you--

84
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:21,282
First I think we have really
talked about what managers do

85
00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:23,383
in urban infrastructure systems.

86
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:26,854
They operate the systems,
they maintain the systems,

87
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:29,478
they plan for future systems.

88
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:33,218
Then we have talked
about the stakeholders.

89
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:38,947
Urban infrastructure management
is not just about activities,

90
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:40,937
it's also about operations.

91
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:43,655
It is also about managing

92
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,125
the different stakeholders
that are involved.

93
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:49,310
We have talked about
the citizens, the customers,

94
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,336
the operators, the investors,
and the different political authorities

95
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:57,854
that are all involved.

96
00:05:57,854 --> 00:06:01,123
And, again, the managers
have a big role to play

97
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:04,000
in dealing with these stakeholders.

98
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,720
The third session
was about the different dimensions.

99
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,164
We have talked 
about the technical dimensions

100
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:13,000
of managing infrastructures,

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,822
think of interoperability,

102
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:18,478
we have talked about
the economic dimensions

103
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,884
of managing urban infrastructures,

104
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:25,825
a lot of economic considerations here
about the social dimensions,

105
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,532
the environmental dimensions,

106
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:32,000
and, of course,
the jurisdictional dimensions

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,309
and challenges these dimensions pose
to the urban infrastructure managers.

108
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,290
In the fourth session

109
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,061
we have talked about the different 
schools of thought.

110
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:45,124
And, basically, we showed you

111
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:48,977
that there is a public management
school of thought,

112
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:50,915
including new public management,

113
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,946
and then a market-based
school of thought,

114
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:59,416
where the public-private partnerships
is now the prevalent model.

115
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,975
And just before I have talked to you

116
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:08,746
about the three different roles
the ICTs are now increasingly playing

117
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:11,406
in managing urban infrastructure systems.

118
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:16,137
In the next two blocks,
we will now go into detail

119
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:18,184
and first talk about energy

120
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,354
and then talk about transportation.

121
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:24,196
And, here again, we will see
much more concretely

122
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:26,782
how all these things play out:

123
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:31,636
the management functions,
the stakeholder functions,

124
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:33,446
and, of course, the role

125
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:36,446
of the information 
communication technologies.

126
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:37,714
Stay tuned.
