As discussed previously, law exists at many levels, from the local level up to the international.
International law is different from law at national and sub-national levels, so in this unit we will spend some time exploring what international law is and how it is relevant for conservation.
While national law binds individuals as well as corporations, organizations and government actors, international law primarily governs relationships between States, at least in theory.
Before explaining, I will quickly note that here we are talking about public international law â€“ there exists a field of private international law that governs international transactions and relationships between private entities, like corporations, but we will not focus on that in this discussion.
In the traditional model of public international law States make treaties and agreements amongst each other, which are only binding on the
States.
Each State is responsible for implementing and enforcing the obligations contained in these agreements on its own citizens, through national law.
This is based on a concept of State sovereignty, in which each country has the exclusive right to make law within its territory and control the actions of its citizens.
However, this model is simplistic at best, and doesnâ€™t really describe the current legal situation.
Multinational corporations have grown bigger and stronger in international influence â€“ many have annual operating budgets higher than the GDP of the States in which they operate.
The line between State and private entity is not always clear, with many wholly or partly
State-owned corporations or public-private partnerships.
NGOs and business interests now participate in the negotiation of treaties as well as their implementation.
Private governance has grown at the international as well as the national level, through corporate standards, labels and private certification schemes.
Civil society and social movements can directly regulate multinational corporations, through consumer and shareholder decisions and public shaming and boycotts facilitated by new forms of media.
Today there is growing international recognition of the significant role of non-state actors in international law.
At this point it is worth taking a step back and asking what is the purpose of international law?
We can start by imagining a world with no international law.
In this world, law is only created at the national level or below.
What problems could this cause?
One problem might be how to deal with transboundary resources.
Imagine a river that crosses a border between countries.
How do the countries share the water?
What about the fish?
What if one country wants to build a dam, or pours pollution into the river?
How could these problems be resolved?
We can also think of questions related to global resources, like oceans or the atmosphere.
A striking example is climate change â€“ a global problem that cannot easily be resolved on a national level.
Another category of problems relates to things that happen entirely within one country, but concern the rest of the world.
The most extreme example is activities that are fundamentally shocking, to the point that they go against what it means to be human.
I am talking about genocide, slavery, torture and other crimes against humanity.
Where these crimes take place within a country, should there be a way for other countries to step in?
And what about other harm, like loss of an entire species, or destruction of an irreplaceable archeological site?
Should the international community be concerned about this?
There are many other examples.
Sometimes solving a problem requires international cooperation â€“ such as when wildlife in one country is killed because of demand in another.
Sometimes countries canâ€™t manage a problem on their own, and need help, including financial and technical resources.
Can you think of other problems that would exist in a world without international law?
We can think of many challenges that cannot be solved by national and subnational law alone.
Letâ€™s think about how international law can help solve them.
There are three main functions that international law can perform.
The first is legislative: international law can create norms and standards for the international community.
These can include principles like the obligation not to cause transboundary harm, and targets like conservation of 11% of terrestrial areas and inland waters through protected areas by 2020.
It can also create procedural norms, such as obligations to obtain prior informed consent or conduct environmental impact assessments for certain activities.
Not all of these norms are binding, but even where they are not, they can create important standards for governments and private actors.
The second function is administrative: international law creates mechanisms such as international bodies, processes, fora and funds for monitoring and coordinating implementation of the standards.
This can include global bodies such as the
UN or multilateral bodies like river basin organizations.
There can also be scientific bodies, such as the IPCC.
The third function is adjudicative: international law can provide mechanisms for resolving disputes between countries.
This includes the international court of justice and the international criminal court, but also specific processes described in treaties for managing disagreements.
So far we have discussed what international law can do, but not what it looks like and where it comes from.
There are three principal sources of international law.
The first we have already mentioned: agreements.
These can have many names -- treaties, conventions, pacts, etc.
Whatever they are called, they must be in written form, and the parties must show an intention to be bound.
The second source of international law is customary international law.
Customary international law is legally binding, even though it may not be found in a specific binding treaty.
It is defined by two criteria: it must be the general practice of states, and it must be followed out of a sense of legal obligation.
There is often some discussion over whether a particular principle has achieved the status of customary law.
A well known example is the Law of the Sea, which was based on customary international law for centuries before its codification in the 1980s.
The third source of international law is general principles of law, which relates primarily to procedure and today is mostly used to fill gaps.
In addition to binding international law, sometimes called â€œhard lawâ€�, there is a world of international law that is not legally binding but still carries some weight.
This is called â€œsoft lawâ€�, and includes non-binding declarations, resolutions, programs of action, and memoranda of understanding.
Soft law can guide and influence the behavior of states and other actors, and help coordination around common principles and goals.
Soft law can also become hard law.
Soft law principles can be written into agreements.
Or, when soft law principles are followed by States in practice, in a way that shows acceptance of an obligation to be bound, they can become customary international law.
In the next sequence we will look at specific international conventions that are relevant for environmental conservation.
