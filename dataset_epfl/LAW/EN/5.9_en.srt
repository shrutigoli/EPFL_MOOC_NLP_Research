00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,450
We’ve reached the end of our MOOC on law
enforcement.

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,670
I hope it met your expectation and helped
you understand what fields law enforcement

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,600
covers inside our protected areas.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,350
The idea was to look at the legal documents
that apply to the conservation of these territories,

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,500
to understand where they come from, their
scope, their limitations…

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:35,170
To master the meaning of key concepts such
as values, ethics, deontology and corruption,

7
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:42,170
…but also to know the rules and procedures
to give and follow orders and instructions

8
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,170
properly.

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,080
And finally, we’ve seen how to translate
this in a park through surveillance and the

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,870
fight against poaching.

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:59,149
Of course, I would like to thank the speakers
involved in this MOOC: Lydia Slobodian, Philippe

12
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,989
Gitz and Benoit Koutoua Amon.

13
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:08,189
I’m not forgetting the PAPACO team, the
staff of the Digital Education Centre, and

14
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,969
our friends at MOOCs for Africa at the EPFL
without whom this programme wouldn’t even

15
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:14,969
exist.

16
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:20,219
If you have any suggestions to improve this
MOOC, please feel free to share them with

17
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:21,219
us.

18
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:27,670
And of course, stay connected by following
our other MOOCs, and by visiting papaco.org

19
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,450
and our Facebook page.

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,520
You can sign up to the NAPA newsletter if
you wish to stay in touch month after month.

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,520
Finally, I must also thank the organisations
that financed this MOOC.

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,549
The Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
and the France-IUCN partnership, particularly

23
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,380
the French Development Agency.

24
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,340
C
There, I do hope we’ll be in touch again

25
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,499
through our other MOOC.

26
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:57,009
Have a great day!
