1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,809
Now we know the core aspects of ethics, deontology,
values and norms.

2
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:18,250
All these elements modify social behaviours,
but can also sometimes be in contradiction

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,360
with morals, cultural habits, or personal
situations.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:30,259
The ethical dilemma poses the question of
choosing between the values that are opposed

5
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:32,320
in a given situation.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,390
For example, in the case of staff working
for security in a park to fight poaching,

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,550
personal values can be opposed to professional
values.

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:49,850
So we will see how to recognize such a dilemma,
how to solve it, and above all, determine

9
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,829
which value prevails: the personal or professional
one?

10
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,489
And what is the role of norms in this type
of conflict?

11
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:05,829
Before we go any further, answer this questions
for yourself: whether we talk about a safety

12
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:12,450
professional, a police officer, a military,
a park guard, a doctor or a teacher: which

13
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,500
value must prevail?

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,880
Let’s try to find the answer together by
underscoring the tensions and dilemmas that

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,780
can exist between values and norms.

16
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,909
Consider a doctor.

17
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,459
A young lady wants to terminate her pregnancy
after a rape.

18
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,409
The law of her country forbids the termination
of pregnancy in all cases.

19
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,850
On a personal level, the doctor fights this
legislation, and is for the liberalisation

20
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,389
of abortion.

21
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:45,630
What must he do?

22
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,640
This doctor’s personal values are in opposition
with the values of his profession under the

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,279
country’s norms.

24
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:59,990
He must then make a decision: respect his
own values and break the law, or give up on

25
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,950
his personal values and respect the law.

26
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:09,349
He must weigh the pros and cons while being
aware of the consequences such a decision

27
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,319
can have.

28
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,329
Consider a park guard.

29
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:19,530
He is paid by the state to stop traffickers
of wood products and poachers.

30
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,080
He finds out his own brother is an ivory trafficker.

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,560
What must he do?

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,709
The guard must make a choice between loyalty
towards his family members or loyalty towards

33
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:37,400
the entire population who is represented by
the institution he serves and pays him to

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,450
fight crime.

35
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:45,080
There won’t be a good solution, but the
guard must make a choice.

36
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,709
There are several more or less complex methods
to analyse these dilemmas.

37
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:54,480
It will be interesting to go deeper by reading
the documents suggested by this MOOC.

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,349
In a nutshell, many aspects must be taken
into account to make a decision.

39
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:04,799
First, identify the main actors of the dilemma.

40
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,709
Here, the guard and his brother.

41
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,150
Also, identify the secondary actors.

42
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:20,240
Here, the trafficking network the brother
belongs to, his own family, his own colleagues,

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,879
the institution and the population.

44
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:31,400
Then, propose an alternative: must I arrest/denounce
my brother or not?

45
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,480
For each alternative, list the positive and
negative consequences for each actor.

46
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:46,060
For example, a positive consequence for the
brother can be to help him give up crime.

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,459
A negative consequence for me can be my family
may reject me.

48
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,459
Etc.

49
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:59,910
Also, in the same way, list the personal and
professional values affected for each opportunity,

50
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,689
as well as the norms concerned.

51
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:07,650
For example
The impact on the family involves a personal

52
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,959
value.

53
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,469
The impact on the organisation involves my
professional values and application of norms.

54
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:18,840
Identify the prevailing value.

55
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,840
At the end of this full procedure, you can
make a sound decision.

56
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:33,550
Then, assess this decision from your own perspective,
but also through other people’s eyes.

57
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,350
Ask yourself: am I satisfied with this decision?

58
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,190
If you can, ask a third party who isn’t
involved to share their opinion.

59
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,570
Imagine what the population will think of
your decision?

60
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,170
And your family?

61
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,640
Are you able to take responsibility for this
decision?

62
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,760
Will you be able to defend it?

63
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,600
Finally, make the decision with full knowledge
of possible consequences, and ready to take

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,190
responsibility for it.

65
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,880
Beyond this formal analysis, it is possible
to delay the final decision.

66
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,890
To do so, find an solution in between that
could mitigate the negative consequences on

67
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,560
the actors, particularly the main actors.

68
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,960
Maybe a good conversation with the poaching
brother could help, where you explain him

69
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,060
why he should stop his illegal activities.

70
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,770
Perhaps this will lead him to turn himself
in.

71
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,030
This intermediate step, where you explain
the conflict of values and norms in play,

72
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,640
may ignite something positive within the brother.

73
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,900
Alternatively, you will have to make the decision
decided upon previously.

74
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,760
And finally, the question asked at the beginning
of this sequence remains to be answered: which

75
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,590
value must prevail?

76
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:14,120
In principle, for a public agent who is paid
for his work, the professional values must

77
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,130
prevail.

78
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:21,620
If this agent has to cheat his employer to
follow personal values, he will quickly find

79
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,470
himself outlawed or outside of the norms.

80
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:33,930
He will become a problem for himself, his
hierarchy and the image of his profession.

81
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:42,540
If the professional values become that unbearable,
one solution remains: resigning.

82
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:52,640
Here is an historical example that shows how
conflicts of value and norms can become unbearable.

83
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:01,220
During the second world war, the Nazis asked
French policemen to arrest and imprison Jews,

84
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:10,390
as well as members of other undesirable communities
in the eyes of the occupant (homosexuals,

85
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,900
communists, artists…).

86
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,430
Some police officers accepted the mission
as their personal values didn’t seem to

87
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,600
clash with the new values and norms of the
institution.

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:31,860
Others resigned, and some kept their jobs
to cheat the institution and save lives.

89
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,930
These situations are extreme, but perfectly
show how far the ethical reflection can go

90
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,370
in special or degraded situations.

91
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,660
The ethical dilemma thus isn’t just a choice
between two alternatives like "should I go

92
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,020
on foot or by bicycle?”.

93
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,660
It is a choice between two solutions with
real consequences.

94
00:07:53,660 --> 00:08:00,150
For a public agent, enforcing the law should
take precedence over other considerations.

95
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,620
In most cases, the solution to the ethical
dilemma of such particular professions will

96
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,900
be in respecting the laws.
