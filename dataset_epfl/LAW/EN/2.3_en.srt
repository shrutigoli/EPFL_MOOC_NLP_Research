1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,680
In the previous sequence, we’ve seen that
to give an answer to the question “what

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:16,040
must I do”, values and norms must be put
into perspective, which will lead to a full

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,430
ethical reflexion.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,680
So now is the time to give a couple of definitions.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,890
Ethics.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:30,310
It is the thought process that allows to solve
situations in which values and/or norms are

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,460
in conflict.

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,370
For instance, some professional decisions
can have consequences in the private sphere,

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,110
if the people involved are close to us.

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,340
Deontology.

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,390
It intends to set the minimal standards of
a profession.

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,300
Access to the profession in question should
be forbidden if those minimal standards aren’t

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,300
met.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,710
For instance, a deontological code could determine
if a public agent has the right to accept

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,940
gifts in kind for personal use.

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,360
Values.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:11,229
These are notions or terms describing goals
to reach according to a group, an organisation,

18
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:16,200
a profession or a corporation’s ideals.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,679
However, values aren’t accompanied with
rules to follow.

20
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:25,840
Everyone can achieve their ideal in different
ways.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,119
Loyalty, professionalism and honesty are common
examples of ideals.

22
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:33,950
Norms.

23
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:42,590
They are texts gathered in laws, by-laws,
codes or any other form of document that authorises,

24
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,840
forbids, obliges or orders.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,779
Norms determine the rules to follow and the
possible penalties if they aren’t respected.

26
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:55,530
The penal code is a norm.

27
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,549
Traffic laws as well.

28
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:01,549
Charters or codes.

29
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:07,789
Generally speaking, organisations want to
communicate about their proper functioning,

30
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:12,580
agents’ good quality of work and the service
they provide to the population.

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:18,959
To do so, they can publish their driving norms
and values in codes or charters.

32
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,200
This is when we talk about deontological code,
the charter of core values, the code of ethics

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
and so on.

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,569
A code of ethics seeks to define the ideal
of a profession by listing common values all

35
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,950
those who practice the profession are supposed
to adhere to.

36
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:46,829
A deontological code is a regulatory basis
that sets the basic requirements to practice

37
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,830
an occupation.

38
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,829
Not respecting the elements of such a code
can lead to administrative penalties and even

39
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,019
dismissal.

40
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:01,610
Let’s quickly get back to some of the values
that are usually recognised for a security

41
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,260
organisation.

42
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:11,950
Loyalty is often mentioned, as well as professionalism,
fairness, faithfulness, honesty and integrity.

43
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,480
These are professional values.

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,489
*At the same time, a person’s personality
is fashioned by his education, his social

45
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:26,989
environment and possible religion, which produce
his personal value system.

46
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:33,510
The same words previously mentioned are by
the way often encountered there: loyalty,

47
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,170
faithfulness and honesty.

48
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,970
However, these words don’t necessarily cover
the same notions.

49
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,829
Among the norms, you can discriminate between
formal and informal norms.

50
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:55,579
Formal norms are the ones that are clearly
announced, formalised and written down.

51
00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:04,469
Informal norms are supposed to be known within
a group, a family, a corporation, without

52
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:07,040
having to be formulated.

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,870
These different notions are connected to each
other as it is widely accepted that:

54
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,000
Ethics are the basis of the law.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,480
Deontology is a discipline of ethics.Deontology
is a norm.

56
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:30,140
It must respect the law and handle ethical
issues that haven’t been solved by the law.

57
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,950
Let’s get back to our question: “What
must I do?”

58
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:40,410
Most of the time, the question brings an immediate
response without requiring deep reflection.

59
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:48,530
We’ll see in the next sequence how personal
and professional values can be in conflict,

60
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:55,040
how they complicate answering the question
“What must I do?”.

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,780
At that point, we will be at the very heart
ethical reflexion.
