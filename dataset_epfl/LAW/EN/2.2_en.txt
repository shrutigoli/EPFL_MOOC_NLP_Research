Letâ€™s start by determining why the legal aspect of official agentsâ€™ activity within a state or a semi-public organisation is essential.
Every worker, regardless of his field, acquires technical knowledge that is specific to his activity.
This stems from his specific vocational training, and his likely previous vocational and academic training.
This knowledge is required to complete the tasks of a profession by respecting existing standards.
It is called professional expertise.
Besides purely professional skills, some professions also require the development of social skills.
These refer to the interaction between the job in question and the impact on other members of society, other citizens.
These interactions with the society in which the workers grow can become problematic as soon as they move away from professional standards or adopt improper behaviours.
Everyone must be able to recognize the possible faults committed by their colleagues, but could also be tempted to adopt improper behaviours.
For these reasons, the reflection on work ethics along with deontology were developed over the past couple of years in all fields of work.
In this MOOC, we will focus on activities related to law enforcement in general, and to protected areas in particular.
This touches on the work done by people with specific powers (surveillance, arrest, search, receiving fines, using force etc.).
They are mainly policemen, military and paramilitary officers, forest guards, eco-guards, administrative officials and private security agents.
The goal is to promote responsible behaviour in the agent when confronted with real situations.
This is done by using practical examples to reduce risks of behavioural blunders and mistakes, but without always being able to eliminate them completely.
Indeed, agentsâ€™ activity isnâ€™t made of theory or statistics, but of real actions.
In this framework, he must recognize the situations where they can proceed, and the ones requiring them to stop and think.
The type of responsible behaviour we are looking for is influenced by many factors.
First, education received by parents is key.
The cultural environment, religious beliefs and social background also play a role.
These influencing factors are permanently set in the agentâ€™s mind, consciously or not, and mould an individualâ€™s personal values.
Professionally speaking, this same agent will also be bound by the norms of his profession, and by the values of his professional environment.
We will explain this in the next sequence.
These norms and values can be in contradiction with his personal values.
In certain situations, the agent will have to ask himself the central question of work ethics: what must I do?
Letâ€™s break down this important question.
First of all, you have to know the context in which the question arises.
Our latitude of action must be known and defined, either by ourselves or by our hierarchy.
This latitude is defined by our rights and obligations as a citizen, a member of a community or as a professional.
Finally, it must be clear that in the question
"What must I do" there is the word â€œmustâ€�.
This means that if you are a public official with a mission, you must act, you have to do so.
An official is indeed paid to take action.
DO, sure, but what?
In fact, once the obligation to take action is recognized and accepted, the norms and values in play allow to give a more concrete answer to the question â€œwhatâ€�?
The answer could then be: I donâ€™t do anything.
Because the circumstances lead me to abstain from any action.
For example, if a direct intervention can result in aggravating a situation rather than in solving it.
But this decision must derive from a consideration on our latitude that I can justify with the relevant norms and values.
The same goes when we decide to proceed with concrete action.
In the next sequence, we will be going deeper into the topic by suggesting structured ways of thinking that allow to make a decision but also to explain the reasons for it.
