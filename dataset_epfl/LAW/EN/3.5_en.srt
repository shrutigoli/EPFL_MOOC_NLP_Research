1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,330
We saw that corruption must be handled by
the organisation itself.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,990
It’s the organisation’s responsibility,
through management, to implement controlling

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,269
measures, namely by adopting rules and norms,
by giving clear orders and by implementing

4
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:27,529
the required ethical principles and deontology.

5
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:32,590
Now we are going to try and see the difference
between what will contribute to effectively

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,160
fight against corruption, and the other types
of offences in an organisation.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,070
First, all levels of responsibility must be
clearly defined, and powers in authority and

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,420
in decision-making must be known by all.

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,020
The instructions and rules of operations must
also be clear and consistent, in other words,

10
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,989
they must be written down and approved.

11
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,719
Operational order must respect principles
of engagement as well as the rights and duties

12
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,610
of the agents and litigants.

13
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:14,890
These responsibilities, instructions and rules
must be known, taught and practiced.

14
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:21,590
Everybody must undergo basic but also recurring
training to guarantee unity of doctrine when

15
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,940
implementing the organisation’s processes.

16
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,390
Training is hence the key to the success of
the fight against corruption.

17
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,920
It must namely include modules about:
The organisation’s goals and objectives

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:48,930
Legal bases (legislation and rules) governing
the organisation’s activities

19
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:57,710
Individual responsibility and consequences
Rights and obligations of members of the organisation

20
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,270
Internal investigations about malfunctions
and their legal (penal) and administrative

21
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:11,530
(dismissal, pay cuts) consequences
And, of course, work ethics and deontology.

22
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,920
Beyond this, training will of course include
the technical aspects of the job.

23
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,659
In other words, training requires time investment.

24
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:28,900
This investment not only trains future managers
and staff, but it also exists to test and

25
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,060
assess them throughout the training period.

26
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:40,120
Sometimes, this helps to detect individuals
who may have chosen the wrong career path.

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,769
Recruiting is therefore a first vital step.

28
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:49,090
Employment criteria must be known, published,
and above all, applied.

29
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,999
Effective recruitment requires selection based
on objective criteria, such as the level of

30
00:02:54,999 --> 00:03:04,200
education required, the age limits for recruitment,
physical condition, required training, criminal

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,930
record.

32
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,609
Only the people who meet all these requirements
can be hired.

33
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:16,170
If at this point, special treatment is given,
nothing can guarantee future behaviours in

34
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,840
terms of corruption an ethics.

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,849
Obviously, these criteria must apply fairly
to both the junior recruits at the beginning

36
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:30,900
of their career, as well as to managers of
all levels.

37
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,079
To conclude, let’s remember that leadership’s
responsibility is key in the fight against

38
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,139
corruption.

39
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:44,500
Leadership must play its controlling role
actively, but must also undergo control itself.

40
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,510
People from the higher levels of the hierarchy
must also set themselves objectives.

41
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,840
These objectives have to be translated into
directives and orders that can be understood

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,519
by staff from all ranks.

43
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:09,819
The issue of the preparation and distribution
of these orders will be discussed in the next

44
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:10,499
module.
