Before making his decision and establishing a strategy, the leader must first make sure to have properly assessed what is expected of him, with the means, staff and equipment he has been given.
The more complex and chaotic the situation, the more holistically the problem should be comprehended.
First, as soon as the mission is received, an event occurs or when the situation changes drastically, the problem must be comprehended.
This comprehension is divided in three parts: detecting the problem, understanding the problem, assessing the problem.
Detecting the problem consist in answering the following basic question: What is it about?
To do so, you must consider the following elements: what are the goals to achieve, or what is the expected result?
What are the risks and the opportunities to seize?
What is the level of difficulty?
What is the deadline in which the mission must be accomplished - in other words, is it urgent?
What are the different tasks required to fulfil the mission?
When trying understanding the problem, the person responsible for the operation distributes the tasks he identified to several subordinates.
These will work simultaneously and give accounts of the results from their work.
In a more complex operation at the operative level, the command staff entrusts its thoughts to auxiliary task forces, made of several people.
When the situation isnâ€™t as complex, the leader simply divides the work between his direct subordinates.
Understanding the problem gives a general overview of all the aspects of the mission, and makes it possible to choose solutions with full knowledge.
Assessing the problem simply consists in describing the importance of the mission compared to other ongoing activities, its importance in the general context, possible urgency in achieving the mission, and setting the order of priority of the different tasks that were identified upon understanding the problem.
Once the mission is fully analysed, this is what we have: a description of tasks to fulfil and their order of priority, a vision of the final desired state, first drafts of possible solutions for the mission, constraints that need to be considered and opportunities that we can benefit from.
The thought process that we just discovered seems quite heavy.
When the mission stems from a sudden and unpredictable event that needs to be handled immediately, the process can be shortened.
In this case, comprehending the problem can be limited to: What is it about?
Must we act?
What tasks must be carried out?
What do I need to face this event?
Obviously, when the mission covers a longer period of time and the operation is more complex or expected to take place later, there is more time for thinking and preparing.
The more time there is between the reception of the mission and its deadline, the more carefully each step of problem comprehension can be followed.
During the thought process, it often seems that measures must be taken immediately to save time, to complete the information at hand, to obtain extra means of support, to avoid any further damage (during a catastrophe for example), or to maintain a level of flexibility
(clearing the road for example).
These are called â€œimmediate measuresâ€�.
Here, the need to take emergency action during a sudden event mustnâ€™t be confused with what we call immediate measures.
These are one-time measures, to carry out immediately.
They are ordered by the leader as soon as the problem comprehension process is over, according to the needs.
Now letâ€™s see how these immediate measures are carried out, who triggers them and when?
In theory, immediate measures arenâ€™t needed when you plan an operation that takes place later in time.
They are used when the mission must be carried out in a binding time limit.
AIMER, French for â€œloveâ€�, is an acronym to help you remember the possible immediate measures.
Depending on the operation, all measures arenâ€™t necessary:
A is for alerting.
Alert support teams like a special squad or paramedics, transport means and so on.
I is for informing.
Inform the lower and higher levels in the command hierarchy so that they can start with preparations related to the new mission, or inform the political level when there is a potential media impact.
M is for putting into Motion.
Put into Motion preparatory actions (roadblocks, operational structures etc.) or pre-existing action plans.
E is for exploring.
Exploring means searching intelligence on people (victims, witnesses, perpetrators etc.).
Who am I dealing with?
What do they want to do?
R is for reconnaissance, called sometimes scouting.
Here, reconnaissance means looking for information on the configuration of the field, the aspect of built-up areas, the state of roads or adverse infrastructures etc.
By triggering immediate measures, the leader must make sure not to block his own future possibilities to take action.
He must always try to preserve flexibility.
Based on if you are at the operative or tactical level, immediate measures can be ordered verbally or through a written order, by respecting the format we will be looking at in the next sequences.
All the steps that we just looked at must follow one another logically over time.
The constraint in this case is the time available until the operation is carried out.
Within this timeframe, the idea is to set precisely when a given step must be undertaken.
You must also give subordinates the time they need to execute the task they were given.
During this process of comprehending the problem and the tasks stemming from it, routine meetings must be set (in time and place) give subordinates the opportunity to present the state of their work.
Scheduling helps setting the same work pace for all subordinates.
However it can be adapted based on the evolution of the situation, or the progress of preparatory works.
As said before, the more complex the event, the more this process will be dense and the more time and energy consuming it will be.
If all these steps are carefully fulfilled, the event leader will have all the elements at hand to consolidate his own position.
