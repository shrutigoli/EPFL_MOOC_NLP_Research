1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,860
As discussed previously, law exists at many
levels, from the local level up to the international.

2
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,969
International law is different from law at
national and sub-national levels, so in this

3
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:21,060
unit we will spend some time exploring what
international law is and how it is relevant

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,220
for conservation.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,359
While national law binds individuals as well
as corporations, organizations and government

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,010
actors, international law primarily governs
relationships between States, at least in

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,010
theory.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,820
Before explaining, I will quickly note that
here we are talking about public international

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,640
law – there exists a field of private international
law that governs international transactions

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,670
and relationships between private entities,
like corporations, but we will not focus on

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,460
that in this discussion.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,530
In the traditional model of public international
law States make treaties and agreements amongst

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,590
each other, which are only binding on the
States.

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,840
Each State is responsible for implementing
and enforcing the obligations contained in

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,880
these agreements on its own citizens, through
national law.

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,469
This is based on a concept of State sovereignty,
in which each country has the exclusive right

17
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,330
to make law within its territory and control
the actions of its citizens.

18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,259
However, this model is simplistic at best,
and doesn’t really describe the current

19
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,060
legal situation.

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,530
Multinational corporations have grown bigger
and stronger in international influence – many

21
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,899
have annual operating budgets higher than
the GDP of the States in which they operate.

22
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:44,340
The line between State and private entity
is not always clear, with many wholly or partly

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,139
State-owned corporations or public-private
partnerships.

24
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:52,390
NGOs and business interests now participate
in the negotiation of treaties as well as

25
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,159
their implementation.

26
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,829
Private governance has grown at the international
as well as the national level, through corporate

27
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,850
standards, labels and private certification
schemes.

28
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,780
Civil society and social movements can directly
regulate multinational corporations, through

29
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,940
consumer and shareholder decisions and public
shaming and boycotts facilitated by new forms

30
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,690
of media.

31
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,360
Today there is growing international recognition
of the significant role of non-state actors

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,310
in international law.

33
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,510
At this point it is worth taking a step back
and asking what is the purpose of international

34
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,940
law?

35
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,940
We can start by imagining a world with no
international law.

36
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,310
In this world, law is only created at the
national level or below.

37
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,200
What problems could this cause?

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,030
One problem might be how to deal with transboundary
resources.

39
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,920
Imagine a river that crosses a border between
countries.

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,720
How do the countries share the water?

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,140
What about the fish?

42
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,450
What if one country wants to build a dam,
or pours pollution into the river?

43
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,280
How could these problems be resolved?

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,620
We can also think of questions related to
global resources, like oceans or the atmosphere.

45
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,090
A striking example is climate change – a
global problem that cannot easily be resolved

46
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,430
on a national level.

47
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,430
Another category of problems relates to things
that happen entirely within one country, but

48
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,090
concern the rest of the world.

49
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,900
The most extreme example is activities that
are fundamentally shocking, to the point that

50
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,040
they go against what it means to be human.

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,030
I am talking about genocide, slavery, torture
and other crimes against humanity.

52
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,930
Where these crimes take place within a country,
should there be a way for other countries

53
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,850
to step in?

54
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,310
And what about other harm, like loss of an
entire species, or destruction of an irreplaceable

55
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,780
archeological site?

56
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,290
Should the international community be concerned
about this?

57
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,360
There are many other examples.

58
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,390
Sometimes solving a problem requires international
cooperation – such as when wildlife in one

59
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,230
country is killed because of demand in another.

60
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,460
Sometimes countries can’t manage a problem
on their own, and need help, including financial

61
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,710
and technical resources.

62
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:10,710
Can you think of other problems that would
exist in a world without international law?

63
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,550
We can think of many challenges that cannot
be solved by national and subnational law

64
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,550
alone.

65
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,269
Let’s think about how international law
can help solve them.

66
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,740
There are three main functions that international
law can perform.

67
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,360
The first is legislative: international law
can create norms and standards for the international

68
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,849
community.

69
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:37,300
These can include principles like the obligation
not to cause transboundary harm, and targets

70
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,169
like conservation of 11% of terrestrial areas
and inland waters through protected areas

71
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:44,990
by 2020.

72
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,379
It can also create procedural norms, such
as obligations to obtain prior informed consent

73
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:54,699
or conduct environmental impact assessments
for certain activities.

74
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,710
Not all of these norms are binding, but even
where they are not, they can create important

75
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,729
standards for governments and private actors.

76
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:08,150
The second function is administrative: international
law creates mechanisms such as international

77
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:15,189
bodies, processes, fora and funds for monitoring
and coordinating implementation of the standards.

78
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,660
This can include global bodies such as the
UN or multilateral bodies like river basin

79
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
organizations.

80
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,690
There can also be scientific bodies, such
as the IPCC.

81
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,070
The third function is adjudicative: international
law can provide mechanisms for resolving disputes

82
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,789
between countries.

83
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:37,830
This includes the international court of justice
and the international criminal court, but

84
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,580
also specific processes described in treaties
for managing disagreements.

85
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,550
So far we have discussed what international
law can do, but not what it looks like and

86
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,810
where it comes from.

87
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,599
There are three principal sources of international
law.

88
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:58,120
The first we have already mentioned: agreements.

89
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,840
These can have many names -- treaties, conventions,
pacts, etc.

90
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,360
Whatever they are called, they must be in
written form, and the parties must show an

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,090
intention to be bound.

92
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,240
The second source of international law is
customary international law.

93
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,970
Customary international law is legally binding,
even though it may not be found in a specific

94
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,120
binding treaty.

95
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,020
It is defined by two criteria: it must be
the general practice of states, and it must

96
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,379
be followed out of a sense of legal obligation.

97
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:34,319
There is often some discussion over whether
a particular principle has achieved the status

98
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,040
of customary law.

99
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,500
A well known example is the Law of the Sea,
which was based on customary international

100
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,659
law for centuries before its codification
in the 1980s.

101
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:50,500
The third source of international law is general
principles of law, which relates primarily

102
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,499
to procedure and today is mostly used to fill
gaps.

103
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:59,900
In addition to binding international law,
sometimes called “hard law”, there is

104
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,350
a world of international law that is not legally
binding but still carries some weight.

105
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,889
This is called “soft law”, and includes
non-binding declarations, resolutions, programs

106
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,569
of action, and memoranda of understanding.

107
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:19,490
Soft law can guide and influence the behavior
of states and other actors, and help coordination

108
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,550
around common principles and goals.

109
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,129
Soft law can also become hard law.

110
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:27,259
Soft law principles can be written into agreements.

111
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,650
Or, when soft law principles are followed
by States in practice, in a way that shows

112
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,780
acceptance of an obligation to be bound, they
can become customary international law.

113
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,759
In the next sequence we will look at specific
international conventions that are relevant

114
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,279
for environmental conservation.
