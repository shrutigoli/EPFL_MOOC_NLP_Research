1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,559
- For this entire module on surveillance,
you can refer to these guidelines to find

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,719
more information.

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:20,849
- In a protected area, surveillance enables
law enforcement, and it is also a key aspect

4
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:23,529
of protected area management.

5
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:30,599
- Generally speaking, the protection of values
involves restrictions, and these restrictions

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,200
require control of what is happening onsite.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,500
- Note that this is not a requirement and
a protected area can do without surveillance

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:49,540
if there are no coveted resources, or that
that these resources do not face any particular

9
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,760
threats.

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:59,940
- A category 3 protected area for example,
a natural monument such as a cliff or a cave,

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:07,080
may be protected through its lack of accessibility
or because there are no exploitable resources

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
to be found.

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,979
Of course, this is not the most frequent scenario.

14
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:19,000
- Surveillance of a protected area can be
defined as the actions that are implemented

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,209
to enforce the rules applying to the territory
and to the resources within.

16
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,369
- The prosecution of criminal offenses in
parks is based on legal texts such as the

17
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:38,389
Environmental Code, the Mining Code, the Water
Code and legislation on human rights.

18
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:47,240
- But as we saw in the first unit, protected
areas are also governed by specific regulatory

19
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,129
texts that should be carefully enforced.

20
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:57,159
- In general, this legal or regulatory framework
is specific to a country.

21
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:04,009
There can be practical variations from one
territory to the next, but the logic remains

22
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:05,709
the same.

23
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:12,670
- Surveillance is carried out under the authority
of the judicial power such as the Public Prosecutor

24
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,570
and his deputies.

25
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,891
- It is therefore important for the park manager
to work closely with these actors, and for

26
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:26,500
himself to master the legal actions he can
take.

27
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,720
- Indeed, lack of knowledge in managing the
case has led many proceedings against poachers

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,400
to fail.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,190
- The police report submitted to court can
be a problem if the facts aren’t recounted

30
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,970
properly, and if all the evidence gathered
during surveillance isn’t included.

31
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:57,200
- These reports are often the basis of the
decision made by the judge, and the slightest

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:07,819
mistake can cause the case to be dropped,
especially when this mistake is a technicality.

33
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:14,550
- Another main aspect is the choice of charges,
in other words, the grounds for prosecuting

34
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,750
the offender.

35
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:24,780
- Nature conservation regulations are a good
basis, but they aren’t necessarily the only

36
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,180
or most suitable framework to consider.

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,540
- For heavier sentences, it is sometimes best
to refer to other regulations such as the

38
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,870
one relative to carrying firearms, to money
laundering, to tax evasion and so on.

39
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,030
- This can also ensure there will actually
be a sentence, instead of risking dropping

40
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:56,710
the case due to lack of admissible evidence
or for another reason of prosecution.

41
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:04,310
- Finally, once the case has been introduced
to the judicial system, it is crucial to follow

42
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,850
up on it.

43
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:13,170
- In court, crimes related to the environment
aren’t usually considered a priority.

44
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:21,560
The length of proceedings can sometimes be
extended indefinitely due to failure to follow

45
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
up.

46
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,939
This results in charges being dropped because
of mere court inaction.

47
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:35,230
- Failing to follow up can also lead to multiple
offenders not appearing as such and facing

48
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,360
light sentences instead of the heavier ones
they deserve.

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:49,759
- Reports and evidence can disappear, be lost
or simply never be presented to the judge.

50
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,880
- When investigating a case, you need to master
the following aspects and there are solutions:

51
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,090
i) a good police report, ii) a solid case
and iii) a good follow-up of the investigative

52
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,090
process.

53
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:10,169
- The most important aspect is strengthening
the skills of all actors involved.

54
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:18,780
Of protected area managers of course, but
also judges so that they can be aware of the

55
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,529
seriousness of the crime committed.

56
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:28,410
- Protected area surveillance requires excellent
collaboration with the Public Prosecutor and

57
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,990
the criminal police officers.

58
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:38,580
- Guidelines can be drawn up to explain how
to write a good report, and which texts to

59
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,419
refer to if needed.

60
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:46,889
- Using the services of trained investigators
can save a case from failing because of a

61
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,789
technicality, and it will also help following
up on the case throughout the proceedings.

62
00:05:52,789 --> 00:06:01,449
- In these fields, some national and international
NGOs provide useful technical support – the

63
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:07,490
EAGLE association we mentioned in the MOOC
GAP is a good example.

64
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,639
- In conclusion, let’s remember that it
isn’t reasonable to invest a lot of means

65
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,479
to arrest offenders in the field who will
not be prosecuted anyway.

66
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:26,370
- Following the case after finding the facts
can seem to be a formality that is not the

67
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:33,400
manager’s responsibility, but this isn’t
true; if the manager wants to be effective,

68
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,000
he must, with his team, follow the case until
the end.
