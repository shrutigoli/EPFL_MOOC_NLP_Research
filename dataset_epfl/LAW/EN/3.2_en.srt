1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,700
We often talk about corruption.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,099
In the media, police officers, politicians,
entrepreneurs, bankers and judges are often

3
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,340
accused of corruption.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,340
But what does this mean?

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:25,750
Actually, the word “corruption” is generally
misused to describe all criminal behaviour

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,769
committed by a person who has power and abuses
it.

7
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:37,860
This is often how the media relays the acts
of political authorities, as in Brazil in

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,770
the example here.

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,840
However, somebody who takes equipment from
his employer for personal use or to resell

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,940
it is called a thief and his employer is the
victim.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,780
The person who diverts money that has been
entrusted to him by his employer to finance

12
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:03,630
his own lifestyle is called a crook and his
employer is, again, the victim.

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,541
These criminal behaviours don’t fall under
the legal sense of corruption, which has a

14
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:14,270
very precise definition in the penal code
of each country.

15
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,290
Offenses of this kind have an interesting
feature.

16
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,240
The perpetrators of such offenses show a certain
perversity.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,840
Indeed, they often know and see the victims
they harm.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,330
If they harm their own employers, the perpetrators
will meet them every day knowing that they

19
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,119
are stealing from them.

20
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:42,360
It is probably easier to burglarize a house
or steal a car, knowing that we never have

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,000
to face the victim.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,830
So together, we will look at the specific
case of corruption, which is one of the many

23
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,020
criminal activities a government official
can be guilty of.

24
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,160
The Swiss penal code, for example, mentions
many different elements that constitute the

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,989
act of corruption.

26
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:07,830
It takes two persons for corruption to take
place:

27
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:13,890
The corrupter, which is the person who corrupts,
the actor of active corruption.

28
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,060
The corrupted, the actor of passive corruption.

29
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,320
Two types of situations can be identified:
The corrupter obtains a free legal service

30
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,090
from the corrupted in return for payment.

31
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:35,980
Or, the corrupter obtains an illegal operation
from the corrupted in return for payment.

32
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:45,360
Now let’s have a look at some typical situations
that will help us understand this better.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,240
First case scenario: consider a protected
area that can be visited according to certain

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
rules.

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,930
Officially, entrance is free, and the duty
officer simply has to register the visitors

36
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,570
that come and go for security reasons.

37
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,740
The government official accepts this mission,
but even though the service is free, he requires

38
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,100
visitors to pay a fee which he keeps for himself.

39
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,560
What is the situation here?

40
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,650
Clearly, this is situation of corruption from
the public servant who takes advantage of

41
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,330
his inevitable location to extort an undue
fee.

42
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,860
The public servant is clearly outlawed.

43
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,100
The visitor as well, if he knows the pass
is free, and aware that if he doesn’t pay,

44
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,290
he won’t be able to enter.

45
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:50,020
Second case scenario: consider a PA in which
hunting is strictly allowed for a couple of

46
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,510
weeks a year, with no possible exemption.

47
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,490
A hunter wants to get permission to hunt outside
this time period.

48
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:04,270
He offers payment to the agents in charge
of hunting control so that they don’t denounce

49
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,099
him and let him hunt freely.

50
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,630
What is the situation this time?

51
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,980
The public servant grants an illegal authorisation
to the corrupt hunter in return for payment.

52
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,820
Here, both parties involved are clearly accomplices
in the act of corruption.

53
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:30,400
Third case scenario: in a PA, the agent in
charge of granting hunting permits follows

54
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
the rules.

55
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,300
He cashes in official taxes paid by hunters
and provides the corresponding permits.

56
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,810
However, to increase his personal income,
he doesn’t register all the permits so he

57
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,320
can keep part of the money paid by hunters
for himself.

58
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,910
What is the situation here?

59
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:57,840
Well, this is theft, possibly fraud at the
expense of the protected area.

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:05,389
The hunters, apparently honest, have probably
no idea how their tax is handled once paid.

61
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:11,470
Basically, you must learn to distinguish active
corruption from passive corruption, whether

62
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:20,970
it is to bypass legislation and regulations,
or to apply them but through undue fees.

63
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,910
Once the notion of corruption is understood
in the legal sense, the question is who can

64
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,670
be corrupt?

65
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,740
This notion mainly applies to government officials
or public servants.

66
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,840
It can also apply to private agencies who
have been assigned a job by the government.

67
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,740
However, for such a person to be corruptible
or susceptible to corruption, they must have

68
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,790
some form of power.

69
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,430
This person must have the power to authorise
or forbid, to grant and to refuse.

70
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,960
In addition, this person must have a key position,
meaning the service provided cannot be obtained

71
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,160
elsewhere.

72
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:11,050
This person must also have greater freedom
of action, and not undergo controls from their

73
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,680
organisation.

74
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,570
Finally, this person cannot be held responsible
for possible consequences.

75
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,490
In a nutshell, to be in a situation that is
favourable to corruption, you must have a

76
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:33,660
monopoly on an act, be able to operate discreetly,
and not be controlled or be held responsible.

77
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:40,590
These elements lead us to think about ways
an organisation must be set up to avoid risks

78
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,300
of corruption.

79
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,130
This will be the topic of the next sequence.
