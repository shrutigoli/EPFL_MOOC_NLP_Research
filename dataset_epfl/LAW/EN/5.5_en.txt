As we mentioned in the previous sequence, surveillance operations are subject to strategic planning in the medium term, usually 3 years.
The strategy can then be implemented yearly in the form of operation plans.
These plans are based on relevant spatial and temporal information collected in the protected area, as well as on the careful analysis of reports from previous patrols.
A surveillance strategy for each park must be defined with the stakeholders, by strongly involving field agents.
This strategy must be very adaptable and able to anticipate the changes in threats on the field to avoid being stuck in â€œreactiveâ€� responsiveness.
The primary objectives of patrols must be accompanied by specific, measureable, accessible, realistic indicators that can be achieved in a certain time.
Tools can be used such as SMART (Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool), a spatial monitoring and reporting tool.
We will be looking into this later.
A system encouraging staff to achieve these targets must be instituted to guarantee sustained commitment of agents for the effective implementation of the strategy.
Then comes the patrolling, then the collect and analysis of data collected by these patrols.
It is essential to prepare management and participants for patrols beforehand.
This preparation ends with a short and clear briefing of the patrol team.
Every patrol team must be led by a mission leader with good team management and reporting skills.
Personal involvement of park managers in patrols is also a key motivation factor for agents, and a good way to control their effectiveness.
In CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire for example, surveillance activities are implemented at the level of the Ivorian Parks and Reserves Authority regional head offices, in other words at a supra park scale, and they are then executed at the level of each park.
At the end of patrols, team members are debriefed to talk about the mission, the results, difficulties encountered, possible recommendations and also to plan future actions.
This is also an opportunity to congratulate agents for the effort accomplished, to potentially award them and encourage them to pursue this work while guiding them.
The length of patrols can change, but in practice, it is recommended not to exceed one week because longer patrols can be tiring and require longer recovery time for agents, not to mention their loss of motivation as days go by.
Surveillance patrols are dissuasive or repressive, and often require strong presence of agents on the field.
If we take the example of CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire, the types of mission that can be organised according to the targets to achieve are:
- the standard mission done by a Mobile Brigade or a team of sector agents (5 usually) at a fixed station,
- the inter-unit mission which is a monitoring activity done by at least two Mobile Brigade units,
- the joint mission which is a monitoring activity carried out by one Mobile Brigade unit and sector agents,
- The large scale mission carried out by more than three Mobile Brigade units over 10 days within a large protected area like ComoÃ© park,
- the control mission which is an offence verification action carried out by at least
5 agents after receiving a piece of information.
Tactically speaking, surveillance must be adapted to the level of threats faced by the park.
Patrols can be carried out on foot or in a motorised vehicle (cars, motorbikes), in an amphibious vehicle, or with aerial support
(helicopter, plane) thanks to an effective communication system.
More and more, units specialised in the fight against poaching are trained to face poachers when a more aggressive response is required.
These units should undergo more individualised management compared to the rest of staff, but they also need training and specific equipment.
They can involve elite (forest commandos) or specialised units (canine units).
Team mobility must always be guaranteed by making special travelling material available.
Unit agents should stay in base camps from where they would carry out their operations, and relay stations near or in the protected area can be used to conduct surveillance activities.
In some reserves, surveillance stations are arranged to receive surveillance agents temporarily in the context of a rotational system of surveillance personnel.
Others benefit from a control room that ensures communication with teams on the field 24 hours a day, thereby strengthening the effectiveness of operations.
Certain parks would rather ban any form of fixed station as they are rapidly identified by poachers, and agents are prone to fall into routine or even corruption.
In this case, only mobile teams are kept.
All this depends of course on the context in which you work.
In the process of surveillance operations, useful information is collected to guide future operations, or for investigations to catch criminals in the act and then prosecute the arrested individual.
This information also helps writing operation reports, but also writing police reports related to the arrested person and make them available for the public prosecutor.
This information must be collected on files or smartphones and added to data bases with spatial references for later use.
Among these databases we can mention the SMART software which is a spatial surveillance and reporting tool, specially designed to assess the effectiveness of patrols and peacekeeping.
Some protected areas with a good cell coverage use a real time information transferring system, combining a Cybertracker and a software that automatically analyses data and generates a report â€“ this completely automates patrol monitoring.
This software improves the quality of collected information and its future prospective use.
This is key to guiding surveillance decisions.
A good geographic information system enables the achievement of set surveillance targets.
Patrol assessement criteria can include:
- the effective presence of agents in the park in terms of number of men per day,
- the coverage ratio of each protected area having undergone patrols,
- the level of implication of neighbouring populations through the amount of information provided to denounce aggressions and/or initiatives taken by communities to prevent infiltrations,
- animal flight distances or evidence proving the presence or number of mammals which is an indicator of the level of threats,
- the amount of evidence of aggression in the protected area,
- the spatial distribution of said evidence in the protected area,
- the proportion of individuals convicted etc.
In the next sequence, we will look at what material is needed to conduct effective surveillance in a park.
