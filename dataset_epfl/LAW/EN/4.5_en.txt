After everything weâ€™ve seen, itsâ€™s time to move on to the part we all like: decision-making!
Many great military strategists in history
Â«feltÂ Â» the situation and acted instinctively.
Unfortunately, we do not all have this ability, hence the necessity to take time for reflexion.
This way, we would be able to explain our decision, to justify it in light of the problem comprehension, and the assessment of the situation.
From there, we have everything we need to establish a written or verbal order.
In the previous steps, we considered possible solutions, different ways of fulfilling the mission.
This leads us to the following principle: thinking in terms of options.
The fancy example you can see here illustrates this.
There is no wrong option, but the consequences are different.
The 2nd option will be more expensive, but the family will make more friends happy to participate.
The first option is more affordable, but the people in the village will probably hold it against us.
There is never only one solution, but rather a couple of them, as each option has its pros and cons.
Generally, we should choose an option that has more pros and fewer cons, but it isnâ€™t as easy as it seems.
To analyse options, you can for example make sure:
It is suitable, in the sense that it indeed solves the problem and respects the mission that was given.
It is exclusive, meaning that false options that only paraphrase others must be avoided.
It is practicable in terms of means at hand, of the level of staff training and deadlines.
It is acceptable in terms of objective risks, but also in terms of risks related to breaching human rights and work ethics, and affecting our image in the eyes of the population.
If it is complete, in the sense that we tick off all the boxes of needed parameters, deadlines, place and how and who does what.
So, what is decision?
The finally chosen option consists in a couple of words or sentences, often associated with a draft that: sets the goal to achieve, how to achieve it, it determines how the action will unfold in space and in time, it sets collaboration with possible support, it is a synthesis of thoughts expressed in a concise manner.
Reserved decision is a special case of the main decision.
In fact, reserved decisions are the result of simultaneous planning, they are ready to use if the situation would radically change.
There can be several reserved decisions answering the following question: â€œwhat do we do ifâ€¦?â€�
In our fancy marriage example: what do we do if the bride or groom doesnâ€™t want to get married anymore?
You can also change a rejected option into reserved decision.
