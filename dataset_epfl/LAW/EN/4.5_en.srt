1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:10,620
After everything we’ve seen, its’s time
to move on to the part we all like: decision-making!

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,139
Many great military strategists in history

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:18,490
«felt » the situation and acted instinctively.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,020
Unfortunately, we do not all have this ability,
hence the necessity to take time for reflexion.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:30,509
This way, we would be able to explain our
decision, to justify it in light of the problem

6
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:35,370
comprehension, and the assessment of the situation.

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,629
From there, we have everything we need to
establish a written or verbal order.

8
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:47,160
In the previous steps, we considered possible
solutions, different ways of fulfilling the

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
mission.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,930
This leads us to the following principle:
thinking in terms of options.

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,690
The fancy example you can see here illustrates
this.

12
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,500
There is no wrong option, but the consequences
are different.

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,680
The 2nd option will be more expensive, but
the family will make more friends happy to

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,549
participate.

15
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:15,549
The first option is more affordable, but the
people in the village will probably hold it

16
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,540
against us.

17
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:25,280
There is never only one solution, but rather
a couple of them, as each option has its pros

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,430
and cons.

19
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,200
Generally, we should choose an option that
has more pros and fewer cons, but it isn’t

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,149
as easy as it seems.

21
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:40,439
To analyse options, you can for example make
sure:

22
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:48,670
It is suitable, in the sense that it indeed
solves the problem and respects the mission

23
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,560
that was given.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:02:01,399
It is exclusive, meaning that false options
that only paraphrase others must be avoided.

25
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:08,500
It is practicable in terms of means at hand,
of the level of staff training and deadlines.

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,919
It is acceptable in terms of objective risks,
but also in terms of risks related to breaching

27
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,790
human rights and work ethics, and affecting
our image in the eyes of the population.

28
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:31,049
If it is complete, in the sense that we tick
off all the boxes of needed parameters, deadlines,

29
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:33,600
place and how and who does what.

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,079
So, what is decision?

31
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:43,639
The finally chosen option consists in a couple
of words or sentences, often associated with

32
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:50,700
a draft that: sets the goal to achieve, how
to achieve it, it determines how the action

33
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,980
will unfold in space and in time, it sets
collaboration with possible support, it is

34
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,960
a synthesis of thoughts expressed in a concise
manner.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,470
Reserved decision is a special case of the
main decision.

36
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:15,130
In fact, reserved decisions are the result
of simultaneous planning, they are ready to

37
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,620
use if the situation would radically change.

38
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:26,120
There can be several reserved decisions answering
the following question: “what do we do if…?”

39
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,380
In our fancy marriage example: what do we
do if the bride or groom doesn’t want to

40
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,290
get married anymore?

41
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,600
You can also change a rejected option into
reserved decision.
