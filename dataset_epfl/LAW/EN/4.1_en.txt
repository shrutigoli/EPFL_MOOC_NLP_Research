- Hello Philippe.
- Hi Geoffroy
- Philippe, why do we need to add a module specifically on giving orders?
- In the previous modules, we talked about organisationsâ€™ responsibility to fight corruption, and to develop work ethics.
I insisted on the importance of training, and mentioned the need to issue clear orders.
- This is why we are now going to talk about a method that helps giving orders drawing from the organisationâ€™s objectives.
These orders are more concrete and operational, but the method also works for administrative tasks.
- Is this method for anybody or do we only target managers?
- Managers are more likely to give orders based on this method.
However, all staff must be aware of it to understand the meaning behind what they are being asked, and how leadership makes its decision.
- But the method can be adapted to all levels of leadership on the basis of a good understanding of the mission.
- So where does this method come from?
- Iâ€™ve applied this method at work throughout my career.
It is the one taught at police and military academies in my country.
Complete handbooks can be ordered from the editors.
- Here I am going to adapt this method, because
I will only give the general guidelines.
To go deeper, it is best to imagine exercises and scenarios to study, and experience them as part of a group.
- Ok, so together, letâ€™s look at the steps of this systematic and structured methodology.
- First, you must understand the goals you want to reach by giving orders.
- Then, to define the orders, you must analyse the mission and understand the problem.
- Assess your own means and possibilities if confronted with problems that can emerge when executing the order.
- Then, we will look at how to make the operational choices and decisions
- Finally, we will consider the plan of operational orders
- Perfect, now letâ€™s have a look at all this!
