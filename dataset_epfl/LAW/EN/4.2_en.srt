1
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:10,599
To kick off this module about issuing orders
and instructions, we need to start by setting

2
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:12,030
the general context.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:19,000
There are indeed several command and management
levels that imply different order classifications.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,460
At every level, the most important part is
to make sure the common goal is reached together

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,500
by all subordinates, in other words, the mission
must be fulfilled in common.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,820
A clear system must be used when issuing orders
to subordinates, so that they understand what

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,199
is expected of them and why.

8
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:45,989
As we’ve already said, there are many levels
of command – they are briefly described

9
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,129
in this table.

10
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:55,789
Strategic command is related to public authorities,
to the senior management of big companies

11
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,510
and to the high command of the police or the
army.

12
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,760
In this MOOC we won’t be looking at this
level.

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,869
Operative command involves commitment in synergy
with different bodies that have to take action

14
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,369
together.

15
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,240
This includes for instance joint action of
the police, firemen and health services during

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,640
large forest fires.

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:27,500
Generally, this requires the creation of a
special task force, as a staff, with its own

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:37,329
dedicated structure, namely facilities equipped
with means of communication.

19
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:45,090
Tactical or operative command focuses on the
work of units directly involved on the field.

20
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,429
Most of the time, at this level, the leader
can lead his team by himself, without the

21
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:56,689
help of a specially and formally established
staff or headquaters.

22
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:01,450
In this MOOC, we will move back and forth
between tactical command and operative command,

23
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:07,560
so it will be important to know what we are
talking about.

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,709
All security organisations like the army,
the police, private security agencies and

25
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:20,260
teams dedicated to the conservation of protected
areas, have a mission, a target to achieve.

26
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,980
In the example displayed here, the mission
is still quite general - the first line is

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,360
strategic, while the second one covers the
operative level.

28
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,340
It doesn’t state the concrete actions each
associate must carry out, so the mission will

29
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,440
have to be analysed and declined into concrete
actions for subordinates.

30
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,099
The mission displayed on the screen right
now is of a lower level, close to the tactical

31
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:55,950
level, but still covering part of the operative
level, as nothing is said concerning the means

32
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,980
at hand (staff, arsenal, duration).

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:06,360
This mission is a bit more concrete than the
previous one, but must be clarified to address

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,680
collaborators on the field.

35
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,980
Here we are at the tactical level of the squadron
commander.

36
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,190
He will have to give a couple of extra precisions
to the team leaders under him.

37
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:25,610
It will then be up to each team leader to
give further instructions based on the sector

38
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:33,280
they are in charge of (bush, mountain, urban
area).

39
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,920
Notice how the levels of command form a chain
reaction from top to bottom when it comes

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,489
to mission assignments.

41
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:49,290
Each level must be aware of this system, not
only executive officers as they apply it,

42
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,480
but also subordinates to understand it.

43
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,829
When the global operation is complex and involves
a lot of staff, the number of levels between

44
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,579
operation leaders and basic collaborator increases.

45
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:11,739
This order preparation system will help managers
have a standardised way of thinking, that

46
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:18,280
ensures all relevant parameters have been
considered, to guarantee the mission is fulfilled.

47
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,840
The more this method is practiced, known and
applied, the more the one using it will be

48
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,370
able to think fast and effectively, even when
he faces unexpected crises or finds himself

49
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,000
under time pressure.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,539
Thus, during training, exercises must be as
realistic as possible, and involve both leaders

51
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:44,889
and their subordinates.

52
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:51,700
These exercises must be prepared by keeping
in mind what level of command should be applied:

53
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,600
operative, tactical, or both at the same time?

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,210
Finally, despite the very formal aspect of
what has been said in this sequence, the personality

55
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,820
of each leader influences the way he faces
and assesses problems.

56
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:15,180
His level of experience may lead him to choose
original or daring solutions, that a beginner

57
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,580
would hesitate on.

58
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:23,639
In the following sequences, we will be seeing
that the systematic method doesn’t exclude

59
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,770
the personality of actors involved.

60
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,480
We will also see that there are often different
possible options available to face a new problem

61
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,889
or achieve a mission.

62
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,710
We’ll see how to choose among these options,
namely by considering the risk assessment

63
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,270
that can impact fulfilling the mission.

64
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:51,020
Finally, ethics and human rights must fully
be part of each step of the process.
