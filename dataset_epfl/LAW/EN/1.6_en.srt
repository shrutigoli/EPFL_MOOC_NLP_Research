1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,930
When we talk about law, we also need to talk
about institutions.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,840
Institutions are involved in making and implementing
law at every level.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,770
There are different types of institutions
involved in law and governance.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,640
Sometimes these are classified as legislative,
executive and judicial institutions.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,000
Legislative institutions create law.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,210
At the national level, a congress or parliament
might be the legislative institution.

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,500
At the local level, a city, community or tribal
council can perform legislative functions.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,800
Executive institutions implement and enforce
law.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,050
The chief executive of a country is normally
the president or prime minister.

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,590
Government ministries and agencies, including
law enforcement agencies and prosecutors,

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,030
are also part of the executive branch.

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,460
Judicial institutions, namely courts, interpret
law and resolve disputes.

13
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,370
Courts can exist at different levels and in
different types of legal system, and they

14
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,500
may have authority, or jurisdiction, over
different subjects.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,420
The lines between legislative, executive and
judicial institutions are often blurred.

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,130
Executive institutions can create legal rules
through agency regulation, described below.

17
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,770
Judicial courts also create law, particularly
in common law countries where judicial decisions

18
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,220
have precedential value.

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,670
Institutional responsibility may be divided
by sector, particularly within the executive.

20
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,210
There may be different agencies responsible
for agriculture, water, forests, fisheries,

21
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,210
etc.

22
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,659
This can create problems, particularly where
environmental systems or challenges implicate

23
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,850
more than one sector.

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,580
For example, a mangrove forest may come under
the authority of forest, coastal, marine,

25
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:56,409
or freshwater agencies; or may fall into a
gap where no agency gives it enough attention.
