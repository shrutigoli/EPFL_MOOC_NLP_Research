00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,070
Hello, and welcome to this first module of
our MOOC on Law enforcement.

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:15,650
It will be presented to you by Lydia Slobodian,
Legal officer at the IUCN Environmental Law

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,150
Center in Bonn, Germany.

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,079
The goal of this module is to help us better
understand the laws and regulations that apply

5
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,820
to protected areas conservation.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,370
We will look at where they come from, and
what their nature, scopes, limits and uses

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,460
are.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,329
This topic is indeed important so the module
will be quite long.

9
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,559
Let’s have a look at the topics we are going
to cover.

10
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,519
First, we will see what Law is.

11
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:47,899
What form it takes.

12
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,670
What it is used for.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,539
Then, we will try to understand its utility
and uses for conservation.

14
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:00,730
We will look at the connection between law
and protected area governance, and of course,

15
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,110
we will see the importance of good governance.

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,270
Then, we will look at the translation of law
into applicable regulations for conservation.

17
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,920
The ones that apply to certain geographical
territories such as protected areas.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,510
The ones that focus on the species found on
these territories.

19
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:27,290
Finally, we will talk about the regulations
that cover the activities that take place

20
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,240
there.

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,990
We will then change scales to look at international
laws, what they are, what they bring, what

22
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,360
their importance is, and where they come from.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,159
Then, we’ll quickly cover some international
agreements on the environment and see how

24
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,579
they work.

25
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:52,500
Among these, we will talk about the ones that
directly concern protected areas like the

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,490
CBD, the Ramsar or world heritage conventions,
the CITES and the CMS which we already talked

27
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,979
about in the MOOC on PA management.

28
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:09,000
We will quickly cover the principles and rights
that go alongside global laws, like the principles

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,150
of precaution or sovereignty, and more generally
human rights.

30
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:21,300
We will finish with a sequence on the principles
of law enforcement, an excellent introduction

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,200
to the next modules.

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,410
Of course, you can go deeper into all these
notions by reading the recommended documents.

33
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:35,150
Do the quizzes between sequences, or join
the conversation with other participants on

34
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,970
the platform or on our Facebook page, it will
certainly help you.

35
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,870
There, have an excellent first module !
