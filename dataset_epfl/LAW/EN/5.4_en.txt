- Just like other activities, surveillance is part of the protected area management plan.
Have a look at these guidelines for more details.
- For reasons of confidentiality, the description isnâ€™t very detailed, but main activities are documented.
- It mainly lists operations to carry out, it identifies staff needs and skills to strengthen, facilities that can promote surveillance, and it explains surveillanceâ€™s monitoring-evaluation and funding.
- An operation plan, usually carried out yearly, details the activities to implement, with clear indicators to assess the progress made.
- Surveillance patrol planning is based on excellent knowledge of the field and of the distribution of threats in the protected area.
- The area is sometimes zoned to target actions better and face threats more effectively according to their nature, their scale, their urgency and so on.
- In this case, ecological monitoring provides significant support because it gives information on human-induced alterations and their location.
- Thus, updating data on the state of conservation of the protected area steers surveillance over time.
It is a field that requires adaptive management.
- Intelligence plays a key role.
Information regarding poachers and other park offenders helps to anticipate their activities.
- Intelligence is therefore not only an opportunistic activity, but must be planned and organised to have the desired effects.
- Staff in charge of surveillance must be adapted to the mission and it is crucial to organise frequent evaluations to make sure their skills remain up to date.
- The evaluation should focus on their physical and mental capacities, on their motivation, their endurance, on their skills related to the field and consequently, their need for training.
- This helps to proceed to new recruitment phases, reassignments, and training.
All this must be integrated to the operation plan.
The method of evaluation must be simple and objective, based on measurable indicators.
- Of course, these rangersâ€™ employment conditions must be defined beforehand, as well as their objectives, and indicators to assess.
- To be clear, the mission must be known by every stakeholder so that he can perfectly master his area of responsibility.
- In some difficult situations, bonuses or other types of rewards can motivate agents.
These should be added to the operation plan and explained to the beneficiaries.
- The role of this is to empower good staff.
A clear and just allocation system must be developed, based on performance to effectively target the deserving ones.
- If properly used this tool can be very useful but it can also be counterproductive otherwise!
- Sometimes, special infrastructure and facilities are needed to facilitate law enforcement actions
- this must also be added to the operation plan.
- This includes base camps, stations to get staff closer to threatened areas, new trails to enable access, acquiring or maintaining stock, getting proper communication material, fences and so on.
- Frequent monitoring-evaluations ensure that set targets are being achieved.
- Assessment criteria must remain simple, and be easy to measure.
For example, they can refer to the effective presence of rangers inside the park in terms of men per day.
- The coverage ratio of patrols on the protected area territory.
- The level of involvement of neighbouring populations through the amount of information provided or the number of initiatives taken by communities to prevent infiltrations.
- Measuring animal flight-distance gives an indication on their confidence, and thereby on the level of aggression they are facing.
- The number of arrests or evidence of criminal activity in the protected area and their spatial distribution.
- The number of convicted people which is an important indicator as it covers the entire law enforcement process, from beginning to end.
- The use of geographical information system tools can be included to the operation plan as they enable the collection of information during patrols.
- These tools are more or less easy to use, and sometimes, a frequently updated database is enough.G - Finally, financing surveillance is a factor that can sometimes limit the operation plan.
- The State must engage by implementing enough measures to sustainably manage the protected area network.
If it doesnâ€™t, financial and technical partners,
NGOs and foundations can help funding the surveillance.
But this field isnâ€™t the most eligible to receive their funding, so it is better to think of sustainable strategies based on lasting resources, steady incomes or sales of environmental services to ensure the long term durability of surveillance.
