In the previous sequence, weâ€™ve seen that to give an answer to the question â€œwhat must I doâ€�, values and norms must be put into perspective, which will lead to a full ethical reflexion.
So now is the time to give a couple of definitions.
Ethics.
It is the thought process that allows to solve situations in which values and/or norms are in conflict.
For instance, some professional decisions can have consequences in the private sphere, if the people involved are close to us.
Deontology.
It intends to set the minimal standards of a profession.
Access to the profession in question should be forbidden if those minimal standards arenâ€™t met.
For instance, a deontological code could determine if a public agent has the right to accept gifts in kind for personal use.
Values.
These are notions or terms describing goals to reach according to a group, an organisation, a profession or a corporationâ€™s ideals.
However, values arenâ€™t accompanied with rules to follow.
Everyone can achieve their ideal in different ways.
Loyalty, professionalism and honesty are common examples of ideals.
Norms.
They are texts gathered in laws, by-laws, codes or any other form of document that authorises, forbids, obliges or orders.
Norms determine the rules to follow and the possible penalties if they arenâ€™t respected.
The penal code is a norm.
Traffic laws as well.
Charters or codes.
Generally speaking, organisations want to communicate about their proper functioning, agentsâ€™ good quality of work and the service they provide to the population.
To do so, they can publish their driving norms and values in codes or charters.
This is when we talk about deontological code, the charter of core values, the code of ethics and so on.
A code of ethics seeks to define the ideal of a profession by listing common values all those who practice the profession are supposed to adhere to.
A deontological code is a regulatory basis that sets the basic requirements to practice an occupation.
Not respecting the elements of such a code can lead to administrative penalties and even dismissal.
Letâ€™s quickly get back to some of the values that are usually recognised for a security organisation.
Loyalty is often mentioned, as well as professionalism, fairness, faithfulness, honesty and integrity.
These are professional values.
*At the same time, a personâ€™s personality is fashioned by his education, his social environment and possible religion, which produce his personal value system.
The same words previously mentioned are by the way often encountered there: loyalty, faithfulness and honesty.
However, these words donâ€™t necessarily cover the same notions.
Among the norms, you can discriminate between formal and informal norms.
Formal norms are the ones that are clearly announced, formalised and written down.
Informal norms are supposed to be known within a group, a family, a corporation, without having to be formulated.
These different notions are connected to each other as it is widely accepted that:
Ethics are the basis of the law.
Deontology is a discipline of ethics.Deontology is a norm.
It must respect the law and handle ethical issues that havenâ€™t been solved by the law.
Letâ€™s get back to our question: â€œWhat must I do?â€�
Most of the time, the question brings an immediate response without requiring deep reflection.
Weâ€™ll see in the next sequence how personal and professional values can be in conflict, how they complicate answering the question â€œWhat must I do?â€�.
At that point, we will be at the very heart ethical reflexion.
