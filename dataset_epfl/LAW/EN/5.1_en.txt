Hello,
In this module we will look at how a key activity related to law enforcement in a protected area is carried out, namely, the fight against poaching.
To learn more about poaching, you can also have a look at the MOOC on species conservation which analyses its form, causes and solutions.
This module is presented by captain Benoit
Koutouna Amon, in charge of mobile brigades for the central region at the Ivorian Parks and Reserves Authority
Together we will look at the following points:
- what is surveillance, what is it based on and how is it organised
- Who are the actors involved and what are their roles
- How is the fight against poaching planned on the field
- And how do patrols manage its execution
- What equipment do we need
- And what vital role does intelligence play to improve results.
- Finally, we will have a quick look at new technologies that can help surveillance, a growing and important topic.
At the end of this module, youâ€™ll also find the last exam of the MOOC!
Have a great week.
