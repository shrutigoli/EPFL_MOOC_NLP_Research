- Hello Philippe.
- Hello Geoffroy
- Here we are at the beginning of the module on work ethics.
In a MOOC like this one, on law enforcement, why is it important to talk about ethics?
- The idea here is to use a form of training widely conducted in police academies.
It is more than just studying laws and identifying what is authorized or not.
In normal circumstances, the agent in charge of enforcing laws and regulations knows perfectly well if he is facing an offender.
He also knows if he is acting like a professional, within the legal framework.
- If each agent or manager already has the tools to act lawfully, what are ethics for?
- Human beings are confronted with temptations, frustrations and desires.
They are also bound by their education, their social status, their culture and their environment, and these elements can make them question or doubt the laws in place.
At this point, the fact of knowing that a behaviour is unlawful isnâ€™t enough to help them overcome their problem.
They need to find answers elsewhere.
This is why an ethical reflection is relevant in addition to simply studying laws and regulations.
- So basically ethics add a philosophical dimension to law enforcement?
- Exactly.
It also helps realize why we do certain things or not, why we took a certain direction instead of another.
It is obviously very relevant for people in justice careers, where representatives are given great power to be used with discernment, for the common good and not for personal benefit.
- In relation to justice, how do work ethics come into play?
P - For many years, I worked as senior officer of criminal police in Switzerland and was trained on the issue in the US at the FBI
Academy in Quantico, Virginia.
- In 2004, an organizational reform of police training in Switzerland introduced a course on work ethics to the basic training for policemen.
Based on my American experience and along with other specialists in the field, we developed a course approved at a national level.
- A course in which work ethics plays an important role I suppose?
- During the training year, no less than 28 sessions are devoted to ethics alone.
As a complement, they are coupled with classes on human rights covering 16 sessions.
Over the years, police students have become increasingly aware of these topics.
While in 2004 many people were still quite opposed to them, the new generation is very open as they understand the stakes.
Behaviours are changingâ€¦
- So specifically, what are we going to see in this module?
- â€œWhat must I do?â€� â€“ This is the first question weâ€™ll be asking ourselves.
- Then, weâ€™ll define ethics more precisely and position it in relation with other notions like deontology, values, norms etc.
- After this, weâ€™ll be looking at the principles governing ethics,
- and weâ€™ll talk about drafting codes and charters to translate them into actions.
- Finally, weâ€™ll consider the dilemmas that can emerge when we move away from ethics.
- Many useful concepts to masterâ€¦ this should be a great week.
