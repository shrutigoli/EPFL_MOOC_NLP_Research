1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:10,110
Law is only effective if it is implemented,
and its rules, processes and obligations are

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,700
followed and upheld.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,340
Making sure this happens is part of what we
call “Compliance and Enforcement.”

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,890
Compliance means adherence to legal rules
by the regulated entities.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,710
Enforcement refers to measures to compel compliance.

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,270
Compliance does not always require enforcement.

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,079
A lot of times compliance is completely voluntary.

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,360
I don’t cross the street when the light
is red, not because I’m afraid of getting

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,020
arrested, but because I’m afraid of getting
hit by a car.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,800
Or because of social pressure to comply.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,120
I don’t attack other people because I don’t
want to and it seems wrong, not because I’m

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,270
afraid of going to jail.

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:54,040
And in some cases, I comply with a law just
because it’s the law and it seems like a

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,399
reasonable and legitimate law that I see no
reason to break.

15
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,380
However, voluntary compliance is not always
enough.

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,019
This is where enforcement comes in.

17
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,200
There are a few different models for compliance
and enforcement.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,560
One model is based on the idea that most people
comply with law most of the time, as long

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,429
as the law seems legitimate and fair, and
compliance is relatively easy.

20
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:21,820
This is called the normative model.

21
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,179
Under this model, compliance and enforcement
measures should ensure that the system seems

22
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:29,090
fair and just, and help people comply.

23
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,799
The second model assumes that people are rational,
and will decide whether to comply or not by

24
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,439
weighing the costs and benefits involved.

25
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,840
Compliance and enforcement measures can improve
compliance by changing the cost-benefit analysis.

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,030
If it is more expensive, more dangerous, and
more difficult to break the law than to comply

27
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,020
with it, fewer people will choose not to comply.

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,009
This is called the rational model.

29
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,859
There are two sides to this cost-benefit calculation:
the costs of breaking the law should be higher

30
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,719
than the benefits lawbreakers get.

31
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,979
Flipped around, the benefits of compliance
with the law should be higher than the costs

32
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,819
of complying.

33
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,890
This gives us four basic approaches to improving
compliance through the cost-benefit model.

34
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,920
The first approach is to lower the cost of
compliance, by making it easy and cheap to

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,349
comply.

36
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,810
This requires making sure that everyone knows
how to comply – that they know what the

37
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,439
law is and what is expected of them.

38
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,459
For example, protected areas should be clearly
demarcated, and neighboring communities should

39
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,909
understand what activities are permitted where.

40
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:42,220
In addition, compliance should not impose
an undue burden.

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,939
Where a community entirely depends on activities
within a protected area for their livelihoods,

42
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,980
legally prohibiting these activities without
providing alternatives will probably result

43
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,370
in extensive non-compliance.

44
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,530
Addressing this will require considering the
needs of the community and how they can be

45
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,459
met while achieving conservation goals.

46
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,319
The second approach to improving compliance
is to increase the benefits of compliance,

47
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,319
through incentives such as subsidies, tax
exemptions, information or technical support.

48
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,700
One of the best ways to improve compliance
is to give people a share in the benefits

49
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,219
of conservation, so that they have a direct
stake in making sure it is successful.

50
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:26,319
Involving communities and other affected stakeholders
directly in management and regulation can

51
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,620
have this result.

52
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,209
A third approach is reducing the benefits
of non-compliance.

53
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,459
You may have heard the phrase, “crime doesn’t
pay”.

54
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,409
Unfortunately, non-compliance often does pay,
so reducing that payout can go a long way

55
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,730
to improving compliance.

56
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,510
One way to do this is by cutting down demand
for unsustainably sourced products like ivory

57
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,439
and rosewood.

58
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,139
Where environmental harm is driven by international
markets, as is frequently the case, demand

59
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:59,279
reduction can require transnational cooperation
and significant action on the part of importing

60
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,279
countries.

61
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:05,569
However, demand reduction can also be an effective
tactic at the local level, where unsustainable

62
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:07,870
products are headed for domestic markets.

63
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,629
For example, increasing availability of sustainable
energy can reduce demand for illegally harvested

64
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,989
charcoal.

65
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,079
Where the demand that is driving biodiversity
loss is local, it is important to understand

66
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,490
the local needs and acceptable sustainable
alternatives.

67
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,550
A final approach to improving compliance under
the rational model is increasing the cost

68
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,389
of non-compliance directly, through criminal
prosecution or administrative and civil measures

69
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:35,000
for enforcement.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,530
Enforcement can serve three basic functions.

71
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,289
The first is punishment or retribution.

72
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:45,180
This can improve compliance under the normative
model, by making the system seem just.

73
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,680
Excessive or disproportionate punishment can
undermine this function, and make law seem

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,610
less legitimate.

75
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,460
A second function is direct prevention, by
making sure that the target of enforcement

76
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,979
cannot violate the law again.

77
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,240
It does this by putting the violator in prison
or taking away the means to carry out the

78
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,090
activity by confiscating equipment, revoking
licenses, or destroying financial means by

79
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,229
imposing fines.

80
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,120
Direct prevention makes the most difference
when targeting the biggest players causing

81
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,150
the most harm.

82
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,860
Removing a single poacher may not significantly
reduce noncompliance where there are a thousand

83
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,760
others to take their place.

84
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,710
However, removing a kingpin of a criminal
organization can have a significant effect

85
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,170
on the illegal market as a whole.

86
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,830
The third function of enforcement is deterrence.

87
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,259
Punishing violators sends a message to other
violators that if they break the law, the

88
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,420
consequences will outweigh the potential benefit.

89
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,240
This function might be the most important
function of enforcement, but it is also the

90
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,450
hardest to prove.

91
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,430
To be an effective deterrent, enforcement
must be consistent, and the penalties must

92
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,680
be sufficiently high to change the cost-benefit
calculation.

93
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,791
The risk of being caught times the cost of
punishment must be higher than the benefit

94
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,830
of noncompliance.

95
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,990
Compliance and enforcement works a little
bit differently at the international level.

96
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,270
When countries don’t comply with their obligations,
we can’t really put them in jail.

97
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,520
But there are ways to promote and facilitate
compliance with international obligations,

98
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,020
and resolve disputes that arise between countries.

99
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,161
Even though international law often doesn’t
have a global enforcement mechanism, like

100
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:29,640
a global judiciary, States usually comply
with it.

101
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,240
Compliance with international law takes place
for many reasons: reputation, reciprocity,

102
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,060
benefits of compliance, or high cost of non-compliance.

103
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,389
Like individuals, States may comply because
they feel the law is legitimate and fair or

104
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:48,449
because when they ratify an agreement this
entails a normative obligation they cannot

105
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,919
ignore.

106
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,729
The international order depends on the principle
of “pacta sunt servanda” under which international

107
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:00,060
treaties must be honored and states must comply
with them.

108
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,300
Nevertheless, not all States always comply
with international law.

109
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,040
International agreements can provide a limited
range of enforcement mechanisms including

110
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,540
penalties such as trade sanctions or withdrawal
of eligibility to participate in the mechanisms

111
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,449
of the treaty.

112
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:20,710
Many international treaties include dispute
resolution mechanisms, such as provisions

113
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:27,069
for arbitration, mediation or referral of
disputes to the International Court of Justice.

114
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,860
The International Court of Justice is the
judicial organ of the United Nations and the

115
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,690
most preeminent international court.

116
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,389
The Court’s role is to settle, in accordance
with international law, legal disputes submitted

117
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,520
to it by States and to give advisory opinions
on legal questions referred to it by the UN

118
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,810
and its specialized agencies.

119
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:51,210
According to the Article 94 (1) of the UN
Charter “each Member of the United Nations

120
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,710
undertakes to comply with the decisions of
the ICJ in any case to which it is a party”,

121
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,509
therefore, all judgments of the ICJ are binding.

122
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:06,020
Nevertheless, the ICJ has some flaws: Currently,
only 73 States have accepted the jurisdiction

123
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
of the Court.

124
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,400
Moreover, the ICJ has no power to enforce
its resolutions by itself – this power is

125
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,000
held by the UN Security Council, whose Permanent
Members have the right to veto any decision

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,310
or recommendation of the Court in which they
are allegedly responsible.

127
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,020
Most importantly, a case can only be heard
by the ICJ if the countries have given their

128
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,919
consent for the Court to hear it.

129
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,630
It is important to remember that at both the
national and international level the objective

130
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,860
of compliance measures is to improve compliance.

131
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,221
The goal is not to put more poachers in jail
or impose more international sanctions, but

132
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:51,030
to create a world where there is less poaching
and less violation of international law.

133
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,920
Enforcement measures can help with this, by
creating deterrence or promoting a sense of

134
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,280
fairness and justice, but the ultimate goal
is a world where all people and countries

135
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,820
follow their obligations to value and respect
nature and natural resources.
