1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,700
Law is one of the most effective tools we
have to influence behavior, coordinate action

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,860
and achieve public goals, such as conservation.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,490
But what is law?

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,110
Law is a body of rules governing human conduct,
recognized as binding, and enforced by a public

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,110
authority.

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,470
Law is different from morality and ethics.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,980
I may think that it is immoral to eat meat,
or lie to your spouse, or cut to the front

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,110
of the line, but in most countries these actions
are not prohibited by law.

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,910
They are not enforced by a public authority.

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,430
At the same time, not all action by public
authority is lawful.

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,340
A corrupt policeman may put me in jail for
refusing to pay a bribe – this is not supported

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,960
by law.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,760
Law takes many forms and exists at many levels,
from international law – including treaties,

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,610
principles and conventions – to national
law – including statutes, regulations and

15
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,670
judicial decisions – to local or community
law – including municipal codes and community

16
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,380
bylaws.

17
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,289
Not all law is written down.

18
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:15,139
In some places, religious codes or customary
rules have legal force.

19
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:22,189
For example, in many countries Sharia – Islamic
law – exists alongside statutory law, or

20
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,299
is incorporated into the statutory system.

21
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:30,109
In these countries, Sharia courts can judge
cases and order punishments.

22
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:34,490
In other places, customary authorities, such
as village chiefs or tribal councils have

23
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,920
lawmaking power.

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,149
Some places have many different types of law,
from different legal sources.

25
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:45,899
Depending on where I live, I may be subject
to national legislation, religious mandates,

26
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,850
local ordinances and tribal rules, all at
the same time.

27
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,349
This is called Legal Pluralism.

28
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,939
Laws also have a hierarchy, which determines
the order in which they are applied, and what

29
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,220
happens when they conflict.

30
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,090
Different laws are at different levels in
this hierarchy, sometimes called the Kelsenian

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,320
Pyramid.

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,490
The highest level of law in a country is almost
always the Constitution.

33
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,939
Lower levels in the pyramid may include general
legislation, special legislation and bylaws

34
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,739
and regulations.

35
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,840
If provisions contained in a specific regulation
contradict the text of a law, the regulation

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,599
will be declared null or invalid.

37
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,040
If a law contradicts the content of the National
Constitution, this law will also be considered

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,450
invalid.

39
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,040
Law performs many functions.

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,469
Substantive law creates rights and obligations.

41
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:42,950
It tells you what you can do and what you
can’t, what rights you have to your things

42
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,989
and your property, and even what taxes you
owe.

43
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:52,800
Procedural law creates processes within the
legislative, judicial and administrative systems.

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,230
It tells you how to get a driver’s license
or file a complaint or defend yourself if

45
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,210
you are arrested or sued.

46
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:04,579
It also gives judges, policemen, officials
and other government actors rules to follow

47
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:06,330
as they do their job.

48
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,750
Law affects every facet of life.

49
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,030
It creates the basic structures of government,
and the basic rights of people.

50
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,349
It regulates businesses, organizations, families
and individuals.

51
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,490
It determines how the State spends its money.

52
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:25,709
And, most importantly for our purposes, law
sets out tools, processes and frameworks for

53
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:25,930
conservation.
