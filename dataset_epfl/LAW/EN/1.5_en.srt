1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,059
Law does not just tell us what to do and what
not to do.

2
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:12,550
It also creates and manages a system of rights
and obligations.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,940
A right is a legal entitlement.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,150
It creates a corresponding obligation or duty
on the part of others to respect that entitlement.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,369
Some rights are human rights, which are recognized
as fundamental by the international community,

6
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,200
no matter what national law says.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,530
The rights to life, to free speech, and to
freedom from discrimination are human rights.

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,710
Other rights are recognized in national law
or private contracts.

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,579
I have rights to the things that I own, rights
to act in certain ways, and rights to make

10
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,390
certain decisions.

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,480
These rights may be limited, and I may be
able to sell them or give them away.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,879
Typically, I cannot use my rights in a way
that violates the rights of others.

13
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,360
I have a right to move my arm around in a
big circle, but I do not have a right to do

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,680
so if it would hit my friend in the face.

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,130
In conservation, one of the most relevant
categories of rights is property rights.

16
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,030
When we think about property, we often think
about ownership.

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,210
But in reality, property rights are much more
complex.

18
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,920
We can understand them as a bundle of sticks,
where each stick represents a different right.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,710
One stick is a right to access the property;
one stick is a right to exclude others.

20
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,840
One stick is a right to use the resources
on the property; another is a right to sell

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
it.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,509
There is the right to live there, and the
right to develop.

23
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,400
Different people may have rights to the same
property.

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,110
One person may have the right to farm the
property, while another has a right to cross

25
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,380
over the property to get to his pasture or
field.

26
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,060
The property itself may be owned by a third
person, or by the state.

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,329
Closely connected to the concept of property
rights is the concept of tenure.

28
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,060
Tenure describes the way in which people or
groups gain and hold rights relating to land

29
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,990
or other resources.

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:08,229
For example, a person may rent or lease land
for a specified time – this type of tenure

31
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,340
is called a leasehold.

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,900
Or they may buy some or all rights to the
property – this is called freehold.

33
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,590
A person or group may have rights to a property
through custom or traditional use – this

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,530
can be referred to as customary tenure.

35
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,470
Rights may even be allocated by the government
based on necessity or need.

36
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,610
Tenure can be public or private, individual
or communal.

37
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,860
Tenure rules can come from different legal
orders, and there can be problems where tenure

38
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,810
rules established by one regime are not recognized
by another – for example, where tenure from

39
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,370
customary law is not recognized in statutory
law.

40
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,430
Property rights are not the only type of rights
that are important for conservation.

41
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,780
There are rights related to specific resources,
such as water, mineral and fishing rights.

42
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,060
There are also rights relating to participation,
information and access to justice: these are

43
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,180
key to good governance.

44
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,459
And there are many important human rights,
including emerging rights to a healthy environment,

45
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:07,660
that we will discuss later.
