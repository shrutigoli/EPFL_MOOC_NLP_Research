1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:07,649
People aren’t naturally corrupt by birth.

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:14,129
So why suddenly or progressively, does a person
fall into crime and corruption?

3
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:17,130
This is what we will see in this sequence.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,590
A child’s education has a decisive influence
on his adult behaviour.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,460
Children act by imitating others, and will
consider it normal to imitate their parents,

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,350
even their most questionable traits.

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,890
Cultural and social environments also influence
a child’s education.

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,739
It may indeed be easier to resist criminal
temptations in a privileged and economically

9
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,920
stable social environment.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,280
In an environment that was degraded by war
or a weak economy, a person would be more

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,090
inclined to behave inadequately.

12
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:04,759
Once he becomes an adult, the person is confronted
with his own ethical analysis: what must I

13
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:06,619
do?

14
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:09,979
The responsible adult must make choices.

15
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:15,729
He must be aware of the social and cultural
influences that guided his education.

16
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:21,689
He must now behave according to his own rules
he has full control of.

17
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,970
But what happens?

18
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,790
Why do some fall?

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,939
Why do they accept to be corrupted or take
illegal liberties?

20
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:35,290
This is what I call the backpack effect.

21
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,920
The backpack is carried by each person every
morning when leaving the house, and carried

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,810
back home in the evening to their families.

23
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:51,550
This imaginary backpack holds all the problems
and troubles individuals have to bear, but

24
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:57,850
also all the joys and satisfactions they’ve
experienced.

25
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,630
The bag’s content permanently influences
the person’s behaviour.

26
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:11,810
Because of it he can lose perfectly good habits,
and act in the heat of the moment.

27
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:20,140
Basically, the state of the bag can make somebody
commit unprofessional or criminal actions.

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,770
What is inside this backpack?

29
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,980
Inside, you’ll find the realities of life.

30
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,970
For example, family problems like the illness
of a loved one, a partner or children.

31
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:41,010
You’ll also find relational problems within
the family, conflict with the spouse or parents.

32
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,889
These problems can take an important space
in the mind of the person who lives with them

33
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:52,980
and can grow to the point that they become
more important than professional issues.

34
00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:01,669
You’ll also find work-related problems,
like lack of consideration for a job from

35
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:09,010
the population, lack of communication with
colleagues, lack of support from leadership,

36
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,530
defective technical equipment in terms of
arsenal, clothing or connection.

37
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:23,720
Here too, an excellent employee may feel demotivated
and think his efforts have no point.

38
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,500
Finally, you’ll find all the problems related
to the financial situation.

39
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:38,220
Often, starting a family leads to great financial
burdens which can be difficult to face.

40
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,230
The birth of children, buying a house etc.

41
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,610
Alone with one partner, possibly with two
incomes, everything seems easy.

42
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,199
But building a family increase expenses.

43
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:59,280
Income may also decline if someone in the
household loses employment.

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,729
And the point of rupture can trigger frustration
and can make someone loose its ethical sense

45
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:10,650
to face everyday problems.

46
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,570
Frustration can be a powerful catalyst for
delinquency.

47
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:21,410
In our case, it leads to professional delinquency,
namely corruption or unlawful acts committed

48
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,850
in the work environment.

49
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,160
All workers show up at work with their own
imaginary backpacks.

50
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,560
It is good for leadership to know what’s
inside, at least in part.

51
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,560
However, employees have no obligation to share
this with their bosses.

52
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,030
If they do, it must be a result of dialogue
based on mutual trust.

53
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,850
If the leaders are informed, they will be
able to distribute the work among employees

54
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,810
by taking this information in consideration.

55
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:05,410
Based on these factors of frustration or influence,
different types of corruption can be defined.

56
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,690
Here, we will only describe three styles that
illustrate how corruption can appear.

57
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:17,920
First, the notion of "rotten apple" which
supposes that human beings are individually

58
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:25,070
responsible and inherently predisposed to
commit crime.

59
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,870
Organisations usually appreciate this vision.

60
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,590
It allows them to distance themselves from
situations, they don’t have to question

61
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:42,390
themselves, namely when it comes to controls
or considering the quality of managers.

62
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,840
The notion of "slippery slope" is also used.

63
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,030
You take a first seemingly trivial step in
the wrong direction, then by habit or laziness,

64
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,090
you go further.

65
00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:00,550
To turn back, you will need to have the courage
to denounce yourself or your accomplices.

66
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,250
So instead, you let yourself go.

67
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:10,770
"Department corruption" describes the fact
that the entire organisation is dysfunctional.

68
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,780
The individual confronted with this environment
will be able to let himself go saying "if

69
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,860
everybody does it, why not me?”

70
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,460
Such behaviors have been found within police
units in various countries, of course not

71
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,770
only in France as in this example.

72
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:35,980
For people to realise this imaginary backpack
exists and that it is the cause of certain

73
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,910
behaviours, the staff must be equipped with
certain tools.

74
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:47,889
This includes basic vocational training on
work-related or technical tasks, but also

75
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,450
training on work ethics and deontology.

76
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:57,780
In the next sequence we will suggest a method
of analysis to create favourable conditions

77
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,080
for such training.
