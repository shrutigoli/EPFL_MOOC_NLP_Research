Hello,
In this module we will look at how a key activity

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,349
related to law enforcement in a protected
area is carried out, namely, the fight against

3
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,200
poaching.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,680
To learn more about poaching, you can also
have a look at the MOOC on species conservation

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,820
which analyses its form, causes and solutions.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,390
This module is presented by captain Benoit
Koutouna Amon, in charge of mobile brigades

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,510
for the central region at the Ivorian Parks
and Reserves Authority

8
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:44,390
Together we will look at the following points:
- what is surveillance, what is it based on

9
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,860
and how is it organised
- Who are the actors involved and what are

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,340
their roles
- How is the fight against poaching planned

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,600
on the field
- And how do patrols manage its execution

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,150
- What equipment do we need
- And what vital role does intelligence play

13
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,359
to improve results.

14
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,960
- Finally, we will have a quick look at new
technologies that can help surveillance, a

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,350
growing and important topic.

16
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,799
At the end of this module, youâ€™ll also find
the last exam of the MOOC!

17
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,399
Have a great week.
