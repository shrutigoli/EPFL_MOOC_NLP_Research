1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,400
Let’s keep unpacking all the aspects that
can impact the mission we were given.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,639
Once again, in this MOOC we are giving the
full method.

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:19,550
Depending on deadlines, or the lack of complexity
of the mission, this systematic thought process

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,840
can and must be simplified.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,650
After the problem is comprehended, we move
on to assessing the situation.

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,730
In this phase, the different aspects that
must be considered are detailed, namely the

7
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,440
five groups of factors.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,930
The mission is the core of the thought process
and must therefore also be assessed.

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,800
Its importance within the general context
should be considered by comparing it with

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,880
other ongoing missions.

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,550
The minimum and maximum expected results of
the action must be expressed, and the level

12
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:03,390
of flexibility of the mission must by questioned
by listing the constraints we are bound by,

13
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,269
and the freedom we are given.

14
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:11,110
Finally, we’ll go over the possible support
or partners we have.

15
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:18,010
A reflexion on legal foundations will help
identify if any form of action is needed,

16
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,360
if it actually falls under our jurisdiction.

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,330
The two basic principles of proportionality
and lawfulness must be carefully followed,

18
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,220
as well as human rights and ethics when the
situation might compromise them.

19
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,690
Deadlines are often a huge constraint.

20
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:44,110
All the time-related elements at hand must
be identified, such as the possible time the

21
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,880
adverse action would happen, the pace at which
the situation is expected to evolve, when

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,000
my possible back-up will show up, when it
is expected from me to implement the action

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and when it is expected I would achieve the
set target.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,500
To know how to act, it is important to know
how the sector of engagement is set.

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,360
This concerns its size and distance from our
own departure base, as well as the state of

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:22,330
the field, if it is a built-up zone, if there
are any roads or inhabitants.

27
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,160
The weather is also considered, as well as
communication networks, natural or manufactured

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,070
obstacles and the possibility to set up a
command post.

29
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,300
Will the action take place at night or during
daytime?

30
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:45,360
In short, this includes all the practical
aspects of the field in which you’ll have

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,180
to venture and the means you will have to
deploy to facilitate the action.

32
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,810
Whether you are confronted to a human adversary
or a catastrophic situation, it is important

33
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:06,150
to imagine all the possibilities the situation
can evolve towards, all the possible risks.

34
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,800
Ideally, list all these risks so that they
can later be confronted with our solutions

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
to minimize them.

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,100
It is important not to understand “adversary”
as “enemy” in the narrow sense of the

37
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,120
word.

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,069
Consider a victim for instance: they are not
an adversary, but will be taken care of concretely

39
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,850
and constitute a task to fulfil.

40
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:39,980
So, anything that will require some sort of
action on our part must be imagined using

41
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,850
the following lingo: opposing party.

42
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,630
Analysing a risk and assessing its importance
can be done by relying on the risk matrix.

43
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,670
The green part relates to the risks considered
insignificant, that won’t require specific

44
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,510
measures, except maybe a follow up on the
situation.

45
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:08,130
The yellow part relates to risks requiring
measures with a debatable scope.

46
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:14,310
The red part is about risks with a high probability
of having grave consequences - these must

47
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,769
be a priority until they are solved.

48
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:24,300
This step of risk assessment can be summarised
as follows: what is the most likely adverse

49
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,690
situation that could happen?

50
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,780
Which one is the most dangerous?

51
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:37,090
A simple method to assess our own means is
to confront every adverse risk with one or

52
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,510
more possible actions on our part.

53
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,910
This makes the thought process more concrete.

54
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,850
It doesn’t exclude listing our own possibilities
as such and not only as a tool for reaction.

55
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:56,100
The state of staff and management, available
equipment and possible back up teams, are

56
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,550
part of this assessment factor.

57
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:04,600
At this point, we should be able to tell if
our means are adapted to the situation to

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
handle.

59
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,310
And at any point of the situation assessment,
based on the identified problems, new immediate

60
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,159
measures can be ordered and the schedule can
be adapted.
