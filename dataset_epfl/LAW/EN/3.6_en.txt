Weâ€™ve seen what a behaviour respecting a certain work ethic looks like.
Weâ€™ve also mentioned the legal questions regarding offences committed in the work environment, namely corruption.
One thing that each and every one must include in their reflection at all levels of leadership is the great risk of damage to a reputation these failures can present.
Weâ€™ve seen how to include the Cohen and
Feldberg principles to an organisationâ€™s governance.
But this relates to the situation where everything goes well.
What happens when it doesnâ€™t?
Recently, in Europe, there was a scandal about a German car manufacturers who cheated their diesel engine tests.
The question isnâ€™t if you are for or against diesel engines, thatâ€™s not the point.
The question is, how are our choices as consumers free and informed if the factors supporting them are forged by manufacturer?
Fundamentally, the damage is done.
Even if the car manufacturers do everything they can to fix the mistakes, the reputation of their companies are affected.
The offence is, obviously, criminal, but the real problem started with a distorted ethical reflection.
The same goes for this Peruvian policeman.
His behaviour made public discredits him AND his corporation.
Even if this is an isolated case, the story will spread and inevitably shed doubts over his organisation and his entire profession, or even all Peruvian public officials.
In the streets youâ€™ll probably often hear people say: â€œtheyâ€™re all corruptâ€�.
These two examples give us an idea of the consequences related to the failure of a senior executive, like in the example of diesel, or the regular employee like with the Peruvian.
Above all, we must realise that each person within the organisation holds the same responsibility and can trigger the same consequences.
Everyone within the organisation, whatever their rank, should care about its image and reputation.
The consequences of such failures are easily identifiable.
Damaged reputations involve loss of confidence and of respect from the population, the litigants and the authorities.
Who would call on a government organisation if the behaviour of its members is considered unreliable?
This will create great distrust from the people towards the ones supposed to serve them.
Also, if the organisation finds out it is susceptible to external corruptors, internal controls must be intensified, and will limit employees liberty.
From a personal perspective, the individual exposes himself to prosecution and internal administrative proceedings.
He is at risk of dismissal and possible lawsuits for damages.
He will lose his job and will have to explain to his future employer why he left his previous job.
These situations raise questions about the gifts from private individuals to government organisations.
At what point are these gifts no longer signs of friendship and attention, but direct or indirect payments?
It is about paying attention to the hidden compensations.
Itâ€™s important to anticipate the donorsâ€™ expectations in future interventions.
Operational choices could be influenced by such or such litigant who is more generous and friendly than others.
A failure at that level will have the same consequences as in the diesel example or of the Peruvian police officer.
Moreover, this would cause major reputation damages.
Thus, internal regulations must deal with the principles of accepting gifts or benefits in kind.
In conclusion, weâ€™ll once again notice the importance of training associates and managers.
This training must cover all these aspects, technical but also ethical, deontological and legal.
The individualâ€™s survival is at stake.
We can consider that training in general,, and trainings on ethics in particular, enables the survival of an individual or the organisation tactically and non-tactically.
Tactical survival is ensured by work skills that are mastered through proper training.
It will enable the associate to survive practically in his daily activity, to not be killed or injured.
Non-tactical survival is based on social skills, and will enable the individual to survive in his job, without being dismissed for misconduct.
These two elements have long been considered by the police and the military as opposed.
According to me, they are complementary and go hand in hand.
