So far weâ€™ve talked about regulation defined by what itâ€™s trying to protect â€“ a particular species or place.
Now we turn to regulation that addresses a specific activity or threat, regardless of where it is carried out or what species it affects.
Weâ€™ve already discussed some mechanisms used to regulate activities.
For example, hunting licenses may be required in specific areas, or when hunting specific species.
However, regulations on hunting may not be limited to protected areas or endangered species.
Many jurisdictions have general hunting regulations that set out processes for licensing and prohibit certain methods or equipment.
Similarly activities that affect specific ecosystems, such as dredging or filling wetlands, may be regulated generally, wherever that ecosystem is found, whether or not it is in a protected area.
Or there may be general standards for activities such as mining or logging practices to reduce environmental impact.
One of the most familiar forms of threat-based regulation is pollution control.
Human activity always affects the environment â€“ this is unavoidable.
Regulation must determine what level of impact is acceptable.
It must balance the desire for innovation and development with the need for sustainability.
It must also be able to adapt to changing technology.
The simplest standard is a quota, cap or load â€“ a number that describes how much pollution can go into the air, water, ground or atmosphere, or how much of a resource can be taken out of the environment.
A standard based on a specific quota can be inflexible.
Alternative types of standards can be used to respond to changing technology, or create incentives for pollution reduction.
One common example is a standard based on â€œbest available technologyâ€� or â€œbest available practicesâ€�.
This standard requires operators to use the best methods available to limit pollution, emissions or other environmental impact.
In many cases it is qualified â€“ operators may not be required to immediately adopt any new technology if it is prohibitively expensive or otherwise unreasonable.
A common criticism of the â€œbest available technologyâ€� standard is that it can reduce incentives for innovation, since any company that develops improvements to reduce impact will be creating a new legal requirement for itself and the rest of the industry.
On the other hand, it can create a protection for companies that do innovate, since their competitors will be held to the same technological standard.
Another option is to couple a cap or quota with a trading scheme.
For example, polluters that exceed their quota may be able to buy credits from others that emit less.
This can create an incentive to improve environmental practices, since companies can sell the credits that they donâ€™t use.
You can also find trading schemes in the context of biodiversity.
Many governments have adopted a policy of â€œno net lossâ€� for wetlands, forests or biodiversity.
Where this applies, operators may be able to offset activities that cause loss in one area by restoring or protecting a similar ecosystem in another.
In the context of climate change, emissions trading has created a global market for carbon offsets.
Many of these offsets come from projects in the developing world.
This offsetting raises complicated legal questions, such as who owns carbon, who can sell it and who can benefit?
It also creates opportunities for fraud and corruption.
Taxes, such as a carbon tax or a pollution tax, can be an alternative to direct regulation or tradeable permits.
Taxes are one of the most efficient types of market-based measures for regulating activities.
Another common tool in activity-based regulation is the environmental impact assessment or
EIA.
Most countries have some form of environmental impact assessment for activities that may cause damage to the environment.
Some activities always require an EIA.
Others may be triggered by a specific threshold, such as where an activity is likely to have a significant adverse effect on biodiversity or the natural environment.
The EIA process should be transparent, and include opportunities for public comment on the proposed activity.
All activity or threat-based regulation has to deal with the question of how to evaluate risk.
It can be hard to quantify the amount of harm that will be caused by an activity in advance, when deciding whether to allow it.
Sometimes it is only possible to say that there is a certain chance of a certain level of harm.
Regulation can provide methods to assess and manage risk, and establish thresholds for what levels of risk are acceptable.
They also provide for what happens if the disaster or emergency actually happens: how to respond, and who bears the cost.
This can give rise to legal liability.
