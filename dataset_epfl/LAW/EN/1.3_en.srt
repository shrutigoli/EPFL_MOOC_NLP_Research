1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,450
Law is an essential tool for conservation.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,610
It sets up the basic framework in which conservation
operates, as well as processes for decision-making,

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,139
planning and management.

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,520
Law provides direct tools for conservation,
such as regulation of certain activities,

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,220
or requirements for protection in certain
areas.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,970
Law also provides incentives for conservation,
such as subsidies or tax credits for certain

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,010
types of land use.

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,620
Many different types of laws are important
for conservation.

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:42,690
These include laws governing particular ecosystems,
such as wetlands, forests, lakes, seas, drylands

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,790
and coastal areas.

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,870
Also laws governing specific sectors, such
as mining, agriculture, water and fishing.

12
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,410
They include protected areas laws, biodiversity
laws, and framework laws for conservation.

13
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,440
And laws that recognize indigenous rights,
community rights and other rights related

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,930
to the environment.

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:07,010
As well as laws that address harmful activities,
such as rules for environmental impact assessments

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,460
and pollution and chemical regulations.

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,270
Also land use, property, tax and trade laws.

18
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,180
Even criminal law is relevant for conservation.

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,830
Another important set of laws, are laws that
define the structure of government, create

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,900
processes for decision-making and establish
procedural rules for resolving disputes.

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,820
Specific types of regulation will be discussed
later.

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,540
But it is important to remember that regulation
is only one way that law can support conservation.
