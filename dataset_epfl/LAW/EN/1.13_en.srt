1
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,549
Now that we have a better sense of how MEAs
are set up, let’s talk about a few of the

2
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:11,539
MEAs that are important for conservation.

3
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:16,950
One of the key agreements is the Convention
on Biological Diversity, or CBD, which I’ve

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,090
already mentioned a few times.

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,419
The CBD is a framework convention – it creates
a broad set of principles and goals for biodiversity

6
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:28,630
conservation as well as structures for international
cooperation.

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,309
It sets out three key objectives: conservation
of biological diversity; the sustainable use

8
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:39,420
of its components; and the fair and equitable
sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,649
of genetic resources.

10
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:46,109
Its two protocols provide more detailed obligations
relating to some of these objectives.

11
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:53,379
In 2010, the CBD COP adopted the Strategic
Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, including

12
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:55,210
the Aichi Targets.

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,210
The Aichi Targets are specific, measurable
goals to be achieved by 2020, across a range

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,390
of sectors.

15
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,550
For example, Target 11 states: “By 2020,
at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland

16
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,810
water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine
areas, especially areas of particular importance

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,820
for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are
conserved through effectively and equitably

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,320
managed, ecologically representative and well
connected systems of protected areas and other

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,130
effective area-based conservation measures,
and integrated into the wider landscapes and

20
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,079
seascapes.”

21
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,609
Other targets focus on other biodiversity
challenges.

22
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:38,640
Target 6 addresses management and sustainable
use of fisheries.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,780
Target 9 deals with invasive alien species.

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,010
Target 20 calls for mobilization of financial
resources, while Target 2 aims at integrating

25
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,030
biodiversity into development and planning
processes.

26
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,950
Let’s look at another agreement.

27
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,770
The Ramsar Convention was adopted two decades
before the CBD, in the 1970s.

28
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,409
It focuses on a specific habitat: wetlands.

29
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,689
Ramsar includes general obligations for wise
use of all wetlands within a country.

30
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:12,000
It also establishes a list of wetlands of
international importance, to which special

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,910
management and conservation obligations apply.

32
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,260
The World Heritage Convention also creates
a list.

33
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,170
The World Heritage List includes sites of
outstanding universal value.

34
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,900
Areas of exceptional natural beauty, outstanding
geological formations, significant ecosystems

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,319
and important natural habitats can all be
listed as World Heritage Sites.

36
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,680
It also creates obligations for Parties to
protect all cultural and natural heritage

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,890
in the country, whether or not it is on the
List.

38
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,060
Why would a country want to have a site listed
as a Ramsar site or a World Heritage site?

39
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,549
What are the benefits?

40
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:53,829
There is certainly a reputational benefit,
but there are also potential economic benefits

41
00:02:53,829 --> 00:03:00,370
– a World Heritage site or Ramsar site might
attract more tourism, or more funding support.

42
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,330
Importantly, these international designations
do not protect the site by themselves.

43
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,610
Protection of these sites needs to be implemented
through national law, for example through

44
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,680
designating a site as a protected area, to
fulfil international obligations.

45
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,360
CITES – the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species – focuses on

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,100
a different aspect of conservation – addressing
international trade in species.

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,579
CITES lists species on three Appendices.

48
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:35,900
For species listed on Appendix I, like the
African Elephant, no international commercial

49
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,739
trade is allowed.

50
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,950
This means that any international trade in
elephant ivory violates CITES, with a few

51
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,110
exceptions, such as for ivory that predates
the Convention.

52
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,980
But remember, CITES only works if it is implemented
in national law.

53
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,110
Countries must create and enforce laws that
prohibit import and export of elephant ivory,

54
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,909
and effectively prosecute traffickers who
break those laws, for CITES to be effective.

55
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:08,230
The other two Appendices list species that
can be traded with appropriate permits.

56
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,180
Species listed on Appendix II, such as the
Hippopotamus, can only be traded with export

57
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,530
and import permits.

58
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,570
For species listed in Appendix III, such as
the Civet cat, only an export permit and a

59
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,750
certificate of origin are required.

60
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,830
The Appendices are reviewed regularly by the
COP, and species are added and moved.

61
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,699
To stay in compliance, countries must make
sure their national laws stay up to date.

62
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,190
One way to do this is to refer directly to
CITES in the national law.

63
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,750
For example, the Tanzania Wildlife Conservation
Act of 2009 states: “Any trade in violation

64
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,560
of CITES provisions is prohibited under this
Act and all specimens illegally traded shall

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,550
be confiscated.”

66
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:57,509
And translation into national law is only
the starting point: the law has to be enforced.

67
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,500
The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory
Species, or CMS, also includes Appendices

68
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,160
listing species, and the species listed under
CMS and those listed under CITES are not same.

69
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,009
CMS creates a framework for agreements and
Memoranda of Understanding among countries

70
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,190
where a particular species is found, or range
states.

71
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,530
It is intended to support coordination in
conservation of transboundary wildlife.

72
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,259
For example, the Gorilla Agreement aims to
conserve Gorillas across all ten range states

73
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,530
in Africa.

74
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,590
The UN Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational
uses of International Watercourses also addresses

75
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,350
the problem of conservation of a transboundary
resource.

76
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,530
Like CMS, the UN Watercourses Convention creates
a framework and principles for agreements

77
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,539
among states that share a water basin.

78
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:52,750
There are other MEAs that we could discuss
here, at the global and regional levels.

79
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,750
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change

80
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,050
are particularly relevant.

81
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,550
And there are important regional agreements
such as the African Convention on Conservation

82
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,470
of Nature and Natural Resources, and regional
seas conventions, such as the Barcelona Convention

83
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,360
for the Protection of Marine Environment and
the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean.
