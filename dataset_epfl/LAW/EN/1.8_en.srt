1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,420
Area-based regulations apply to a particular
geographical space, that you can point to

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,590
or draw on a map.

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,530
Protected areas are a primary tool for area-based
regulation.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,220
Law regulates access to protected areas, use
of protected areas and their resources, and

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,270
activities that threaten their conservation
objectives.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,019
For example, a law might regulate hunting,
possession of a firearm, or destruction of

7
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,380
habitat in a protected area.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,170
In some cases law can prohibit entry into
a protected area altogether.

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,760
How activities are regulated depends on international
obligations, conservation objectives and the

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,210
protected area category of a specific site.

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,940
For example, in a strictly protected area,
only scientific research or cultural activities

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,610
might be permitted or authorized.

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,010
Other activities might be prohibited.

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,289
In protected landscapes or seascapes, more
activities may be authorized or allowed with

15
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:07,220
a permit, including sustainable agriculture,
fishing or harvesting of forest products.

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,290
Different regulations may apply to different
zones within a single protected site.

17
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:18,380
Area-based regulation is not limited to protected
areas â€“ it can also promote connectivity

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:25,030
through conservation between and around protected
areas, and conservation at the landscape level.

19
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,820
Spatial planning or land use planning and
zoning can be tools for area-based regulation

20
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,890
both within and outside protected areas.

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,100
Legislation can create systems of permits
or concessions for activities such as mining,

22
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,829
logging or tourism.

23
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,270
Environmental impact assessment requirements
are an important tool in making decisions

24
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,049
on whether to allow activities in a particular
space.

25
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,130
Market-based measures, such as tax credits
for sustainable private land use, or direct

26
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,500
payments for ecosystem services can also be
used for area-based conservation.

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,070
Area-based regulation may be provided for
in national protected areas legislation, or

28
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,860
land use legislation.

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,930
It may also be based on forest law, wildlife
conservation law or a framework biodiversity

30
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,220
act.

31
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,120
Marine and coastal areas, as well as wetlands
may be subject to special regulations.
