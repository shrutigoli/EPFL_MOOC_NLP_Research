1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:11,330
As we mentioned in the previous sequence,
surveillance operations are subject to strategic

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,900
planning in the medium term, usually 3 years.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:24,420
The strategy can then be implemented yearly
in the form of operation plans.

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:32,040
These plans are based on relevant spatial
and temporal information collected in the

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:41,180
protected area, as well as on the careful
analysis of reports from previous patrols.

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:49,379
A surveillance strategy for each park must
be defined with the stakeholders, by strongly

7
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,879
involving field agents.

8
00:00:51,879 --> 00:01:01,339
This strategy must be very adaptable and able
to anticipate the changes in threats on the

9
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:04,590
field to avoid being stuck in “reactive”
responsiveness.

10
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:18,729
The primary objectives of patrols must be
accompanied by specific, measureable, accessible,

11
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:25,450
realistic indicators that can be achieved
in a certain time.

12
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,671
Tools can be used such as SMART (Spatial Monitoring
and Reporting Tool), a spatial monitoring

13
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:31,909
and reporting tool.

14
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:34,810
We will be looking into this later.

15
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:45,509
A system encouraging staff to achieve these
targets must be instituted to guarantee sustained

16
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:54,679
commitment of agents for the effective implementation
of the strategy.

17
00:01:54,679 --> 00:02:02,710
Then comes the patrolling, then the collect
and analysis of data collected by these patrols.

18
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:09,650
It is essential to prepare management and
participants for patrols beforehand.

19
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:19,560
This preparation ends with a short and clear
briefing of the patrol team.

20
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:27,781
Every patrol team must be led by a mission
leader with good team management and reporting

21
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,330
skills.

22
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:39,890
Personal involvement of park managers in patrols
is also a key motivation factor for agents,

23
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:46,140
and a good way to control their effectiveness.

24
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,160
In Côte d’Ivoire for example, surveillance
activities are implemented at the level of

25
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,920
the Ivorian Parks and Reserves Authority regional
head offices, in other words at a supra park

26
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,620
scale, and they are then executed at the level
of each park.

27
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:14,310
At the end of patrols, team members are debriefed
to talk about the mission, the results, difficulties

28
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:23,880
encountered, possible recommendations and
also to plan future actions.

29
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:34,150
This is also an opportunity to congratulate
agents for the effort accomplished, to potentially

30
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:42,150
award them and encourage them to pursue this
work while guiding them.

31
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:50,680
The length of patrols can change, but in practice,
it is recommended not to exceed one week because

32
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:58,540
longer patrols can be tiring and require longer
recovery time for agents, not to mention their

33
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,720
loss of motivation as days go by.

34
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,880
Surveillance patrols are dissuasive or repressive,
and often require strong presence of agents

35
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,340
on the field.

36
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:19,370
If we take the example of Côte d’Ivoire,
the types of mission that can be organised

37
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:28,090
according to the targets to achieve are:
- the standard mission done by a Mobile Brigade

38
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:34,340
or a team of sector agents (5 usually) at
a fixed station,

39
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:43,560
- the inter-unit mission which is a monitoring
activity done by at least two Mobile Brigade

40
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,150
units,
- the joint mission which is a monitoring

41
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:57,740
activity carried out by one Mobile Brigade
unit and sector agents,

42
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:06,170
- The large scale mission carried out by more
than three Mobile Brigade units over 10 days

43
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:11,010
within a large protected area like Comoé
park,

44
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:17,720
- the control mission which is an offence
verification action carried out by at least

45
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,610
5 agents after receiving a piece of information.

46
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:35,111
Tactically speaking, surveillance must be
adapted to the level of threats faced by the

47
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:36,580
park.

48
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,690
Patrols can be carried out on foot or in a
motorised vehicle (cars, motorbikes), in an

49
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,940
amphibious vehicle, or with aerial support
(helicopter, plane) thanks to an effective

50
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,240
communication system.

51
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:02,520
More and more, units specialised in the fight
against poaching are trained to face poachers

52
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,270
when a more aggressive response is required.

53
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:19,120
These units should undergo more individualised
management compared to the rest of staff,

54
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,340
but they also need training and specific equipment.

55
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:36,980
They can involve elite (forest commandos)
or specialised units (canine units).

56
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:46,810
Team mobility must always be guaranteed by
making special travelling material available.

57
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:55,070
Unit agents should stay in base camps from
where they would carry out their operations,

58
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:04,330
and relay stations near or in the protected
area can be used to conduct surveillance activities.

59
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:13,280
In some reserves, surveillance stations are
arranged to receive surveillance agents temporarily

60
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,140
in the context of a rotational system of surveillance
personnel.

61
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:29,170
Others benefit from a control room that ensures
communication with teams on the field 24 hours

62
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:37,270
a day, thereby strengthening the effectiveness
of operations.

63
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:48,560
Certain parks would rather ban any form of
fixed station as they are rapidly identified

64
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:57,570
by poachers, and agents are prone to fall
into routine or even corruption.

65
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,290
In this case, only mobile teams are kept.

66
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:11,110
All this depends of course on the context
in which you work.

67
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:19,940
In the process of surveillance operations,
useful information is collected to guide future

68
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:30,410
operations, or for investigations to catch
criminals in the act and then prosecute the

69
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,080
arrested individual.

70
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:40,119
This information also helps writing operation
reports, but also writing police reports related

71
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:47,819
to the arrested person and make them available
for the public prosecutor.

72
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:58,240
This information must be collected on files
or smartphones and added to data bases with

73
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,589
spatial references for later use.

74
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:07,250
Among these databases we can mention the SMART
software which is a spatial surveillance and

75
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:15,279
reporting tool, specially designed to assess
the effectiveness of patrols and peacekeeping.

76
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:25,660
Some protected areas with a good cell coverage
use a real time information transferring system,

77
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:36,339
combining a Cybertracker and a software that
automatically analyses data and generates

78
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:43,369
a report – this completely automates patrol
monitoring.

79
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:53,700
This software improves the quality of collected
information and its future prospective use.

80
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,189
This is key to guiding surveillance decisions.

81
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:07,769
A good geographic information system enables
the achievement of set surveillance targets.

82
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:13,369
Patrol assessement criteria can include:

83
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:19,619
- the effective presence of agents in the
park in terms of number of men per day,

84
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,619
- the coverage ratio of each protected area
having undergone patrols,

85
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,619
- the level of implication of neighbouring
populations through the amount of information

86
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,179
provided to denounce aggressions and/or initiatives
taken by communities to prevent infiltrations,

87
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:27,439
- animal flight distances or evidence proving
the presence or number of mammals which is

88
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,959
an indicator of the level of threats,
- the amount of evidence of aggression in

89
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:31,959
the protected area,
- the spatial distribution of said evidence

90
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,139
in the protected area,
- the proportion of individuals convicted

91
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,139
etc.

92
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:43,459
In the next sequence, we will look at what
material is needed to conduct effective surveillance

93
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:44,699
in a park.
