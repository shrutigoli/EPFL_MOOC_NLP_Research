- For this entire module on surveillance, you can refer to these guidelines to find more information.
- In a protected area, surveillance enables law enforcement, and it is also a key aspect of protected area management.
- Generally speaking, the protection of values involves restrictions, and these restrictions require control of what is happening onsite.
- Note that this is not a requirement and a protected area can do without surveillance if there are no coveted resources, or that that these resources do not face any particular threats.
- A category 3 protected area for example, a natural monument such as a cliff or a cave, may be protected through its lack of accessibility or because there are no exploitable resources to be found.
Of course, this is not the most frequent scenario.
- Surveillance of a protected area can be defined as the actions that are implemented to enforce the rules applying to the territory and to the resources within.
- The prosecution of criminal offenses in parks is based on legal texts such as the
Environmental Code, the Mining Code, the Water
Code and legislation on human rights.
- But as we saw in the first unit, protected areas are also governed by specific regulatory texts that should be carefully enforced.
- In general, this legal or regulatory framework is specific to a country.
There can be practical variations from one territory to the next, but the logic remains the same.
- Surveillance is carried out under the authority of the judicial power such as the Public Prosecutor and his deputies.
- It is therefore important for the park manager to work closely with these actors, and for himself to master the legal actions he can take.
- Indeed, lack of knowledge in managing the case has led many proceedings against poachers to fail.
- The police report submitted to court can be a problem if the facts arenâ€™t recounted properly, and if all the evidence gathered during surveillance isnâ€™t included.
- These reports are often the basis of the decision made by the judge, and the slightest mistake can cause the case to be dropped, especially when this mistake is a technicality.
- Another main aspect is the choice of charges, in other words, the grounds for prosecuting the offender.
- Nature conservation regulations are a good basis, but they arenâ€™t necessarily the only or most suitable framework to consider.
- For heavier sentences, it is sometimes best to refer to other regulations such as the one relative to carrying firearms, to money laundering, to tax evasion and so on.
- This can also ensure there will actually be a sentence, instead of risking dropping the case due to lack of admissible evidence or for another reason of prosecution.
- Finally, once the case has been introduced to the judicial system, it is crucial to follow up on it.
- In court, crimes related to the environment arenâ€™t usually considered a priority.
The length of proceedings can sometimes be extended indefinitely due to failure to follow up.
This results in charges being dropped because of mere court inaction.
- Failing to follow up can also lead to multiple offenders not appearing as such and facing light sentences instead of the heavier ones they deserve.
- Reports and evidence can disappear, be lost or simply never be presented to the judge.
- When investigating a case, you need to master the following aspects and there are solutions: i) a good police report, ii) a solid case and iii) a good follow-up of the investigative process.
- The most important aspect is strengthening the skills of all actors involved.
Of protected area managers of course, but also judges so that they can be aware of the seriousness of the crime committed.
- Protected area surveillance requires excellent collaboration with the Public Prosecutor and the criminal police officers.
- Guidelines can be drawn up to explain how to write a good report, and which texts to refer to if needed.
- Using the services of trained investigators can save a case from failing because of a technicality, and it will also help following up on the case throughout the proceedings.
- In these fields, some national and international
NGOs provide useful technical support â€“ the
EAGLE association we mentioned in the MOOC
GAP is a good example.
- In conclusion, letâ€™s remember that it isnâ€™t reasonable to invest a lot of means to arrest offenders in the field who will not be prosecuted anyway.
- Following the case after finding the facts can seem to be a formality that is not the managerâ€™s responsibility, but this isnâ€™t true; if the manager wants to be effective, he must, with his team, follow the case until the end.
