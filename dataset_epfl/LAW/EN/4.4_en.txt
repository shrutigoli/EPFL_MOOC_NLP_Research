Letâ€™s keep unpacking all the aspects that can impact the mission we were given.
Once again, in this MOOC we are giving the full method.
Depending on deadlines, or the lack of complexity of the mission, this systematic thought process can and must be simplified.
After the problem is comprehended, we move on to assessing the situation.
In this phase, the different aspects that must be considered are detailed, namely the five groups of factors.
The mission is the core of the thought process and must therefore also be assessed.
Its importance within the general context should be considered by comparing it with other ongoing missions.
The minimum and maximum expected results of the action must be expressed, and the level of flexibility of the mission must by questioned by listing the constraints we are bound by, and the freedom we are given.
Finally, weâ€™ll go over the possible support or partners we have.
A reflexion on legal foundations will help identify if any form of action is needed, if it actually falls under our jurisdiction.
The two basic principles of proportionality and lawfulness must be carefully followed, as well as human rights and ethics when the situation might compromise them.
Deadlines are often a huge constraint.
All the time-related elements at hand must be identified, such as the possible time the adverse action would happen, the pace at which the situation is expected to evolve, when my possible back-up will show up, when it is expected from me to implement the action and when it is expected I would achieve the set target.
To know how to act, it is important to know how the sector of engagement is set.
This concerns its size and distance from our own departure base, as well as the state of the field, if it is a built-up zone, if there are any roads or inhabitants.
The weather is also considered, as well as communication networks, natural or manufactured obstacles and the possibility to set up a command post.
Will the action take place at night or during daytime?
In short, this includes all the practical aspects of the field in which youâ€™ll have to venture and the means you will have to deploy to facilitate the action.
Whether you are confronted to a human adversary or a catastrophic situation, it is important to imagine all the possibilities the situation can evolve towards, all the possible risks.
Ideally, list all these risks so that they can later be confronted with our solutions to minimize them.
It is important not to understand â€œadversaryâ€� as â€œenemyâ€� in the narrow sense of the word.
Consider a victim for instance: they are not an adversary, but will be taken care of concretely and constitute a task to fulfil.
So, anything that will require some sort of action on our part must be imagined using the following lingo: opposing party.
Analysing a risk and assessing its importance can be done by relying on the risk matrix.
The green part relates to the risks considered insignificant, that wonâ€™t require specific measures, except maybe a follow up on the situation.
The yellow part relates to risks requiring measures with a debatable scope.
The red part is about risks with a high probability of having grave consequences - these must be a priority until they are solved.
This step of risk assessment can be summarised as follows: what is the most likely adverse situation that could happen?
Which one is the most dangerous?
A simple method to assess our own means is to confront every adverse risk with one or more possible actions on our part.
This makes the thought process more concrete.
It doesnâ€™t exclude listing our own possibilities as such and not only as a tool for reaction.
The state of staff and management, available equipment and possible back up teams, are part of this assessment factor.
At this point, we should be able to tell if our means are adapted to the situation to handle.
And at any point of the situation assessment, based on the identified problems, new immediate measures can be ordered and the schedule can be adapted.
