When we talk about law, we also need to talk about institutions.
Institutions are involved in making and implementing law at every level.
There are different types of institutions involved in law and governance.
Sometimes these are classified as legislative, executive and judicial institutions.
Legislative institutions create law.
At the national level, a congress or parliament might be the legislative institution.
At the local level, a city, community or tribal council can perform legislative functions.
Executive institutions implement and enforce law.
The chief executive of a country is normally the president or prime minister.
Government ministries and agencies, including law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, are also part of the executive branch.
Judicial institutions, namely courts, interpret law and resolve disputes.
Courts can exist at different levels and in different types of legal system, and they may have authority, or jurisdiction, over different subjects.
The lines between legislative, executive and judicial institutions are often blurred.
Executive institutions can create legal rules through agency regulation, described below.
Judicial courts also create law, particularly in common law countries where judicial decisions have precedential value.
Institutional responsibility may be divided by sector, particularly within the executive.
There may be different agencies responsible for agriculture, water, forests, fisheries, etc.
This can create problems, particularly where environmental systems or challenges implicate more than one sector.
For example, a mangrove forest may come under the authority of forest, coastal, marine, or freshwater agencies; or may fall into a gap where no agency gives it enough attention.
