Developing and publishing codes or charters are some of the tools an organisation can use to communicate on its activities and work.
These codes are destined to the general public, but also to the staff and leaders of the institution in charge of drawing them up.
Here we are going to explain the logical way of achieving these texts, namely based on the notions of values and norms.
The idea is also to give these documents the right size so that they are read and understood by all.
Remember, each individual has his own personal values.
In principle, when joining an organisation, a person also accepts the values within.
This is the only condition that will enable this agent to act in the way intended by the organisation.
If the personal value system of the individual is too different from the values of the organisation he joined, difficulties will emerge.
Itâ€™s the case of A in the picture here, where the personal values seem way off the professional values of the organisation.
B will do better.
For this reason, the organisation must clearly display its professional values.
Thereby, the values of the organisation and of the people working within it are visible to all.
This also helps people who may be interested in joining the organisation to see, beforehand, if these professional values arenâ€™t in conflict with their own personal values.
As weâ€™ve see, ethics define the ideal of a profession.
The agent must recognise himself in his employerâ€™s code of ethics.
We also remember that in a code of ethics, ideas of loyalty, honesty and impartiality are stated.
So how do you move from a code of ethics to a code of deontology?
This is done by stating a companyâ€™s operational standards, which stem from the values given in the code of ethics.
You could say for example: â€œthe employee canâ€™t accept personal gifts for the execution of a specific task related to his work.â€� â€œthe employee is held by official secrecy in all circumstancesâ€� â€œthe agent treats every person he interacts with fairly, irrespective of race, sex or religion.â€�
There are still two important elements that will guarantee the success of these codes.
First, as the codes are intended for the agents themselves, they must be concise.
Avoid adding too many pages and articles.
The values must be limited to one page, as the deontology will be more comprehensive.
If you want it to be read by the right people, limit the number of pages to only hold vital information.
Ideally, create a pocket format, a kind of pocket card, that everybody can carry with them.
The second element is participation.
These codes mustnâ€™t be be an expression of the power or direction set by the higher levels of hierarchy.
Everybody must be able to recognise themselves in these texts.
Thus, code of ethics and deontology writing committees must gather people of all hierarchical levels, including trade unions and minorities.
This certainly complicates the writing process, but, in the end, the published texts will be accepted by all the people involved.
The content can be very different from one organisation to the next.
However, the following topics are usually included:
The behaviour that all employees are expected to conform to.
Leaders responsibility.
They must give clear orders, respect legislation and the codes that have been set.
Employee rights, namely regarding refusal to submit to illegal orders.
The guarantee that the organisation does its best to ensure proper training for agents, and thereby enabling them to act in the best way possible, with comprehensive and recognised professional skills.
Thatâ€™s it for the important part!
