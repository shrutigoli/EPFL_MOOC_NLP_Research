Here we are at the last step of our thinking process leading to establishing orders.
Remember: the goal of the entire process is to give clear written or verbal orders.
The process that we just went over, provides all the elements you need for this.
Letâ€™s see how.
In my country, we would generally consider an order in 5 points.
Letâ€™s see what they contain.
Letâ€™s start with orientation.
Orientation gives indications on :
-The situation and possible developments,
-Risks associated with the adverse party and its own possibilities or means,
-The missions received by the superior level of hierarchy, respectively the mission that you give yourself facing a situation that occurs or evolves,
-Support from non-subordinate partners that you may have.
- All these elements exist, because information was collected and analysed in the problem comprehension and situation assessment phases.
From these two steps, we gather relevant information to explain the decision.
What about intention ?
In short, the person responsible for an operation explains what he wants to do, how, and what the means and deadlines are.
Terminology must be concise and illustrative.
The total explanation must be summarised so that everybody understands what the common goal to achieve is.
This is maybe the hardest thing to write down, as ideally, you should try to be as comprehensive as possible using only few words, as Iâ€™m trying to show here.
And the missions.
A mission is assigned to each subordinate, whether it is a colleague by himself, or a group with a designated leader.
The mission is compulsory, and binding.
However, subordinates must always be given some flexibility so that they can adapt to unforeseen circumstances.
Again, the mission must be described concisely and precisely.
Special requirements are part of the category we could call "miscellaneousâ€�.
The following information is indicated in this category: The time and place of meeting for the beginning of the action ; The possible end of action (what time and under whose orders)
; The radio channels that will be used and/or contact information of people involved ; Equipment required per individual (weapon or not, winter attire, helmet, etc.)
;Special guidelines like the rule about weapon usage and other means of defence ;The behaviour to have with people encountered, this is where human rights and ethics are mentioned ; Rules of communication with the media ; Administrative rules like working time or possible benefits
; Housing details and supplies for a durable commitment.
Finally, letâ€™s talk about locations:
In principle, at least the location and the contact information of the leader must appear here.
The possible location of command facilities is also noted, in other words the command post along with the contact information.
Verbal or written orders?
All orders mustnâ€™t necessarily be written down.
For complex operations, with higher risks, written orders help guarantee everyone has the same information.
If the matter goes wrong, the subordinates will be able to state they acted based on the orders they were given.
It is a form of protection.
Facing the population and public authorities, this helps showing management professionalism, in the way they comprehend the problem and assess the situation.
Different words can be considered to identify types of orders.
Each organisation can create its own classification.
A general order could be about the organisation of the company or institutionâ€™s structure.
An operational order will directly be about a concrete engagement.
A prior order can help to give immediate measures or advise different actors involved of an operation to come.
Here, letâ€™s give organisations the freedom to choose their own terminology.
To establish standard behaviours within an organisation, we can give a general order.
We can also draw up a practical document, in pocket-format, that gives basic rules that everybody must follow.
These rules of engagement frame the use of coercion, force, and therefore the use of weapons.
They also provide the legal bases to follow, namely Human rights.
This is particularly useful when the organisation is supported by people with different philosophies, for instance, when the police is supported by the military, whose rules on weapon usage are slightly different.
Rules of engagement can be permanent or written down specifically for a particular operation.
At the end of these sequences, we can ask why we have to go through this entire process.
Well, as weâ€™ve said, this helps to prove the professionalism of people writing the orders, and it also helps subordinates knowing precisely what is expected of them.
In the end, everyone is more comfortable during the action.
Obviously, when the situation is simple, an order can simply be a: "goal, way towards the goal, behaviour at the goalâ€�.
Especially when the action is immediate on the field.
At this point, reflexion is secondary, so risks are greater.
Taking time for reflexion is never lost time.
