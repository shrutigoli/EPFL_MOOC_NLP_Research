00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:05,470
- Hello Philippe.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,840
- Hi Geoffroy
- In the previous module, we talked about

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,960
work ethics, and now, we are going to be looking
at corruption.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,600
Corrupt government officials often make the
news, but what does it really mean?

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,009
- There is a general language misuse around
the word "corrupt” or “corruption”.

6
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:33,340
From a strictly legal point of view, corruption
is a specific criminal offense with clearly

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,800
defined legal implications.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,250
We will talk about this in the next sequence.

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,550
- But indeed, we do describe people abusing
their State power as being “corrupt”.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,190
These “corrupt” officials can steal, divert
money, scam, defraud and bribe.

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:57,829
This language misuse is rather convenient
as it clearly holds state or semi-public officials

12
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:00,579
responsible for any legal failure.

13
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:07,119
- So basically, we need to make a difference
between the common use of the word corruption

14
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,270
and its legal definition?

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,439
- Exactly.

16
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,609
For instance, if a state official in charge
of patrols prefers hiding in a quiet place

17
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:22,900
so he doesn’t get tired, his behaviour would
be questionable from an ethical perspective,

18
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,200
but he hasn’t really committed any concrete
criminal offense.

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:35,939
You can call him depraved, lazy, but he certainly
isn’t corrupt.

20
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,430
- So why does this notion of "corruption”
in its everyday use find itself associated

21
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,049
with so many illegal activities related to
government work?

22
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:50,659
- Let’s just say that it’s an oversimplification.

23
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:57,739
The reason why this language misuse has won
over the media and the people is clear: it

24
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:04,479
gives us one word to describe the fact that
somebody has serious shortcomings, and deserves

25
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,840
to be sanctioned for it.

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,720
But from a strictly legal perspective, a corrupt
person must be found guilty of corruption.

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,140
- Is corruption present all over the world?

28
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,670
- Unfortunately, yes, no country has been
spared.

29
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:28,790
For example, the corruption perceptions index
of Transparency International places Switzerland,

30
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,250
where I used to work, in a rather flattering
position.

31
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,209
But this doesn’t mean there is absolutely
no corruption.

32
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:44,140
I’ve actually had the chance to investigate
this matter, mainly on cases related to public

33
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,519
procurement awards, but also to bribes paid
to other countries to facilitate the conclusion

34
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,739
of commercial contract.

35
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,990
- Nobody is immune to it.

36
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,400
How can you detect criminal behaviour and
fight it?

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,290
This is what we will be looking at in the
coming sequences.

38
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,310
- First, we will see the different classifications
of offense that can be committed in the professional

39
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,189
environment, and we’ll explain what corruption
is.

40
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:23,670
- Then, we will be looking at some principles
that dictate the operations of organisations….and

41
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,060
reasons that can lead to corruption.

42
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:35,129
- After this, we will talk about the solutions
to reduce, unfortunately not eliminate, corruption

43
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:42,249
within organisations
- or on a personal level.

44
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:48,060
- Finally, we will talk about how corruption
can damage reputations, as it was the case

45
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,219
for the FIFA recently.

46
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,780
- A good legal and criminal overview ahead!

47
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,079
Have a great week.
