1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:10,330
Intelligence plays a key role in planning
and implementing surveillance activities.

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:15,990
Information is indeed key to improving law
enforcement.

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,540
It helps to implement a preventive strategy,
planning and implementing better targeted

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:28,720
operations and carrying out more effective
cases against criminals.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,540
However, the implementation and operation
of an effective intelligence system in protected

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,840
areas are often defective.

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:47,350
Intelligence must be conducted by dedicated
units, with personnel who is able to collect

8
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:55,710
and analyse data on crimes related to wild
species, and with all the technical, technological

9
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,160
and financial means at hand to effectively
accomplish their mission.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,050
It is essential to work with the police and
other State security services to exchange

11
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:16,109
information useful to the investigation, as
well as getting support from NGOs or other

12
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,100
local community organisations.

13
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:27,109
Data collection relies on a discreetly managed
network of informants who remain anonymous

14
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,950
for their own protection.

15
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:37,069
These individuals are usually from the neighbouring
communities, but can really be any person

16
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:42,509
who has information (poachers, agents, merchants,
tourists etc.).

17
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:51,149
A system of incentives must encourage the
sharing of information: a financial or in-kind

18
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,329
award can be given to the person who helped
arresting the criminal.

19
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:02,649
In Côte d’Ivoire, if an information has
helped arresting a poacher, the informant

20
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:09,970
gets a financial compensation only if the
poacher is sentenced in court.

21
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:18,019
In such a system, proceedings must be carried
out until the end, with a solid case that

22
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,810
would not allow the defendant to be freed.

23
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:31,120
The system of incentives must therefore encourage
the provision of relevant information, especially

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,580
coming from people specialised in the matter.

25
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,590
If the award isn’t encouraging enough, the
risk is that informants give information on

26
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,819
agent plans to poachers or gold diggers.

27
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:52,700
Once collected, the information must be put
in a data base where they can be consulted

28
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,010
and analysed to plan patrols.

29
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,310
When there is a lot of information, it is
recommended to use specialised software, or

30
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,489
to make them more available to all levels
of park management.

31
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:15,480
Otherwise, in most cases, a table or a database
like Microsoft Access is enough.

32
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:23,099
A good intelligence system helps to collect
evidence better, and aims at officially prosecuting

33
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,730
the offender.

34
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,890
In some countries, when guards have found
a crime scene (and secured it), an investigative

35
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,870
unit specialised in environmental crimes is
in charge of carrying out investigations in

36
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,970
partnership with the police if needed.

37
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,501
This is the case in Kruger National Park in
South Africa, where agents collect and manage

38
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:53,049
all the evidence to build solid and effective
investigative cases.

39
00:03:53,049 --> 00:04:01,760
Thereby, intelligence must also be subject
to standard operational proceedings to guide

40
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,180
the collection and the treatment of evidence
by investigators, as well as actions of different

41
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,310
actors before patrols.

42
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:16,890
Even though it is often neglected, intelligence
is a key factor of patrolling success, and

43
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:24,660
a relevant way to lower costs by allowing
better targeted and more suitable planning.

44
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:34,720
Studies have shown that informed patrols have
30 times more chances to find poachers than

45
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,000
simple patrols carried out at random.
