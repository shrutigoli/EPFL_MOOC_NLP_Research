1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:10,190
So far we’ve talked about regulation defined
by what it’s trying to protect – a particular

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,250
species or place.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,650
Now we turn to regulation that addresses a
specific activity or threat, regardless of

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,250
where it is carried out or what species it
affects.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,310
We’ve already discussed some mechanisms
used to regulate activities.

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,079
For example, hunting licenses may be required
in specific areas, or when hunting specific

7
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,160
species.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,110
However, regulations on hunting may not be
limited to protected areas or endangered species.

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,540
Many jurisdictions have general hunting regulations
that set out processes for licensing and prohibit

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,580
certain methods or equipment.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,550
Similarly activities that affect specific
ecosystems, such as dredging or filling wetlands,

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,240
may be regulated generally, wherever that
ecosystem is found, whether or not it is in

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,100
a protected area.

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,220
Or there may be general standards for activities
such as mining or logging practices to reduce

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,900
environmental impact.

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,729
One of the most familiar forms of threat-based
regulation is pollution control.

17
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:18,810
Human activity always affects the environment
– this is unavoidable.

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,520
Regulation must determine what level of impact
is acceptable.

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,290
It must balance the desire for innovation
and development with the need for sustainability.

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,630
It must also be able to adapt to changing
technology.

21
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:38,609
The simplest standard is a quota, cap or load
– a number that describes how much pollution

22
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:44,460
can go into the air, water, ground or atmosphere,
or how much of a resource can be taken out

23
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,259
of the environment.

24
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,619
A standard based on a specific quota can be
inflexible.

25
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:54,789
Alternative types of standards can be used
to respond to changing technology, or create

26
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,520
incentives for pollution reduction.

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,469
One common example is a standard based on
“best available technology” or “best

28
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:04,899
available practices”.

29
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:09,350
This standard requires operators to use the
best methods available to limit pollution,

30
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,340
emissions or other environmental impact.

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,010
In many cases it is qualified – operators
may not be required to immediately adopt any

32
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:24,130
new technology if it is prohibitively expensive
or otherwise unreasonable.

33
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,909
A common criticism of the “best available
technology” standard is that it can reduce

34
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:34,340
incentives for innovation, since any company
that develops improvements to reduce impact

35
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,909
will be creating a new legal requirement for
itself and the rest of the industry.

36
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:44,310
On the other hand, it can create a protection
for companies that do innovate, since their

37
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,989
competitors will be held to the same technological
standard.

38
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:54,220
Another option is to couple a cap or quota
with a trading scheme.

39
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,430
For example, polluters that exceed their quota
may be able to buy credits from others that

40
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,090
emit less.

41
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,840
This can create an incentive to improve environmental
practices, since companies can sell the credits

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,090
that they don’t use.

43
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,209
You can also find trading schemes in the context
of biodiversity.

44
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,980
Many governments have adopted a policy of
“no net loss” for wetlands, forests or

45
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,569
biodiversity.

46
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:22,140
Where this applies, operators may be able
to offset activities that cause loss in one

47
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,700
area by restoring or protecting a similar
ecosystem in another.

48
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,800
In the context of climate change, emissions
trading has created a global market for carbon

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
offsets.

50
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,379
Many of these offsets come from projects in
the developing world.

51
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:43,269
This offsetting raises complicated legal questions,
such as who owns carbon, who can sell it and

52
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:45,180
who can benefit?

53
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,909
It also creates opportunities for fraud and
corruption.

54
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:54,980
Taxes, such as a carbon tax or a pollution
tax, can be an alternative to direct regulation

55
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,019
or tradeable permits.

56
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:03,030
Taxes are one of the most efficient types
of market-based measures for regulating activities.

57
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,970
Another common tool in activity-based regulation
is the environmental impact assessment or

58
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,930
EIA.

59
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,079
Most countries have some form of environmental
impact assessment for activities that may

60
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,880
cause damage to the environment.

61
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,390
Some activities always require an EIA.

62
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,560
Others may be triggered by a specific threshold,
such as where an activity is likely to have

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,100
a significant adverse effect on biodiversity
or the natural environment.

64
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,660
The EIA process should be transparent, and
include opportunities for public comment on

65
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,979
the proposed activity.

66
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:43,010
All activity or threat-based regulation has
to deal with the question of how to evaluate

67
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,069
risk.

68
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:48,970
It can be hard to quantify the amount of harm
that will be caused by an activity in advance,

69
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,200
when deciding whether to allow it.

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,139
Sometimes it is only possible to say that
there is a certain chance of a certain level

71
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,350
of harm.

72
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,569
Regulation can provide methods to assess and
manage risk, and establish thresholds for

73
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,940
what levels of risk are acceptable.

74
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,280
They also provide for what happens if the
disaster or emergency actually happens: how

75
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,200
to respond, and who bears the cost.

76
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,319
This can give rise to legal liability.
