1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,059
We’ve seen what a behaviour respecting a
certain work ethic looks like.

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:16,360
We’ve also mentioned the legal questions
regarding offences committed in the work environment,

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,050
namely corruption.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,329
One thing that each and every one must include
in their reflection at all levels of leadership

5
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:30,980
is the great risk of damage to a reputation
these failures can present.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,929
We’ve seen how to include the Cohen and
Feldberg principles to an organisation’s

7
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:38,929
governance.

8
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:43,050
But this relates to the situation where everything
goes well.

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,800
What happens when it doesn’t?

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,839
Recently, in Europe, there was a scandal about
a German car manufacturers who cheated their

11
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:55,970
diesel engine tests.

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:01,739
The question isn’t if you are for or against
diesel engines, that’s not the point.

13
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:09,940
The question is, how are our choices as consumers
free and informed if the factors supporting

14
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,580
them are forged by manufacturer?

15
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,520
Fundamentally, the damage is done.

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,360
Even if the car manufacturers do everything
they can to fix the mistakes, the reputation

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,280
of their companies are affected.

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:34,240
The offence is, obviously, criminal, but the
real problem started with a distorted ethical

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,640
reflection.

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,330
The same goes for this Peruvian policeman.

21
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:46,410
His behaviour made public discredits him AND
his corporation.

22
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:53,510
Even if this is an isolated case, the story
will spread and inevitably shed doubts over

23
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,940
his organisation and his entire profession,
or even all Peruvian public officials.

24
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:05,020
In the streets you’ll probably often hear
people say: “they’re all corrupt”.

25
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:12,709
These two examples give us an idea of the
consequences related to the failure of a senior

26
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:19,030
executive, like in the example of diesel,
or the regular employee like with the Peruvian.

27
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:25,599
Above all, we must realise that each person
within the organisation holds the same responsibility

28
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,189
and can trigger the same consequences.

29
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:36,139
Everyone within the organisation, whatever
their rank, should care about its image and

30
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,139
reputation.

31
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,659
The consequences of such failures are easily
identifiable.

32
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:49,859
Damaged reputations involve loss of confidence
and of respect from the population, the litigants

33
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,499
and the authorities.

34
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:58,390
Who would call on a government organisation
if the behaviour of its members is considered

35
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,390
unreliable?

36
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:07,209
This will create great distrust from the people
towards the ones supposed to serve them.

37
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:13,590
Also, if the organisation finds out it is
susceptible to external corruptors, internal

38
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:21,049
controls must be intensified, and will limit
employees liberty.

39
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:29,000
From a personal perspective, the individual
exposes himself to prosecution and internal

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,489
administrative proceedings.

41
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:36,160
He is at risk of dismissal and possible lawsuits
for damages.

42
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,769
He will lose his job and will have to explain
to his future employer why he left his previous

43
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:43,769
job.

44
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,090
These situations raise questions about the
gifts from private individuals to government

45
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,160
organisations.

46
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,781
At what point are these gifts no longer signs
of friendship and attention, but direct or

47
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:56,781
indirect payments?

48
00:03:56,781 --> 00:04:00,950
It is about paying attention to the hidden
compensations.

49
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:09,109
It’s important to anticipate the donors’
expectations in future interventions.

50
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:14,969
Operational choices could be influenced by
such or such litigant who is more generous

51
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:17,459
and friendly than others.

52
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,370
A failure at that level will have the same
consequences as in the diesel example or of

53
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,419
the Peruvian police officer.

54
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:32,569
Moreover, this would cause major reputation
damages.

55
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:43,000
Thus, internal regulations must deal with
the principles of accepting gifts or benefits

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
in kind.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,030
In conclusion, we’ll once again notice the
importance of training associates and managers.

58
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:56,500
This training must cover all these aspects,
technical but also ethical, deontological

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,460
and legal.

60
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,530
The individual’s survival is at stake.

61
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:09,590
We can consider that training in general,,
and trainings on ethics in particular, enables

62
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:16,090
the survival of an individual or the organisation
tactically and non-tactically.

63
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:24,310
Tactical survival is ensured by work skills
that are mastered through proper training.

64
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:31,440
It will enable the associate to survive practically
in his daily activity, to not be killed or

65
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,310
injured.

66
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,509
Non-tactical survival is based on social skills,
and will enable the individual to survive

67
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:48,050
in his job, without being dismissed for misconduct.

68
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,710
These two elements have long been considered
by the police and the military as opposed.

69
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,490
According to me, they are complementary and
go hand in hand.
