1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,930
New technologies can improve the effectiveness
of law enforcement in protected areas.

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:16,270
There is enormous unexplored potential, but
this sequence will only provide a short overview

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,779
of what is already out there.

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:27,450
Have a look at these websites to find out
more, especially on the WCPA website which

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,119
has a working group on new technologies.

6
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:39,289
So let’s focus on a couple of the most commonly
used solutions.

7
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:45,449
One vital aspect of these technologies is
their ability to connect with each other and

8
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:48,600
create a rapid flow of information.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,110
Thereby providing a proper response in due
time.

10
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:00,359
This is a limiting factor in remote areas
where there is no cellular network.

11
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:08,970
But there are always relay solutions based
on private radio networks, or other technologies

12
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,080
like drones or satellites.

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,910
Another key aspect is data treatment automation
that frees up time for practical action.

14
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:30,670
This is based on the development of softwares
that can do a job better and faster than a

15
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,750
person would.

16
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,030
They can, for example, analyse hundreds of
hours of video to find a specific animal in

17
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,830
just a couple of minutes.

18
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:48,140
On this basis: 1- connectivity and 2- automation.

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,970
Many solutions are being developed.

20
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:56,570
They aim at protecting a territory or a species,
improving surveillance practices and tools,

21
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:05,230
reinforcing detection, information and communication
abilities as well, and ranger or visitor safety.

22
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:13,210
At a larger scale, satellites can be used
for surveillance…

23
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,870
namely by detecting changes in the habitat
or forest fires,

24
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:26,720
by monitoring a species equipped with a transmitter,
and even detect deep sea fishing.

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,790
One example of practical use is the cybertracker.

26
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:38,140
It is based on the GPS system which gives
the exact location of where the infringement

27
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:48,830
was detected – it is used in addition to
software such as SMART.

28
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,310
Closer to the ground, the use of drones is
spreading.

29
00:02:52,310 --> 00:03:01,570
They are equipped with detectors, and can
virtually search and find anything you want.

30
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,840
They can have rotary wings, in which case
they are generally used to explore certain

31
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,610
perimeters with relatively low autonomy.

32
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:16,920
They can also have fixed wings, and in this
case, they are able to cover hundreds of hectares.

33
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,460
this is especially the case for solar-powered
models.

34
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:30,130
These drones can also be a relay for information
transmission when there is no connectivity

35
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,660
in the park.

36
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:40,360
For example, by overflying camera traps daily,
and by downloading the data obtained.

37
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,450
Even closer to the ground, sensors can be
deployed.

38
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,630
They would capture the information and transmit
it.

39
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,720
A good example are the camera traps which
we talked about in the MOOC on ecological

40
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:01,800
monitoring, which can be connected to a base
that receives all the images and videos.

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:10,530
A simple recognition software would then directly
process the photos and videos and extract

42
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:20,220
the ones, for example, where a human is detected
to immediately inform the anti-poaching patrol.

43
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:28,020
Acoustic transmitters can also be used – they
detect chainsaws, gun shots, human voices

44
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,520
or engine sounds.

45
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,990
They inform rangers in real time with the
exact location of the sound through simple

46
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,850
triangulation.

47
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,419
Sensors detect the vibrations on the ground
and send notifications when a vehicle drives

48
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,419
by.

49
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:53,980
The vehicle would then be followed by a drone
for identification, then by a patrol to arrest

50
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,330
the intruder.

51
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:04,330
Infra-red cameras placed at park access-points
detect body heat at night.

52
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:11,050
A recognition software will then distinguish
human from animal shapes, and alert security

53
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,050
rangers.

54
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:19,270
Nowadays, there are mobile towers thanks to
which these cameras can be moved when needed,

55
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,350
and elevated to enable a better coverage of
the area.

56
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:33,250
There are more and more solutions that contribute
to daily animal protection.

57
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:40,270
Tracking collars, radios, GPSs and satellites
adapt to large species.

58
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:49,310
Not only do they track their movements, but
also their biological parameters which detects

59
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,520
periods of stress to enable immediate action.

60
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:02,460
The same goes for microchips that can be implanted
to many animal or plant species such as a

61
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,380
tree trunk,
so that the day this tree is cut down and

62
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:13,080
moved, the chip will follow the movement of
the trunk and its location by sending notifications

63
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,759
through the cellular network.

64
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:23,949
Elephant collars, rhino bracelets, tags for
birds, chips on trees, drones for mapmaking,

65
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:30,750
radars for surveillance, specialised sensors
to detect movement, sound and heat, software

66
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,870
adapted to smartphones…

67
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:39,680
All these solutions already exist in the field
in Africa, and are being tested in Namibia,

68
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,360
Malawi, Kenya, South Africa, Burkina Faso,
Benin etc.

69
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:55,580
At another scale, DNA analysis during seizures,
wherever they occur, can trace back to when

70
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,270
the crime was committed, thanks to a worldwide
coded database of the different species.

71
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:10,490
This way, the point of origin of a rhino horn
or a shark fin can be found!

72
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:18,690
Science-fiction or near future, some projects
are developing mimetic robots that can place

73
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:26,000
automated guards near species for 24/7 protection
on the ground.

74
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,720
Possibilities are countless, and this already
shakes up law enforcement methods in protected

75
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:33,810
areas.
