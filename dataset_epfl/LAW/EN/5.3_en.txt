- Field surveillance in a protected area relies on different stakeholders with complementary missions.
Once again, find more information by having a look at these guidelines.
- Sworn officials are in charge of implementing police actions.
They are usually recruited at a national level, especially in State-governed protected areas.
-These agents must be selected according to strict criteria: physical fitness, endurance, ability to live in difficult conditions but also mental capacities and especially their love for teamwork and ability to follow rules.
- To choose the right selection criteria, it is important to have identified the needs you intend to cover.
- The idea isnâ€™t necessarily to look for qualified people or for people with specific knowledge, but rather finding individuals with the ability to work in a field that can sometimes be very tough.
- Enthusiasm for nature conservation should be part of the qualities, otherwise staff rapidly loses their motivation.
- The selection process should also identify field experience, like some people growing up in rural areas which can be a great asset for daily activities.
- Then they must undergo proper training that is adapted to the context of the protected area, like the fight against poaching for example.
There are guidelines explaining the details of this type of training.
- This practical training should cover all the aspects of the rangerâ€™s future missions, and if possible, be carried out in the protected area heâ€™s been assigned to.
This way, his training can target effective actions.
- Beyond the initial training, it is important to maintain a training cycle to face the evolution of means, but also of threats and of the context.
Over time, this can also be a source of motivation for rangers and a way to maintain team unity.
- It is important to carefully consider the number of agents to send out to properly face the intensity and the dispersal of threats inside the park.
- Some numbers are often suggested, going from one agent for 1000 ha to 5000 ha, depending on the intensity of threats, on the type of ecosystem and the evolution of obtained results.
There is no absolute rule, the important thing is to adapt.
- For example, in Tai National Park, there are around 90 agents for 500,000 ha, in other words 1 agent for 6000 ha.
This is quite a low number given the park is mostly a forest.
- Often times, we try to complement the national personnel pool with local agents with more direct operational skills.
- These would usually be members of local community that play different roles in patrolling teams.
They are often called eco-rangers or eco-volunteers.
- Some are used as trackers or guides, by making use of their skills in detecting signs of poaching.
- Others carry out camping tasks, by transporting supplies and preparing meals.
In Tai, there would be around 1 eco-ranger for 2 agents per patrolling team.
- Other village stakeholders contribute more directly to the enforcement of laws, by reporting those who commissioned the crime.
- They would then receive bonuses for every piece of information that led to finding a crime or to the arrest of the commissioner.
We will see this in sequence 5.6.
- Patrol leaders are just as important as rangers and eco-rangers.
They lead surveillance operations on the ground and work towards achieving the targets set by the mission.
- They must be carefully chosen and the criteria must include personal management skills, good ethics, excellent experience in the work they need to carry out, and having received proper training for the mission.
- The patrol leader can be formally designated or changed from one patrol to the next.
In any case, he must have respect for and confidence in his staff.
- Obviously, other bodies of public forces can be solicited to bring their support and expertise to deal with situations that exceed rangersâ€™ capabilities.
- This can be the Police force in the case of certain legal proceedings, or the army when the threat requires stronger intervention.
- Regardless, the persons in charge of surveillance must have authority and responsibility over surveillance so that the work can be carried out effectively and fully assessed afterwards
