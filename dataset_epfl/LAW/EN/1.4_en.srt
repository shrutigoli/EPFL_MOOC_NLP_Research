1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,490
Governance is a key part of conservation that
is closely associated with law.

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,750
So what is governance?

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,320
Governance can be defined as “The interactions
among structures, processes and traditions

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,679
that determine how power and responsibilities
are exercised, how decisions are taken and

5
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,130
how citizens or other stakeholders have their
say.”

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,689
Law creates the basic frameworks and tools
for governance.

7
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:34,870
In other words, law creates the rules for
exercising power and authority and ensuring

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,160
accountability.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,200
Governance also describes processes for making
and implementing laws.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,610
Many actors are involved in these processes.

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,450
We can talk about two dimensions of governance:
governance type and governance quality.

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:55,140
There are different types of governance system,
depending on who makes decisions and how.

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,770
For example, in the context of protected areas,
there are four main types of governance:

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,780
First, governance by government describes
a situation where the government makes decisions

15
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,870
and exercises authority.

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,400
This does not mean there is no participation
of relevant stakeholders or the public, but

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,850
the final decision rests with the government.

18
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,570
The legal framework designates and empowers
the appropriate government agency, and creates

19
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,290
processes and guidelines for decision-making
and management.

20
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,240
It determines the amount of discretion the
government agency can exercise in carrying

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,120
out its mandate.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,729
Second, private governance describes governance
by a private entity, such as an individual,

23
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,520
corporation or private association.

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,830
Around the world there are many examples of
private protected areas.

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:47,200
Often these are the result of private landowners
voluntarily committing their land for conservation,

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,970
for altruistic or business reasons, and seeking
the appropriate designation and support.

27
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,980
Private protected areas are most effective
when recognized by law.

28
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,770
Clear and specific legal provisions should
provide frameworks and standards for private

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,200
conservation activities.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,700
Legal recognition of private protected areas
creates both incentives and accountability

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,399
for voluntary conservation.

32
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,060
A third form of governance is governance by
indigenous peoples or local communities.

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,980
Indigenous peoples and local communities may
have ownership or governance rights over their

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,450
territory as a matter of law, set out in the
constitution, national legislation, or a treaty

35
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,319
with the national government.

36
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,730
Alternatively, the government may delegate
governance of a specific area to an indigenous

37
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,040
community through a contract or regulation.

38
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,790
In some cases, indigenous peoples or local
communities exercise de facto governance over

39
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,470
territory where they do not have formally
recognized rights, but like private governance,

40
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,470
indigenous or community governance is most
effective when it is strongly backed by law.

41
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,569
Finally, a significant amount of conservation
governance today is shared governance.

42
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,880
Governance authority may be shared between
a state and a private entity, indigenous or

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,660
local community, or another state.

44
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,910
These arrangements should be legally formalized
with clear definition of how power is shared

45
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,459
and how decisions will be made.

46
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,560
There are certain basic standards that apply
to all types of governance.

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,849
We call these the elements of good governance.

48
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:22,400
There is no universally agreed definition
of good governance, but in general it is governance

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
that demonstrates fairness, legitimacy and
accountability.

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,709
Key requirements for good governance include
participation, transparency, predictability,

51
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,410
equity and access to justice.

52
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,880
Good governance is closely associated with
the concept of rule of law.

53
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,209
Good governance is predicated on legal frameworks
that contain strong and appropriate substantive

54
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,940
and procedural elements.

55
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,709
Law should protect and respect human rights
and principles of non-discrimination and fairness.

56
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,659
For example, many constitutions list fundamental
rights such as the right to property or the

57
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:03,050
right to equal treatment regardless of religion,
race or gender.

58
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:08,380
Law should also create processes and obligations
to ensure transparency and provide opportunities

59
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,060
for meaningful participation and use of the
legal system.

60
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,989
For example, national legislation often provides
for access to government information, or requires

61
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,060
a notice and comment period for new government
rules.

62
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:28,290
Some people are beginning to discuss a third
dimension of governance: governance vitality.

63
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,050
Governance vitality would go beyond the requirements
of good governance, and describe the wisdom,

64
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,880
vision, adaptability and resilience of governance
actors and processes.
