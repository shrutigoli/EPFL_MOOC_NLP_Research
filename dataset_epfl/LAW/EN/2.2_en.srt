1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,860
Let’s start by determining why the legal
aspect of official agents’ activity within

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,490
a state or a semi-public organisation is essential.

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:21,290
Every worker, regardless of his field, acquires
technical knowledge that is specific to his

4
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,320
activity.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,800
This stems from his specific vocational training,
and his likely previous vocational and academic

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
training.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,320
This knowledge is required to complete the
tasks of a profession by respecting existing

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,930
standards.

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,750
It is called professional expertise.

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:48,440
Besides purely professional skills, some professions
also require the development of social skills.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,829
These refer to the interaction between the
job in question and the impact on other members

12
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:57,280
of society, other citizens.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,649
These interactions with the society in which
the workers grow can become problematic as

14
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:08,860
soon as they move away from professional standards
or adopt improper behaviours.

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,500
Everyone must be able to recognize the possible
faults committed by their colleagues, but

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,549
could also be tempted to adopt improper behaviours.

17
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:25,110
For these reasons, the reflection on work
ethics along with deontology were developed

18
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,799
over the past couple of years in all fields
of work.

19
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,700
In this MOOC, we will focus on activities
related to law enforcement in general, and

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,150
to protected areas in particular.

21
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:45,350
This touches on the work done by people with
specific powers (surveillance, arrest, search,

22
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,490
receiving fines, using force etc.).

23
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:59,049
They are mainly policemen, military and paramilitary
officers, forest guards, eco-guards, administrative

24
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,280
officials and private security agents.

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,200
The goal is to promote responsible behaviour
in the agent when confronted with real situations.

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:18,910
This is done by using practical examples to
reduce risks of behavioural blunders and mistakes,

27
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,240
but without always being able to eliminate
them completely.

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:30,810
Indeed, agents’ activity isn’t made of
theory or statistics, but of real actions.

29
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,879
In this framework, he must recognize the situations
where they can proceed, and the ones requiring

30
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,500
them to stop and think.

31
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,920
The type of responsible behaviour we are looking
for is influenced by many factors.

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,970
First, education received by parents is key.

33
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,900
The cultural environment, religious beliefs
and social background also play a role.

34
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,920
These influencing factors are permanently
set in the agent’s mind, consciously or

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,519
not, and mould an individual’s personal
values.

36
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,780
Professionally speaking, this same agent will
also be bound by the norms of his profession,

37
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,120
and by the values of his professional environment.

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,530
We will explain this in the next sequence.

39
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,440
These norms and values can be in contradiction
with his personal values.

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,850
In certain situations, the agent will have
to ask himself the central question of work

41
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,250
ethics: what must I do?

42
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,640
Let’s break down this important question.

43
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:51,400
First of all, you have to know the context
in which the question arises.

44
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:58,510
Our latitude of action must be known and defined,
either by ourselves or by our hierarchy.

45
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:06,290
This latitude is defined by our rights and
obligations as a citizen, a member of a community

46
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,510
or as a professional.

47
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:16,609
Finally, it must be clear that in the question
"What must I do" there is the word “must”.

48
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:24,189
This means that if you are a public official
with a mission, you must act, you have to

49
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:25,889
do so.

50
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,330
An official is indeed paid to take action.

51
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,860
DO, sure, but what?

52
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:40,169
In fact, once the obligation to take action
is recognized and accepted, the norms and

53
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:45,949
values in play allow to give a more concrete
answer to the question “what”?

54
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,509
The answer could then be: I don’t do anything.

55
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:55,089
Because the circumstances lead me to abstain
from any action.

56
00:04:55,089 --> 00:05:02,389
For example, if a direct intervention can
result in aggravating a situation rather than

57
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,490
in solving it.

58
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:10,050
But this decision must derive from a consideration
on our latitude that I can justify with the

59
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,849
relevant norms and values.

60
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:16,409
The same goes when we decide to proceed with
concrete action.

61
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:23,169
In the next sequence, we will be going deeper
into the topic by suggesting structured ways

62
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:28,529
of thinking that allow to make a decision
but also to explain the reasons for it.
