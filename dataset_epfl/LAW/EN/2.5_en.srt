1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,680
Developing and publishing codes or charters
are some of the tools an organisation can

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,059
use to communicate on its activities and work.

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:23,480
These codes are destined to the general public,
but also to the staff and leaders of the institution

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,110
in charge of drawing them up.

5
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:34,980
Here we are going to explain the logical way
of achieving these texts, namely based on

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,600
the notions of values and norms.

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,949
The idea is also to give these documents the
right size so that they are read and understood

8
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:49,609
by all.

9
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:54,479
Remember, each individual has his own personal
values.

10
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:01,300
In principle, when joining an organisation,
a person also accepts the values within.

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:08,409
This is the only condition that will enable
this agent to act in the way intended by the

12
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,920
organisation.

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,700
If the personal value system of the individual
is too different from the values of the organisation

14
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,490
he joined, difficulties will emerge.

15
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:29,979
It’s the case of A in the picture here,
where the personal values seem way off the

16
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:33,080
professional values of the organisation.

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,670
B will do better.

18
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,210
For this reason, the organisation must clearly
display its professional values.

19
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:50,420
Thereby, the values of the organisation and
of the people working within it are visible

20
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,340
to all.

21
00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:00,310
This also helps people who may be interested
in joining the organisation to see, beforehand,

22
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:06,840
if these professional values aren’t in conflict
with their own personal values.

23
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,690
As we’ve see, ethics define the ideal of
a profession.

24
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,030
The agent must recognise himself in his employer’s
code of ethics.

25
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:25,870
We also remember that in a code of ethics,
ideas of loyalty, honesty and impartiality

26
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,970
are stated.

27
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:35,370
So how do you move from a code of ethics to
a code of deontology?

28
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:42,520
This is done by stating a company’s operational
standards, which stem from the values given

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,300
in the code of ethics.

30
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,220
You could say for example:
“the employee can’t accept personal gifts

31
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,200
for the execution of a specific task related
to his work.”

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,190
“the employee is held by official secrecy
in all circumstances”

33
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:11,490
“the agent treats every person he interacts
with fairly, irrespective of race, sex or

34
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,490
religion.”

35
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,810
There are still two important elements that
will guarantee the success of these codes.

36
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:25,180
First, as the codes are intended for the agents
themselves, they must be concise.

37
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,330
Avoid adding too many pages and articles.

38
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:35,260
The values must be limited to one page, as
the deontology will be more comprehensive.

39
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:42,970
If you want it to be read by the right people,
limit the number of pages to only hold vital

40
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,610
information.

41
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:51,560
Ideally, create a pocket format, a kind of
pocket card, that everybody can carry with

42
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
them.

43
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,370
The second element is participation.

44
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,800
These codes mustn’t be be an expression
of the power or direction set by the higher

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,780
levels of hierarchy.

46
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,760
Everybody must be able to recognise themselves
in these texts.

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:17,910
Thus, code of ethics and deontology writing
committees must gather people of all hierarchical

48
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,730
levels, including trade unions and minorities.

49
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,070
This certainly complicates the writing process,
but, in the end, the published texts will

50
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,520
be accepted by all the people involved.

51
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:39,300
The content can be very different from one
organisation to the next.

52
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,410
However, the following topics are usually
included:

53
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,740
The behaviour that all employees are expected
to conform to.

54
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,680
Leaders responsibility.

55
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,760
They must give clear orders, respect legislation
and the codes that have been set.

56
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,710
Employee rights, namely regarding refusal
to submit to illegal orders.

57
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:14,120
The guarantee that the organisation does its
best to ensure proper training for agents,

58
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:21,240
and thereby enabling them to act in the best
way possible, with comprehensive and recognised

59
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,510
professional skills.

60
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,260
That’s it for the important part!
