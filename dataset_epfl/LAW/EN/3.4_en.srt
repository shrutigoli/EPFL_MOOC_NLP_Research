1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,600
We’ve defined what corruption is.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,820
We also saw that besides corruption, there
are other offences or crimes that can be committed

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,740
by public officials.

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,199
Corruption requires the presence of a corruptor
and a corrupted while other criminal activities

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,499
are the responsibility of one person alone.

6
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:32,119
Notice that the situations leading public
officials, managers and staff to fail are

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:39,420
often the same: absence of internal control,
temptation, a personal financial situation

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:47,519
considered unfair, lack of recognition by
leadership and/or by the population, frustrations

9
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,420
on career evolutions etc.

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,300
There are plenty of countermeasures.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,980
At least some of them must be implemented
by the organisation.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,050
This is what we will look at in this sequence.

13
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,320
First, each member of the organisation must
be clear on the general mission of the organisation

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,060
he serves and that pays him, as well was on
his own mission within this structure.

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,320
It is everyone’s responsibility to understand
these missions, regardless of the level of

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,780
leadership.

17
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,729
Senior executives as well as staff must know
the factors impacting the organisation’s

18
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:35,549
operations, as clarity and transparency are
the enemies of corruption.

19
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,880
Each element of an organisation has a clearly
defined area of work.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,200
Literature in this field identifies many types
of factors that impact organisations.

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,369
In this sequence, we’ll introduce one of
these lists of factors, namely the PESTEL

22
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:55,930
analysis, which includes six main factors.

23
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,430
P for Politics.

24
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,259
Whether it’s the country or the organisation’s
politics, this is the main factor impacting

25
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:08,229
an organisation in its operations and in setting
the goals to achieve.

26
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,650
Politics determine the nature of the organisation’s
mission.

27
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,599
E for Economy.

28
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,260
The economic and financial situation obviously
influence the operations of the organisation,

29
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,430
namely the means at hand to fulfil its mission.

30
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,230
S for Social.

31
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,520
The social situation of civil society, its
customs, its culture and morals, limit some

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,280
aspects of the organisation’s operations,
but sometimes it can broaden them.

33
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,950
T for Technology.

34
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:48,420
The technology at hand can modify the organisation’s
operations and methods, by distributing the

35
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,040
logistics at hand more or less evenly.

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,790
E for Environment.

37
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:01,349
The weather, the field layout, urban development,
or on the contrary a very rural context or

38
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:07,010
an isolated location, all require special
adaptation from the organisation.

39
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,150
L for Legal.

40
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,959
By definition, the law is binding in many
fields, but it also leaves room for freedom

41
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,840
in other fields.

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,269
This flexibility is part of the mission analysis
and the goals to achieve.

43
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,560
The PESTEL analysis is only one of the possible
approaches.

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,920
But it illustrates quite well the different
constraints that an organisation and its members

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,610
may face.

46
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,030
Top leadership must also get its decisions
across to all the associates.

47
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:45,040
To do so it must explain the factors that
influences their decisions in a way or another.

48
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,900
Communication must hence be a key element
in the fight against corruption.

49
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,549
Staff must on the other hand must have a clearly
defined scope of action within their own field

50
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,000
of activity.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,340
In this case, PESTEL may not be the most suitable
solution as its factors aren’t perceptible

52
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,260
enough or adapted to daily activities.

53
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,900
Instead, the organisation can focus on having
good work ethics and on making sure clear

54
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,270
and non-ambiguous orders are given by leadership.

55
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:26,750
These two elements limit the scope of action
of each person within the organisation.

56
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,220
We talk about this briefly in the next sequence
and see what it looks like practically.
