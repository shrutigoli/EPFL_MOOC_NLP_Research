1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,649
In the last few sequences we have discussed
international environmental law, with a focus

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,260
on MEAs.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,120
But these are not the only sources of law
relevant for conservation.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,890
I want to talk about two other aspects of
international law: principles and human rights.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,949
In a previous sequence, I introduced the concept
of customary international law.

6
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:29,710
A few key environmental principles have achieved
the status of customary international law,

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,310
meaning they are legally binding outside the
context of a particular convention.

8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,640
One of the oldest recognized environmental
principles is the territorial principle, which

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,260
says, that States have “the sovereign right
to exploit their own resources pursuant to

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,720
their own environmental and developmental
policies, and the responsibility to ensure

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,540
that activities within their jurisdiction
or control do not cause damage to the environment

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,320
of other States or of areas beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction.”

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,850
In other words, a State can mostly do what
it wants within its territory as long as it

14
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,100
doesn’t hurt other States or areas outside
its territory.

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,190
Sometimes this is referred to as Principle
21, because it is clearly stated as the twenty-first

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,760
principle of the Stockholm Declaration of
1972.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,320
The precautionary principle is another important
example.

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,040
This principle says that “where there are
threats of serious irreversible damage, lack

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,880
of full scientific certainty shall not be
used as a reason for postponing cost-effective

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,240
measures to prevent environmental degradation.”

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,570
Put another way, you can’t decide not to
try to prevent serious environmental damage

22
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,030
just because you’re not sure.

23
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,140
This principle is stated in the Rio Declaration
on Environment and Development of 1992.

24
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,390
A relatively new principle recognized in international
law is the principle of intergenerational

25
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:59,530
equity, which describes an obligation on present
generations to act as custodians of the earth

26
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,530
for future generations.

27
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:08,110
The last topic I want to address in the context
of international law is human rights.

28
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,220
Human rights, like international principles,
may be part of customary international law,

29
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,220
though they can be stated in international
agreements such as the International Covenant

30
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,790
on Civil and Political Rights or the African
Charter of Human and Peoples’ Rights.

31
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,260
Human rights can also be stated in declarations,
such as the Universal Declaration of Human

32
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,680
Rights.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,301
The definitions of human rights are elaborated
and clarified by human rights tribunals, such

34
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:39,340
as the African Commission on Human and Peoples’
Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human

35
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,900
Rights.

36
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,940
Many well established human rights are closely
related to conservation of the environment.

37
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,569
In some cases, protection of the right to
life requires addressing environmental harms

38
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,220
that create lethal threats.

39
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,800
The European Court of Human Rights has found
that governments have a duty to address serious

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,940
environmental threats, from “any activity,
whether public or not, in which the right

41
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,340
to life may be at stake.”

42
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,410
The Inter-American Court on Human Rights has
found that the human right to life is implicated

43
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,010
“where environmental contamination and degradation
pose a persistent threat to human life and

44
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,150
health.”

45
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,550
Human rights are often invoked in cases involving
indigenous peoples.

46
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,500
Multiple international instruments recognize
peoples’ rights to self-determination and

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,730
control over their natural wealth and resources.

48
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,989
Development in their territory, and particularly
removal of a people from their territory requires

49
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,849
their free, prior informed consent.

50
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,709
This has also been connected to rights to
property.

51
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,040
The African Commission on Human and Peoples’
Rights has found that indigenous peoples have

52
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,489
rights to ownership over their traditional
land, and that States should take special

53
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,010
measures to secure such ownership.

54
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,430
There is an emerging discussion of a human
right to a clean and healthy environment.

55
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,709
Such a right could include procedural and
substantive components.

56
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,409
On the procedural side, it could incorporate
rights related to access to information, public

57
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,239
participation and access to justice.

58
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,870
On the substantive side, it could include
obligations to meet minimum standards for

59
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,840
environmental quality.

60
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,310
The questions of whether such a right exists
and what content it might contain are being

61
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,430
investigated by the UN Special Rapporteur.
