Governance is a key part of conservation that is closely associated with law.
So what is governance?
Governance can be defined as â€œThe interactions among structures, processes and traditions that determine how power and responsibilities are exercised, how decisions are taken and how citizens or other stakeholders have their say.â€�
Law creates the basic frameworks and tools for governance.
In other words, law creates the rules for exercising power and authority and ensuring accountability.
Governance also describes processes for making and implementing laws.
Many actors are involved in these processes.
We can talk about two dimensions of governance: governance type and governance quality.
There are different types of governance system, depending on who makes decisions and how.
For example, in the context of protected areas, there are four main types of governance:
First, governance by government describes a situation where the government makes decisions and exercises authority.
This does not mean there is no participation of relevant stakeholders or the public, but the final decision rests with the government.
The legal framework designates and empowers the appropriate government agency, and creates processes and guidelines for decision-making and management.
It determines the amount of discretion the government agency can exercise in carrying out its mandate.
Second, private governance describes governance by a private entity, such as an individual, corporation or private association.
Around the world there are many examples of private protected areas.
Often these are the result of private landowners voluntarily committing their land for conservation, for altruistic or business reasons, and seeking the appropriate designation and support.
Private protected areas are most effective when recognized by law.
Clear and specific legal provisions should provide frameworks and standards for private conservation activities.
Legal recognition of private protected areas creates both incentives and accountability for voluntary conservation.
A third form of governance is governance by indigenous peoples or local communities.
Indigenous peoples and local communities may have ownership or governance rights over their territory as a matter of law, set out in the constitution, national legislation, or a treaty with the national government.
Alternatively, the government may delegate governance of a specific area to an indigenous community through a contract or regulation.
In some cases, indigenous peoples or local communities exercise de facto governance over territory where they do not have formally recognized rights, but like private governance, indigenous or community governance is most effective when it is strongly backed by law.
Finally, a significant amount of conservation governance today is shared governance.
Governance authority may be shared between a state and a private entity, indigenous or local community, or another state.
These arrangements should be legally formalized with clear definition of how power is shared and how decisions will be made.
There are certain basic standards that apply to all types of governance.
We call these the elements of good governance.
There is no universally agreed definition of good governance, but in general it is governance that demonstrates fairness, legitimacy and accountability.
Key requirements for good governance include participation, transparency, predictability, equity and access to justice.
Good governance is closely associated with the concept of rule of law.
Good governance is predicated on legal frameworks that contain strong and appropriate substantive and procedural elements.
Law should protect and respect human rights and principles of non-discrimination and fairness.
For example, many constitutions list fundamental rights such as the right to property or the right to equal treatment regardless of religion, race or gender.
Law should also create processes and obligations to ensure transparency and provide opportunities for meaningful participation and use of the legal system.
For example, national legislation often provides for access to government information, or requires a notice and comment period for new government rules.
Some people are beginning to discuss a third dimension of governance: governance vitality.
Governance vitality would go beyond the requirements of good governance, and describe the wisdom, vision, adaptability and resilience of governance actors and processes.
