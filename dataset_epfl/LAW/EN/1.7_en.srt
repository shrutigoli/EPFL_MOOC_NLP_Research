1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,590
As discussed previously, law performs many
functions in relation to conservation, from

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,070
creating rules for judicial proceedings to
setting up the basic structures of government.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,540
But one of the most important and familiar
examples of environmental law is regulation

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,640
of activities that affect biodiversity and
natural resources.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,110
There are many different types of regulation.

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,940
Two main categories of regulation are “command
and control” regulation and “market-based”

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,940
regulation.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,640
“Command and control” regulation works
by directly prohibiting or imposing requirements

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,969
on activities.

10
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:45,770
Command and control regulation states what
is allowed and what is not allowed, and establishes

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,480
punishments for violating the rules.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920
“Market-based” regulation operates differently.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,180
It tries to create enabling frameworks or
market conditions where certain activities

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,280
are more or less desirable or profitable.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,540
Market-based regulation can use tools like
subsidies and taxes, or tax breaks.

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,170
Tradeable permits are also considered a type
of market-based mechanism.

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,729
Regulation can come directly from legislation.

18
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:19,170
For example, national legislation might state
that it is illegal to kill endangered species

19
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,240
or drain wetlands.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,520
But often the specific rules that apply to
individuals and corporations are fleshed out

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,100
through regulations created by government
agencies to implement the legislation.

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,009
Permitting processes, quotas, descriptions
of regulated activities, and lists of protected

23
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,939
species are often found in agency regulations.

24
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,229
These agency regulations are usually easier
to change than the framework legislation.

25
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,970
This makes them more flexible and adaptable
to circumstances.

26
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,950
For example, if a species becomes more vulnerable,
it can be subject to stronger levels of protection

27
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,990
through regulation, and vice versa.

28
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,500
Creating or changing regulations usually requires
a participatory rulemaking process.

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,479
For example, there may be a requirement that
new rules are subject to a “notice and comment”

30
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,220
period, when they are publicly posted and
available for comment.

31
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,450
This is an important time for civil society
and concerned individuals to express their

32
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,660
views on the new regulations.

33
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,250
The regulating body may be required to take
public comment into account in reviewing the

34
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,690
regulations.

35
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,360
In some cases, specific permitting processes
are also subject to requirements for public

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,710
notice and comment.

37
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,190
Regulations may be based on geographical area,
species, or type of activity or threat.

38
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,530
Specific types of regulation will be discussed
next.
