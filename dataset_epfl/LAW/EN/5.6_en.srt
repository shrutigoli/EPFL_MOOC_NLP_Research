1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:15,019
Surveillance relies on suitable material and
equipment to carry out operations on the field.

2
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:23,750
Field agents with proper individual and collective
equipment have stronger capacities of intervention,

3
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,660
and are more motivated to carry out their
mission.

4
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:42,840
Individual equipment includes uniforms, raincoats,
tents, sleeping mats and sleeping bags, backpacks,

5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,809
camel bags, shoes, water bottles and weapons.

6
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:56,100
If possible, every agent is responsible for
the maintenance of his own equipment.

7
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:04,110
In Côte d’Ivoire, the State provides agents
with a yearly supply of outfits.

8
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,722
Projects in different parks support the acquisition
for each ranger of an additional outfit like

9
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:16,200
a tent and a sleeping mat.

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,340
Collective equipment ensures the accomplishment
of the mission by facilitating travelling,

11
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:31,360
bivouac and camping, good communication inside
the patrol team and with the base, but also

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,739
the collection of patrolling data.

13
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:43,300
Proper vehicles are required to facilitate
team travels and to improve responsiveness.

14
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:53,050
Unit mobility on the entire PA is key to face
aggressions and to ensure the security of

15
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,630
all.

16
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:02,560
According to the specificities of each park,
vehicles can consist in four-by-fours fitted

17
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,690
with special equipment and traction tools.

18
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:16,320
Chainsaws are also needed, as well as boats
equipped with life rings, jet skis and bikes

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,040
that can also be a good quick response tool.

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,820
In some parks, patrols are done with horses,
bicycles and even quads.

21
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:33,500
In some larger parks like the Kruger in South
Africa, several planes are deployed for proper

22
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
surveillance of the territory.

23
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:44,870
A maintenance and replacement plan guarantees
operational equipment, thereby ensuring agent

24
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,310
mobility at all times.

25
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:56,900
For bivouac and camping, kits need to be made
available for teams with kitchenware and camping

26
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,620
materials adapted to every type of environment.

27
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,530
These should be easily transportable for foot
patrols.

28
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:12,710
Food rations can be provided to agents to
ensure their daily food intake.

29
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:19,850
They can consist in specialised rations, or
in local meals with, if possible, some high-energy

30
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,010
dried foods.

31
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,880
To manage stocks, a good option is to set
menus.

32
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:34,110
For instance, in Côte d’Ivoire, two methods
are used: food is directly provided by management,

33
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:41,569
or money is provided so that agents can organise
food rations themselves for patrols.

34
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:50,210
A first aid kit with medication can also be
provided to each patrol team.

35
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:56,140
Communication materials include VHF radios
and their accessories or satellite phones,

36
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,010
or cell phones with solar panels and portable
chargers.

37
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,840
Radios enable secure communication with the
possibility to track positions and patrol

38
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,300
teams in real time, but they are expensive
and not always adapted to the forest cover.

39
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:23,630
For intelligence, digital cameras and voice
recorders can be useful to collect data and

40
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,500
build a case against suspects.

41
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:34,000
To guide teams on the field and to collect
patrolling data, technical surveillance equipment

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,370
is required.

43
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,690
This includes GPSs, compasses, tablets or
digital cameras.

44
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,910
CLIC
In terms of equipment, providing patrol teams

45
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,220
with weapons and ammunition is a real challenge.

46
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:56,280
Nowadays, poachers’ level of equipment requires
rangers to be properly equipped and trained.

47
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,460
This isn’t always the case in countries
where surveillance is delegated to paramilitary

48
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:11,169
forces, in spite of weapon training being
provided by the military.

49
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:17,810
When weapons are made available, an inventory
and strict management and maintenance system

50
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:26,130
should secure weapons in armouries and keep
them in good working condition.

51
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:32,290
Carrying out joint patrols with other units
(military, police) is essential when the threat

52
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,290
exceeds the normal intervention capacities
of forest guards.

53
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:48,050
Finally, infrastructures and facilities must
be designed specifically to facilitate surveillance,

54
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:54,950
such as base camps or a mechanical garage
for vehicle maintenance, and of course, landing

55
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:01,400
runways distributed throughout the park for
planes and ULMs.

56
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,390
Basically, to ensure optimal conditions and
effectiveness of surveillance activities,

57
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,060
equipment must always be in good working condition.
