1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:10,710
Before making his decision and establishing
a strategy, the leader must first make sure

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,700
to have properly assessed what is expected
of him, with the means, staff and equipment

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,230
he has been given.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,080
The more complex and chaotic the situation,
the more holistically the problem should be

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,329
comprehended.

6
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:33,960
First, as soon as the mission is received,
an event occurs or when the situation changes

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,640
drastically, the problem must be comprehended.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,300
This comprehension is divided in three parts:
detecting the problem, understanding the problem,

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,719
assessing the problem.

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:54,350
Detecting the problem consist in answering
the following basic question: What is it about?

11
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:02,559
To do so, you must consider the following
elements: what are the goals to achieve, or

12
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,110
what is the expected result?

13
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,200
What are the risks and the opportunities to
seize?

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,140
What is the level of difficulty?

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,479
What is the deadline in which the mission
must be accomplished - in other words, is

16
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,720
it urgent?

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,960
What are the different tasks required to fulfil
the mission?

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,880
When trying understanding the problem, the
person responsible for the operation distributes

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,860
the tasks he identified to several subordinates.

20
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,619
These will work simultaneously and give accounts
of the results from their work.

21
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:48,380
In a more complex operation at the operative
level, the command staff entrusts its thoughts

22
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,570
to auxiliary task forces, made of several
people.

23
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,460
When the situation isn’t as complex, the
leader simply divides the work between his

24
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,439
direct subordinates.

25
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,530
Understanding the problem gives a general
overview of all the aspects of the mission,

26
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,960
and makes it possible to choose solutions
with full knowledge.

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,970
Assessing the problem simply consists in describing
the importance of the mission compared to

28
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:27,310
other ongoing activities, its importance in
the general context, possible urgency in achieving

29
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,500
the mission, and setting the order of priority
of the different tasks that were identified

30
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,620
upon understanding the problem.

31
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,690
Once the mission is fully analysed, this is
what we have: a description of tasks to fulfil

32
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,540
and their order of priority, a vision of the
final desired state, first drafts of possible

33
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,540
solutions for the mission, constraints that
need to be considered and opportunities that

34
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,690
we can benefit from.

35
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,170
The thought process that we just discovered
seems quite heavy.

36
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:12,260
When the mission stems from a sudden and unpredictable
event that needs to be handled immediately,

37
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,140
the process can be shortened.

38
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,770
In this case, comprehending the problem can
be limited to: What is it about?

39
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,360
Must we act?

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,180
What tasks must be carried out?

41
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,750
What do I need to face this event?

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,200
Obviously, when the mission covers a longer
period of time and the operation is more complex

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,990
or expected to take place later, there is
more time for thinking and preparing.

44
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,010
The more time there is between the reception
of the mission and its deadline, the more

45
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:52,410
carefully each step of problem comprehension
can be followed.

46
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:58,970
During the thought process, it often seems
that measures must be taken immediately to

47
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:04,680
save time, to complete the information at
hand, to obtain extra means of support, to

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,090
avoid any further damage (during a catastrophe
for example), or to maintain a level of flexibility

49
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,260
(clearing the road for example).

50
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,100
These are called “immediate measures”.

51
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:25,330
Here, the need to take emergency action during
a sudden event mustn’t be confused with

52
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,710
what we call immediate measures.

53
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,259
These are one-time measures, to carry out
immediately.

54
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:37,650
They are ordered by the leader as soon as
the problem comprehension process is over,

55
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,020
according to the needs.

56
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:49,400
Now let’s see how these immediate measures
are carried out, who triggers them and when?

57
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,560
In theory, immediate measures aren’t needed
when you plan an operation that takes place

58
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,520
later in time.

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,300
They are used when the mission must be carried
out in a binding time limit.

60
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:12,830
AIMER, French for “love”, is an acronym
to help you remember the possible immediate

61
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,870
measures.

62
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,439
Depending on the operation, all measures aren’t
necessary:

63
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,539
A is for alerting.

64
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:30,310
Alert support teams like a special squad or
paramedics, transport means and so on.

65
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,300
I is for informing.

66
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,139
Inform the lower and higher levels in the
command hierarchy so that they can start with

67
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:44,990
preparations related to the new mission, or
inform the political level when there is a

68
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,479
potential media impact.

69
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:52,000
M is for putting into Motion.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:02,490
Put into Motion preparatory actions (roadblocks,
operational structures etc.) or pre-existing

71
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,240
action plans.

72
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,060
E is for exploring.

73
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:15,430
Exploring means searching intelligence on
people (victims, witnesses, perpetrators etc.).

74
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,020
Who am I dealing with?

75
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,520
What do they want to do?

76
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,009
R is for reconnaissance, called sometimes
scouting.

77
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:32,330
Here, reconnaissance means looking for information
on the configuration of the field, the aspect

78
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:38,669
of built-up areas, the state of roads or adverse
infrastructures etc.

79
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:44,409
By triggering immediate measures, the leader
must make sure not to block his own future

80
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,190
possibilities to take action.

81
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,860
He must always try to preserve flexibility.

82
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:57,259
Based on if you are at the operative or tactical
level, immediate measures can be ordered verbally

83
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:02,599
or through a written order, by respecting
the format we will be looking at in the next

84
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:04,599
sequences.

85
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:12,280
All the steps that we just looked at must
follow one another logically over time.

86
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,849
The constraint in this case is the time available
until the operation is carried out.

87
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:24,430
Within this timeframe, the idea is to set
precisely when a given step must be undertaken.

88
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:31,509
You must also give subordinates the time they
need to execute the task they were given.

89
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:37,080
During this process of comprehending the problem
and the tasks stemming from it, routine meetings

90
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,419
must be set (in time and place) give subordinates
the opportunity to present the state of their

91
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,430
work.

92
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,939
Scheduling helps setting the same work pace
for all subordinates.

93
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:58,139
However it can be adapted based on the evolution
of the situation, or the progress of preparatory

94
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,659
works.

95
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:06,300
As said before, the more complex the event,
the more this process will be dense and the

96
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,110
more time and energy consuming it will be.

97
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:15,490
If all these steps are carefully fulfilled,
the event leader will have all the elements

98
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,699
at hand to consolidate his own position.
