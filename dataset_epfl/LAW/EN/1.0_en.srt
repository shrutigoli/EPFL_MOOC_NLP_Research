Hello and welcome to this MOOC on law enforcement
in protected areas.

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,910
As you know, protected areas are places that
conserve nature.

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,510
This conservation meets certain rules.

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:24,310
The goal of this MOOC is to give us the keys
to understanding what these rules are and

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:30,800
what are the principles regulating their implementation,
in theory and in practice.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,360
Of course, a MOOC can’t replace in situ
surveillance, or more generally monitoring

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,330
infringements in the field.

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,520
But it can help us think about the context
in which this can be applied, about what behaviours

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,220
to have and about the best practices to develop.

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:54,870
In this MOOC, we will be looking at:
- How the laws, rules, conventions and codes

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,610
that supervise nature conservation in general
and protected areas in particular function.

12
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,990
- Then, we will talk about work ethics required
for law enforcement

13
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,770
- We will focus on corruption, a key element
of the failure of monitoring systems

14
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:19,340
- We will describe the methods on how to give
clear and organised orders to limit possible

15
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,310
mistakes
- Finally, we will see how all this can be

16
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,100
translated into field surveillance in a protected
area.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,369
You’ll see, the classes include several
experts, lawyers, police officers, PA managers,

18
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:34,179
all professionals in their fields.

19
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:40,390
Each module is made of several sequences in
the form of videos divided by quizzes and

20
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,499
examples.

21
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:46,760
Further documentation is also available, which
can help you go in further detail according

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,859
to your needs.

23
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:53,000
A PDF document is also available for online
reading or for downloading to help you remember

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,700
the most important points.

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,863
Finally, if you pass the optional online exams
you will receive a certificate.

26
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:01,219
If you would like to receive the Certificate
of Open Studies, you can prepare for the classroom

27
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,219
exam of this MOOC.

28
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,240
All this is mentioned on the forum of the
MOOC platform, but also in the Facebook group

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,100
which I invite you to join.

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,689
You can also sign up for the monthly NAPA
newsletter.

31
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:18,880
There, we are available for you so don’t
hesitate to get in touch.

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,939
Have a great MOOC !
