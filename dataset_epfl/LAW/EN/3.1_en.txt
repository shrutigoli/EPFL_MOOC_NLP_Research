- Hello Philippe.
- Hi Geoffroy
- In the previous module, we talked about work ethics, and now, we are going to be looking at corruption.
Corrupt government officials often make the news, but what does it really mean?
- There is a general language misuse around the word "corruptâ€� or â€œcorruptionâ€�.
From a strictly legal point of view, corruption is a specific criminal offense with clearly defined legal implications.
We will talk about this in the next sequence.
- But indeed, we do describe people abusing their State power as being â€œcorruptâ€�.
These â€œcorruptâ€� officials can steal, divert money, scam, defraud and bribe.
This language misuse is rather convenient as it clearly holds state or semi-public officials responsible for any legal failure.
- So basically, we need to make a difference between the common use of the word corruption and its legal definition?
- Exactly.
For instance, if a state official in charge of patrols prefers hiding in a quiet place so he doesnâ€™t get tired, his behaviour would be questionable from an ethical perspective, but he hasnâ€™t really committed any concrete criminal offense.
You can call him depraved, lazy, but he certainly isnâ€™t corrupt.
- So why does this notion of "corruptionâ€� in its everyday use find itself associated with so many illegal activities related to government work?
- Letâ€™s just say that itâ€™s an oversimplification.
The reason why this language misuse has won over the media and the people is clear: it gives us one word to describe the fact that somebody has serious shortcomings, and deserves to be sanctioned for it.
But from a strictly legal perspective, a corrupt person must be found guilty of corruption.
- Is corruption present all over the world?
- Unfortunately, yes, no country has been spared.
For example, the corruption perceptions index of Transparency International places Switzerland, where I used to work, in a rather flattering position.
But this doesnâ€™t mean there is absolutely no corruption.
Iâ€™ve actually had the chance to investigate this matter, mainly on cases related to public procurement awards, but also to bribes paid to other countries to facilitate the conclusion of commercial contract.
- Nobody is immune to it.
How can you detect criminal behaviour and fight it?
This is what we will be looking at in the coming sequences.
- First, we will see the different classifications of offense that can be committed in the professional environment, and weâ€™ll explain what corruption is.
- Then, we will be looking at some principles that dictate the operations of organisationsâ€¦.and reasons that can lead to corruption.
- After this, we will talk about the solutions to reduce, unfortunately not eliminate, corruption within organisations
- or on a personal level.
- Finally, we will talk about how corruption can damage reputations, as it was the case for the FIFA recently.
- A good legal and criminal overview ahead!
Have a great week.
