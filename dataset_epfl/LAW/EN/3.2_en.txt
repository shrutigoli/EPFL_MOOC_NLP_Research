We often talk about corruption.
In the media, police officers, politicians, entrepreneurs, bankers and judges are often accused of corruption.
But what does this mean?
Actually, the word â€œcorruptionâ€� is generally misused to describe all criminal behaviour committed by a person who has power and abuses it.
This is often how the media relays the acts of political authorities, as in Brazil in the example here.
However, somebody who takes equipment from his employer for personal use or to resell it is called a thief and his employer is the victim.
The person who diverts money that has been entrusted to him by his employer to finance his own lifestyle is called a crook and his employer is, again, the victim.
These criminal behaviours donâ€™t fall under the legal sense of corruption, which has a very precise definition in the penal code of each country.
Offenses of this kind have an interesting feature.
The perpetrators of such offenses show a certain perversity.
Indeed, they often know and see the victims they harm.
If they harm their own employers, the perpetrators will meet them every day knowing that they are stealing from them.
It is probably easier to burglarize a house or steal a car, knowing that we never have to face the victim.
So together, we will look at the specific case of corruption, which is one of the many criminal activities a government official can be guilty of.
The Swiss penal code, for example, mentions many different elements that constitute the act of corruption.
It takes two persons for corruption to take place:
The corrupter, which is the person who corrupts, the actor of active corruption.
The corrupted, the actor of passive corruption.
Two types of situations can be identified:
The corrupter obtains a free legal service from the corrupted in return for payment.
Or, the corrupter obtains an illegal operation from the corrupted in return for payment.
Now letâ€™s have a look at some typical situations that will help us understand this better.
First case scenario: consider a protected area that can be visited according to certain rules.
Officially, entrance is free, and the duty officer simply has to register the visitors that come and go for security reasons.
The government official accepts this mission, but even though the service is free, he requires visitors to pay a fee which he keeps for himself.
What is the situation here?
Clearly, this is situation of corruption from the public servant who takes advantage of his inevitable location to extort an undue fee.
The public servant is clearly outlawed.
The visitor as well, if he knows the pass is free, and aware that if he doesnâ€™t pay, he wonâ€™t be able to enter.
Second case scenario: consider a PA in which hunting is strictly allowed for a couple of weeks a year, with no possible exemption.
A hunter wants to get permission to hunt outside this time period.
He offers payment to the agents in charge of hunting control so that they donâ€™t denounce him and let him hunt freely.
What is the situation this time?
The public servant grants an illegal authorisation to the corrupt hunter in return for payment.
Here, both parties involved are clearly accomplices in the act of corruption.
Third case scenario: in a PA, the agent in charge of granting hunting permits follows the rules.
He cashes in official taxes paid by hunters and provides the corresponding permits.
However, to increase his personal income, he doesnâ€™t register all the permits so he can keep part of the money paid by hunters for himself.
What is the situation here?
Well, this is theft, possibly fraud at the expense of the protected area.
The hunters, apparently honest, have probably no idea how their tax is handled once paid.
Basically, you must learn to distinguish active corruption from passive corruption, whether it is to bypass legislation and regulations, or to apply them but through undue fees.
Once the notion of corruption is understood in the legal sense, the question is who can be corrupt?
This notion mainly applies to government officials or public servants.
It can also apply to private agencies who have been assigned a job by the government.
However, for such a person to be corruptible or susceptible to corruption, they must have some form of power.
This person must have the power to authorise or forbid, to grant and to refuse.
In addition, this person must have a key position, meaning the service provided cannot be obtained elsewhere.
This person must also have greater freedom of action, and not undergo controls from their organisation.
Finally, this person cannot be held responsible for possible consequences.
In a nutshell, to be in a situation that is favourable to corruption, you must have a monopoly on an act, be able to operate discreetly, and not be controlled or be held responsible.
These elements lead us to think about ways an organisation must be set up to avoid risks of corruption.
This will be the topic of the next sequence.
