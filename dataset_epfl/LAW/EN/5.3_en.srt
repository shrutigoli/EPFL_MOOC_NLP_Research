1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:11,670
- Field surveillance in a protected area relies
on different stakeholders with complementary

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,780
missions.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:21,170
Once again, find more information by having
a look at these guidelines.

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,910
- Sworn officials are in charge of implementing
police actions.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:32,210
They are usually recruited at a national level,
especially in State-governed protected areas.

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:42,410
-These agents must be selected according to
strict criteria: physical fitness, endurance,

7
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:49,659
ability to live in difficult conditions but
also mental capacities and especially their

8
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:54,890
love for teamwork and ability to follow rules.

9
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,909
- To choose the right selection criteria,
it is important to have identified the needs

10
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:03,220
you intend to cover.

11
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:10,140
- The idea isn’t necessarily to look for
qualified people or for people with specific

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,290
knowledge, but rather finding individuals
with the ability to work in a field that can

13
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,900
sometimes be very tough.

14
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:30,620
- Enthusiasm for nature conservation should
be part of the qualities, otherwise staff

15
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,450
rapidly loses their motivation.

16
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:40,550
- The selection process should also identify
field experience, like some people growing

17
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:48,390
up in rural areas which can be a great asset
for daily activities.

18
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,479
- Then they must undergo proper training that
is adapted to the context of the protected

19
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,870
area, like the fight against poaching for
example.

20
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:04,820
There are guidelines explaining the details
of this type of training.

21
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:11,720
- This practical training should cover all
the aspects of the ranger’s future missions,

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:19,209
and if possible, be carried out in the protected
area he’s been assigned to.

23
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:26,020
This way, his training can target effective
actions.

24
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:32,920
- Beyond the initial training, it is important
to maintain a training cycle to face the evolution

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,620
of means, but also of threats and of the context.

26
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:45,370
Over time, this can also be a source of motivation
for rangers and a way to maintain team unity.

27
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,810
- It is important to carefully consider the
number of agents to send out to properly face

28
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,210
the intensity and the dispersal of threats
inside the park.

29
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:07,349
- Some numbers are often suggested, going
from one agent for 1000 ha to 5000 ha, depending

30
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:15,340
on the intensity of threats, on the type of
ecosystem and the evolution of obtained results.

31
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,959
There is no absolute rule, the important thing
is to adapt.

32
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:29,430
- For example, in Tai National Park, there
are around 90 agents for 500,000 ha, in other

33
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,140
words 1 agent for 6000 ha.

34
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:40,709
This is quite a low number given the park
is mostly a forest.

35
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:47,340
- Often times, we try to complement the national
personnel pool with local agents with more

36
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,820
direct operational skills.

37
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:56,760
- These would usually be members of local
community that play different roles in patrolling

38
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,170
teams.

39
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:05,900
They are often called eco-rangers or eco-volunteers.

40
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,090
- Some are used as trackers or guides, by
making use of their skills in detecting signs

41
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,189
of poaching.

42
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:21,239
- Others carry out camping tasks, by transporting
supplies and preparing meals.

43
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:29,339
In Tai, there would be around 1 eco-ranger
for 2 agents per patrolling team.

44
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:37,039
- Other village stakeholders contribute more
directly to the enforcement of laws, by reporting

45
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:39,449
those who commissioned the crime.

46
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:46,659
- They would then receive bonuses for every
piece of information that led to finding a

47
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:50,849
crime or to the arrest of the commissioner.

48
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:54,770
We will see this in sequence 5.6.

49
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,990
- Patrol leaders are just as important as
rangers and eco-rangers.

50
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,939
They lead surveillance operations on the ground
and work towards achieving the targets set

51
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,340
by the mission.

52
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:15,400
- They must be carefully chosen and the criteria
must include personal management skills, good

53
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:22,339
ethics, excellent experience in the work they
need to carry out, and having received proper

54
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:25,240
training for the mission.

55
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,189
- The patrol leader can be formally designated
or changed from one patrol to the next.

56
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:36,449
In any case, he must have respect for and
confidence in his staff.

57
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:43,680
- Obviously, other bodies of public forces
can be solicited to bring their support and

58
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,619
expertise to deal with situations that exceed
rangers’ capabilities.

59
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:57,089
- This can be the Police force in the case
of certain legal proceedings, or the army

60
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,939
when the threat requires stronger intervention.

61
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:08,811
- Regardless, the persons in charge of surveillance
must have authority and responsibility over

62
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:16,900
surveillance so that the work can be carried
out effectively and fully assessed afterwards
