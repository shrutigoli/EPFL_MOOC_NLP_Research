00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,560
In the last sequence, we discussed the purpose
of international law, what it looks like and

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,650
where it comes from.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,460
In this sequence I want to discuss some specific
instruments of international law that are

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,349
relevant for conservation.

5
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:24,590
Global and regional agreements that address
environmental issues are often called “Multilateral

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,460
Environmental Agreements” or MEAs.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,550
Most MEAs use the name “Convention”.

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:37,870
Some MEAs focus on a specific type of species
or ecosystem, such as the Ramsar Convention

9
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,550
on Wetlands of International Importance, Especially
as Waterfowl Habitat.

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,620
Others have a wider scope, like the Convention
on Biological Diversity, which provides a

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,710
broad framework for conservation.

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,870
Modern MEAs can have an extensive governance
structure.

13
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:01,579
At the core is the text of the Convention,
which contains legally binding obligations.

14
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:07,070
Sometimes the Convention Text includes Appendices
or Annexes that are more specific and easier

15
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,360
to modify than the main text.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,610
For example, the Convention on the International
Trade in Endangered Species has three Appendices,

17
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,760
listing threatened or vulnerable species to
which varying levels of obligation apply.

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,750
Every two or three years, the Parties review
the lists of species in the Appendices and

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,390
decide whether to add or remove species.

20
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,170
A Convention may have one or more protocols.

21
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,610
These are additional agreements that are negotiated
under the auspices of the main agreement,

22
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,360
but may contain additional legally binding
obligations.

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,530
Parties to the Convention are not obligated
to join its Protocols, and often Protocols

24
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,010
have a smaller number of Members than the
parent Convention.

25
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,189
For example, the Convention on Biological
Diversity has two Protocols: the Cartagena

26
00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:01,150
Protocol on Biosafety and the Nagoya Protocol
on Access and Benefit Sharing, both named

27
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,300
after the cities in which they were adopted.

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:09,000
The Cartagena Protocol even has a Protocol
of its own, the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,040
Protocol on Liability and Redress.

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,620
MEAs normally set up a governance structure
to facilitate implementation.

31
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,299
The highest governing structure is the Conference
of the Parties, or COP, which usually is held

32
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,419
every few years.

33
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:30,400
Protocols have their own high level structure,
called the Meeting of the Parties or MOP.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,340
The COP and MOP are typically held in the
same place, back to back or at the same time.

35
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,499
At the COP or MOP or COP/MOP, Parties come
together to make decisions about the interpretation

36
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:44,069
and implementation of the Convention.

37
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:49,769
They can adopt resolutions, decisions, plans
or strategies or modify the annexes or appendices,

38
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,290
or set up working groups or task forces to
investigate specific issues.

39
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,280
They can review and make decisions about financial
contributions and budget.

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,079
They can also direct the Secretariat to take
on particular programmes or tasks.

41
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:05,230
Which brings us to the Secretariat.

42
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,760
Almost all Conventions have a Secretariat,
responsible for managing and guiding the day

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,620
to day implementation work of the Convention
and its Protocols.

44
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,930
The Secretariat cannot make legally binding
decisions, but it can provide guidance and

45
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,349
support to Parties in implementing the Convention.
