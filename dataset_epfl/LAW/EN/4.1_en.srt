00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,240
- Hello Philippe.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,680
- Hi Geoffroy
- Philippe, why do we need to add a module

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,069
specifically on giving orders?

4
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:18,270
- In the previous modules, we talked about
organisations’ responsibility to fight corruption,

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,369
and to develop work ethics.

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:27,140
I insisted on the importance of training,
and mentioned the need to issue clear orders.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:34,920
- This is why we are now going to talk about
a method that helps giving orders drawing

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,550
from the organisation’s objectives.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,200
These orders are more concrete and operational,
but the method also works for administrative

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
tasks.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,350
- Is this method for anybody or do we only
target managers?

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,740
- Managers are more likely to give orders
based on this method.

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,900
However, all staff must be aware of it to
understand the meaning behind what they are

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,450
being asked, and how leadership makes its
decision.

15
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:13,399
- But the method can be adapted to all levels
of leadership on the basis of a good understanding

16
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,520
of the mission.

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,450
- So where does this method come from?

18
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,170
- I’ve applied this method at work throughout
my career.

19
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,319
It is the one taught at police and military
academies in my country.

20
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,350
Complete handbooks can be ordered from the
editors.

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,240
- Here I am going to adapt this method, because
I will only give the general guidelines.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,389
To go deeper, it is best to imagine exercises
and scenarios to study, and experience them

23
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:49,779
as part of a group.

24
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:56,569
- Ok, so together, let’s look at the steps
of this systematic and structured methodology.

25
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:01,899
- First, you must understand the goals you
want to reach by giving orders.

26
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:10,090
- Then, to define the orders, you must analyse
the mission and understand the problem.

27
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,330
- Assess your own means and possibilities
if confronted with problems that can emerge

28
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,680
when executing the order.

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,840
- Then, we will look at how to make the operational
choices and decisions

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,849
- Finally, we will consider the plan of operational
orders

31
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:34,050
- Perfect, now let’s have a look at all
this!
