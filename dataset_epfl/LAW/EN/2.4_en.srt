1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,870
There is plenty of literature on work ethics,
especially on security services like the police

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,680
or the army.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:18,310
Many authors have developed concepts or principles
on how these organisations function.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,750
We will be looking at the governance of a
state or semi-public organisation based on

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:30,500
the principles exposed by Cohen and Fledberg
in this book.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,280
The authors consider 5 principles that must
guide the governance of a police organisation,

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,859
describing them as the 5 moral standards a
security organisation must follow.

8
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:53,329
This can perfectly apply to the sovereign
structure of a protected area.

9
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:59,010
According to the authors, the 5 principles
make up a form of social contract between

10
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:06,670
the population and the security organisation:
Fair access to government services.

11
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:13,460
This means each individual, citizen and litigant
must have access to services provided by the

12
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,439
dedicated structure.

13
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,670
The response given must be the same for all.

14
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,810
In all cases, the citizen’s approach must
be taken into account.

15
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,030
Public trust.

16
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,390
When the population grants specific power
to a security organisation, it must have the

17
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,850
guarantee, based on laws and regulations,
that the organisation will be used in the

18
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,759
interest of all and not for the benefit of
a few.

19
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,520
Public safety and security.

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,650
Protection of goods and people is the goal
to achieve.

21
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,159
It is the common asset to preserve.

22
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,320
Abuses that come along trying to reach this
goal are just as damageable as the omission

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,450
to take care of it.

24
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,299
Teamwork – Cooperation with all the partners.

25
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:10,590
A security organisation is only part of the
problem resolution chain.

26
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,910
It cannot act alone and must collaborate with
the population in the general sense, namely

27
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:23,440
with the local authorities, the judicial order,
political authorities, education officials

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,380
and so on.

29
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,000
*Objectivity.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,030
Any action of a security organisation’s
agent must be driven by the target to meet,

31
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,890
without giving way to favouritism, discrimination
or negligence.

32
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:48,210
Now that we’ve established the 5 principles,
we can define communication actions that will

33
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,370
make the organisation more transparent to
the population, that will instil confidence

34
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:00,060
in its interventions and valorise the agents’
actions.

35
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,650
Now let’s see what concrete communication
actions can be taken.

36
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,930
Fair access to government services.

37
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:15,100
For such a principle to be adopted by the
entire organisation, rules must be set, and

38
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,350
for the population to know these rules, they
must be published.

39
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:26,710
A deontological code tells agents what their
rights and obligations are, and what the minimal

40
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:35,850
requirements are that habilitate them to practise
their profession.

41
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:42,010
By having access to this code, the population
will have a clear idea of what they can obtain

42
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,260
from the relevant institution.

43
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,870
Public trust.

44
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,870
Safety and security.

45
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:55,550
This is about managing the latitude given
to agents when exercising their given power.

46
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,840
Professionally speaking, agents must undergo
structured training, especially when it comes

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,900
to the use of force or coercion.

48
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:13,080
In the same way, leaders must manage staff
transparently and undergo proper training.

49
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,440
Here, the leadership’s responsibility, their
way of leading staff and the precision of

50
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,530
orders given are a matter of vital importance.

51
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:31,910
Also, at this point, a discussion must be
carried out on the relevance of controlling

52
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:40,170
agents’ personal lives to enable early detection
of risks of blunder.

53
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,560
Teamwork - cooperation with partners.

54
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,380
In a park, the organisation in charge of security
or surveillance is one of the components from

55
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,960
a wide selection of partners involved in conservation.

56
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,000
Ideally, these partners should meet regularly
to share problems, find solutions and implement

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,100
them.

58
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:10,290
This is the principle used by community policing.

59
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,420
The idea to set up meetings that the security
organisation can be led to organise.

60
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:23,460
This is when we talk about a local safety
and security council.

61
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,570
Objectivity.

62
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:31,520
This is when we tackle the issue work ethics
that must be subject to a published code of

63
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
ethics.

64
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,240
The nomination of an ethical officer supports
this element.

65
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,750
Purpose and governance.

66
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:45,360
The notions considered here are different
pieces of a puzzle within a Protected Area,

67
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,960
that will show externally that the area is
indeed achieving the mission it was given,

68
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,160
and internally, to determine what is expected
from agents and managers.

69
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:05,350
To tie it all together, the security organisation,
for example the unit in charge of the fight

70
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:14,490
against poaching, could draw up a yearly report
to the guardianship authority, which is destined

71
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:22,880
to be published and exposes the actions undertaken
in relation with the 5 standards and the results

72
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,840
obtained.
