00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,840
- Hello Philippe.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,970
- Hello Geoffroy
- Here we are at the beginning of the module

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,380
on work ethics.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:19,410
In a MOOC like this one, on law enforcement,
why is it important to talk about ethics?

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,939
- The idea here is to use a form of training
widely conducted in police academies.

6
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:30,350
It is more than just studying laws and identifying
what is authorized or not.

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:36,980
In normal circumstances, the agent in charge
of enforcing laws and regulations knows perfectly

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,670
well if he is facing an offender.

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:47,790
He also knows if he is acting like a professional,
within the legal framework.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:56,239
- If each agent or manager already has the
tools to act lawfully, what are ethics for?

11
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,750
- Human beings are confronted with temptations,
frustrations and desires.

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:09,470
They are also bound by their education, their
social status, their culture and their environment,

13
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,090
and these elements can make them question
or doubt the laws in place.

14
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:20,509
At this point, the fact of knowing that a
behaviour is unlawful isn’t enough to help

15
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,930
them overcome their problem.

16
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,579
They need to find answers elsewhere.

17
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:34,080
This is why an ethical reflection is relevant
in addition to simply studying laws and regulations.

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,880
- So basically ethics add a philosophical
dimension to law enforcement?

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,180
- Exactly.

20
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,659
It also helps realize why we do certain things
or not, why we took a certain direction instead

21
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:48,659
of another.

22
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,810
It is obviously very relevant for people in
justice careers, where representatives are

23
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:02,759
given great power to be used with discernment,
for the common good and not for personal benefit.

24
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,920
- In relation to justice, how do work ethics
come into play?

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,049
P - For many years, I worked as senior officer
of criminal police in Switzerland and was

26
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:22,689
trained on the issue in the US at the FBI
Academy in Quantico, Virginia.

27
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:30,270
- In 2004, an organizational reform of police
training in Switzerland introduced a course

28
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,519
on work ethics to the basic training for policemen.

29
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,199
Based on my American experience and along
with other specialists in the field, we developed

30
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,420
a course approved at a national level.

31
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,769
- A course in which work ethics plays an important
role I suppose?

32
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:56,570
- During the training year, no less than 28
sessions are devoted to ethics alone.

33
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:05,990
As a complement, they are coupled with classes
on human rights covering 16 sessions.

34
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,290
Over the years, police students have become
increasingly aware of these topics.

35
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,400
While in 2004 many people were still quite
opposed to them, the new generation is very

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,680
open as they understand the stakes.

37
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,580
Behaviours are changing…

38
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,529
- So specifically, what are we going to see
in this module?

39
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,279
- “What must I do?”

40
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:33,880
– This is the first question we’ll be
asking ourselves.

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:42,169
- Then, we’ll define ethics more precisely
and position it in relation with other notions

42
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:48,189
like deontology, values, norms etc.

43
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:54,630
- After this, we’ll be looking at the principles
governing ethics,

44
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,330
- and we’ll talk about drafting codes and
charters to translate them into actions.

45
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:09,230
- Finally, we’ll consider the dilemmas that
can emerge when we move away from ethics.

46
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,540
- Many useful concepts to master… this should
be a great week.
