1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,670
Here we are at the last step of our thinking
process leading to establishing orders.

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,119
Remember: the goal of the entire process is
to give clear written or verbal orders.

3
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,980
The process that we just went over, provides
all the elements you need for this.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,110
Let’s see how.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,780
In my country, we would generally consider
an order in 5 points.

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,380
Let’s see what they contain.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,070
Let’s start with orientation.

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:41,910
Orientation gives indications on :
-The situation and possible developments,

9
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,739
-Risks associated with the adverse party and
its own possibilities or means,

10
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,800
-The missions received by the superior level
of hierarchy, respectively the mission that

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,510
you give yourself facing a situation that
occurs or evolves,

12
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,549
-Support from non-subordinate partners that
you may have.

13
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:12,350
- All these elements exist, because information
was collected and analysed in the problem

14
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,000
comprehension and situation assessment phases.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,580
From these two steps, we gather relevant information
to explain the decision.

16
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:28,860
What about intention ?
In short, the person responsible for an operation

17
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,860
explains what he wants to do, how, and what
the means and deadlines are.

18
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,439
Terminology must be concise and illustrative.

19
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,490
The total explanation must be summarised so
that everybody understands what the common

20
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,950
goal to achieve is.

21
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,830
This is maybe the hardest thing to write down,
as ideally, you should try to be as comprehensive

22
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:03,090
as possible using only few words, as I’m
trying to show here.

23
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,090
And the missions.

24
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:10,009
A mission is assigned to each subordinate,
whether it is a colleague by himself, or a

25
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,150
group with a designated leader.

26
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,270
The mission is compulsory, and binding.

27
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:22,251
However, subordinates must always be given
some flexibility so that they can adapt to

28
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:24,060
unforeseen circumstances.

29
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,280
Again, the mission must be described concisely
and precisely.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,630
Special requirements are part of the category
we could call "miscellaneous”.

31
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,300
The following information is indicated in
this category: The time and place of meeting

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:51,810
for the beginning of the action ; The possible
end of action (what time and under whose orders)

33
00:02:51,810 --> 00:03:00,060
; The radio channels that will be used and/or
contact information of people involved ; Equipment

34
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,790
required per individual (weapon or not, winter
attire, helmet, etc.)

35
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,800
;Special guidelines like the rule about weapon
usage and other means of defence ;The behaviour

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:22,030
to have with people encountered, this is where
human rights and ethics are mentioned ; Rules

37
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:29,400
of communication with the media ; Administrative
rules like working time or possible benefits

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,769
; Housing details and supplies for a durable
commitment.

39
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:41,980
Finally, let’s talk about locations:
In principle, at least the location and the

40
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,900
contact information of the leader must appear
here.

41
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,890
The possible location of command facilities
is also noted, in other words the command

42
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,450
post along with the contact information.

43
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,260
Verbal or written orders?

44
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,879
All orders mustn’t necessarily be written
down.

45
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,480
For complex operations, with higher risks,
written orders help guarantee everyone has

46
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,620
the same information.

47
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,690
If the matter goes wrong, the subordinates
will be able to state they acted based on

48
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,890
the orders they were given.

49
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,919
It is a form of protection.

50
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,789
Facing the population and public authorities,
this helps showing management professionalism,

51
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:36,749
in the way they comprehend the problem and
assess the situation.

52
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:41,180
Different words can be considered to identify
types of orders.

53
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,050
Each organisation can create its own classification.

54
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:50,819
A general order could be about the organisation
of the company or institution’s structure.

55
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,199
An operational order will directly be about
a concrete engagement.

56
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:03,819
A prior order can help to give immediate measures
or advise different actors involved of an

57
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,059
operation to come.

58
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:12,539
Here, let’s give organisations the freedom
to choose their own terminology.

59
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:17,979
To establish standard behaviours within an
organisation, we can give a general order.

60
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:24,819
We can also draw up a practical document,
in pocket-format, that gives basic rules that

61
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:27,550
everybody must follow.

62
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:35,559
These rules of engagement frame the use of
coercion, force, and therefore the use of

63
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:38,509
weapons.

64
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:44,580
They also provide the legal bases to follow,
namely Human rights.

65
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,419
This is particularly useful when the organisation
is supported by people with different philosophies,

66
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:58,689
for instance, when the police is supported
by the military, whose rules on weapon usage

67
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:03,279
are slightly different.

68
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:10,750
Rules of engagement can be permanent or written
down specifically for a particular operation.

69
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,740
At the end of these sequences, we can ask
why we have to go through this entire process.

70
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,309
Well, as we’ve said, this helps to prove
the professionalism of people writing the

71
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:30,939
orders, and it also helps subordinates knowing
precisely what is expected of them.

72
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,680
In the end, everyone is more comfortable during
the action.

73
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:44,240
Obviously, when the situation is simple, an
order can simply be a: "goal, way towards

74
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,090
the goal, behaviour at the goal”.

75
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,050
Especially when the action is immediate on
the field.

76
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:56,469
At this point, reflexion is secondary, so
risks are greater.

77
00:06:56,469 --> 00:07:00,159
Taking time for reflexion is never lost time.
