1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,039
Most countries have laws providing for protection
of specific species.

2
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,830
They may use different tools, from incentives
for habitat conservation to criminalization

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,160
of exploitation or trade.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,060
But the common thread is that this type of
regulation defines what is permitted or prohibited

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,430
in terms of the species involved, rather than
where the activity takes place.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,340
One of the most heavily regulated activities
involving species is “taking”.

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,140
Taking includes hunting, killing, catching,
gathering, fishing, poisoning, harvesting,

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,820
snaring, cutting, plucking or removing all
or part of a member of a protected species.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,500
It may include harassing, disturbing or otherwise
harming a species or its eggs.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,790
In some jurisdictions, actions that cause
a protected plant or animal to die, such as

11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,860
use of pesticide, can also be considered a
taking.

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,900
Taking of strictly protected or endangered
species is often entirely prohibited, and

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,559
in many cases it is a crime.

14
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,570
More common species may be subject to different
regulatory requirements.

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,110
A hunting or fishing license may be required,
or hunting may only be allowed in certain

16
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,170
seasons.

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,789
Regulations may establish quotas for the number
of specimen that can be removed.

18
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:22,600
The size and gender of the specimen may be
regulated.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,469
For example, regulations could only allow
taking of fish over 12 inches long, or male

20
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:29,649
deer.

21
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:34,649
This is to protect the natural reproductive
and growth cycle of the population.

22
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:40,090
Even for strictly protected populations, some
taking may be allowed under specific circumstances.

23
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,710
Traditional use by indigenous or local communities
may be allowed.

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,579
Or trophy hunting under controlled conditions
and subject to strict quotas may be used to

25
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:51,450
generate revenue for conservation.

26
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,509
In addition to regulating taking of species,
laws can also regulate possession, processing,

27
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,020
or transport of protected species.

28
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,240
This type of regulation helps address taking
along the trade chain.

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,829
It facilitates enforcement, as it is usually
easier to prove possession than to prove that

30
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,420
someone killed a particular specimen.

31
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,800
It also addresses the problem that the people
and organizations most responsible for loss

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,240
of species are not always the people holding
the gun.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,020
Like taking, possession of a specimen or part
of an endangered species can be a criminal

34
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,410
offence.

35
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,410
When people hear this, they often ask, “but
what if it isn’t mine?

36
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,640
What if someone puts something in my bag and
I’m caught with it – can I go to jail?”

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,720
Usually the law takes this into consideration.

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,150
Possession requires both physical possession
– corpus – and intention to possess – animus.

39
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,970
In short, you can’t be convicted of possessing
something if you don’t know you have it.

40
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,720
The second question is a little harder: “What
if I have something, but I don’t know it’s

41
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
illegal?”

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,070
This is the scenario of the hapless tourist
who buys a piece of ivory or conch shell at

43
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,810
a market, or the subsistence hunter who shoots
the wrong type of antelope.

44
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,810
In this case the legal question is more complicated,
but there is a general principle in many jurisdictions

45
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,450
that ignorance of the law is no excuse!

46
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,840
A third category of species-based regulation
relates to trade.

47
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,240
Many jurisdictions regulate selling, offering
for sale, supplying, buying, bartering, trading

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,530
and even donation of products or specimens
of protected species.

49
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,120
This type of regulation can cover domestic
or international trade.

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,180
In the case of international trade, legislation
can create a system of permits or certificates

51
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,320
for import or export of protected species.

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,460
These do not need to be species that are native
to the regulating country, but can apply to

53
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,640
imported species.

54
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,370
The US Lacey Act, for example, provides that
it is unlawful to trade in wildlife “taken,

55
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,740
possessed, transported, or sold in violation
of any law or regulation of any State or in

56
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,190
violation of any foreign law.”

57
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,290
Sometimes, the list of species subject to
regulation may need to change, depending on

58
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,000
the vulnerability of different species.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,690
The list of protected species may be regularly
updated by a government agency.

60
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,730
It may incorporate by reference an international
list, such as the IUCN Red List or species

61
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,410
listed under the Convention on the International
Trade in Endangered Species.

62
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,639
Listing or delisting a species may be subject
to a regulatory process that provides opportunities

63
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,319
for public consultation.

64
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,800
It is important for agents involved in enforcement
and the judicial process to be up to date

65
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,560
and have the capacity to correctly identify
protected species.

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,189
Enforcement can be easiest when all taking
or possession of a specific species is prohibited.

67
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:48,650
When some taking is permitted subject to regulations,
it is vital to be able to distinguish between

68
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,710
legally and illegally taken specimens.

69
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,729
This can be facilitated by requirements for
certificates or other appropriate documentation.

70
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:01,449
But there can always be problems of forged
certificates or permits, or exceeding allowed

71
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:01,979
quotas.
