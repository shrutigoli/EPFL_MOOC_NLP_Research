Now we know the core aspects of ethics, deontology, values and norms.
All these elements modify social behaviours, but can also sometimes be in contradiction with morals, cultural habits, or personal situations.
The ethical dilemma poses the question of choosing between the values that are opposed in a given situation.
For example, in the case of staff working for security in a park to fight poaching, personal values can be opposed to professional values.
So we will see how to recognize such a dilemma, how to solve it, and above all, determine which value prevails: the personal or professional one?
And what is the role of norms in this type of conflict?
Before we go any further, answer this questions for yourself: whether we talk about a safety professional, a police officer, a military, a park guard, a doctor or a teacher: which value must prevail?
Letâ€™s try to find the answer together by underscoring the tensions and dilemmas that can exist between values and norms.
Consider a doctor.
A young lady wants to terminate her pregnancy after a rape.
The law of her country forbids the termination of pregnancy in all cases.
On a personal level, the doctor fights this legislation, and is for the liberalisation of abortion.
What must he do?
This doctorâ€™s personal values are in opposition with the values of his profession under the countryâ€™s norms.
He must then make a decision: respect his own values and break the law, or give up on his personal values and respect the law.
He must weigh the pros and cons while being aware of the consequences such a decision can have.
Consider a park guard.
He is paid by the state to stop traffickers of wood products and poachers.
He finds out his own brother is an ivory trafficker.
What must he do?
The guard must make a choice between loyalty towards his family members or loyalty towards the entire population who is represented by the institution he serves and pays him to fight crime.
There wonâ€™t be a good solution, but the guard must make a choice.
There are several more or less complex methods to analyse these dilemmas.
It will be interesting to go deeper by reading the documents suggested by this MOOC.
In a nutshell, many aspects must be taken into account to make a decision.
First, identify the main actors of the dilemma.
Here, the guard and his brother.
Also, identify the secondary actors.
Here, the trafficking network the brother belongs to, his own family, his own colleagues, the institution and the population.
Then, propose an alternative: must I arrest/denounce my brother or not?
For each alternative, list the positive and negative consequences for each actor.
For example, a positive consequence for the brother can be to help him give up crime.
A negative consequence for me can be my family may reject me.
Etc.
Also, in the same way, list the personal and professional values affected for each opportunity, as well as the norms concerned.
For example
The impact on the family involves a personal value.
The impact on the organisation involves my professional values and application of norms.
Identify the prevailing value.
At the end of this full procedure, you can make a sound decision.
Then, assess this decision from your own perspective, but also through other peopleâ€™s eyes.
Ask yourself: am I satisfied with this decision?
If you can, ask a third party who isnâ€™t involved to share their opinion.
Imagine what the population will think of your decision?
And your family?
Are you able to take responsibility for this decision?
Will you be able to defend it?
Finally, make the decision with full knowledge of possible consequences, and ready to take responsibility for it.
Beyond this formal analysis, it is possible to delay the final decision.
To do so, find an solution in between that could mitigate the negative consequences on the actors, particularly the main actors.
Maybe a good conversation with the poaching brother could help, where you explain him why he should stop his illegal activities.
Perhaps this will lead him to turn himself in.
This intermediate step, where you explain the conflict of values and norms in play, may ignite something positive within the brother.
Alternatively, you will have to make the decision decided upon previously.
And finally, the question asked at the beginning of this sequence remains to be answered: which value must prevail?
In principle, for a public agent who is paid for his work, the professional values must prevail.
If this agent has to cheat his employer to follow personal values, he will quickly find himself outlawed or outside of the norms.
He will become a problem for himself, his hierarchy and the image of his profession.
If the professional values become that unbearable, one solution remains: resigning.
Here is an historical example that shows how conflicts of value and norms can become unbearable.
During the second world war, the Nazis asked
French policemen to arrest and imprison Jews, as well as members of other undesirable communities in the eyes of the occupant (homosexuals, communists, artistsâ€¦).
Some police officers accepted the mission as their personal values didnâ€™t seem to clash with the new values and norms of the institution.
Others resigned, and some kept their jobs to cheat the institution and save lives.
These situations are extreme, but perfectly show how far the ethical reflection can go in special or degraded situations.
The ethical dilemma thus isnâ€™t just a choice between two alternatives like "should I go on foot or by bicycle?â€�.
It is a choice between two solutions with real consequences.
For a public agent, enforcing the law should take precedence over other considerations.
In most cases, the solution to the ethical dilemma of such particular professions will be in respecting the laws.
