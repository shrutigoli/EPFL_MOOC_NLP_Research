People arenâ€™t naturally corrupt by birth.
So why suddenly or progressively, does a person fall into crime and corruption?
This is what we will see in this sequence.
A childâ€™s education has a decisive influence on his adult behaviour.
Children act by imitating others, and will consider it normal to imitate their parents, even their most questionable traits.
Cultural and social environments also influence a childâ€™s education.
It may indeed be easier to resist criminal temptations in a privileged and economically stable social environment.
In an environment that was degraded by war or a weak economy, a person would be more inclined to behave inadequately.
Once he becomes an adult, the person is confronted with his own ethical analysis: what must I do?
The responsible adult must make choices.
He must be aware of the social and cultural influences that guided his education.
He must now behave according to his own rules he has full control of.
But what happens?
Why do some fall?
Why do they accept to be corrupted or take illegal liberties?
This is what I call the backpack effect.
The backpack is carried by each person every morning when leaving the house, and carried back home in the evening to their families.
This imaginary backpack holds all the problems and troubles individuals have to bear, but also all the joys and satisfactions theyâ€™ve experienced.
The bagâ€™s content permanently influences the personâ€™s behaviour.
Because of it he can lose perfectly good habits, and act in the heat of the moment.
Basically, the state of the bag can make somebody commit unprofessional or criminal actions.
What is inside this backpack?
Inside, youâ€™ll find the realities of life.
For example, family problems like the illness of a loved one, a partner or children.
Youâ€™ll also find relational problems within the family, conflict with the spouse or parents.
These problems can take an important space in the mind of the person who lives with them and can grow to the point that they become more important than professional issues.
Youâ€™ll also find work-related problems, like lack of consideration for a job from the population, lack of communication with colleagues, lack of support from leadership, defective technical equipment in terms of arsenal, clothing or connection.
Here too, an excellent employee may feel demotivated and think his efforts have no point.
Finally, youâ€™ll find all the problems related to the financial situation.
Often, starting a family leads to great financial burdens which can be difficult to face.
The birth of children, buying a house etc.
Alone with one partner, possibly with two incomes, everything seems easy.
But building a family increase expenses.
Income may also decline if someone in the household loses employment.
And the point of rupture can trigger frustration and can make someone loose its ethical sense to face everyday problems.
Frustration can be a powerful catalyst for delinquency.
In our case, it leads to professional delinquency, namely corruption or unlawful acts committed in the work environment.
All workers show up at work with their own imaginary backpacks.
It is good for leadership to know whatâ€™s inside, at least in part.
However, employees have no obligation to share this with their bosses.
If they do, it must be a result of dialogue based on mutual trust.
If the leaders are informed, they will be able to distribute the work among employees by taking this information in consideration.
Based on these factors of frustration or influence, different types of corruption can be defined.
Here, we will only describe three styles that illustrate how corruption can appear.
First, the notion of "rotten apple" which supposes that human beings are individually responsible and inherently predisposed to commit crime.
Organisations usually appreciate this vision.
It allows them to distance themselves from situations, they donâ€™t have to question themselves, namely when it comes to controls or considering the quality of managers.
The notion of "slippery slope" is also used.
You take a first seemingly trivial step in the wrong direction, then by habit or laziness, you go further.
To turn back, you will need to have the courage to denounce yourself or your accomplices.
So instead, you let yourself go.
"Department corruption" describes the fact that the entire organisation is dysfunctional.
The individual confronted with this environment will be able to let himself go saying "if everybody does it, why not me?â€�
Such behaviors have been found within police units in various countries, of course not only in France as in this example.
For people to realise this imaginary backpack exists and that it is the cause of certain behaviours, the staff must be equipped with certain tools.
This includes basic vocational training on work-related or technical tasks, but also training on work ethics and deontology.
In the next sequence we will suggest a method of analysis to create favourable conditions for such training.
