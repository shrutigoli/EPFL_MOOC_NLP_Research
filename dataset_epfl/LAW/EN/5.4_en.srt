1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:11,510
- Just like other activities, surveillance
is part of the protected area management plan.

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:17,220
Have a look at these guidelines for more details.

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,680
- For reasons of confidentiality, the description
isn’t very detailed, but main activities

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,590
are documented.

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:34,180
- It mainly lists operations to carry out,
it identifies staff needs and skills to strengthen,

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:42,000
facilities that can promote surveillance,
and it explains surveillance’s monitoring-evaluation

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,090
and funding.

8
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:50,079
- An operation plan, usually carried out yearly,
details the activities to implement, with

9
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,080
clear indicators to assess the progress made.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,190
- Surveillance patrol planning is based on
excellent knowledge of the field and of the

11
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,740
distribution of threats in the protected area.

12
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,110
- The area is sometimes zoned to target actions
better and face threats more effectively according

13
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,750
to their nature, their scale, their urgency
and so on.

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:24,140
- In this case, ecological monitoring provides
significant support because it gives information

15
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,920
on human-induced alterations and their location.

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,530
- Thus, updating data on the state of conservation
of the protected area steers surveillance

17
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,530
over time.

18
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,180
It is a field that requires adaptive management.

19
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,010
- Intelligence plays a key role.

20
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:52,780
Information regarding poachers and other park
offenders helps to anticipate their activities.

21
00:01:52,780 --> 00:02:00,420
- Intelligence is therefore not only an opportunistic
activity, but must be planned and organised

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,920
to have the desired effects.

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,170
- Staff in charge of surveillance must be
adapted to the mission

24
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:17,450
and it is crucial to organise frequent evaluations
to make sure their skills remain up to date.

25
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:24,150
- The evaluation should focus on their physical
and mental capacities, on their motivation,

26
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,550
their endurance, on their skills related to
the field and consequently, their need for

27
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,299
training.

28
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:39,879
- This helps to proceed to new recruitment
phases, reassignments, and training.

29
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,540
All this must be integrated to the operation
plan.

30
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:53,239
The method of evaluation must be simple and
objective, based on measurable indicators.

31
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:01,419
- Of course, these rangers’ employment conditions
must be defined beforehand, as well as their

32
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:06,010
objectives, and indicators to assess.

33
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:13,419
- To be clear, the mission must be known by
every stakeholder so that he can perfectly

34
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:17,569
master his area of responsibility.

35
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:25,040
- In some difficult situations, bonuses or
other types of rewards can motivate agents.

36
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,090
These should be added to the operation plan
and explained to the beneficiaries.

37
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,230
- The role of this is to empower good staff.

38
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:41,469
A clear and just allocation system must be
developed, based on performance to effectively

39
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:44,959
target the deserving ones.

40
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,680
- If properly used this tool can be very useful
but it can also be counterproductive otherwise!

41
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:59,650
- Sometimes, special infrastructure and facilities
are needed to facilitate law enforcement actions

42
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,099
- this must also be added to the operation
plan.

43
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:10,329
- This includes base camps, stations to get
staff closer to threatened areas, new trails

44
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:16,220
to enable access, acquiring or maintaining
stock, getting proper communication material,

45
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,549
fences and so on.

46
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:27,160
- Frequent monitoring-evaluations ensure that
set targets are being achieved.

47
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,790
- Assessment criteria must remain simple,
and be easy to measure.

48
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,230
For example, they can refer to the effective
presence of rangers inside the park in terms

49
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,750
of men per day.

50
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:46,260
- The coverage ratio of patrols on the protected
area territory.

51
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,940
- The level of involvement of neighbouring
populations through the amount of information

52
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:59,540
provided or the number of initiatives taken
by communities to prevent infiltrations.

53
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:05,660
- Measuring animal flight-distance gives an
indication on their confidence, and thereby

54
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,510
on the level of aggression they are facing.

55
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:17,500
- The number of arrests or evidence of criminal
activity in the protected area and their spatial

56
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
distribution.

57
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,940
- The number of convicted people which is
an important indicator as it covers the entire

58
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:31,410
law enforcement process, from beginning to
end.

59
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,050
- The use of geographical information system
tools can be included to the operation plan

60
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,639
as they enable the collection of information
during patrols.

61
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,470
- These tools are more or less easy to use,
and sometimes, a frequently updated database

62
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:58,370
is enough.G - Finally, financing surveillance
is a factor that can sometimes limit the operation

63
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,449
plan.

64
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:08,990
- The State must engage by implementing enough
measures to sustainably manage the protected

65
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,430
area network.

66
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:18,850
If it doesn’t, financial and technical partners,
NGOs and foundations can help funding the

67
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,850
surveillance.

68
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:27,200
But this field isn’t the most eligible to
receive their funding, so it is better to

69
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,700
think of sustainable strategies based on lasting
resources, steady incomes or sales of environmental

70
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,460
services to ensure the long term durability
of surveillance.
