1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,046
After nature,
let's have a look on time.

2
00:00:07,046 --> 00:00:09,276
Space and time are often associated,

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:14,021
at least because we massively use
 spatial metaphors to address

4
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,602
the complexity of time.

5
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:18,205
This second transversal approach

6
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:21,665
will lead us towards 
a fundamental principle :

7
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:24,531
geography is not the opposite of history.

8
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:30,052
Both geographicity and historicity
 are dimensions of the thick bundle

9
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:35,629
of logics that make us, society, exist 
as a complex yet consistent reality.

10
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:39,261
When we cross-cut space with time,

11
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:42,925
we discover that time is at any
 of its scale

12
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:46,725
a major spatial substance
 as well as power or money.

13
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:51,308
To explore this dimension, 
we welcome Hélène Noizet,

14
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:56,462
a remarkable historian of space,
that is to say, a time geographer.

15
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,090
She prepared this session

16
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,002
with a contribution of
 Groupe Du Lac,

17
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:04,032
a group of historians, archeologists,
and geographers

18
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:07,320
focused on space-time relationships.

19
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:12,770
Hello, we’re only going to talk here

20
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,946
about historical time

21
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:15,712
and Western Europe in general.

22
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,066
In this session, 

23
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,580
we’re going to address the temporal dimension of social facts, 

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,306
which are also fundamentally spatial, as we’ve seen before. 

25
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:26,336
First of all,

26
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,982
we’ll see that space has a history

27
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:33,774
Certain social forms are located in space and in time

28
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:35,805
having a beginning and an end. 

29
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:39,748
Conceptual tools from metric geography

30
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:42,190
such as the territory-network pair

31
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,942
help us to better define ancient social structures

32
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:46,337
for example those from the Middle Ages.

33
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:49,326
Later,

34
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:54,434
we’ll demonstrate the discontinuity of spatio-temporal processes

35
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:55,960
in the construction of the social. 

36
00:01:57,072 --> 00:02:02,090
The goal is not to juxtapose the dimension of time with that of space, 

37
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,914
but to intersect them

38
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:06,677
by analysing social processes 

39
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:10,257
as specific spatio-temporalities.

40
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:14,991
Space has a history. 

41
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:17,516
Certain contemporary social arrangements

42
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:18,940
seem structural to us, 

43
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,169
and it’s difficult to imagine things working differently 

44
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,658
since we’re so much a part of them. 

45
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,272
And yet neither the State, nor the city,

46
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,720
nor even the fact of gathering together into communities

47
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,989
are a given;

48
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,913
they are not inherent necessities for the human condition.

49
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:37,784
Only biological needs such 

50
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:39,943
as eating and sleeping

51
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:42,685
are invariables for the human race. 

52
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:45,105
Beyond that, everything is a a matter of space and time. 

53
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,954
This means that spatial forms of the social can be historicised.

54
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:59,632
For example, the idea of a national State 

55
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:02,683
is a relatively recent form of organisation in Western Europe.

56
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:07,082
It began to be set up at the end of the Middle Ages, in the 14th to 15th centuries,

57
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:11,576
developed during the Modern Era

58
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:16,235
and has seriously been brought into question since the end of the 20th century.

59
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:21,062
Globalisation, supranational constructions, 

60
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:24,742
and regionalisation undermine the national scale. 

61
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:27,077
Whether we accept it or not, 

62
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:32,407
the national State is no longer destined to be the principle operator 

63
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:34,804
of supra-local spatiality. 

64
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:39,811
If this social form now seems to be heading towards its end,

65
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:42,083
it also once had a beginning.

66
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:48,245
At the end of the Middle Ages, lasting administrations emerged 

67
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:50,378
which were at the service of a single power, 

68
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:51,987
and national sentiments 

69
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,794
were more and more exclusive

70
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:56,839
for example in France and England

71
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:59,237
following the Hundred-Year War.

72
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,568
It must be noted that at that time

73
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:07,376
the properly territorial dimension 

74
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:10,870
of this political construction, the State,

75
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,215
was not at all a given

76
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:13,858
contrary to what is often said. 

77
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:19,228
Too often, what is understood today by “State” 

78
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,882
is projected backwards onto previous ways of working. 

79
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,475
By doing this,

80
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:26,432
we inject modern attributes into the past, 

81
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,089
such as that of territoriality, 

82
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,732
which weren’t there from the beginning 

83
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:33,167
of the state-making process.

84
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:35,740
For example, 

85
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,898
the most classical maps on the construction of the Royal Capetian domain, 

86
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:43,397
considered as the foundation of the French national State, 

87
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:45,746
were mostly choropleth maps, 

88
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:48,382
such as those by Auguste Longnon in 1884, 

89
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:53,150
Fernand Braudel in 1986,

90
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,035
or Georges Duby's one,

91
00:04:57,035 --> 00:05:00,140
which was republished in 2008.

92
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,720
And yet even at the end of the Middle Ages, 

93
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,347
written documents identifying the rights and revenues of the king 

94
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:11,459
clearly carry a fundamentally reticular dimension of royal power. 

95
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,924
The king , and it is the same for all feudal lords ,

96
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:19,266
never held power over all of a region

97
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:20,981
in a continuous manner

98
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:24,694
but only over precisely located points,

99
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:26,837
such as this map of points 

100
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:29,381
by Olivier Guyotjeannin in 2005 shows.

101
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:33,179
This map is more respectful 

102
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,643
of Medieval reality than previous maps were.

103
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:39,393
If this map refers to a 12th-century reality,

104
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:41,985
during the reign of Louis the VIIth,

105
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:44,598
it is difficult to apply it to later realities.

106
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:46,515
It was still clear in the 14th century 

107
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:51,049
that royal power wasn’t territorial

108
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,230
as demonstrates the cartography

109
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,150
done by Marie-Pierre Buscail in 2014

110
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,391
on the prisée, the price evaluation of 1332.

111
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,478
The prisée was a document

112
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:03,261
listing revenues located in the Gâtinais,

113
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,466
a little region to the south of Paris,

114
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,230
destined for the queen in case of the king’s death.

115
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:11,884
By looking at the local scale,

116
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:13,630
like here in the provostship of Janville,

117
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,302
we can well see how the powers exercised in different places were entangled. 
118
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:20,139
Here’s the king in black

119
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,273
as well as the Lord of Puiset in red

120
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:25,238
but also the Lord Bishop of Bonneval Abbey in purple.

121
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:30,156
Given the reticular form of royal rights,

122
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,080
it is impossible to assign

123
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,082
a territorial dimension to kings during this era,

124
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:37,713
an era which however saw the introduction 

125
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:40,882
of other fundamental characteristics of the national State.

126
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:43,745
Finally, it wasn’t before the French Revolution 

127
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,370
and Napoleonic Empire 

128
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,746
that the definition of the areas covered 

129
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:49,977
by departments and communes 

130
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,633
created truly local territories. 

131
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:55,790
The continuous juxtaposition of all of these spaces,

132
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,359
with a perfect joining between each sector, 

133
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,367
ensured that there were no empty spaces 

134
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,838
and that any point in space 

135
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:06,060
fell within the scope of only one public authority.

136
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,166
This contributed to territorialising the State.

137
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,680
This reasoning, that historicises the nation State, can be can be applied 

138
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,564
at a more local scale, 

139
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:21,162
to the city, which deserves to be conceptually distinguished from the urban. 

140
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:24,269
The urban, 

141
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,711
is one of three ways of managing distance 

142
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,466
through co-presence in addition to two other ways, 

143
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:32,245
transportation and telecommunication. 

144
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,527
Just like the other two ways, 

145
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,306
the urban has always existed 

146
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:42,874
and has been translated into variable spatial arrangements. 

147
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:44,864
The city is one of them.

148
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,585
The city can be defined 

149
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:53,558
as a temporary and particular configuration of urban space, 

150
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:57,301
erected as a powerful ideal model,

151
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:59,954
yet still capable of legitimising action.

152
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:03,417
However, the development of the city 

153
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,375
still remains a historical sequence, 

154
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,089
and is therefore temporally situated, 

155
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:12,857
generally from 1350 to 1950.

156
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:14,429


157
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:17,510
From the middle of the 14th century, 

158
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,223
every urban form has been thought of as a city.

159
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,796
The city at that time was thought of as a symbiotic unity AND a territory. 

160
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,918
The symbiotic unity was the civitas, 

161
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:31,686
which was a city made up of a political community 

162
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:34,165
endowed with its own personality,

163
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:37,508
and formalised through an institutionalised municipal government. 

164
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:39,852
The territory was the urbs,

165
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,414


166
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,802
whose material unification

167
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:46,787
through a barrier encircling it

168
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,265
helped to give it both 

169
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:50,981
the singularity of a place,

170
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,711
and a territorial envelope 

171
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:54,497
with a distinction between inside and outside.
172
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:57,421
Therefore, it could be said that the city 

173
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,779
is the urban conceived of as a territorial place.

174
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:05,814
Frescos painted by the Lorenzetti brothers in the Sienna city hall,  

175
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:08,440
from 1337 to 1339,

176
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,409
show for the first time

177
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:14,570
a territorialising bi-partition of humanised space. 

178
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,228
All of human beings’ spatial devices

179
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:19,846
can thus be summed up into an alternative pair, 

180
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,970
that of city and country,

181
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:24,976
the separation being realised by an urban fences.

182
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:28,562
However, this modern and territorialised conception of the city, 

183
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:30,796
which existed materially until the 20th century, 

184
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:32,846
and still exists today from an ideal point-of-view,

185
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:38,315
did not exist between the 8th and 14th centuries.

186
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:42,409
At least during this phase, which lasted for a long time,

187
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:46,564
whether it’s based on textual documentation or images,

188
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:48,433
everything shows that the urban

189
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:53,360
was fundamentally segmented and polynuclear. 

190
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:58,641
Obviously, there existed urban settlements characterised by co-presence,

191
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:02,285
implying socio-spatial density and diversity.

192
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:04,576
For example, this archeological site in the South-West of France, 

193
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:07,426
dating back to the 8th to 10th centuries,

194
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:11,518
shows a very high density of silos arranged in a series, 

195
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:14,011
destined for grain storage.

196
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:16,782
However, these populations didn’t have any residential structures

197
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,642
on the site where the silos were found ;

198
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:20,269
So we found silos but no living areas.

199
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:23,493
It was a bit like our modern-day supermarkets in commercial areas,

200
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:26,149
where nobody lives but where everyone goes to do their shopping. 

201
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:30,670
Finally the contemporary urban form, 

202
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:36,555
often qualified as broken, distended, diffuse, and geographically spread-out

203
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:43,555
has some points in common  

204
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:45,758
with the first medieval urban,

205
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:49,999
so mainly from 8th to 13-14th centuries.

206
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:56,149
Thirdly, after having visited the cases of the State and the City,

207
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:57,847
we could also talk about 

208
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:59,224
communities of inhabitants at the local level.

209
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:02,165
They also corresponded

210
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:04,495
to a special organization of the social sphere,

211
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:09,774
which appeared in Western Europe between the 10th and 12th centuries,

212
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:11,671
so in the Middle-Age,

213
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,497
and lasted until the end of the 18th century.

214
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:17,962
Inhabiting is not to be considered 

215
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:20,485
only in its material dimension, 

216
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:24,576
but as a set of social relationships of power.

217
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:30,973
Hence, communities of inhabitants allowed lords

218
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:37,973
to dominate people who were dependent on them in other ways than directly

219
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:42,787
and coercively, like it was the case in the high Middle Ages. 

220
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:48,279
From then on, the community of inhabitants will be divided in "feux"

221
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,083
that is to say in households, as we woud say today.

222
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,834
Especially from the High Middle Age 

223
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,069
this community of inhabitants is to constitute

224
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:58,476
a moral person

225
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:01,163
whose legal existence was recognized by lords

226
00:12:01,163 --> 00:12:04,719
in charters of liberties.

227
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:09,259
These "feux" were relatively autonomous in their daily lives, 

228
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:12,494
even materially, 

229
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:17,670
as suggested by this bird’s eye view of Rohrdorf in 1575-76, 

230
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,621
a Swabian village in Germany.

231
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:27,966
This community of inhabitants is represented 

232
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:30,639
as a block of autonomous "feux",

233
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,215
with each house having its own enclosed garden.

234
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,087
These households were gathered around the church, 

235
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:43,198
which was more-or-less located at the village centre,

236
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:47,340
Having the church in the village centre 

237
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,705
dates from the High Middle Ages, that is to say very recently.

238
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:53,891
Having the church in the village centre 

239
00:12:53,891 --> 00:13:00,891
was not at all an immemorial, eternal form of the rural landscape. 

240
00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:04,913
Like the State or the City, 

241
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:07,661
the community of inhabitants as a concept 

242
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:12,369
developed relatively later on, in the second half of the Middle Ages.

243
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:17,142
If the church was an element of the homogenization of these many households, 

244
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:21,273
the properly seigniorial factor also unified the agglomeration  

245
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:23,155
into a community of inhabitants.

246
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:24,998
In face of the lords

247
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:28,182
the community’s many households only constituted one being, 

248
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,738
one body,

249
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:32,017
which is also suggested by this picture. 

250
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:35,689
This view was created within the context of a trial between several lords

251
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,921
to know exactly in which part of this village 

252
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:43,259
the baron of Zimmern could exercise his justice. 

253
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:47,736
The unity of this community of inhabitants is suggested by the village fence, 

254
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:49,910
called an etter,

255
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:51,447
the alignment about which these lords disagreed. 

256
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:54,367


257
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:58,524
The black line defined the jurisdiction of baron of Zimmern 

258
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,522
according to his opponent, the Counts of Zollern, 

259
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:03,942
whereas the red line defined this same jurisdiction according to the barons of Zimmern. 

260
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:06,930
These demarcations were identified by a certain number of places, 

261
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,651
such as trees, doors, fences, and so forth,

262
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:11,367
numbered starting from one..

263
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:15,120
The other unifying elements of these households, which were otherwise autonomous, 

264
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,068
correspond to particular points in space, 

265
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:20,251
all of which were meeting points: 

266
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,639
that is to say points of polarization in social life, 

267
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,429
under the auspices of ecclesiastical and seigniorial powers. 

268
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:29,364
The church, the pendulum wells, or yet the village square

269
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:32,848
which served as a place for the proclamation of seigniorial decisions,

270
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:35,343
and where seigniorial justice was administrated.

271
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:37,294
These various hand-drawn objects

272
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,230
were either places of polarized movements,

273
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,155
such as the church, well, and meeting place, 

274
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:46,777
or places preventing crosspassing, such as the etter gates: 

275
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:49,781
all of them refer thus to constrained movements.

276
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:55,521
What such a figurative representation 

277
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,425
of a community of inhabitants hardly shows

278
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:03,369
are the dependents’ movements within this particular space, 

279
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,517
which were linked to the seigniorial domination.

280
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:11,252
In fact, one of the core interests of the community of inhabitants 

281
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:16,727
was that it assumed, at least partially,  

282
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,467
the distribution and collection of seigniorial dues,

283
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:23,731
and that, through physical and ritualized movements of goods and people,

284
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:27,998
this collection objectified and made the holders of seigniorial authority  

285
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:30,239
visible to everybody.

286
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,529
The community of inhabitants 

287
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,735
was a structure for the seigniorial appropriation 

288
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:35,586
of rights over a space:

289
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,856
but this appropriation was achieved by the dependents themselves,

290
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,489
at once spatially, via perambulation through the territory, 

291
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,973
and temporally according to a specific calendar.

292
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:50,769
On this actual photograph of signposts 

293
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:53,815
from a French commune in Ambourville, Normandy, 

294
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:58,357
the arrows symbolize the spatio-temporal movement 

295
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,744
structuring a community of inhabitants. 

296
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:03,368
First, we can see the present direction of City Hall 

297
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:08,097
which is the same direction as the church, and opposite that of the castle. 

298
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:11,508
This makes manifest the “historical victory” of the clergy 

299
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:13,137
over the secular lords

300
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:15,946
from the point-of-view of the structural development of the community of inhabitants:

301
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:18,672
the church more than the castle

302
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:23,420
was therefore the principal pole for community densification since the end of the Middle Ages.

303
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:27,990
Moreover, the diverging arrows correspond to specific movements in space.

304
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,483
It suggests that medieval mastery over space firstly worked 

305
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:34,158
through a regulation of movement

306
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:36,965
that is to say through imposed rhythms of spatial usage:

307
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:39,697
when, how often and how you had go to a given spot. 

308
00:16:40,803 --> 00:16:43,615
Social domination and internal promotions were achieved

309
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:46,611
through the frequency imposed upon movements, 

310
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:48,116
going, for example, from a pure and simple prohibition 

311
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:50,066
all the way up to a coerced daily frequency; 

312
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,460
through the scope of movements,

313
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,232
from a purely domestic stay to a faraway pilgrimage;

314
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:58,052
through the ritualization and social values and so on.

315
00:16:58,052 --> 00:16:59,722
with which these were achieved, and so on.

316
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:01,774
The internal structure of the mighty group

317
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:04,777
resulted from the establishment of priorities between lords in this regulation of mobility:

318
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:09,696
the more one could spatio-temporally regulate the movement of others,
  
319
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,512
(including other lords) to their own profit, and the less their own movements 

320
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:15,675
were regulated from outside, the more dominant position one could have.

321
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:21,734
These arrows not only represent a spatial phenomenon, 

322
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:24,752
for example a direction to take or a distance to cross,

323
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,611
but also a temporal phenomenon, 

324
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,458
such as the length of the journey, 

325
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,972
 which is today only indicated 

326
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:34,556
for marginal social activities 

327
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:37,940
such as hiking trails. 

328
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:41,369
However, the movement is as much about time as it is about space

329
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:42,995
in the same way as co-presence is as much a spatial phenomenon

330
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,668
as it is a temporal one. 

331
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:50,382
Overall, the social interpretation 

332
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,272
of the emergence of these communities of inhabitants 

333
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:55,280
is completely different from that which is normally drawn. 

334
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,127
There was no local proto-democracy 

335
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:02,117
bringing seigniorial authority into question; 

336
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:03,576
it was not a liberation, 

337
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:04,934
but to the contrary, 

338
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:08,881
a system of collective self-disciplining, 

339
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:12,343
allowing for the maintenance of seigniorial domination over dependents 

340
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:15,714
through specific spatio-temporal regulations. 

341
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:20,107
These regulations were interiorized and effectively achieved by the dependents themselves, 

342
00:18:20,107 --> 00:18:24,763
which has been shown to be a much more effective method of control 

343
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,987
than merely coercion by the mighty. Social organisation historicised in this way

344
00:18:29,987 --> 00:18:31,485
encourages us to more broadly intersect 

345
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,766
the spatial and temporal dimensions of social facts, 

346
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,364
not only within a given time, as we saw for the Middle Ages, 

347
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:40,983
but also within the longer temporality of transmission,

348
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:43,183
or yet between different times. 

349
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:45,758
First of all, 

350
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:46,800
we’ll see how in a certain way 

351
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,019
the past doesn’t exist, 

352
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,328
and that over the long term

353
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:52,128
the heritage of past societies 

354
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:54,400
cannot be preserved as such

355
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,627
but must be re-actualised, 

356
00:18:56,627 --> 00:18:59,587
so as to both be transmitted and transformed.

357
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:02,188
Then, we’ll see how space can produce the social, 

358
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:05,752
or in other words be an operator for spatialities, 

359
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:08,689
through spatio-temporal connections and recurrences.
