00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:08,183
This photo shows the ruins of the burned-out village of Oradour-sur-Glane, 

2
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:12,183
in Limousin, France, whose entire population of men, women, and children 

3
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:16,783
were atrociously massacred on June 10th, 1944 by SS troops. 

4
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:21,338
There rapidly developed both a local and national movement to preserve these ruins 

5
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:23,728
in their original state in order to give witness to the horror of Nazi barbarity.

6
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:25,058
It shows how, 

7
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,538
in Oradour, life brutally came to a halt that day. 

8
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,408
It seemed essential

9
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:33,466
then to show a place frozen in time, as if suddenly fossilised 

10
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:39,706
by the historical cataclysm which had seized it. Yet, no one had imagined at the time the  

11
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,706
effects that the site’s own inertia would have, a site which itself had not died in 1944.

12
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:47,836
People still continued to pass by along the road to Oradour; 

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,700
peasants still owned barns where they stored their agricultural machinery;  

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,500
families still had gardens where they grew vegetables… 

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,330
In short, the ordinary material things of life 

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,270
continued in Orador despite the traumatic event. 

17
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,850
So, one of the principle measures to accompany the ruins’ recognition 

18
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,270
as a national historical monument in 1946 

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,150
was enclosing it within a barrier

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,290
and completely forbidding access and thoroughfare. 

21
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:20,348
To preserve Oradour as a historical monument, 

22
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:24,588
Oradour had to cease being a place of human occupation.

23
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:28,936
Those responsible for the administration of historical monuments 

24
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,806
to whom the project had been entrusted had not anticipated

25
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:33,506
the growing importance that the maintenance work would take

26
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:39,526
in order to preserve the site, as soon as Oradour was completed. 

27
00:01:39,526 --> 00:01:42,276
At first, only minor maintenance work had been planned, 

28
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:44,916
such as weed removal, or small repairs in the stonework,

29
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:48,276
to be carried out by communal employees. 

30
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:49,376


31
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:54,876
Yet from 1946 on, 

32
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:58,776
a real building programme had to be launched,

33
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:02,787
with more and more work needed every year: 


34
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:07,517
walls which were falling down and exposed to storms had to be fixed,

35
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,727
and rotting wood over door lintels had to be replaced by pieces of concrete…

36
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:16,127
In the same way, as soon as the gardens were gone, 

37
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:21,377
which had nonetheless contributed to the site’s upkeep, 

38
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:26,457
there was no other solution than to create large, grassy spaces 

39
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:30,712
in order to control the rampant growth of bushes and trees. 

40
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:34,712
Over time, and year by year, Oradour took on the surrealist physiognomy

41
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:38,656
of a fabricated, contemporary park of ruins,

42
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:41,856
in which restorative work progressively was substituted for the original elements.

43
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:45,951
The preservation of Doctor Descourteaux’s car

44
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:47,741
is without doubt the most striking example 

45
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:52,921
of the impossibility of fixing archeological constructions in the past.

46
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,069
This car was at first supposed to recall the circumstances 

47
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,429
in which Doctor Descourteaux had to abandon his car on the spot, 

48
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,839
upon arriving in Oradour and immediately being carried away by SS troops to be killed. 

49
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:06,539
The car has remained there ever since, 

50
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,573
but what is striking today is that 

51
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,163
it resembles less and less 

52
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:14,743
what would be expected of a real car: 

53
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:18,953
since 1944, all of the paint has disappeared, leaving the oxidised metal visible,

54
00:03:18,953 --> 00:03:22,953
which had to be stabilised and protected using an anti-corrosion polish. 

55
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,229
Small elements such as window-wipers and rear-view mirrors 

56
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:29,509
are no longer there, as well as some of the windows and the seat lining. 

57
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:33,985
The tires have literally disintegrated; 

58
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:38,405
the car’s carcass now sits on the ground directly on its chassis

59
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:41,205
a bit awry, while the base of the doors has fallen onto the pavement.

60
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:44,525
What is visible today is no longer a car from the 1940s;

61
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:47,265
it’s an archeological vestige of a car from the 1940s, 

62
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,867
such as can be presented in the 2000s,

63
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:55,037
that is to say that it has changed from 1944 to 2014.

64
00:03:56,257 --> 00:04:00,167
Therefore, whatever we may do, the past continues to exist 

65
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,777
and to be transformed in the present.

66
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:05,107
It is because we believe in a unilinear and sequential historical time, 

67
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:09,587
in which every temporality follows that which precedes it, 

68
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:13,587
that we are persuaded that Oradour must be preserved in its original state. 

69
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,277
But we don’t see that this historical time, which we want to remain fixed,  

70
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:20,527
is not the archeological time of the vestiges themselves. 

71
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,187
In fact, to preserve the remains of the past “in their original state”, 

72
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:26,917
it takes a whole lot of additions foreign to them, 

73
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,840
that is to say it takes reinventing them.

74
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:33,884
Thus, vestiges from the past can travel through time 

75
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:38,794
and arrive at our knowledge of them only by being transformed.

76
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:42,134
Exactly the same observation could be made about another object, more ancient yet, 

77
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:43,684
that of Roman centuriation.

78
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:49,844
In Antiquity, centuriation was a surveying technique used to create 

79
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:53,244
a subdivision of land for colonists, 

80
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:56,724
most often veteran soldiers, 
 

81
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:58,824
in a land conquered by the Roman army. 

82
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:02,194
They were created by regular squared grids,

83
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:04,794
formed of squares about 700 metres to a side,

84
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,814
and which depended on a main axis indicating the general orientation, 

85
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:10,514
which was called the cardo maximus. 

86
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:14,514
These grids exist in present landscapes

87
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:18,514
and can stretch on for several hundreds of square kilometres, 

88
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:22,514
such as in Italy, as these satellite photos of Venezia show, 

89
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:27,044
which is a landscape presently known under the name of graticolato romano,

90
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:30,396
or in Romagna, Cesena.

91
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,866
A simple first question is, from when does this centuriated landscape date? 

92
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:37,246
Classically, the founding moment is given,

93
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:38,246
that of centuriation’s implementation,

94
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,556
principally dating from the era of the Roman Republic

95
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:43,436
from 509 BC to 27 BC,

96
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:47,436
saying that centuriation has been more-or-less well “preserved”

97
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:51,436
or “fossilised” from Antiquity to the present day. 

98
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:55,436
But in the constitutive elements of the squared grids visible from these aerial photos 

99
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:59,926
from the beginning of the 21st century, not everything dates from Antiquity, far from it.

100
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:04,766
Even better, certain sections of centuriation which are several hundreds of metres long, 

101
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:09,695
have been excavated by archaeologists.

102
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,700
However, either they don’t reveal any antique vestiges but only a ditch from modern times,

103
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,280
as in the case of centuriation B Orange, Bartras site,

104
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,700
or there is a present materialisation along the ancient axis, 

105
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,759
such as a road, while the Roman ground is buried 

106
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,598
under 3 to 5 metres of sediment,

107
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:29,048
as in the case of Lugo, Romagna

108
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:33,748
Therefore in certain places, the axes of centuriation awaited the Modern

109
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:36,728
or even Contemporary era to be materialised, that is to say, to be imprinted onto the soil, 

110
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,818
in the form of a ditch or a road.

111
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:40,298
In Antiquity these axes only existed as survey lines, 

112
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:43,978
without a material basis, so they were merely sight-lines. 

113
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:48,298
They only became material limits, 

114
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:52,298
such as drainage ditches or roads, 

115
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:55,568
 at a much later date, without relationship, then, 

116
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:56,988
to the ancient structure to which it referred.

117
00:06:56,988 --> 00:07:00,988
Therefore we have the choice of understanding this question in two different ways.

118
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:04,988
One, the classic understanding, says that what we see on the present map is Roman, 

119
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:07,068
and that it is inertia that explains its survival, 

120
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:10,068
which is the fixed notion of linear continuity and durability. 

121
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:14,068
Another way of understanding it, a new one,

122
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:17,438
says that the perfect planimetry which can be seen on the maps of Padua or Cesena 

123
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,438
are creations over time

124
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,828
and that they probably didn’t exist in those forms in Antiquity,

125
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:25,828
that they are as much Medieval, Modern, and Contemporary than Roman. 

126
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:30,268
So we have to replace the idea of survival 

127
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:33,868
by that of construction over time. 

128
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:36,868
The explanation that this is the form’s fossilisation or an inertia

129
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:40,843
doesn’t work anymore because these spaces have not been unused since Ancient times

130
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:44,843
quite on the contrary. We must therefore consider

131
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:50,273
a diachronic reading of centuriation, highlighting Medieval and Modern interventions 

132
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:55,633
which have reactualised the system’s overall form, or have even extended it.

133
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,852
In both cases, in Oradour as with the centuriations, if the form inherited 

134
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:04,762
from a previous social configuration is still present,

135
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:07,492
it’s not only because previous societies have agreed to produce such or such configuration,

136
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:12,602
such as destroying a village or assigning conquered land to colonists.

137
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:18,102
It is also subsequently because the following societies have, 

138
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:21,252
whether consciously or not, replayed the inherited spatial device

139
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,602
through other social configurations. 

140
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:27,602
These new configurations re-actualised the inherited forms.

141
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:32,791
To do this, they transmitted the previous form while giving it a new meaning, 

142
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:38,218
for example by turning it into a heritage site in Oradour,

143
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:42,218
or into a drainage operation during the Medieval or Modern eras, as with the centuriations. 

144
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:47,683
This is where the idea comes from that the past as such doesn’t exist,  

145
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:52,173
but that it has been transmitted to us all the way through to the present by way of 

146
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:56,453
a series of intermediary moments which are just as necessary as the initial moment was. 

147
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:01,184
Therefore, we suggest formalising this idea by the concept of “transformission”, 

148
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:05,504
meaning that every configuration inherited from the past can only be transmitted 

149
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:09,734
if it is reused,to different ends, and thus necessarily 

150
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:12,174
more-or-less reorganised, transformed. 


151
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:16,422
With the examples of Oradour and the centuriations, 

152
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:20,182
we’ve seen that the relationship to time is not more linear

153
00:09:20,182 --> 00:09:23,412
than the relationship to space is isotropic.

154
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,867
To this must be added the fact that 

155
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:28,747
history can be consciously mobilised  

156
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:30,307
as an efficient spatial resource.

157
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:33,307
Therefore, we’re now going to see

158
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,947
how spatio-temporal connections produce the social.

159
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:42,144
In spatial planning projects today, there’s sometimes

160
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:43,934
an explicit desire to bring the present closer to a time

161
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:48,454
very far removed in the past or even in space.

162
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:54,124
Different temporal states, as well as discontinuous states for the same space,

163
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:58,514
can thus be directly connected. 

164
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:03,395
These connections, as artificial as they may be 

165
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,848
since they neglect all of the effective intermediate phases of transmission, are themselves

166
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:13,085
powerful operators of spatiality. They justify the decisions made at the present moment 

167
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:18,105
and thus participate in the production of a new, socio-spatial configuration.


168
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,775
During the Fascist era in Italy, 

169
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:22,735
urban planning projects for the city of Rome offer 

170
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:26,735
good examples of this time-compression,

171
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:30,735
which put Mussolini’s Rome into direct relationship with Roman antiquity.

172
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:35,567
Great clearances aimed at putting the capital on stage, 

173
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,097
and mass pro-regime demonstrations are organised.

174
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,907
In particular, the creation of the Via dell’Impero 

175
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:45,287
between 1930 and 1933, which is now the Via dei Fori Imperiali, built right through 

176
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:49,807
the middle of the vestiges of the Forum, allowed the regime to link the Piazza Venezia  

177
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:54,409
to the Coliseum.- Palazzo Venezia was the epicentre for the new seat of power :

178
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:58,409
it was transformed into Mussolini’s residence, while the Monument to Vittorio Emmanuelle II 

179
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:02,409
became in 1926 the Altar of the Fatherland. This project carried out to the detriment of


180
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:06,719
archeological preservation presents the Fascist regime as the heir of Roman Emperors. 


181
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:10,674
This production of centrality and urban space

182
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:14,984
is based on the compression method. 

183
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:19,234
It is a discursive urban planning procedure that legitimates the present power 

184
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:22,984
by bringing the contemporary stratum closer to the glorious strata of the past, 

185
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:26,294
in this case an ancient stratum, 

186
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:27,894
and by erasing any intermediate transmission.

187
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:32,435
On another note, heritage making also creates

188
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:36,195
a connection between temporalities, which are often discontinuous, 

189
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,195
and we can perceive the desire to remove a section of space out of its  

190
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:41,215
« normal » evolution so as to enable it to be transmitted.

191
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:48,295
Beyond spatio-temporal connections, which are conscientious reconstructions, 

192
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:52,295
the ability space has to produce the social 

193
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:56,295
and thus to indirectly be a social operator, is also related to certain 

194
00:11:56,517 --> 00:12:00,517
recurrent spatio-temporalities, which for example can be observed at the global scale.


195
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:05,698
Progressions of spatial modifications which can be generalised 

196
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:08,538
starting from a precise historical case do in fact exist. 

197
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:12,258
Regular successions of synchronic configurations 

198
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:14,978
can thus be identified and found again in very different contexts. 

199
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:19,468
For example, the evolution of the Mediterranean basin 

200
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:23,468
from early to late Roman Empire, along with the shift 

201
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:26,068
in its centre of gravity from Rome to Constantinople,

202
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:28,368
can be resumed in the following manner:

203
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:34,898
At the age of early Empire, Rome was in the centre of its space. 

204
00:12:34,898 --> 00:12:38,898
In fact, this central position was the inheritance of two successively dominant spaces, 

205
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,856
Greece and then Rome.

206
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:45,277
Then there were asymmetric external pressures 

207
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:49,277
from the so-called barbarian invasions starting in the mid-3rd century.

208
00:12:49,277 --> 00:12:53,277
Faced with this threat, people returned to their old home

209
00:12:53,277 --> 00:12:58,397
and the capital was displaced to Constantinople in 330.

210
00:12:58,397 --> 00:13:03,322
This caused a decentring and stretching of maximal distances.
 

211
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:07,322
From then on, ruptures were created along the offset boundary, 

212
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:11,322
with a new wave of barbarian invasions starting in the 5th century.

213
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:16,215
This finally produced two types of inherited spaces, one which was fragmented, 

214
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:21,925
in Western Europe where a mosaic of Romano-German kingdoms were created, 

215
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,305
and the other a hardened space, in the Byzantine Empire in the East.


216
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,413
This progression, which can be called the Constantinople principle, 

217
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:33,053
can thus be generalised in the following form: “central position,  

218
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,779
decentring based on a threat, fragmentation or hardening”

219
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:42,299
which recalls the general outline decontextualising the principle.

220
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:46,569
However, it is interesting to see that this principle also works for another case, 

221
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:51,229
completely different in space and in time : Ancient Egypt during the three millennia  

222
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:56,706
before our era. This case even allows us to consider complex spatio-temporal dynamics.

223
00:13:56,882 --> 00:14:02,042
Traditionally, Upper and Lower Egypt were contrasted

224
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:06,982
each having  its own capital location: number two at North being Tanis, or Avaris; 

225
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:08,802
and number three in the south being Thebes. 

226
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:11,022
When Egypt was united, the capital became the pivot

227
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:14,992
between Upper and Lower Egypt: this is number one, Memphis, or Licht.

228
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:19,272
That is moreover, Cairo’s location today.

229
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:23,635
The recurrent evolution of Egyptian space can be schematised in four steps:

230
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:27,775
A = Egypt was united and governed from the pivot between Upper and Lower Egypt

231
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:32,811
B = This unification allowed the Egyptian Empire to become powerful, 

232
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,355
and thus conquer lands towards the south, in Nubia, 

233
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,355
or towards the north-east, for example in the 15th century BC.

234
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:42,355
C = The North became distant and ran the risk of gaining independence,

235
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:47,594
which caused a power vacuum. If this internal depression in Egyptian space  

236
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:52,240
had come at the same time as an external pressure, there would have been a risk of invasion. 

237
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,960
Faced with the threat, the seat of power was displaced towards the North according 

238
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,429
to the Constantinople principle. D = In turn, the southern part of Egypt became independent. 

239
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:04,749
If the disunited empire  hadn’t resisted, Egypt would have been conquered. 

240
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:09,065
In the North, a decentered capital represented the invading power, with the conquest 

241
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:12,265
starting in the south. et la conquête se fait à partir du sud.


242
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:15,815
The Egyptian spatial configurations can thus be resumed in four simple types:

243
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:19,558
A = A united Egypt, a strong and conquering State

244
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:24,015
B = A divided Egypt, but only divided into two States, capable of resisting 

245
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:26,135
external pressures for at least a certain time

246
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:30,883
C = A reunited Egypt, but weakened and submitted to external pressures

247
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:36,236
D = A politically fragmented Egypt dominated from outside.

248
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:42,749
However over time, these configurations could be observed 

249
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:49,109
to progress several times in this order: D => B => A => B, or C => D

250
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:51,789
This progression corresponded to what we call, in Egyptian history, 

251
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:55,589
an “empire” (B=>A=>C), framed by intermediate periods (D).

252
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,982
We could thus summarise this into a model of Egyptian history,

253
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:01,752
which progressed in a complex but recurrent manner, 

254
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,852
according to the Constantinople principle:

255
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:07,922
The first rectangle represents the Ancient Egyptian Empire 2700-2200 BC.

256
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,519


257
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,199
The second represents the Middle Egyptian Empire 2033-1786 (2000-1800)

258
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,829

259
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:20,259
The third represents the New Egyptian Empire 1500-1000

260
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,089
Et entre chacun des ces trois moments,
on a une phase D.

261
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:27,057
These repeatable progressions can thus create spatio-temporal scenarios, 

262
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:30,287
or in other words geo-historical evolutions. 

263
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:34,287
Their recurrence in different circumstances shows that

264
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:36,297
space is an essential actor in history. 

265
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:39,361
Clearly this must not be viewed as deterministic, 

266
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:43,495
but only as a way of showing that spatial configuration is one of the elements

267
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:46,375
which comes into play when some decision is made,  

268
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:50,655
for example in the choice of a capital.
 

269
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:54,965
It is this sometimes important role of spatial positioning which explains 

270
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:58,025
the regularity in certain spatio-temporal combinations over history’s long duration.

271
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,640
In conclusion, let us summarise several lessons:

272
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,910
1. Certain spatial configurations, such as the city and the State, 

273
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,610
can be historicised. 

274
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:12,642
They are not unsurpassable and invariable frameworks of humanity,

275
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:16,752
but spatial sequences, in these cases territorialised,

276
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:18,682
limited in time, generally since the end of the Middle Ages up 

277
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:22,207
until the 20th century. 

278
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:26,598
Such an intellectual deconstruction should allow us to accept the changes 

279
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:30,598
in these Modern but inherited political frameworks,

280
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:33,758
and to accept them not as a tragedy,

281
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,248
but as an inherent consequence of the human condition.

282
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:40,287
2. The past does not exist as such,

283
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:44,777
but is always made known to the present through a process of transmission

284
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:49,197
which necessarily causes its transformation, re-actualisation, and reinvention. 

285
00:17:49,197 --> 00:17:51,347

286
00:17:51,677 --> 00:17:53,277
For example, it would be better to think of development projects,

287
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:55,517
not as lasting but as transformable.

288
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:59,647
Whatever money, energy, and power 

289
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:03,127
is put into a development project, it will only be temporary 

290
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:06,917
since the social forces which created it won’t exist eternally, 

291
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:10,917
and the project will last only if it is re-appropriated and transformed. 

292
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:15,858
It would thus be better to assume the obsolescence of spatial amenities 

293
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:19,028
and encourage their capacity for re-appropriation rather than to seek 

294
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:20,918
to lengthen their lifespan.

295
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:25,451
3. Modes of articulation between space-times 

296
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:29,171
allow for a better understanding of social dynamics

297
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:33,171
than when only one spatial or temporal dimension of society is considered. 

298
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:36,301
This can occur either by synchrony,

299
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:40,111
that is a social community conceived of as a special structure 

300
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,741
for the appropriation of a space-time, or by diachrony,

301
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:46,461
in spatio-temporal recurrences and connections.
