1
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:06,559
As we've said in the first session,

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,184
human bodies have three 
major spatial characteristics.

3
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:15,188
First, they are multisensorial sensors.

4
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:17,451
Secondly, they are mobile

5
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:22,157
in contrast with some objects
and environments they interact with.

6
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:24,992
And finally, they're vulnerable.

7
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:28,964
They can be destroyed
either by natural causes

8
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:35,153
or social operators, at the risk
of the annihilation of their ‘inhabitant’

9
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:37,670
that is, the human being.

10
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:46,317
We can then consider the human body 
as the primary environment of the self.

11
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:53,634
It is an environment in the dual sense 
that it conditions the actors agency

12
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:59,103
and is simultaneously 
modifiable by this actor.

13
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:02,995
Our psyche is made possible 
by the existence

14
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:06,269
of our body and especially by our brain.

15
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:13,170
However, we know how important 
ourselves’ feedback is on our body,

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,943
the psychosomatic dimension 
of illness is now identified as crucial

17
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:24,984
and placebos seem to figure 
among the most efficient medicines.

18
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:30,336
My body preconditions me 
but I can change my body too.

19
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:37,570
Given this body is a multisensorial,
mobile and fragile device,

20
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,826
it constitutes a major component 
of our spatial style.

21
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:46,990
Although it is not technically
unthinkable, it is difficult for us

22
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,694
to imagine a body-free way of life.

23
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:56,448
Our spatiality is, at least so far, 
profoundly impacted

24
00:01:56,448 --> 00:02:02,341
by the fact that our body operates 
as a pervasive, invasive mediator

25
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:05,118
in our relationship to the outer world.

26
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:07,331
One of the most significant aspects

27
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:10,580
of what is often called
the digital revolution,

28
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,639
is that we can more easily keep our body
off an increasing part of our activities,

29
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:21,538
including those that require interactions
with objects or other humans.

30
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:27,588
The huge importance of large spectrum 
sex-oriented individual performances

31
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:31,337
that take place on the web is
particularly intriguing.

32
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,340
This tendency towards 
the de-embodying of interactions

33
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,271
helps us understand, 
through its opposite,

34
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:46,709
how critical the presence of bodies is 
to define the uniqueness of public space.

35
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,988
We'll examine this point in session five.

36
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,173
Let's keep in memory, anyway,
the simple fact

37
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:58,440
that human bodies are not alone,

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,153
but often in interaction
with other human bodies.

39
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:09,044
In his work, namely his famous book,
‘The Hidden Dimension’, published in 1971,

40
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:16,583
Edward T. Hall proposed as early as 1963,
the following definition of ‘proxemy’:

41
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:44,227
In this perspective,
inter-body distances are to be considered

42
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:48,133
at least according 
to two different scales:

43
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:53,570
First, at their level, 
either contact, remoteness,

44
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,761
convergence, or divergence, 
border or a continuum between bodies.

45
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,263
Second, at the societal scale.

46
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:07,139
Hall, and other scholars,
have tried to identify

47
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,114
contact and non-contact societies,

48
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:14,464
and this empirical field has still
to be seriously documented.

49
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:20,314
As Erving Goffman has eloquently shown,
the arrangement of bodies

50
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:24,523
is strongly related to the general
organization of society,

51
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:30,542
and space turns out to be 
an excellent intellectual vehicle

52
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:34,524
to explore individual 
society relationships.

53
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:45,421
With and beyond the bodies,
there is a spatial dimension

54
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:48,163
to this emergence 
of the individual actor.

55
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,953
Let's introduce the notion 
of spatial capital.

56
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:57,890
Spatial capital is a species 
of social capital,

57
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,466
non reducible to other species.

58
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:05,468
When using spatial practice 
it provides social value

59
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:10,989
by offering competence in their relations
to spaces and spatialities.

60
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:15,877
This competence is obtained 
through both heritages of

61
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:19,564
the experience of places 
or geographical practices,

62
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:25,526
and capability: the aptitude 
to manage new spatial situations.

63
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:30,863
Spatial capital is a significant component
of an actor’s social capital

64
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,167
and can be exchanged with other capitals.

65
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:39,975
A space may have spatial capital too,
in terms of stock and flows.

66
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:44,515
For example, a city 
can take advantage of its location

67
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:47,630
and develop its relations
with other spaces.

68
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:54,863
It can also foster its attractiveness
towards various spatial actors.

69
00:05:56,743 --> 00:06:01,520
By putting forward the idea 
that there is not one,

70
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,445
but at least three types of capitals

71
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:07,445
to define the social position
of an individual,

72
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:10,860
Pierre Bourdieu opened up a discussion

73
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,618
that can serve to explore the complexity 
of sociological contexts.

74
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:20,863
The notion of spatial capital is located
within this perspective.

75
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:23,688
It allows the taking account 
of an integration

76
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:28,568
of both stocks of experience 
and acting capacities.
