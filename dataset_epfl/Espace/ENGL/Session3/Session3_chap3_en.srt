1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,160
We've seen in Session 2

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,130
that the construction 
of a World society is at stake

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,877
in the current globalization process.

4
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:20,153
We've equally seen in this session
that the emergence of individual actors

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:24,860
paves the way to a novel,
post-communal era:

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,550
a society of individuals.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,797
If we combine these two
statements, we'll obtain:

8
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:35,565
emergence of actors as individuals,

9
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:42,230
society of individuals 
plus globalization, World-society,

10
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:46,781
equal World-society of individuals.

11
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:55,506
The individual and the World 
entertain a strong emerging relationship

12
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:59,271
to the detriment of communal allegiances.

13
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:03,230
In such ways, the individuals 
make their mark

14
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,448
on the stage of the World’s globalization.

15
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:10,763
Conversely, the individual 
as a relevant social reality

16
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:13,786
is also at stake in this event.

17
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:17,616
The globalized individual,
is not the same individual

18
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:21,413
who developed in Europe 
and in North America

19
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:25,552
during the 19th and the 20th centuries.

20
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:30,510
The individual is an active operator
in the globalization process,

21
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,035
especially through their mobility,
and their practice of telecommunication.

22
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:41,797
However, this process is 
simultaneously changing their nature.

23
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:47,613
The notion of identity may help
an understanding of what's happening.

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,890
Norbert Elias was the first author 
to associate,

25
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,422
for fundamental theoretical reasons,

26
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:01,586
the emergence of the individual
and globalization.

27
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:05,566
In a society of individuals,
the individual became

28
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:09,606
the primary actor of globalization.

29
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:12,996
Following Elias, the society 
of individuals

30
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:18,516
and the World-society are in fact
one and the same thing.

31
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,136
It's true that there can be
a society of individuals,

32
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:28,076
as distinct from communal societies,
at other levels than the world.

33
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:34,029
However, on the one hand,
globalization contributes to relativizing

34
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:38,529
the national, infra-national, or even
trans-national levels

35
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:42,869
at which communal ties have operated.

36
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:48,857
On the other hand, 
and in a symmetrical fashion,

37
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:53,427
the World presents itself
as a space of freedom

38
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:56,184
open to new modes of organization

39
00:02:56,184 --> 00:03:00,574
in which individual logics 
can assert themselves.

40
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:07,055
However, let's say that these types 
of statements do not validate

41
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:15,861
methodological individualism, or radical 
interpretations of the liberal legacy.

42
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:19,826
Saying that the role
and weight of individuals

43
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:24,996
is increasing doesn't imply
that society is losing its relevance.

44
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:33,116
On the contrary, 
in ‘Gemeinschaft’-type societies,

45
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:37,812
communal groups not only take in hand 
the destinies of individuals,

46
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:42,059
but also every single aspect 
of social solidarity.

47
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:47,422
By contrast, in systems
with strong individuals,

48
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:51,317
social relations are expressed
through a multitude

49
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,933
of institutions - state or non-state -, 
such as

50
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:58,351
social security, education, 
political life, and so on.

51
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:01,848
This appears everywhere, 
in the developed world,

52
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:05,545
including the United States, 
where it is only

53
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:09,624
the classical, European-style
polarity towards the state

54
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,671
that is relatively diminished.

55
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:17,538
It is thus logical that the 
globalized individual

56
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:20,792
can no longer be 
the same individual as the one

57
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:25,084
that slowly emerged from the heart 
of social configurations

58
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:27,962
that structurally limited its role.

59
00:04:28,322 --> 00:04:33,220
The geopolitical state, 
the most accomplished communal structure,

60
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,379
consumed and destroyed 
the life of its subjects,

61
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:42,369
while imposing brutal limits
to personal fulfillment.

62
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:45,609
At the same time,
however,

63
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:48,246
the emergence of the 
welfare state,

64
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,779
and the establishment
of a democracy

65
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,569
that was explicitly designed
as a response

66
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,986
to the ‘blood tax’ provided
by ordinary inhabitants

67
00:04:57,986 --> 00:05:02,046
offered dramatically new opportunities
for the emergence

68
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:04,465
of individual autonomy.

69
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,739
The new times of individual identities
are prospering

70
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:12,889
with this relativization of allegiances

71
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,810
and of the scales of these allegiances.

72
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,015
We then can call alter-identities

73
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,755
the global individual's mode 
of identification.

74
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:33,253
The encounter between
a theoretical hypothesis

75
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:35,873
about the empowerment 
of individuals

76
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:40,021
and the observation of 
a historically-situated, empirical reality

77
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:44,045
leads to suggest that the notion 
of alter-identity -

78
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:47,172
in Latin, ‘alter’ means ‘other’ -

79
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:53,435
signifies both the hybridization of 
otherness and identity,

80
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:58,336
as well as an alternative way to deal 
with the usual ways

81
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:02,865
of managing their relations of the self
with the others.

82
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:07,219
Said differently, what this 
term is about is simultaneously

83
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:12,602
the us-them, and the me-you couples.

84
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:18,916
Beyond the abundance and richness
of theoretical debates

85
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:22,171
about idenitites in geography, 
it may be argued

86
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:26,978
that the alter-identity framework
can be a useful boost

87
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:32,576
and can allow us to go beyond
notions of intersectionalism

88
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:36,786
or situatedness, 
which appear to be

89
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:40,761
just a refinement of the
classical structuralist perspective.

90
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,717
In ‘Oneself as Another’, 
in 1992, Paul Ricoeur

91
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:58,523
analyzed two different types of identity:
‘mêmeté’(sameness) and ‘ipséité’ (selfness).

92
00:06:58,523 --> 00:07:02,796
In the first case, 
a being whose essential features

93
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:05,262
remain identical forever,
94
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:11,808
the fixedness and differentiation
towards another is fundamental.

95
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:16,528
In the second case, 
the identification process

96
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:21,228
constructs itself through 
an iterative dynamic

97
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:24,218
between an individual 
and the outer world.

98
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:28,868
Even though this reflection 
was formulated by Ricoeur

99
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:33,506
without reference to history
and to recent evolution

100
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:35,954
of contemporary societies,

101
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:38,550
it's arguable that ‘ipséité’

102
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,538
individual psyches
is more developed today.

103
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:49,824
The decline of automatic 
allegiances creates hybrids

104
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:53,983
combining ‘Gemeinschaft’ (communal)
and ‘Gesellschaft’(individual)-type elements.

105
00:07:54,684 --> 00:08:00,542
In fact, even if this occurs
in a certain state of confusion,

106
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:04,073
and even if 
spectacular communal movements

107
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:07,432
such as: Fundamental Christianity, 
Radical Islamism,

108
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:11,043
European, North
or South American Nationalisms,

109
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:14,680
and African ethnic conflicts
occupy the front stage,

110
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,660
the progressive emancipation
from non-chosen

111
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,396
and irreversible group allegiances
is clearly the major event.

112
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:32,376
This great crossing from a world
to another represents a major issue

113
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:35,780
for the anthropology of hybridization.

114
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:42,626
Increases in the individuals’ leeway, 
in the face of their environments’

115
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:48,486
constraints and resources, 
affect the very construction of identity.

116
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:53,019
This evolves into 
two converging directions.

117
00:08:53,505 --> 00:08:57,697
A more marked lifetime
self-transformability

118
00:08:57,697 --> 00:09:03,009
and an increase of intentionality
in the dynamic of the psyche.

119
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:11,694
Contemporary notions of identity appear
less opposed to a reflexive consciousness

120
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:15,618
and to the kind of ambitious projects
thereby made possible.

121
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:20,954
As far as their social capital allows 
them to make strategic choices,

122
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:25,647
individuals can define their 
expectations in different ways.

123
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:29,658
Those that make them move, 
for example,

124
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:33,891
towards various projects 
of personal development,

125
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:38,351
as well as those that pertain 
to the field of conservation,

126
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:44,413
of resistance to what they see as 
vital social benefits.

127
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:50,306
They can be self- or family-centered,
with various family size and values

128
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:55,116
or conversely a matter of 
professional or voluntary involvement.

129
00:09:55,116 --> 00:10:01,125
And all those orientations 
can be hosted by the same individual,

130
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,026
simultaneously or successively.

131
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:09,044
Identity is no longer 
an a-priori condition,

132
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:13,660
but tends to become
a permanent form of self-construction.

133
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,523
Identities are provisional stabilizations, 
which evolve in relation

134
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:23,629
to the pace of the 
dis-equilibrating dynamics

135
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:26,767
acceptable by a given personality.

136
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:31,789
These imbalances and the risks
they generate are increasingly understood

137
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:36,158
as an inevitable counterpart 
of the supplementary degrees of freedom

138
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:41,066
that the individuals have acquired
in the fabrication of themselves.

139
00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:50,115
In this context, 
the spatial components of identity

140
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:53,225
are also logically touched upon.

141
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:57,946
‘Here’ and ‘there’ cannot be defined
once and for all anymore.

142
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,532
Classically, geographers conceived
of the identity tie between the individual

143
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:11,101
and a place as univocal. 
‘To everybody, their place’ is a postulate,

144
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:14,842
often translated into the metaphor
of rootedness.

145
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:19,522
It is an obvious identification 
between the tree and the soil,

146
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:23,727
it's natural and easy 
to be taken for granted.

147
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:28,604
The near and the local would then 
govern identity.

148
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:36,139
However, the appropriation 
of multiple geographical places,

149
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:41,179
through mobility or by other means, 
throws this model into question.

150
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:45,605
All anchoring places
can possibly be good clients

151
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:50,362
for an identification carried out
by an individual,

152
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:56,023
due as much to its spatial extension, 
as to the complexity of its determinants.

153
00:11:56,023 --> 00:12:01,221
the ordinary actors’ spatial system
has a comparable, or more often,

154
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:06,244
a superior size to the society 
in which they principally evolves.

155
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:13,657
Individual identities may thus, 
not merely be seen as little things

156
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:16,142
placed inside a big box.

157
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:22,603
They may also be considered 
as organized and orientated layers

158
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:29,586
of space, possessing a specific dynamic, 
as indeed, geography and sociology

159
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:34,302
have convincingly demonstrated since 
the first works of the Chicago School

160
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:37,782
in urban research
in the early 20th century.

161
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:43,932
This leads to the proposition, 
according to which,

162
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:48,654
‘here’ does not correspond
to a single stable substance.

163
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:53,607
On the contrary, there are many 
‘heres’ in motion, which,

164
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:58,428
when taken together, contribute 
to an individual's relation to space.

165
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:05,343
Any type of place can become 
a referent for identity.

166
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:10,894
‘Here’ can thus be defined 
as a spatial component of identity.

167
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:18,162
In a symmetrical way, ‘there’
could be said to constitute

168
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:21,722
the spatial component of otherness.

169
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:25,288
Alter-identity then seems to be

170
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:30,283
a phenomenon for which globalization
is the most favorable environment

171
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:32,526
for its emergence and development.

172
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:36,217
The dynamic of the relation between
identity and otherness,

173
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:41,017
is, at the same time, a consequence
and a component of globalization.

174
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:49,268
Thinking beyond this, however, 
certain characteristics of globalization

175
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:53,862
make possible the appropriation 
by individuals of a bigger,

176
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:58,305
but, paradoxically, 
more easily penetrable World.

177
00:13:59,391 --> 00:14:02,976
By reducing the magnitude
of differences,

178
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:06,420
by creating new singularities 
at every scale,

179
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,243
and by confirming big cities
as concentrates of the World,

180
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:15,074
globalization offers an 
enlarged palette for experiencing

181
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:19,091
this setting in motion of 
individual identities.

182
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:23,423
In this context, anthropologists
have signaled

183
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:28,020
the appearance of diverse combinations
of identification processes,

184
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,256
fabricated with bricks of various nature.

185
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:39,051
This is the end of exoticism, 
with a triumph of complex patchworks,

186
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:42,996
hybrids, and cross-breeds. 
The notion of environment,

187
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:47,665
in the sense of an encompassing 
reality in interaction with realities

188
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:52,043
it encompasses, as we've seen in 
Session 1, is useful here.

189
00:14:53,897 --> 00:14:57,510
The description of the World
as a differentiated space

190
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,675
is then passed on to the study
of diverse environments,

191
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:05,271
articulated in various ways
amongst each other,

192
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,622
and not necessarily
in a nesting mode,

193
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:12,913
but also through co-spatiality 
within a unique place.

194
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:18,501
The possible agency in these different
environments constitutes

195
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:23,368
the dashboard of individuals, 
who are yet also

196
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:25,956
components of these environments.

197
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:30,083
Intensity and speed of dynamics,
then, depend less

198
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:34,718
on the reciprocal influence 
of the environment, taken as a whole,

199
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:38,676
than on the capacity of actors 
to activate

200
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:42,807
the elements of one environment
that could serve their projects,

201
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:46,781
potentially achieved 
in another environment.

202
00:15:49,628 --> 00:15:53,061
The world of individuals is, 
thus, per excellence,

203
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:56,861
any kind of place, 
including the World itself.

204
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:03,328
From the body to the planet 
the individual is actively present;

205
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:07,918
he or she is a privileged courier
of spatialities,

206
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:12,941
namely by, his or her ability 
to cross borders,

207
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:17,351
beyond the terrible dangers
that this may imply, and the fact that

208
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:22,061
these crossings are not always desired, 
but often forced.

209
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:28,451
Similarly, the capability to jump 
from one scale to another,

210
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:33,983
or from one spatial layer
to another, is remarkable in itself

211
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:38,587
and because of the powerful impact
it has on social interactions,

212
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:40,777
and cultural hybridization.

213
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:47,634
This is not a completely new reality,
but what's new is that this issue

214
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:52,232
is present, more or less, and in
a highly uneven fashion

215
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:56,732
for every individual,
and not only to a tiny minority

216
00:16:56,732 --> 00:17:00,010
of great travelers 
or great intellectuals.

217
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:05,499
The world of individuals 
was practiced even during the Holocaust,

218
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:11,012
in spite of its planned and obscene
extermination of entire populations

219
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:16,270
and its negation of the existence 
of individuals as human beings.

220
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:23,084
Imre Kertész knew how to describe
a life where the loss of control

221
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,741
over one's own body in no way meant
a lack of activity,

222
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:31,354
but involved a life dominated by an
interminable slowness,

223
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:34,301
punctuated by little choice.

224
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:39,931
For Kertész, ‘fatelessness’ means
having the power to act

225
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:43,161
and to have the influence 
on the future of one's existence

226
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:46,959
without everything being decided
beforehand.

227
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:52,344
The paradox lies in the fact that 
this horizon was constructed

228
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:57,549
in a world where freedom, 
was, nevertheless, radically banned.

229
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:04,467
This is a power to move forward
‘step by step’, as he says,

230
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:10,867
if only to decide about whether 
it's best to take the bus or the tram

231
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:13,663
to go to Auschwitz.

232
00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:19,214
Kertész blames those who give up,
pretending that ‘things happen’,

233
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:25,065
that is to say, fall upon us 
without having been there for nothing.

234
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:31,752
‘Thinking after Auschwitz’ is saying that
in a society of individuals,

235
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:35,658
even when crushed by a brutal 
and violently imposed weight,

236
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:39,487
the individual can resist, 
and, as incredible as it can appear,

237
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,342
can live intensely, as such,
and not only in their own mind.

238
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:50,982
If we follow Kertész's leading thread,
we finally understand that,

239
00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:53,754
in these camps, the effort 
to make the self exist

240
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:56,691
doesn't consist of plunging 
into the horror,

241
00:18:56,691 --> 00:19:02,336
to pull from it a certain grandeur,
but, paradoxically,

242
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:08,548
in seeking against all odds
to create an unlikely banality,

243
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:13,174
which permits an access, 
if only for brief moments,

244
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:18,317
to rhythms, landmarks, 
temporary identifications

245
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:22,638
and pleasant or unpleasant
micro-events which contribute

246
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:27,234
to build a marvelous daily grayness.

247
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,807
We have noticed that globalization

248
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,007
clearly has an economic dimension,
but not only.

249
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:41,906
All aspects of social life
are present

250
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:44,757
in this invention of 
a World-scale space.

251
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:49,987
It's a dangerous mistake
to reduce globalization to flows of money

252
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:52,882
or to the expansion of companies.

253
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:57,984
The arrangement of social groups,
politics, science, art or technology,

254
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:01,859
are also at stake, 
in all stages of globalization.

255
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:05,960
And the role of individuals 
helps us not to forget

256
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,981
this multi-dimensional aspect
of global dynamics.

257
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:17,541
Since late 2010, the Arab Spring, 
especially in Tunisia and Egypt,

258
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,734
has shown a new kind 
of political movement,

259
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:25,109
based on individual-driven, 
reversible groups.

260
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:33,263
The 2009 pacific protests in Iran have 
sometimes been called ‘Tweeter Revolution’.

261
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,240
In democratic countries, de-aligned
political movements:

262
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:46,268
‘Los Indignados’ in Spain, ‘Occupy’ in the 
United States, in 2011 and 2012,

263
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:49,311
have shown comparable features.

264
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:57,199
In Turkey, the 2013 ‘Taksim-Gezi Park’
protest movement

265
00:20:57,199 --> 00:21:02,200
made visible a new side
of political agency

266
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,361
and transcended 
the common partisan splits.

267
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:10,297
In Ukraine, the ‘Maidan Movement’, 
which succeeded in overthrowing

268
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:14,647
the President and his regime,
was mostly composed

269
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:19,333
of self-organized, self-assigned people, 
coming from different

270
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:24,886
socioeconomic and geographic layers
of the Ukrainian society.

271
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:31,197
In the case of the Arab Spring, 
whose impact is ambivalent,

272
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:35,208
we can identify different types
of processes and outcomes.

273
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:41,124
In different cases, the importance of this
new kind of movement is indisputable.

274
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:52,995
In this perspective, we can
construct a theoretical framework

275
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:57,531
to elaborate a sociology of globalization,
and of the global society

276
00:21:57,531 --> 00:22:01,269
which takes into account 
both the global and other scales.

277
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:08,957
No individual, of course, has a 
100% grip on their own life,

278
00:22:08,957 --> 00:22:12,580
and the weight of economic, political, 
or cultural limitations

279
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,171
to their freedom of self-invention
should definitely not be forgotten.

280
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:24,795
What can be said, however, 
is firstly that between zero and 100,

281
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:30,693
there are many interesting intermediate 
situations that deserve to be explored.

282
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:36,131
Secondly, we can say that this mix 
between freedom and constraint

283
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:41,481
cannot be described by a single aspect, 
such as, for instance, income.

284
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:46,270
The relation between the individual
and the World, actually

285
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:50,830
as it can be observed, 
suggests that the interpretation

286
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:56,527
of social ties should be reformulated 
to integrate their spatial dimension.

287
00:22:57,027 --> 00:23:00,787
This is true in any 
geographic configuration.

288
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:08,297
In fact, globalization gives a new
significance to spatial competences.

289
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:15,276
This table shows the relative dependence
between economic capital

290
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:18,217
and spatial capital in a 
globalizing World.

291
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:23,257
It illustrates how people with little
economic capital,

292
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:27,771
but much spatial capital -
the ‘plugged-In’, for example;

293
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:32,499
international migrants
who already have experience

294
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:37,439
of otherness and often benefit
from consistent support from,

295
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:42,479
for example, relatives and from 
fellow countryman and women

296
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:47,099
at their port of entry, may often
develop a winning strategy

297
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:52,279
of social ascent, while those who 
are here called the ‘entrenched’,

298
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:58,649
for example, workers with a protected
status in a developed country

299
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:03,609
are, when faced with globalization,
poor geographical actors

300
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:08,889
despite their relatively privileged
economic position.

301
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:14,137
Let's go back to a table we had 
introduced in the first session.

302
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:21,217
As we saw, countries, that is, territories
surrounded by clear border lines,

303
00:24:21,217 --> 00:24:25,357
are by far not the only 
observable situation.

304
00:24:26,117 --> 00:24:29,817
Networks are very common,
as well as fuzzy limits.

305
00:24:29,817 --> 00:24:33,780
Moreover, since they include
an infinity of parts,

306
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,827
territories have been mere utopias
for a long period

307
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:40,577
and states are forced to spend
huge amounts of money

308
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:44,887
to turn borders into efficient
lock-out fences.

309
00:24:45,478 --> 00:24:49,357
By the way, the practical way
to create territories

310
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:53,807
is generally the construction of dense, 
thick networks.

311
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:59,163
Networks are precisely effective
in each dimension

312
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,589
of social life and for each actor.

313
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:04,379
Spacial agency, what we've called
spatiality

314
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:09,869
is essentially made of networks, 
and in networks.

315
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:12,939
Networks are typically individual spaces.

316
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:17,519
In this perspective, we should give
particular attention to ‘rhizomes’.

317
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:23,249
This term is derived from Gilles Deleuze
and Félix Guattari's notion developed

318
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:27,269
in their book, ‘A Thousand Plateaus’,
first published in 1980.

319
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:31,609
A rhizome is a borderless network.

320
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:37,889
This concept expresses the individual's
capability to both develop

321
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:43,949
weak ties with unknown people -
‘friends’ in digital social networks -

322
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:48,169
and largely accept the 
transitivity of these ties.

323
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:53,309
My acquaintances' acquaintances
are my acquaintances too.

324
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:59,879
That's why in small worlds
where interaction systems are random,

325
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:07,549
unlikely encounters often happen, like 
in the book by David Lodge, ‘Small Worlds’.

326
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:12,929
Transforming a network into 
a territory (that is,

327
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:17,607
adding continuity, contiguity, 
and exhaustivity),

328
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:22,327
or even a place (a space freed 
from relevant distances),

329
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:28,117
is not a trivial or an easy task. 
It requires resources and determination.

330
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:33,668
Is the World becoming a territory
and a place too?

331
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:38,639
Its inhabitants only
will eventually decide.
