1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,340
Once made more intelligible,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,130
the global rationales appear 
to be combining and interacting

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,250
as a vortex of partially 
contradictory projects.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,640
It is easy to detect 
the role of big actors,

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,850
such as transnational companies,

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,110
or the states.

7
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:23,444
What we will see now is that small actors,

8
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:25,974
as small as ordinary individuals,

9
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:31,454
do bring a major contribution
to the shaping of today's inhabited space,

10
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:34,684
including, and perhaps all the more,

11
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:36,214
at the global scale.

12
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:38,480
Individuals matter.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,166
Let's see how.

14
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:48,732
In the World are the individuals.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,490
The apparently smallest operators
are powerful spatial actors.

16
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:58,093
Let's see how they can be.

17
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:01,880
We will first retrace the slow emergence

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,880
of the individual in society.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,550
Then, we’ll more specifically focus
on the spatial dimensions

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,830
of the individual actor.

21
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:17,896
And finally, we'll connect individuals 
with contemporary global issues.

22
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,556
The individual has emerged 
as a major spacial actor

23
00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:32,716
with his or her spatial capital 
and spatial strategies.

24
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:33,826
How?

25
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,836
This is a long story.

26
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:44,171
The capability of a simple and single 
individual to become an actor–

27
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:49,561
that is, an operator endowed 
of strategic intelligence –

28
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:53,221
begins faraway, back in the past.

29
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:57,326
However, for millennia,

30
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:01,326
most individuals had 
practically no leeway,

31
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:05,326
and were totally dependent 
from the group they belonged to,

32
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:09,356
and from the role society 
assigned to this group.

33
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:13,508
The process of emancipation 
of the individual

34
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,998
clearly began in Europe at the end 
of the Medieval period,

35
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:17,998
and became visible

36
00:02:17,998 --> 00:02:21,685
within the 18th century bourgeoisie.

37
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:26,161
We must wait for the early 20th century
in Europe and North America

38
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:28,851
to see the rise of a middle class,

39
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:33,101
whose characteristics 
are precisely not to be a class,

40
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:36,781
in the meaning that 
Karl Marx gave to this word.

41
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:41,792
The capacity of arbitration 
in strategic choices

42
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,800
is provided by a growing 
material and cultural affluence

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,930
that this group progressively experienced.

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,080
Beyond its economic dimension,

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,263
this evolution gives the individuals

46
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:59,763
the opportunity to decide 
on their own in fields

47
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,603
that were traditionally 
predetermined by communal -

48
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:06,543
family, territory, religion,

49
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:10,543
social status, gender, or age - rationales.

50
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:15,481
A contemporary individual is a worker,

51
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:20,481
soldier, voter, consumer, 
state-protected person,

52
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:23,891
citizen, self-biographer,

53
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,821
versatile actor,

54
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:28,151
inhabitant.

55
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,951
The end of the 19th century

56
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:34,001
and the beginning of the 20th

57
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,571
meant in the West

58
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:38,901
the advent of the individual worker

59
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:41,731
because of industrialization,

60
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:46,161
and the individual voter
thanks to democracy.

61
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:48,607
With Fordism and the welfare state,

62
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:54,017
the last two thirds of the 20th century
made the individual a consumer,

63
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:57,107
whilst marketing embedded
this major change

64
00:03:57,107 --> 00:04:00,107
in the daily life of companies.

65
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:02,533
It was also a moment when,

66
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,485
in all types of biologically 
defined groups –

67
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:12,355
e.g. women, men, young people,
children, elderly people -

68
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:15,725
the right to be an individual 
was established,

69
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:19,925
and where discriminations 
based on intentional practice -
 
70
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:22,635
sexual practices and lifestyles -

71
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:25,242
or on imposed attributes -

72
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:29,472
ethnic origins, age,
gender, or handicaps -

73
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:31,316
were questioned.

74
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:36,195
All these events are entirely social

75
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:40,195
and involve other roles
society processes in the economic,

76
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:43,455
as well as in the political sphere.

77
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:48,175
But in spite of a huge
pressure to turn persons -

78
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:52,525
for example, conditioning of
consumption practices,

79
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:58,256
the continuation of unequal 
industrial relations inside companies,

80
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,076
and on the job market -

81
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:06,046
the ordinary individuals have more
leeway than they used to have before.

82
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:15,792
This can be measured
through economic rationales -

83
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,632
purchasing power -

84
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:21,102
and non-economic rationales -

85
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:25,096
knowledge, mobility, citizenship -

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,820
that have substantial
geographical components.

87
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:36,038
The result is the emergence 
of the individual as a significant actor.

88
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:38,008
And this is all the more pronounced

89
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:44,096
in societies where, in spite
of an uneven development,

90
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:48,986
people are benefiting from 
a relatively equal distribution of health,

91
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:53,106
mobility, education,
and other public goods.

92
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,386
In emerging countries, mostly in Asia -

93
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:57,526
and in a more contradictory way,

94
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,226
in Latin America -

95
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:03,118
the rapid eruption 
of a substantial middle class

96
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:05,748
of hundreds of millions of people,

97
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:08,188
whose members are capable of making

98
00:06:08,188 --> 00:06:12,348
strategic arbitrations of their lifetimes,

99
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:16,168
is a major event in World history.

100
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,160
The Internet opened up an even 
more encompassing universe

101
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,721
where individuals’ expectations

102
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,311
are no longer evaluated by surveys,

103
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,491
or market studies -

104
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:33,831
or not only.

105
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:36,231
They turned themselves into

106
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:39,757
producers, inventors, and actors

107
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:43,697
of the discourses that
talk about themselves.

108
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:46,225
The massive eruption of blogs

109
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:49,800
is probably the best expression
of this emergence

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,600
with its contradictions,
instability, and no doubt, illusions,

111
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,530
but also its potential capacity

112
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,270
to impose itself on the
market of communication.

113
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:07,644
Being an actor doesn't mean 
being a big actor,

114
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:10,344
but being able to define and implement

115
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:13,544
strategic objectives 
in a given environment.

116
00:07:13,544 --> 00:07:16,144
What's striking is that the kind of goals

117
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,354
targeted by the different
individuals throughout the World

118
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:21,304
is converging.

119
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:24,353
And in spite of huge differences in power,

120
00:07:24,353 --> 00:07:28,551
little folks hold up their heads
next to the big ones

121
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:32,811
in the domains which really
matter the most for an individual--

122
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:37,151
that is, long-term security, 
self-affirmation,

123
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:40,514
the capability of developing
a personal development,

124
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:44,894
and of attaining an actual 
social recognition.
