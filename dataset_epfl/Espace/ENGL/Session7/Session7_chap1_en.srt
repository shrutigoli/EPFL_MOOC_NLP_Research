1
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:10,461
We will now address space through two 
transversal approaches: nature and time.

2
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:14,254
In the first case, we often mentally
superpose an environment

3
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:20,274
that has inhabited spaces above, 
and another environment beneath: nature.

4
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:24,785
What if nature was nothing but 
a component of society?

5
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:31,164
Furthermore, many people, including
scholars, have believed, or still do,

6
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:36,074
that pre-human realities like atoms,
cells, planets or living species

7
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:41,394
could be sufficient cognitive resources
to explain human behavior.

8
00:00:42,513 --> 00:00:47,746
It can be first argued, conversely, 
that human history has its own rationales.

9
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:53,234
It can be contended, too, that there are
different natures, that none of them

10
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:57,894
is reducible to the logics of physical
and biological worlds.

11
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,436
Warning: nature is not the opposite 
of culture, but a part of it.

12
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,603
Let's try to go beyond this paradox.

13
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:16,370
The relationships between societies
and natural environments have long been

14
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:21,230
a substantial component of geography,
to the point that geographical determinism

15
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,888
meant natural determinism 
throughout the 20th century

16
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:26,952
and in many different languages.

17
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:32,771
Today, things have changed and nature
has become just one particular topic

18
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:38,291
among others for geographical research,
as it is in the other social sciences,

19
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:42,291
such as the economy of natural 
resources in economics,

20
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:46,291
or the politics of nature 
in political science.

21
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:52,818
This new situation gives the social
sciences of space the freedom,

22
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:57,338
and responsibility, to propose fresh 
insights into relationships between

23
00:01:57,338 --> 00:02:00,298
inhabited spaces and natural environments.

24
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:04,978
In this session, the general societal 
issues of these relationships

25
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:08,978
will be examined, in addition to their
spatial dimensions.

26
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:18,278
What is nature? And how far
can nature be a part

27
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:20,552
of the exploration of inhabited space?

28
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:23,458
This is the question we
will be examining in the course.

29
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:30,158
Let's try to get a simple and clear view
of this subject.

30
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:34,158
First of all, there is a reality,
the physical universe,

31
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:37,998
which is studied by the science 
of matter, or physics.

32
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,876
Because of the emergence of living
organisms and their logics on planet Earth

33
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:46,332
there has been a distinct
field of research

34
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:50,692
to explore the sciences of life, 
or biology.

35
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:54,604
The objects of these studies are, 
through their construction,

36
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:57,072
independent of social life.

37
00:02:57,072 --> 00:03:01,587
They existed before humans appeared
and would continue to exist

38
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:04,889
even if every human disappeared.

39
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,019
These realities are called 
bio-physical worlds.

40
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:16,104
Now, if we look at societies, we see that
they had high mountains,

41
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:21,104
which, during millennia, were strongly
repulsive realities, even if they are

42
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:25,104
now very attractive, as well as
being economically significant

43
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:29,104
for skiing, trekking, and climbing.

44
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:36,020
The soil of the western United States
has long been unsuitable

45
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,970
for agriculture until knowledge 
of dry-farming was developed.

46
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,201
This was also true for part of the arid
Champagne region of France,

47
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:52,391
which was incapable of producing high 
yields and was called ‘hampagne pouilleuse’

48
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:58,121
or ‘seedy Champagne’, until new farming
techniques made of it one of the most

49
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:02,121
efficient cereal crop-producing 
zones in Western Europe.

50
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:05,607
Biophysical worlds have 
their own chronology,

51
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:09,625
and nature has a history,
which is human history.

52
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:14,865
Nature can then be defined 
as biophysical realities,

53
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:17,865
insofar as they concern societies.

54
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:22,045
In other words, it could be said that 
nature is a social dimension

55
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,969
of biophysical realities.

56
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:28,349
Therefore, nature should not
be opposed to culture.

57
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:32,211
Nature is a part of human culture.

58
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:38,444
Here, the notion of a three-fold 
system, including

59
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,802
actors, objects, and environments, 
could be useful.

60
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:47,022
Nature can be considered as an environment
but not the environment.

61
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:51,197
There are unnatural environments,
like social milieus.

62
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,335
Inhabited spaces are environments.

63
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:59,125
As for nature, it shouldn't be forgotten
that there are two major natural

64
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:03,805
environments; the body, and 
the external natural environment.

65
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:09,104
These two envelopes are certainly 
environments, and pre-figure

66
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:15,544
the actors they encompass, but can be
modified by the actors' intentionality.

67
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,113
This is obviously true for the body.

68
00:05:19,113 --> 00:05:24,632
Our body kills us, at the end of the day,
that is our lifetime,

69
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:31,232
but the psychosomatic impact of our mind
over our body is massive and indisputable.

70
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:35,543
Volcanic eruptions, 
earthquakes, and tsunamis

71
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,273
can kill hundreds of thousands of people.

72
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:44,203
What has been called the ‘Anthropocene’
is a geological era defined by

73
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:49,563
the significant impact of human agency
upon Earth's biophysical worlds.

74
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:56,010
The recent and progressive accumulation
of power by societies gives human actions

75
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,330
the same level of influence 
as physical or biological forces,

76
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,212
imposing on humanity a brand new 
series of responsibilities.
