1
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:09,284
If the history of humanity 
could be attempting

2
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:11,560
to be summed up in one sentence,

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,191
it could be said that to begin 
with the 190,000 year era

4
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:21,034
during which resources 
were mostly withdrawn

5
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:24,851
from the natural environment,
that is Palaeolithic.

6
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:29,511
Then, an 11,000 year period,

7
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:33,657
during which there was a mix 
of predation and production.

8
00:00:33,657 --> 00:00:38,517
During this period, it was possible 
to dramatically increase production,

9
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:43,258
especially, once fossil fuel
sources were mobilized.

10
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:57,559
‘Ecological awareness’ 
could now be called the cultural event

11
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,429
leading to the conclusion 
among a significant number

12
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:04,022
of experts and the public opinion

13
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:08,732
that the Neolithic age 
will not be endless.

14
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:11,471
The argument is quite plausible.

15
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:17,259
If the predation/production period
continues to demonstrate growth,

16
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:23,258
someday, the natural inputs withdrawn
from the natural environment

17
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:26,137
will inevitably be exhausted.

18
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:33,002
As we'll be seeing later in this session,

19
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:38,741
this option collides with the image 
of traditional agricultural industry,

20
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:42,032
which perceives the mix 
of predation/production

21
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:46,078
to be a normal, unquestionable
way of life for societies.

22
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,609
It will also be seen 
that within the discourses

23
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,584
pertaining to the ecological
awareness corpus,

24
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:56,784
there are two opposite 
families of approaches.

25
00:01:57,546 --> 00:02:01,794
On the whole, there is a set 
of three models of nature

26
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,982
which are in competition.

27
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:06,610
As can be seen on the table,

28
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,920
these models of nature
are also models of society.

29
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:18,357
As a matter of fact, statements 
on natural environments are so pervasive

30
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:22,745
that they have major consequences 
on the way societies are organized.

31
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:25,605
This is particularly true about space.

32
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:31,505
Conceptions of inhabited space 
clearly differ from one model to another.

33
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:38,830
If we now more specifically focus
on models compatible

34
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,905
with ecological awareness, 
it can be noticed

35
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:44,738
that they stand in 
profound opposition.

36
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:48,888
Here can be found 
two irreconcilable approaches

37
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:51,450
to the organization of social life.

38
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:25,895
‘The Limits to Growth’, that is
the Meadows’ report published in 1972,

39
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:29,876
is a good example 
of neo-naturalist interpretation.

40
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,795
It appeared in the wake 
of a long intellectual tradition

41
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:36,319
beginning with Thomas Malthus,

42
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,509
the famous 19th Century 
demographer and theologian.

43
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:44,285
The basic idea is that when 
natural resources are limited,

44
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:49,726
population cannot increase 
without provoking massive starvation

45
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:51,366
and other disasters.

46
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:54,720
According to a neo-naturalist
point of view,

47
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,350
there is also a moral dimension
as the graph shows.

48
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:03,568
The neo-naturalist paradigm
always assumes

49
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:07,634
that intrinsic moral values 
are conveyed by natural beings,

50
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:10,750
be they animals, plants or minerals.

51
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,883
The implementation of these values
contributes to creating

52
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:17,760
a natural order which man has disrupted.

53
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,010
In this regard, the issue 
of biodiversity clearly is critical.

54
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:27,442
Some biologists warn
of an anthropic seventh extinction,

55
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:33,142
which might affect from 15% to 50%
of existing species.

56
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:37,895
It is also true that 
back in the Palaeolithic era,

57
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:41,716
humans, in fact, 
destroyed many species.

58
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:46,326
For instance, scientists have good reasons
to believe that forests were destroyed

59
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:50,499
thousands of years ago 
by the first Palaeolithic societies

60
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,420
living in Central Australia.

61
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,350
And who transformed 
a vast area into desert.

62
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,199
However, the four last extinctions 
annihilated more than 50%

63
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,556
of previously existing species,

64
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:10,098
with the Permian extinction --the fifth-- 
eliminating 70% of terrestrial species

65
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:15,608
and 95% of marine life 
250 million years ago.

66
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:20,084
The difference this time 
does not originate

67
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:23,436
in the quantity of species 
projected to be lost,

68
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:26,226
nor in the pace of extinction.

69
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:30,600
Most extinctions, 
such as the disappearance

70
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,910
of the dinosaurs 
during the Cretaceous,

71
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,674
occurred as a result 
of a sudden catastrophic event

72
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:41,284
such as a volcanic eruption
or a meteorite.

73
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:46,907
The difference this time 
comes from man's supposed guilt.

74
00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:50,856
Keeping the same perspective,
the very notion

75
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:54,116
of ‘climatic disturbance’ is disputable.

76
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,452
It's supposed that before
human intervention,

77
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:02,239
the climate was both stable
and consistent, obeying rules,

78
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:07,019
the antonym of disturbance
being organization or order.

79
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,710
Debates on climate are clearly 
marked by the weight of neo-naturalism.

80
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:16,319
Roger Pielke Jr. 
assumed that once

81
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,229
controversial scientific research
meets controversial political issues,

82
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:25,784
the schola’s role tends to switch
to the stance of an activist.

83
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:30,372
He detected this tendency 
in many documents

84
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:33,640
overestimating our level of knowledge,

85
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,010
and not only trying to blame
human impact for climatic warming,

86
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,611
but also any orientation
towards development.

87
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:48,601
The idea of sustainable development
progressively appeared

88
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:51,091
in the 1970’’s and 1980’s.

89
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:58,009
Gro Harlem Brundtland's text
‘Our Common Future’ released in 1987

90
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,735
by a UN agency devoted 
to the natural environment,

91
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:05,748
was the first official 
political expression

92
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:09,035
of the sustainable 
development orientation.

93
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:11,641
The term ‘sustainable development’

94
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:15,437
is not the title 
of a complete political agenda,

95
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:19,477
but rather a general 
framework for public debate.

96
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:24,232
The main idea is that, if we want
to make development sustainable,

97
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:29,155
and maintain it as efficient
for future generations,

98
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:32,975
three pillars should be
simultaneously strengthened:

99
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:36,006
economic growth, social cohesion,

100
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:39,176
and the preservation 
of natural environments.

101
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,918
For promoters of sustainable development,

102
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:45,908
there’s no antimony 
between these three objectives.

103
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,640
Quite to the contrary.

104
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,316
As the graph demonstrates, they are all
the more compatible among themselves,

105
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:55,029
since each component includes

106
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,662
a substantial intersection
with the others.

107
00:07:57,662 --> 00:08:01,832
Said differently, it could be argued 
that each of the three pillars

108
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:05,588
is a particular way of saying 
the same thing, that is:

109
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:09,873
the crucial necessity 
of considering societies’ futures

110
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:14,230
as long-term processes 
supposes encompassing nature

111
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,950
as a dimension 
of socio-economic development.

112
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,971
The sustainable development framework
has also clearly identified

113
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:26,226
the global scale 
as the one most relevant

114
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:31,044
for addressing developmental
and environmental issues.

115
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:39,297
One of the key issues 
in these models of nature

116
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:43,096
is humanit’s ability to arrange
development programs

117
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:46,833
which can be efficient 
with a decreasing withdrawal

118
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,971
of non-reproducible natural resources.

119
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:54,021
The graph demonstrates 
that bet about decoupling.

120
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:02,634
The decoupling process shows 
that despite the high level of unevenness

121
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:06,036
persisting inside and amongst societies,

122
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:08,872
there are significant tendencies
in the World

123
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:12,922
in favour of overcoming Neolithic logics.

124
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:16,938
An important and probably dominant part
of human production and activities

125
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:21,608
has already been the result
of immaterial processes.

126
00:09:22,152 --> 00:09:25,032
The economy of knowledge 
is growing daily,

127
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,524
and it is easy to imagine 
a production system

128
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:32,272
in which all natural inputs 
are reduced to recyclable sources,

129
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:37,415
such as water, metals, soil,
or non-limited sources,

130
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:42,331
such as, wind, sun, 
or some day nuclear fusion.

131
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:48,101
However, it’s true that decoupling
is just the first step.

132
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:55,727
In a post-Neolithic world, 
fossil energy will disappear,

133
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:59,430
and the destruction of useful 
and limited resources

134
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,860
will tend towards zero.

135
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:06,865
This era has clearly not yet arrived
and the positive impact

136
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:11,125
of some technological processes,
such as cleaner cars,

137
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:15,426
has been weakened by the simple 
increase in quantities produced.

138
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:18,184
Much remains to be done 
for the construction

139
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,979
of a ‘post-lithic’ production system.
