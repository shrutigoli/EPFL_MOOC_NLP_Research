1
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,298
One more concrete example of
the issues raised by

2
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:11,742
the Sustainable Development 
paradigm is space.

3
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:16,004
Are there certain spatial configurations
more favorable

4
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:18,502
to the three pillars
of sustainable development?

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,346
The following documents show that 
the city – that's to say

6
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:26,743
the urban configuration maximizing
density and diversity –

7
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:31,374
at its best, clearly satisfies
the requirements

8
00:00:31,374 --> 00:00:34,429
of sustainable development’s 
three pillars.

9
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:39,335
First of all, the compact city is
the best solution for developing

10
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:43,151
a post-predatory approach to 
natural resources.

11
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:47,355
At this point it can clearly be seen
how the spatial logics

12
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:50,452
of farming and industry 
are the problems.

13
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:53,695
These two sectors,
 are in contradiction

14
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:58,320
with urban rationales,
as the city is the solution.

15
00:00:58,664 --> 00:01:03,043
As can be seen in Session 5,
however, urban sprawl,

16
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:06,644
or the ‘Johannesburg’ model,
is not a good answer.

17
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:11,301
The more an urban area is scattered
and fragmented,

18
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:16,705
the more negatively it will impact
upon natural environments.

19
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,105
The pillar of economic growth
was analyzed in Session 5.

20
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,995
The map is a reminder
of the strong correlation

21
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:27,375
between the relative 
and absolute urbanity,

22
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,297
and productive efficiency.

23
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,405
Finally, social cohesion turns out
to be to the advantage of the city.

24
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:40,031
These maps representing
two different cartographic languages

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,187
– a cartogram based on population
and a classic Euclidean map –

26
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,782
the degree of income diversity
in each small statistical area

27
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:52,753
of 2,000 residents
of the Parisian built-up area.

28
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:56,613
As the maps demonstrate,
the maximum social mix

29
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:59,311
is attained in city centers,
that’s to say

30
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:03,733
where density is higher, 
city centers are places

31
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:06,937
where exposure to otherness
is the most accepted,

32
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:09,946
and even expected by the people,

33
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:12,720
rich or poor,
who have chosen to live in it.

34
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:16,069
The misguiding notion of
gentrification,

35
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,824
which is actually,
a way of promoting ghettoes

36
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:21,824
as a relevant orientation
for urbanism,

37
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,713
appears to be particularly
counter-productive in this case.

38
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:30,155
Logically, urban issues and 
political scenes

39
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:32,952
are good expressions of 
the debates about nature.

40
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:36,510
To take the example of mobility,
it can be seen that

41
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:39,519
each of the three 
nature-society models

42
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,269
lends its own point of view
to this topic,

43
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,924
which is consistent 
to its general rationale.

44
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,528
The second graph shows that
compromises are possible

45
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:52,873
between these pure orientations.

46
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:56,907
Anti-urban mobility,
self-mobility,

47
00:02:57,205 --> 00:03:01,123
or the right to mobility are 
possible hybridizations

48
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:03,112
of two of these orientations.

49
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:07,289
Of course, these compromises
do not eliminate contradictions.

50
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,822
Does self-mobility, for instance, 
include high-speed trains?

51
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:16,318
The neo-naturalist activists
would answer ‘no’,

52
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:22,690
just as, in the ‘post-lithic’ approach,
a ‘yes’ would be perfectly consistent.

53
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:29,667
In short, the pivotal role
of nature is confirmed every day

54
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:34,190
in political controversies,
especially when space is at stake.

55
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:40,034
The spatiality of nature is, 
above all, political.
