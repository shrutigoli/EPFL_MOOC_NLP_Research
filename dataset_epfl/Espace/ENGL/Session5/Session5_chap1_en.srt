00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:04,403
In the next session, it will be shown

1
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:07,195
that urbanity is not only a technical feature

2
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:11,066
that characterizes a rapidly urbanizing World.

3
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:15,738
It is also a pivotal issue which is at stake,

4
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:20,953
beyond urban planning, in almost every societal - that is political - debate.

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,484
What exactly is a city?

6
00:00:29,484 --> 00:00:32,198
Answering this question never seems to have been easy.

7
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,978
It's become even less so now.

8
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:44,079
The urban is a spatial arrangement where urbanity makes sense.

9
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,656
Urbanity is that which gives space its urban character.

10
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:53,557
It can be summarized as a combination of density and diversity.

11
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:57,421
It is what has sometimes been called ‘urbanism’

12
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:02,947
in North American urban studies, such as the famous article from 1938,

13
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:06,027
‘Urbanism as a Way of Life’.

14
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:10,046
More recently, the term ‘urbanism’ has been influenced

15
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:15,225
by its French ‘urbanisme’ and Spanish ‘urbanismo’ meanings,

16
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:18,637
and it tends to replace the term ‘urban planning’.

17
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:25,883
Finally, ‘city’ means a particular urban configuration.

18
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:29,341
A city is an urban space par excellence,

19
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:35,634
a space with a relatively higher level of urbanity in a given context,

20
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:40,146
but there are other kinds of urban spaces as well.

21
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,503
Why do cities exist?

22
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:53,189
If distance is a problem for social interactions,

23
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:54,804
how can it be solved?

24
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:59,418
Since the beginning of the Neolithic Age,

25
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:04,176
there have essentially been three ways of managing distance.

26
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:09,734
Coopetition is a neologism

27
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:14,681
summarizing a combination of competition and cooperation.

28
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:18,809
This table shows that in the ‘coopetitive’ interactions

29
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:23,191
between the three major ways of managing distance -

30
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:27,137
co-presence, mobility, and tele-communication -

31
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:29,563
co-presence, and therefore, urbanity,

32
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:34,141
possesses and preserves certain comparative advantages.

33
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:40,689
However, there is also a cooperative component.

34
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:44,235
In a city, there is a synchronization of people,

35
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:48,091
and in order to approach the idea of urban co-presence,

36
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:53,928
we must employ other techniques allowing for distance management.

37
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:57,598
The denser, more diverse and more messy the city is,

38
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,204
the more people move about within it,

39
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:03,632
the more objects are transported around within it,

40
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:08,552
and the more people telephone, email and text message each other.

41
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:12,711
The more people chat, the more people Skype.

42
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:16,265
Co-presence is nourished by its rivals,

43
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:18,534
mobility and tele-communication.

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,269
Urbanization has lent the fullness of its strength to this paradox:

45
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,046
it's only now that billions of urban dwellers exist,

46
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:33,294
that there are also billions of tourists and billions of internet users.

47
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:39,101
Urban civilization is also made up of the lacunae of its utopias.
