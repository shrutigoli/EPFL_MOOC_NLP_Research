1
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:07,985
Urbanity consists of virtuality
and serendipity.

2
00:00:07,985 --> 00:00:09,933
A large city is characterized

3
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:13,652
by the significance of its virtuality
and serendipity,

4
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:17,928
and both are impossible without density.

5
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:22,307
Firstly, there are so many things to do,

6
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:24,424
that a choice must be made,

7
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,497
which means eliminating certain things.

8
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:29,593
When you are not in a movie theater,

9
00:00:29,593 --> 00:00:31,513
you are not the same person,

10
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:36,359
whether there are one
or three hundred films to see.

11
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:41,957
This is virtuality, which should
not be confused with simulation,

12
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:43,764
or approximation.

13
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:49,132
The greater the degree to which one lives
in an urbanity-rich environment,

14
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,779
the larger the gap between
what could be done,

15
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:55,949
and what is actually done.

16
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,910
This is the golden burden of urbanity.

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,427
In this context, chance can offer
a partial solution.

18
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:11,557
The non-actualized component
of the possibilities offered by the city

19
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:16,245
is made available
through random encounters.

20
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:20,442
‘The Three Princes of Serendip’
is a medieval Persian tale,

21
00:01:20,442 --> 00:01:25,630
popularized by Horace Walpole
in the 18th Century.

22
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,118
The princes in the story used
two alternative strategies

23
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:32,831
to get through difficult situations.

24
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:37,800
The first is to take advantage
of the unexpected situations

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,830
they encounter along the way,

26
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,041
while the second is to employ
a skill for arranging accidents -

27
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,241
an expression of their sagacity,

28
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,041
to use Walpole's words.

29
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:52,460
Robert Merton and Umberto Eco

30
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,441
have both taken this phenomenon seriously.

31
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,495
We could even go beyond mere observation

32
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,537
to consider how serendipity
could be arranged.

33
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:06,471
Transforming chance into productivity

34
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:12,845
is what John Udell, a blog specialist,
calls ‘manufactured serendipity’.

35
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:15,552
In an urban context,
the conditions to be met

36
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,149
for efficient serendipity to exist,

37
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:20,406
could then be identified.

38
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:26,787
I the activation and involvement
of all of our perceptive sensors,

39
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:30,712
indeed, all of our sensorial apparatus,

40
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:34,018
in order not to miss any information.

41
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:38,774
Pedestrian metrics are the most
suitable for that purpose,

42
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:41,353
although their suitability
can be challenged

43
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:44,485
by physical or digital libraries,

44
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:48,310
and even more by search engines.

45
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,810
II an exposure to otherness,

46
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,787
which assumes the existence
of otherness, diversity,

47
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:02,965
its accessibility, density,
and of course its acceptability.

48
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:10,050
III the cognitive skill to usefully
interpret the information received.

49
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,678
Thus, reciprocal reinforcement takes place
between urbanity and serendipity.

50
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,270
Serendipity is all the more necessary

51
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,869
because urban space generates
a rich set of virtual resources.

52
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:29,237
At the same time, serendipity is made
all the more possible

53
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:33,630
because of the density
and diversity of urban space.

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,072
This is a clear case of a virtuous,
positive feedback loop.

55
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:43,917
To the contrary, if the level
of urbanity is reduced,

56
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:49,668
the efficiency of serendipity,
as well as its usefulness, is weakened.

57
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:59,327
N x(n - 1), or approximately n2,

58
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:06,086
is a formula defining the number
of potential non-reciprocal links

59
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:08,794
between n realities.

60
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:14,199
It permits an understanding
of why city size matters.

61
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,387
Nevertheless, size is not everything:

62
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:22,537
n can be large but with no reason
for people to meet,

63
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:25,899
either because they are too similar,
or too different,

64
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,761
with nothing to exchange,

65
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:33,820
or because they lack sufficient
accessibility to come into contact.

66
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,625
Hence there is an absolute,
size-dependent urbanity

67
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:43,144
and a relative urbanity,
independent of size.

68
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:49,649
This means that urbanization can be
defined as a creation of urbanity,

69
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:53,831
in relative as well as in absolute terms.

70
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:57,442
Urbanity can be injected
into existing cities

71
00:04:57,442 --> 00:05:00,641
through the creation
of density or diversity.

72
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,671
‘Urban renewal’ or ‘urban renaissance’

73
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:10,532
are movements typical of relative
urbanization processes.

74
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:18,613
Public space is a special, quintessential
component of urbanity.

75
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,987
It is a specific way
of creating politics:

76
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,815
that is, civility.

77
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:29,786
Public space is a strange
multi-scalar object.

78
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:32,247
Let's see how strange it is.

79
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:38,090
Public space can be defined as
a small component of a local society,

80
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,421
which possesses the same
level of diversity

81
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:43,945
of the society as a whole.

82
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:47,479
This means that entering a public space

83
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,370
involves a high degree of otherness,

84
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,496
in terms of population and activities.

85
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:57,541
Any public space then,
has at least two scales:

86
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,757
its own, and that of the reference space,

87
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:04,364
whose diversity it concentrates.

88
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:09,530
Public space can be approached
as the quintessence of the city,

89
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,141
as a concentrated urbanity.

90
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:15,966
Etienne Tassin showed
the contradictions encountered

91
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:21,335
if public space is to be looked at
through a communitarian lens.

92
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:27,210
Public space does not belong
to an exclusive community

93
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,311
benefiting from its exclusive usage.

94
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:34,095
That which defines the public
in terms of space,

95
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:35,956
as in other domains,

96
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:39,945
is a fact that it does not
belong to anybody,

97
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:43,879
because it arises from
society in its entirety.

98
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:48,846
Writings on public space
are surprisingly recent.

99
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:51,980
Public space remains
relatively peripheral

100
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,242
to the otherwise foundational
works on urban action

101
00:06:56,242 --> 00:06:59,790
by Ildefons Cerdà
in the late 19th Century,

102
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,498
and very marginal to
the works of Le Corbusier,

103
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:07,615
and the modern movement
in the mid-20th Century.

104
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:11,109
The beginning,
reflections on public space

105
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:14,505
were confined to the domain
of urban design.

106
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,940
In French, and sometimes
in English literature,

107
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,132
public space suffered
a misunderstanding,

108
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:26,192
due to a bad translation
of the Kantian notion,

109
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:30,035
which was taken up
again by Jürgen Habermas,

110
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:31,770
of ‘Öffentlichkeit’,

111
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,458
which means public,
or public sphere, in German.

112
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:39,806
This was confused with 'public space',

113
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:42,450
which is ‘öffentlicher Raum’,

114
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:47,125
and this notably led
to lackadaisical confusion

115
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:51,945
of the agora, as a material metaphor
of the political scene,

116
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:54,562
in the context of direct democracy,

117
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:58,811
and public space, as it exists
in inhabited environments,

118
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:04,334
without any specific relation
to institutional political life.

119
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:08,102
This confusion in turn
prevented an awareness

120
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:12,466
of the political component
proper to the public space,

121
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:14,993
which may be called ‘civility’.

122
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:17,948
Civility is entirely political,

123
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:22,097
without referring to institutional
political life at all.

124
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:28,440
Aristotle defined the possibility
for liberty through equality.

125
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,125
This liberty is made possible

126
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,921
through the creation of
an egalitarian environment,

127
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:40,002
where the words and actions of each
person carry the same weight.

128
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:45,633
This is the principle of ‘polis’,
according to Hannah Arendt,

129
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:51,258
who defined politics as
the freedom to organize a space.

130
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:55,921
Urban public space is a good
expression of a political universe:

131
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:59,591
that of civility, which, while not
democratic in its apparent,

132
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:03,504
and purely interactive,
form of organization,

133
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:08,185
is nonetheless founded
on the principle of equality.

134
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,969
When this equality
is fundamentally missing,

135
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,509
such as in India and Africa,

136
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:17,678
there is no public space present.

137
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:22,913
One of the particularities of civility

138
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:28,548
lies in the fact that it is entirely
expressed through interaction.

139
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:32,204
It is through the exposure
of vulnerable human bodies

140
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,494
and their protection by others

141
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:39,988
that inhabitants transform public space
into a political environment.

142
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:44,792
In a square, on a street,
or in a subway car,

143
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:49,178
norms of spatial organization
are constantly being renegotiated,

144
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:54,348
by placing one’s body in such and such
a way in relation to others.

145
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:57,084
A conflict implies a challenge

146
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:59,969
to the interactive norms between people.

147
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:05,006
Yet, whether the protagonists
of this joust reach an agreement or not,

148
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:10,676
the argumentative phase will not
tip civility over into deliberation.

149
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:16,751
Deliberation means a collective,
explicit process of decision making,

150
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:19,866
which cannot occur in public space.

151
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:25,067
The being-inhabited nature of public space

152
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,983
is in fact volatile by definition,

153
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:32,297
since it’s open to everyone,
and not only to regulars,

154
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:37,154
but to all of those who, to some degree
or another, occupy the space.

155
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:41,762
The ethics of interaction work
in all sorts of spaces.

156
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:46,817
They consist of preserving
autonomy within integration,

157
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:51,854
as much in private space (the protection
of individual integrity

158
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:55,403
and minimalist benevolence via politeness,

159
00:10:55,403 --> 00:10:58,605
which is etymologically an urban value),

160
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:03,814
as in public space (protection of intimacy
and favorable exchanges

161
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:06,150
lending value to publicness).

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,370
What has emerged can now be summarized
into a set of characteristics,

163
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,046
making public space a very peculiar
and fascinating object for geography.

164
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:20,974
First of all, the efficiency
of a public space

165
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:25,744
is based on the interaction of those
provisionally inhabiting it.

166
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:30,216
Public space is open to changes
in its norms and uses,

167
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:34,018
as carried out by the practices
of those inhabiting it.

168
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:40,511
These changes may either reinforce
or weaken its public character.

169
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:45,461
As a result, designing
and building a public space

170
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:49,685
is neither necessary nor sufficient
to make it exist.

171
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:52,769
Secondly, public space is a public good,

172
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:57,697
characterized by the possible presence
of a level of population,

173
00:11:57,697 --> 00:12:00,278
and functional diversity within it,

174
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:05,022
equal to that of the larger
reference space, or spaces:

175
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:07,818
a neighborhood, a city, the world.

176
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:14,301
Thirdly, pedestrian metrics -
walking plus public transit -

177
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:18,031
are the characteristic
metrics of public space,

178
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:20,925
which can be fixed or mobile.

179
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:27,226
Finally, public space protects
and reinforces intimacy.

180
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:31,250
Places marked by the necessity
of pre-existing links

181
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,693
between its inhabitants,

182
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:36,617
like compulsorily belonging to
any kind of communality,

183
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:38,854
cannot be public spaces.

184
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:44,419
Thus there should be a distinction
made between the two pairs,

185
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:47,934
private/public and intimate/‘extimate’.

186
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:53,747
Family housing is commonly a place
of privacy without intimacy,

187
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:58,263
domestic violence being dominant
among all violent practices,

188
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:03,389
while urban public spaces
offer intimacy without privacy.

189
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:07,705
Urbanity can be defined, as we have said,

190
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:11,849
as a combination of density and diversity.

191
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:14,898
Those terms refer to population:

192
00:13:14,898 --> 00:13:20,330
urbanity being higher when different
social categories are more mixed,

193
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,762
as well as to functions:

194
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:28,241
urbanity being made up of
a heterogeneity of activities,

195
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,758
sectors, and dimensions.

196
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:33,531
In consequence of these characteristics,

197
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:37,084
public space can be seen
as an excellent generator

198
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,021
and indicator of urbanity.

199
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,906
Since public space
is supposed to concentrate

200
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:46,239
a similar level of diversity
as a whole urban area

201
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,417
into a small part of this area,

202
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:51,725
it can be considered as
a concentration of urbanity.

203
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:57,600
Like urbanity in general, public
spaces express weak ties.

204
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,062
This also means that we are not
dealing with the major flaws

205
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,463
of social redistribution,

206
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:10,328
nor with the main features defining
an individual within society.

207
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:16,945
This apparent inconsistency has
sometimes led to misunderstandings.

208
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:22,945
Certain commentators do not
perceive weak ties

209
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,115
to play major roles
in social construction,

210
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,123
and complain that urbanity
does not solve

211
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:33,635
the problems resulting from
economic inequalities.

212
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:38,247
They denounce research into
social diversity as a myth,

213
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:41,317
since it does not solve any problems.

214
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,940
Increasing diversity is not a policy

215
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,995
for the redistribution
of separable private goods,

216
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:54,102
but a contribution to equality
of access and capacity.

217
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,664
Public space does not distribute
money to the poor,

218
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:00,203
but it gives to the poor, as to the rich,

219
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:04,203
the possibility of experiencing
productivity and creativity

220
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,637
through exposure to otherness.

221
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:08,421
That is all it does,

222
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:12,080
but that is already something remarkable.

223
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,918
Public space does not create
an easy experience.

224
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:18,151
The more successful the public space,

225
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:21,108
that is to say, the greater
the degree of diversity

226
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:23,213
to be encountered therein,

227
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:27,563
the more it enables a visible
and felt heterogeneity,

228
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:29,074
agreeable or not,

229
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:34,629
which defines society, and to which
all of those within the space belong.

230
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:41,068
Public space can raise awareness
of the otherness of the social world.

231
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:47,437
A public space is not
a designer’s creation.

232
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:53,687
It can be useful for an urban designer
to plan its materiality.

233
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:58,099
However, this does not
guarantee its viability.

234
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:04,990
To the contrary, public spaces can exist
ephemerally and nomadically

235
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,908
in a non-constructed manner,

236
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:11,700
during exceptional or periodic events.

237
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,053
It can be assumed that public space
is a moment of justice,

238
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:19,765
a weak moment,

239
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:25,745
but whole in the fact that it makes
equality possible in act.

240
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:30,299
Conversely, urban planning
linked to power politics

241
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:33,679
seeks to make such moments
of justice impossible,

242
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,779
by creating grand squares

243
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:40,493
devoted to formal gatherings
and military parades.

244
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:45,724
Urban planning aiming at
fragmentation and separation

245
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:50,811
forgets about public space
and privatizes everything possible,

246
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:54,742
while demolishing in its path
everything required,

247
00:16:54,742 --> 00:17:00,543
the multi-sensory exposure to otherness
proper to the pedestrian.

248
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:05,254
However, a style of urban planning,

249
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:08,147
aiming at adding value
to existing urbanity,

250
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:12,893
and producing new dimensions
of urban being-together,

251
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:17,549
focuses, almost exclusively,
on public space.

252
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:21,312
The main features of public space

253
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:25,403
can be summed up through
fifteen theses on public space,

254
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:26,890
which have been the outcome

255
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,483
of a collective research
project on the concept.
