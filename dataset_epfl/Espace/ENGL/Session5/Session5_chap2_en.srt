1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,672
The era of absolute
urbanization is ending,

2
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:10,100
and, from now on,
what can be found,

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,170
on the horizon of urban agency,

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,909
is relative urbanization.

5
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:19,349
The city is not a new phenomenon
in human history.

6
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:21,747
Cities appear
roughly at the same time

7
00:00:21,747 --> 00:00:25,187
as farming, writing, money,
and the state.

8
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:28,842
The invention of the city
can be seen at the outcome

9
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:30,934
of the Neolithic Revolution

10
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:33,849
due to the existence of food surpluses,

11
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:38,128
allowing for new
and totally artificial settlements.

12
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:42,942
However, as Jane Jacobs
and Henri Lefebvre argued,

13
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,770
the emergence of cities

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,520
as political, religious, commercial,
or cultural areas,

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,310
can also be understood
as the cause of this revolution.

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:59,247
In brief,
a city is an amazing spatial machine.

17
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,074
All throughout
the process of urbanization,

18
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:09,273
the very idea of a city
has triggered some negative attitudes.

19
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:13,573
There has been a long tradition
of rejecting urbanity.

20
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:18,260
The history of the city
entered our minds through a spell.

21
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,368
The curse on the city, and on density,
and, indeed, on globalization too,

22
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:30,440
had already been announced
in the Old Testament.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,494
The God of the Jews and Christians

24
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,752
was the first enemy of density.

25
00:01:50,293 --> 00:01:54,562
Then, the curse upon density
was maintained,

26
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:56,626
and given fresh impetus,

27
00:01:56,626 --> 00:02:01,496
by an important European
puritanical-communal tradition.

28
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,055
This tradition was represented

29
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:06,457
at the highest philosophical
and literary levels,

30
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:10,356
by Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
who wrote:

31
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,757
This tradition continued in Europe,

32
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:28,132
and increased under the influence
of agrarian states,

33
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:34,291
which perceived emerging large cities
as dangerous political rivals.

34
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,067
This was particularly the case for France,

35
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,047
where the alliance

36
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:41,938
between the central state and rural notables

37
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:48,100
kept Paris and other major urban areas,
in a state of subjugation.

38
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,261
In many European countries,

39
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:56,181
the imagined community
underpinning national identity

40
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:58,111
was nothing more than the myth

41
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,442
of a self-sufficient, nature-friendly,

42
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:04,153
prolific, and harmonious countryside,

43
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:06,988
unfortunately,
undermined and threatened

44
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:12,133
by messy, artificial, and sterile cities.

45
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,960
This myth migrated to America,

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,008
conveyed by people who,
from the day they landed,

47
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:21,947
began to build
an overwhelmingly urban environment,

48
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:24,592
while remaining
proud and ardent militants

49
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:28,053
of their puritanical cause.

50
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:31,137
This probably explains a paradox.

51
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:34,884
The North American version
of the anti-urban narrative

52
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:40,878
is embodied, if not by a city,
then, at least, by a town-like landscape,

53
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,004
that of Main Street America,

54
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:47,913
with its parochial
single-street community,

55
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:49,864
and its farming hinterland,

56
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:54,453
but not exactly with the plow,
plowing, and plowman,

57
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:57,813
of European mythologies.

58
00:03:57,813 --> 00:04:01,349
‘Parochial’ was the word
used by Lyn Lofland

59
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:05,121
to designate
the kind of fake public space

60
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,811
where anonymity is impossible.

61
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:12,475
We will explore this idea
more in-depth during this session.

62
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:15,693
In Walt Disney's images,

63
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:19,243
the discourse
may seem to have been secularized.

64
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:22,410
However, when one reads
the following statement,

65
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,293
in a Dearborn published article
by Henry Ford,

66
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:31,213
stigmatizing the pestiferous growth
of the city,

67
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:35,089
one discovers
an unquestionable continuity

68
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:39,223
with the Bible's inspiration and style.

69
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:59,692
On the academic side,
the libertarian utopia,

70
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:02,899
epitomized by Melvyn Webber,
in the 50s,

71
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:06,663
or the cybermythology
proposed by the early William Mitchell,

72
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:12,113
joyfully celebrating the end of the city,
completes the picture.

73
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:14,843
Why so much hatred?

74
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:17,675
An attractive hypothesis is that the city

75
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:22,392
is the hyper-realistic expression
of human agency.

76
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:27,543
In a city, everything is artificial,
including, of course, nature.

77
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:31,932
Hatred for urbanity
is hatred for society,

78
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:36,923
and, more specifically,
for the inevitable exposure to otherness

79
00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:41,786
which a city harbors
in each of its dimensions.

80
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:47,746
Lyn Lofland has called the city
a ‘world of strangers’.

81
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:52,442
A city is the kind of place
where people are forced to entertain

82
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:55,970
limited relationships with unknown others

83
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,515
who, nevertheless,
belong to the same society as ours.

84
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:06,796
Cities mark the end
of the communal dream - or nightmare -,

85
00:06:06,796 --> 00:06:12,045
a world where any people tossed away
are known and watched,

86
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:15,239
as we are known and watched by them.

87
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:19,843
In any city,
even in communally-organized societies,

88
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:22,529
the perspective of a society
of individuals,

89
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:25,813
with more society and individuality,

90
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:29,263
is both possible and conceivable.

91
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,773
Tell me what you think about cities,

92
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:35,257
and I will tell you
what is your social attitude

93
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:38,751
and, if you are a scholar,
what is your social theory.
