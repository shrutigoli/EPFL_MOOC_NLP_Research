Urbanity consists of virtuality and serendipity.
A large city is characterized by the significance of its virtuality and serendipity, and both are impossible without density.
Firstly, there are so many things to do, that a choice must be made, which means eliminating certain things.
When you are not in a movie theater, you are not the same person, whether there are one or three hundred films to see.
This is virtuality, which should not be confused with simulation, or approximation.
The greater the degree to which one lives in an urbanity-rich environment, the larger the gap between what could be done, and what is actually done.
This is the golden burden of urbanity.
In this context, chance can offer a partial solution.
The non-actualized component of the possibilities offered by the city is made available through random encounters. â€˜The Three Princes of Serendipâ€™ is a medieval Persian tale, popularized by Horace Walpole in the 18th Century.
The princes in the story used two alternative strategies to get through difficult situations.
The first is to take advantage of the unexpected situations they encounter along the way, while the second is to employ a skill for arranging accidents - an expression of their sagacity, to use Walpole's words.
Robert Merton and Umberto Eco have both taken this phenomenon seriously.
We could even go beyond mere observation to consider how serendipity could be arranged.
Transforming chance into productivity is what John Udell, a blog specialist, calls â€˜manufactured serendipityâ€™.
In an urban context, the conditions to be met for efficient serendipity to exist, could then be identified.
I the activation and involvement of all of our perceptive sensors, indeed, all of our sensorial apparatus, in order not to miss any information.
Pedestrian metrics are the most suitable for that purpose, although their suitability can be challenged by physical or digital libraries, and even more by search engines.
II an exposure to otherness, which assumes the existence of otherness, diversity, its accessibility, density, and of course its acceptability.
III the cognitive skill to usefully interpret the information received.
Thus, reciprocal reinforcement takes place between urbanity and serendipity.
Serendipity is all the more necessary because urban space generates a rich set of virtual resources.
At the same time, serendipity is made all the more possible because of the density and diversity of urban space.
This is a clear case of a virtuous, positive feedback loop.
To the contrary, if the level of urbanity is reduced, the efficiency of serendipity, as well as its usefulness, is weakened.
N x(n - 1), or approximately n2, is a formula defining the number of potential non-reciprocal links between n realities.
It permits an understanding of why city size matters.
Nevertheless, size is not everything: n can be large but with no reason for people to meet, either because they are too similar, or too different, with nothing to exchange, or because they lack sufficient accessibility to come into contact.
Hence there is an absolute, size-dependent urbanity and a relative urbanity, independent of size.
This means that urbanization can be defined as a creation of urbanity, in relative as well as in absolute terms.
Urbanity can be injected into existing cities through the creation of density or diversity. â€˜Urban renewalâ€™ or â€˜urban renaissanceâ€™ are movements typical of relative urbanization processes.
Public space is a special, quintessential component of urbanity.
It is a specific way of creating politics: that is, civility.
Public space is a strange multi-scalar object.
Let's see how strange it is.
Public space can be defined as a small component of a local society, which possesses the same level of diversity of the society as a whole.
This means that entering a public space involves a high degree of otherness, in terms of population and activities.
Any public space then, has at least two scales: its own, and that of the reference space, whose diversity it concentrates.
Public space can be approached as the quintessence of the city, as a concentrated urbanity.
Etienne Tassin showed the contradictions encountered if public space is to be looked at through a communitarian lens.
Public space does not belong to an exclusive community benefiting from its exclusive usage.
That which defines the public in terms of space, as in other domains, is a fact that it does not belong to anybody, because it arises from society in its entirety.
Writings on public space are surprisingly recent.
Public space remains relatively peripheral to the otherwise foundational works on urban action by Ildefons CerdÃ in the late 19th Century, and very marginal to the works of Le Corbusier, and the modern movement in the mid-20th Century.
The beginning, reflections on public space were confined to the domain of urban design.
In French, and sometimes in English literature, public space suffered a misunderstanding, due to a bad translation of the Kantian notion, which was taken up again by JÃ¼rgen Habermas, of â€˜Ã–ffentlichkeitâ€™, which means public, or public sphere, in German.
This was confused with 'public space', which is â€˜Ã¶ffentlicher Raumâ€™, and this notably led to lackadaisical confusion of the agora, as a material metaphor of the political scene, in the context of direct democracy, and public space, as it exists in inhabited environments, without any specific relation to institutional political life.
This confusion in turn prevented an awareness of the political component proper to the public space, which may be called â€˜civilityâ€™.
Civility is entirely political, without referring to institutional political life at all.
Aristotle defined the possibility for liberty through equality.
This liberty is made possible through the creation of an egalitarian environment, where the words and actions of each person carry the same weight.
This is the principle of â€˜polisâ€™, according to Hannah Arendt, who defined politics as the freedom to organize a space.
Urban public space is a good expression of a political universe: that of civility, which, while not democratic in its apparent, and purely interactive, form of organization, is nonetheless founded on the principle of equality.
When this equality is fundamentally missing, such as in India and Africa, there is no public space present.
One of the particularities of civility lies in the fact that it is entirely expressed through interaction.
It is through the exposure of vulnerable human bodies and their protection by others that inhabitants transform public space into a political environment.
In a square, on a street, or in a subway car, norms of spatial organization are constantly being renegotiated, by placing oneâ€™s body in such and such a way in relation to others.
A conflict implies a challenge to the interactive norms between people.
Yet, whether the protagonists of this joust reach an agreement or not, the argumentative phase will not tip civility over into deliberation.
Deliberation means a collective, explicit process of decision making, which cannot occur in public space.
The being-inhabited nature of public space is in fact volatile by definition, since itâ€™s open to everyone, and not only to regulars, but to all of those who, to some degree or another, occupy the space.
The ethics of interaction work in all sorts of spaces.
They consist of preserving autonomy within integration, as much in private space (the protection of individual integrity and minimalist benevolence via politeness, which is etymologically an urban value), as in public space (protection of intimacy and favorable exchanges lending value to publicness).
What has emerged can now be summarized into a set of characteristics, making public space a very peculiar and fascinating object for geography.
First of all, the efficiency of a public space is based on the interaction of those provisionally inhabiting it.
Public space is open to changes in its norms and uses, as carried out by the practices of those inhabiting it.
These changes may either reinforce or weaken its public character.
As a result, designing and building a public space is neither necessary nor sufficient to make it exist.
Secondly, public space is a public good, characterized by the possible presence of a level of population, and functional diversity within it, equal to that of the larger reference space, or spaces: a neighborhood, a city, the world.
Thirdly, pedestrian metrics - walking plus public transit - are the characteristic metrics of public space, which can be fixed or mobile.
Finally, public space protects and reinforces intimacy.
Places marked by the necessity of pre-existing links between its inhabitants, like compulsorily belonging to any kind of communality, cannot be public spaces.
Thus there should be a distinction made between the two pairs, private/public and intimate/â€˜extimateâ€™.
Family housing is commonly a place of privacy without intimacy, domestic violence being dominant among all violent practices, while urban public spaces offer intimacy without privacy.
Urbanity can be defined, as we have said, as a combination of density and diversity.
Those terms refer to population: urbanity being higher when different social categories are more mixed, as well as to functions: urbanity being made up of a heterogeneity of activities, sectors, and dimensions.
In consequence of these characteristics, public space can be seen as an excellent generator and indicator of urbanity.
Since public space is supposed to concentrate a similar level of diversity as a whole urban area into a small part of this area, it can be considered as a concentration of urbanity.
Like urbanity in general, public spaces express weak ties.
This also means that we are not dealing with the major flaws of social redistribution, nor with the main features defining an individual within society.
This apparent inconsistency has sometimes led to misunderstandings.
Certain commentators do not perceive weak ties to play major roles in social construction, and complain that urbanity does not solve the problems resulting from economic inequalities.
They denounce research into social diversity as a myth, since it does not solve any problems.
Increasing diversity is not a policy for the redistribution of separable private goods, but a contribution to equality of access and capacity.
Public space does not distribute money to the poor, but it gives to the poor, as to the rich, the possibility of experiencing productivity and creativity through exposure to otherness.
That is all it does, but that is already something remarkable.
Public space does not create an easy experience.
The more successful the public space, that is to say, the greater the degree of diversity to be encountered therein, the more it enables a visible and felt heterogeneity, agreeable or not, which defines society, and to which all of those within the space belong.
Public space can raise awareness of the otherness of the social world.
A public space is not a designerâ€™s creation.
It can be useful for an urban designer to plan its materiality.
However, this does not guarantee its viability.
To the contrary, public spaces can exist ephemerally and nomadically in a non-constructed manner, during exceptional or periodic events.
It can be assumed that public space is a moment of justice, a weak moment, but whole in the fact that it makes equality possible in act.
Conversely, urban planning linked to power politics seeks to make such moments of justice impossible, by creating grand squares devoted to formal gatherings and military parades.
Urban planning aiming at fragmentation and separation forgets about public space and privatizes everything possible, while demolishing in its path everything required, the multi-sensory exposure to otherness proper to the pedestrian.
However, a style of urban planning, aiming at adding value to existing urbanity, and producing new dimensions of urban being-together, focuses, almost exclusively, on public space.
The main features of public space can be summed up through fifteen theses on public space, which have been the outcome of a collective research project on the concept.
