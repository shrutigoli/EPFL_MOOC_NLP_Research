1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,515
Finally, public space
logically constitutes

2
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:11,904
one of the markers in a debate
on the conception of the city.

3
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:17,073
Although there are certain nuances,

4
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:18,340
on the whole,

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,120
there are clearly two opposed tendencies

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,394
in any city in the World today.

7
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:26,480
The opposition between ‘Amsterdam model’

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,618
and ‘Johannesburg model’ is very simple.

9
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:35,380
One assumes urbanity,
in its various dimensions of exposure

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,330
to otherness, density, diversity,
public space, and public metrics,

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,844
while the other assumes
a dispersed fragmentation

12
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:49,627
and a generalized privatization of space,

13
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:55,503
notably through adherence
to a car-oriented system.

14
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,450
The Amsterdam model takes predominance

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,339
when living in a city

16
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:05,089
implies a continuous making of society.

17
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:07,937
By contrast, the Johannesburg model

18
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:11,918
demonstrates a refusal
to take responsibility

19
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:15,953
for the societal consequences
of the technical options

20
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:19,533
preferred to living
in a concentrated space.

21
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:25,584
The following table suggests
that cities endowed with a high degree

22
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:28,696
of fixed or mobile public space

23
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:35,216
are also compact, mixed, productive,
and nature-friendly cities.

24
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:40,168
Serendipity, which allows value
to be added to creative processes,

25
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:45,640
and consisting of cognitive and emotional
displacements and deviations,

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,812
belongs more readily
to the Amsterdam model,

27
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:51,813
along with environmental protection,

28
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:56,732
which provides benefits
to all of its components --

29
00:01:56,732 --> 00:02:01,240
air, water, soil, and biodiversity --

30
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,260
when faced with the urban parsimony
of surface conception.

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,214
The prevalence of these models
can be differentiated as three scales.

32
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:19,667
The Johannesburg model is predominant
in North America and Africa, small towns,

33
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:23,930
and in situations
with weaker levels of urbanity

34
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,973
(less density, less diversity),

35
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:31,560
such as in peripheral suburbs or exurbs.

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,758
Conversely, the Amsterdam model
is predominant in Europe and Asia,

37
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:39,421
large cities, and city centres,

38
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:42,851
with the other spaces being more uncertain.

39
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:46,060
Thus the contrast between models

40
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,573
is at its height between city centers

41
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:53,143
such as Tokyo and Paris, 
on the one hand,

42
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:54,943
and the outer periphery,

43
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:58,403
or little Texan or South African towns,

44
00:02:58,403 --> 00:02:59,873
on the other.

45
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:04,066
Everywhere, and without exception,

46
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:06,842
the process of increasing development

47
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:10,178
has firstly meant choosing the automobile,

48
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:14,393
which has automatically led
to de-densification

49
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:19,391
and a loss of diversity
in less interesting neighbourhoods,

50
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:24,885
and a lack of attention given
to public space and the natural environment.

51
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:28,091
After this initial stage, however,

52
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:32,461
certain fundamentals
of social life take over.

53
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:35,760
Thus, in ‘hydraulic’ rural Asia,

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,348
there was, and still is,
a distinct value given to density,

55
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:46,360
where people constantly reinvest
into soil through human labor,

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,759
proximity through the distance
between industrial

57
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,327
or agricultural and residential locations,
and spatial arrangement

58
00:03:55,327 --> 00:04:00,759
through compact collective practices
which are found in its cities.

59
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:05,010
Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong,
and South Korea

60
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,936
have become creative places
for the re-evaluation of urbanity.

61
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:16,682
China displays a surprising situation
in which the Johannesburg model

62
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:19,303
continues to prosper,
even though public policies

63
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:25,017
are already and unambiguously orientated
towards the Amsterdam model,

64
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:27,750
with reinforced densities,
functional diversity,

65
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,530
public transit, and public spaces.

66
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:36,830
Moreover, this movement is affecting
the peripheral cities of the Pacific Rim,

67
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,808
marked by Chinese immigration,
such as Vancouver and Sydney,

68
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:46,594
which have been resistant 
to this approach for a long time.

69
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:49,160
Who chooses these models?

70
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,414
All of the urban society does

71
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:56,294
and, naturally,
its most expert or powerful actors.

72
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:59,556
The distribution of these models
across the map

73
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:03,658
points to the modes of organization
of inhabited space

74
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:06,166
profoundly linked to a certain manner

75
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:10,186
of conceiving liberty and equality.

76
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:15,779
The Amsterdam model
makes all the inhabitants in a city

77
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:18,817
its actors working continuously.

78
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:22,116
The entire city becomes a public good,

79
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:24,066
available to all,

80
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:28,336
and ceaselessly growing in its uses.

81
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:30,327
In a society of actors,

82
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:34,554
where life choices become part
of a process of arbitration

83
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:37,234
amongst those actors,

84
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:41,120
the pragmatic adoption 
of one model over another

85
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,442
is clearly translated
into political choices.

86
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:46,082
In developed countries,

87
00:05:46,082 --> 00:05:49,256
housing choices 
have progressively been added

88
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:53,535
to individuals’ spheres of arbitration.

89
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:58,085
This means that a majority of households

90
00:05:58,085 --> 00:05:59,889
have a certain affordance,

91
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:02,759
in the meaning used
in cognitive psychology,

92
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,026
that is to say,

93
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:07,306
a useful grip inside an environment,

94
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:10,526
possibly at a high cost
to the poorest layer

95
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:13,702
of an extended middle-class.

96
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:16,127
Being located within an urban area

97
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:19,817
has become one criterion, among others,

98
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:24,245
like ownership status, owner or renter,

99
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:27,885
housing style (flat or house), or size.

100
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:30,351
Consequently,

101
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:33,986
the place where most people live
is not merely the result

102
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:38,237
of an externally directed 
process of fatality,

103
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:42,939
but, at least, partially the outcome
of the people concerned.

104
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,347
We were able to show

105
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:49,713
that votes for populist
right-wing parties in Western Europe,

106
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:54,931
which are xenophobic nationalists
and anti-European Union,

107
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,795
were strongly correlated

108
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:59,969
with peri-urban residential environments,

109
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,709
beyond contiguous built up areas,

110
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,619
all things being equal.

111
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:14,789
From the same perspective,

112
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:18,106
the present day political map
of the United States

113
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:21,226
shows an extreme and novel polarization

114
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:24,226
between two contrary spatial size,

115
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:28,675
low-urbanity territories
associated with Republicans,

116
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:34,230
and high urbanity networks
associated with Democrats.

117
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,346
Furthermore,

118
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:39,346
formal modelling of residential choices,

119
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:42,099
centred on inhabitant individuals

120
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:47,154
and constructed with realistic economic
and geographical parameters,

121
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,272
gave spectacular results.

122
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:55,642
While ‘allophilia’ - that is the search for,
or acceptance of exposure to otherness,

123
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,129
through choices to live

124
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,644
in a socioeconomically 
diverse neighborhood -

125
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:02,234
prevails,

126
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:08,274
a compact city in conformity
to the Amsterdam model is created.

127
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,459
Conversely, in the case of ‘allophobia’ —

128
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:16,305
the refusal of diversity
in urban cohabitation -

129
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:21,086
the result is a sprawling
and fragmented city.

130
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:26,114
During iterative processes,
the model makes the decisive role

131
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:30,286
played by upper and middle 
income groups clear.

132
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:35,560
If those capable of arbitrating
do so with an allophilic tendency,

133
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,751
then diversity is maintained,

134
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:41,656
otherwise the poorest inhabitants
cannot achieve this end

135
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:45,076
since the other social groups
flee from them.

136
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:51,586
This is where attention to ‘bobo’
(bourgeois-bohème) logic is due.

137
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:56,716
Those disposing of high income 
who seek diversity for some reason

138
00:08:56,716 --> 00:09:01,572
play an essential role
in the maintenance of diversity.

139
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,600
This model allows for an evaluation

140
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,787
of the specific effects
of urban public policies.

141
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:14,360
It shows that if allophobia is dominant,
then public action is ineffective,

142
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,386
and individual actors bypass it

143
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:21,646
to continue pursuing
their project of separation.

144
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:24,535
If allophilia sets the tone,

145
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:28,344
diversity-oriented residential
and family policies

146
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:31,115
can accompany and enhance it.

147
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:34,445
It may be concluded that,

148
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:38,546
within heavy and complicated
machinery-like cities,

149
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:41,617
little actors play a major role.

150
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:43,959
The balance between
spactialities and spaces,

151
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,998
that is to say, between spatial actors
and spatial environments,

152
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:53,086
is better-assured than we could believe.

153
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:55,626
This means that major actions,

154
00:09:55,626 --> 00:10:00,753
deciding the place accorded to values
of justice and development,

155
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:03,065
may decreasingly be the result

156
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:06,696
of technocratic choices or structures

157
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:09,183
beyond reach, and increasingly,

158
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:15,078
result from the multiform deliberations
of ordinary citizens.

159
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:20,123
A recent evolution in urban planning
illustrates this point.

160
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:22,948
It’s daily becoming more difficult
to make decisions

161
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:25,359
and to implement urban projects

162
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:30,945
without a minimum of participatory
processes and rationales.

163
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:34,414
In this context,
public space appears

164
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:37,414
both as the quintessence of urbanity

165
00:10:37,414 --> 00:10:40,841
and as a potentially continuous space

166
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:44,665
connecting all areas
within and between cities.

167
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:45,831
As a matter of fact,

168
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:48,595
if we consider
public transportation systems

169
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:51,706
as the mobile part of public space,

170
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:55,270
intra-urban and interurban
public transport

171
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,140
both requires and provides public space.

172
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,724
In an urban network

173
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:03,154
characterized by the Amsterdam model,

174
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:06,046
there is a continuity between public space

175
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:09,296
inside and between cities.

176
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:14,634
This contributes to adding 
a third scale to any public space,

177
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:17,898
beyond its own micro intra-local scale,

178
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:23,055
and the urban society to which it belongs,
that is, at a local level.

179
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:26,221
Public space forms part of the integration

180
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:29,621
of an interconnected, interurban system

181
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:34,642
whose potential size could be 
the global urban archipelago,

182
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:39,636
and which is also a scalar 
measurement of a public space.

183
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:42,481
This means that a global scale
can be present,

184
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,895
in different ways in a public space,

185
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:49,720
for example, in people, activities,
products, and cultures,

186
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,397
as tiny as that public space might be,

187
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:56,777
and especially in metropolises.
