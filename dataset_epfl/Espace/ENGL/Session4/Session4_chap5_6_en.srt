1
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:06,677
The Internet’s strengths and weaknesses 

2
00:00:06,677 --> 00:00:08,249
lay precisely in


3
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:09,863
in its ability to transmit information

4
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:12,793
with unparalleled efficiency.

5
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:15,030
As matter is energy

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,084
in mass form,

7
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:17,759
it resists movement.

8
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:20,936
The larger the mass, the greater the energy

9
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:22,719
requires to move it.

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,040
The light or electricity we use

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,313
to communicate information via the Internet,

12
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:31,585
however, are forms of electromagnetic energy,

13
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,522
i.e. waves whose speed

14
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:36,824
is ideally close to nearly

15
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:38,637
a billion kilometers an hour.

16
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:41,288
It is by channeling this energy

17
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:43,340
in the form of continuums

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,852
that we are able to reach

19
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:48,654
transmission of this rapidity at a global scale.

20
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:53,448
Thus are we witnessing the emergence of new spaces

21
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:56,343
that reorganize the relative arrangement of things.

22
00:00:56,343 --> 00:00:59,456
These spaces are not mere transpositions

23
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:01,411
of existing spaces:

24
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:05,022
libraries, shops, newsstands, schools,

25
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:07,122
bars, public place, etc.

26
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:10,242
They are original spaces with specific qualities

27
00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:13,595
that use immateriality

28
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:15,447
in an exceptional way,

29
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:19,751
which is why they have such impressive transmission speeds

30
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:22,844
and cover unprecedented expanses.

31
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:29,080
The Internet’s limitations are nonetheless numerous.

32
00:01:29,384 --> 00:01:31,863
For instance, it is powerless

33
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:33,961
in meeting the many material needs

34
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,696
 of our existence.

35
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,777
Our bodies have a complex spatiality

36
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:41,871
requiring matter.

37
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:44,745
Digital technology can undoubtedly help us better understand

38
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:46,310
our practices and how they evolve,

39
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,839
as feedback to help us make decisions

40
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:52,240
and change our behavior.

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,736
But digital technology is limited to organizing information,

42
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:59,406
which is not the extent of our bodies’ demands.

43
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:03,076
Our bodies need protection from the elements, to be fed

44
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,233
with food and to be

45
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,275
healed with compounds.

46
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:11,997
Multisensory interaction is also widely sought after,

47
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:15,269
whereas the Internet is limited to two immaterial senses

48
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,871
(vision and hearing)

49
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:21,385
and cannot truly convey textures, flavors and smells.

50
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:24,606
Our bodies themselves are made of matter

51
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:27,976
and have mass, thus limiting their mobility.

52
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:30,954
Therefore, far from abolishing space,

53
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:34,355
the Internet reorganizes it, increasing its potential

54
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,250
and differentiating it even more,

55
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,185
constantly activating the value of situated resources

56
00:02:39,185 --> 00:02:44,256
whose materiality is a constraint or a gift.

57
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:48,661
The Internet thus reminds us of the plural nature of the territories

58
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:52,092
that are home to our bodies and the places that are home to our lives.

59
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,579
Thus, in just a few decades,

60
00:02:57,072 --> 00:03:00,384
 space has radically changed,

61
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:03,196
 offering new interpersonal opportunities.

62
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:05,774
In a hyperconnected environment,

63
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:09,508
 even disconnection is a change, at least relatively speaking.

64
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:13,559
The World is more cohesive but is also more diverse.

65
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:16,898
It is not so much the homogenization of the world we are witnessing

66
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:19,562
as that of these processes of differentiation.

67
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:22,704
The latter are based

68
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,396
on generic systems and norms:

69
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:28,204
airports, hotels, restaurants, cell phones and the Internet,

70
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:31,906
whose similarities mask their spatial potency

71
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:33,609
and the diversity of their uses,

72
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,593
like so many points of reference

73
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:37,043
from which to take action.

74
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:42,140
Currently, the gap between

75
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,402
our understanding of this dynamic and its effectiveness

76
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:48,224
is particularly important,

77
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:53,532
as the Internet has created a space whose potential and practices

78
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:56,951
stem from logics that fit poorly into the frames

79
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,073
of reference we have developed thus far.

80
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:04,033
In particular, it gives rise to unprecedented interactions,

81
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,669
 from the local to the global scale,

82
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,095
like so much potential contact between individuals

83
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:11,180
regardless of the distance that separates them.

84
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,724
This dynamic - which began with the first roads and cities,

85
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,839
 with shipping lanes, railroads, writing,

86
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,100
printing, the radio,

87
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,351
 telephone and television -

88
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:29,038
is experiencing an important revival.

89
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:30,409
By changing space,

90
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:33,917
we affect one of society’s fundamental dimensions,

91
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:36,865
one of its most powerful driving forces.

92
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:40,478
How can we imagine that by simplifying the exchange of goods

93
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,239
between China and Europe that we are only

94
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:45,794
affecting the distribution of material goods?

95
00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:49,488
How can we believe that in inventing the car

96
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,660
we are only affecting mobility?

97
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,580
How can we assume that in creating the Internet,

98
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,669
we are only affecting the circulation of information?

99
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:03,873
Perhaps the Internet was an Eldorado

100
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:08,334
inhabited by pioneers who sought the coming of a better world.

101
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,436
But the Internet is above all a space

102
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:13,998
whose every basic component we build.

103
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:18,136
It is not so much an existing space to be discovered

104
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:21,904
but a space to be invented, again and again.

105
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,475
Understanding the tensions that affect

106
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,334
contemporary societies

107
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,872
implies taking space seriously,

108
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:31,395
not as a mere projection of the social realm

109
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:33,106
that situates what occurs

110
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:35,076
but as one of its conditions.

111
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:37,757
Without space there is no society.

112
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:40,668
Without contact the social realm disappears without enchantment.

113
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:44,924
Without communication life is reduced to nothing,

114
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,749
emptied from the outside, without otherness..

115
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:51,313
Society is therefore not given.

116
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:54,332
It is born of distance, of the space between people,

117
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:56,983
for which it is both a solution and a problem.

118
00:05:56,983 --> 00:06:00,331
Because it is fragile, it is constantly recomposed

119
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:03,122
based on the many acts and individual expressions

120
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:07,479
that together provide the delicate balance

121
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,582
between today’s society and the one to come.

122
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:12,527
Society is a solution when it liaises between individuals

123
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:16,773
with multiple and/or conflicting intentions.

124
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:19,078
Society is a problem

125
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,637
when it no longer is part of the space that gives it life,

126
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:23,607
and when it falls short of or goes beyond

127
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:29,287
the actual relationships between individuals.

128
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,298
Yet, the Internet does not abolish space.

129
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:36,657
On the contrary, it creates space between people,

130
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:39,314
a space of considerable power

131
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:41,139
that reorganizes our environment

132
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,174
in specific ways.

133
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:46,232
Because the Internet offers a unique space,

134
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:48,778
it is imperative to think about its architecture,

135
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:51,645
design, organization and players, 

136
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,472
and to identify the practices that develop therein, 

137
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:57,080
their logics and the favorite haunts

138
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,891
emerging from this renewal.

139
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:02,312
This space – both an economic and a political issue -

140
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:05,143
has become subject to intense conflicts

141
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:08,438
in which companies, that have become multinational

142
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:10,084
 in less than two decades,

143
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:13,268
are pitted against States whose sovereignty is impacted

144
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,274
by a network that is too big for them, 

145
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:17,226
and individuals whose interests 

146
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:19,349
and privacy are challenged

147
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:22,777
by this space of often opaque intricacy.
