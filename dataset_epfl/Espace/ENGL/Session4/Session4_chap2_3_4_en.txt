Such changes in modes of contact, are not without implications, for the world.
The economy, laws, politics and culture, â€“ no aspect of social life is spared by such changes.
Distance and the strategies we employ for eliminating it, have a structuring effect on our existence.
As such, our values and individual and collective capacity for â€œliving togetherâ€�, are inevitably affected.
That is why the Internet is such an important issue, now and for the future.
Understanding the spatial dimension of the Internet, is also a way of understanding the extent to which, our relationship to space is undergoing a profound change.
Access to information has changed, its distribution being more massive, individualized, disintermediated and dematerialized.
Production conditions are changing as new relationships,
- more scattered but also more numerous -, are being forged a little more each day.
The rules of the economy are also being altered, as contact between supply and demand has greatly changed.
Furthermore, our means of evaluating our environment are changing as intermediaries seemingly become less and less essential.
This means that we must not only reevaluate the nature of our social environment, but also those who are in charge of it, discussing expertise and, by extension, the legitimacy of experts.
More fundamentally, individuals are recreating their relationship with the world and with themselves,, their identity, otherness and ability to act in a world that is increasingly vast.
Politics are also affected by such changes.
Changing space means changing coexistence, our relationship to others and politics.
Politics is thus faced with a double burden :
On one hand, as political action, it must respond to social change : changes in ownership, privacy, freedom of expression, education, sovereignty, etc.
On the other hand, as politics in action, it must adapt its very framework to peopleâ€™s changing modes of expression, commitment, collaboration and responsibility.
Understanding what is occurring, does indeed require perceiving the many modes of existence, and most notably spatiality.
Thus it becomes obvious that changing space means changing the arrangement of things, changing interpersonal relationships, changing the World and changing society.
The relationships between the Internet, space and society are so complex that it is essential to distinguish clearly between the societal causes that led to its emergence and the consequences of its spread in society.
The causes are generally the result of the widespread desire to optimize social interaction, whereas the consequences are the result of the realization of this desire.
The car perfectly illustrates this distinction: it meets an identifiable urge for individual mobility, but the consequences of its use on society is far more complex.
The cognitive dissonance resulting from the common confusion between the causes and consequences, results in expectations, an imaginary and a vocabulary, marked by a strong dichotomy between dystopias and utopias.
But such confusion is detrimental to understanding the actual relationship between the Internet and its social environment.
The Internetâ€™s emergence brought about not only the abolition of space and distance, but also the supposed discrepancy between real space and virtual space, and, even more, between real life and virtual life.
This discrepancy has raised numerous questions relative to the Internetâ€™s unique spatiality.
When we go on the Internet, where are we really going?
What does an address or site mean in such a context?
Of what is the Internet the virtual version?
Understanding the Internet requires a better understanding of space.
Let us speculate that our inability to understand the Internetâ€™s influence on the World stems from an erroneous conception of space.
Space is generally understood as a material reality and is often equated to territory, in which other realities (individuals, homes, vehicles, resources, etc.) coexist: individuals, homes, vehicles, resources, etc.
The problem with this perception of space, though widespread, can be summed up in a relatively simple question: if space is a thing, then where is it?
This question highlights the aporia of considering space as a material support for action and underscores the common confusion between what is situated and what situates.
Yet, space is neither material, nor a support.
Spaces may be situated, but always in relation to other spaces.
That is why we must completely rethink space, as discussed in the previous sessions.
Leibnizâ€™s and Kantâ€™s philosophies in the 17th and 18th centuries, and physics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, clearly showed that space is essentially an a priori requirement for the understanding that allows us to situate things in a relative way.
It is not a specific thing, but a specific ordering of things. an arrangement of things relative to one another.
This conceptual shift, which significantly changed philosophy and physics, has not yet fully taken place.
While material realities are an essential part, of our existence, contemporary societies are nonetheless increasingly organized around immaterial resources.
Information in particular has become a major resource, whose processing, storage and circulation are the focus of many industries.
Today we consecrate more than a quarter of our lives to education, which is nothing other than the transmission of information that has been deemed useful for our development.
Our leisure activities are also affected by the dematerialization of music, films and many games.
Money is also increasingly simple information that no longer needs to be in material form to be exchanged.
That is why the consequences of spatial materialism are relatively numerous.
Such a conception of space, for instance, lends to an incomplete comprehension of the reality of the Internet.
The contradistinction between real life and virtual life is undoubtedly one of the most caricatural consequences of this confusion.
But this aporia is particularly unfortunate in that it de-realizes our increasingly numerous relationships and acts.
Finally, it seems that this confusion between real and virtual conceals the other, more insidious one between reality and materiality.
More precisely, it is the immateriality of the relationships, created via the Internet, that is at the heart of a larger misunderstanding, of which the materialist conception of space is the most structural element.
It is not enough to recall that the Internet is made of cables and data centers to describe its reality.
The reality of the Internet is far bigger.
It includes all the information and practices that take place in this space.
And yet, these immaterial relationships are nevertheless real interactions and, each day, contribute in their own small way to the development of contemporary individual and collective lives.
Nowadays, the challenge is understanding the tradeoffs between the material and immaterial, network and territory, and between the Internet and the spaces existed prior to it.
The Internet does not abolish space, no more so than it eliminates distance.
Rather, it makes distance less relevant in certain configurations and with regard to certain issues, to respond to specific interactions.
For this reason, the Internet creates space, new relationships between an ever-growing number of realities and new places that are very much real, which become interfaces, that are essential to increasingly numerous practices.
Wikipedia, Facebook and YouTube, among others, are spaces that respond to specific problems with amazing efficiency.
They are not degraded forms of space or virtual spaces, but real, contemporary spaces.
The immateriality of the interactions that characterize them does not detract from their reality.
On the contrary, it increases their capacity to fully respond to specific needs.
These spaces emerge in response to problems that territorial spaces cannot resolve as effectively.
It is unnecessary to emphasize the virtual nature of the relationships on Facebook or to compare Wikipedia to Britannica.
Instead we should ask of what
Facebook and Wikipedia are the spaces, and take a more symmetrical approach that would require the same thing of territorial spaces.
What territorial space could possibly allow for the constant, instantaneous coproduction of an encyclopedia developed by individuals who are scattered all over the world, and disseminate this knowledge for free?
What territorial space allows us to interact with people, regardless of their whereabouts, at any moment?
What territorial space allows you to view or listen to virtually any contemporary audiovisual resource ever made?
