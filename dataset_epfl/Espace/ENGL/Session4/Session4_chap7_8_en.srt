1
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:04,790
Space is indeed

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,000
what brings us together and what separates us.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,955
There is space between us, the space we share.

4
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:16,088
The duality of space is also a major social issue,

5
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:17,817
that reflects the tension between

6
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:21,945
the distance necessary for the expression of individuality

7
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:25,640
and the contact necessary for the expression of society.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,130
Because action takes place,

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,473
space is inevitably a problem of desires,

10
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:33,919
appropriation, inequalities, identities and conflicts.

11
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:36,040
Living together with space means

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,901
finding a way to share that works..

13
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:44,976
Clearly, the Internet is a space wherein sharing

14
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:46,710
will become increasingly complicated

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,717
as the number of players increases.

16
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,703
Internet also has the particularity

17
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:57,338
of being simultaneously

18
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:00,440
global, national and regional.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,970
Yet, tradeoffs must be made together,

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,776
in order to organize this space

21
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:07,651
and guide its future.

22
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,680
Tradeoffs like privacy vs. transparency,

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,546
security vs. freedom of expression,

24
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:17,387
and intellectual property vs. the dissemination of knowledge

25
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:20,176
can be left neither to the market

26
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:22,622
nor to the power of individual disappointments.

27
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:25,669
These adjustments raise many difficulties

28
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,361
because it can legitimately be argued that the space for their regulation

29
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,263
is unquestionably the World.

30
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:34,985
On the other hand, these tradeoffs have an inevitable cost: policy.

31
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:37,266
Losing individual sovereignty

32
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:40,266
to gain power to make

33
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,189
the plurality of the World exist together seems

34
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,118
like the only condition of this coexistence,

35
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,271
in a unified world of interconnections.

36
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:53,238
Thus, “the Eldorado” has probably lasted too long.

37
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,533
Google prioritizes spaces using opaque algorithms

38
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,264
of which it alone is the master,

39
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:00,608
giving it unrivalled centrality.

40
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:03,322
Facebook handles the social practices

41
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:04,958
of more than a billion people

42
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,068
whose relationships and exchanges become its property.

43
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:10,622
The network effect of such players

44
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:14,092
is so great that it is becoming increasingly difficult to escape it,

45
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:18,886
or risk losing the gains of that which was nonetheless produced collectively

46
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:22,592
(hypertext links, publications, relationships, etc.).

47
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:28,719
That’s why it is worth asking

48
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,506
why such key features were not developed

49
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:36,691
using principles comparable to

50
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:40,879
packet transmission, IP addressing, messaging or the Web

51
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,137
at the Internet’s founding.

52
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:44,420
How is it that a private company

53
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,348
can monopolize our social networks

54
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:48,543
and stockpile our digital traces,

55
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,421
and sell them unbeknownst to us?

56
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:53,093
Why is it so unthinkable

57
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:56,272
that social networks are becoming a protocol like any other,

58
00:02:56,272 --> 00:03:00,946
whose market activity will eventually come down to simplifying use,

59
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:04,119
like messaging or the Web?

60
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:08,198
Why do private companies give themselves permission

61
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:11,627
to activate cameras remotely on stolen computers?

62
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:15,098
Why does Google think it can divert the privacy settings

63
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:17,999
of a competing browser?

64
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,266
Why did Megaupload prosper

65
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,273
for so long with total impunity?

66
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:29,383
The answer: simply because politics were largely absent

67
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,058
from this space for many years, and often restricted

68
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:33,717
its involvement to limited

69
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:35,680
authoritative prerogatives.

70
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,196
Above all, this authority was largely inapplicable

71
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:43,023
in a space where the State had so little control.

72
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:47,632
Yet, defining what is fair and the means for complying

73
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:49,798
with this is a highly political issue that is little satisfied

74
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:53,426
with injunctions at inappropriate scales.

75
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:56,643
Justice is invariably a compromise

76
00:03:56,643 --> 00:03:58,518
between private interests that incorporate

77
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:01,247
provisional values

78
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:02,909
and is therefore contextual.

79
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,455
Which is why the World and the Internet share a common problem:

80
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,794
justice can be thought about at this scale

81
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:11,341
but is only marginally effective.

82
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:15,942
The Internet as such is facing a formidable problem:

83
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:19,848
making local conceptions of what is fair commensurable

84
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:22,558
while changing the practical arrangements

85
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:25,236
of living together by its very existence.

86
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:29,193
It is not Wikipedia, P2P (Peer-to-Peer), blogs

87
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:31,630
or collective evaluation platforms

88
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,156
that should be questioned,

89
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:36,120
but rather what they will become in a highly commercial world

90
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,047
driven by numerous private interests,

91
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:41,194
from which the Internet will not escape unscathed

92
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:44,772
without full consideration of what sharing includes.

93
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:47,826
Now more than ever we must explore this question

94
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:52,191
and together devise the means for maintaining this shared space,

95
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,365
and of sharing it.

96
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:57,504
Paradoxically, the Internet is an ideal place

97
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:59,306
for implementing such a project,

98
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:02,085
by dint of the conversations

99
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,148
that take place in a broader public sphere.

100
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:07,485
But sharing cannot be done without considering

101
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:09,473
the plurality of individuals,

102
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:13,396
spaces and institutions concerned by it.

103
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:17,113
Certainly we must safeguard against idiocy,

104
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:18,930
which the ancient Greeks defined

105
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,557
as the propensity to restrict one’s horizons

106
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:24,547
and isolate oneself from a broader world.

107
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:33,053
The Internet thus appears to be the ideal space for the emergence of a World society,

108
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:38,179
a society whose ultimate horizon is political.

109
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:42,260
This dynamic underscores the weakness of nation states,

110
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,989
which were once legitimate before being overwhelmed

111
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:48,670
by increasingly intense practices

112
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,551
at scales that largely exceed them.

113
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:57,843
In this respect, individuals’ disengagement from and mistrust of politics

114
00:05:57,843 --> 00:06:00,384
is not so much a failure of politics

115
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:02,290
as of the nation state,

116
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,958
which clearly no longer has the means to fulfill its ambitions.

117
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,134
Currently, numerous are the events

118
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,237
that take the World

119
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:10,566
as their pertinent space

120
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:13,634
for expression and political action.

121
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:19,897
But the Internet is facing an obstacle

122
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:22,544
that threatens all of its underpinnings.

123
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:25,662
Paradoxically, the time seems to have come

124
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:28,503
where politics must preserve the utopia

125
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:31,769
it had aspired to do without.

126
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:36,114
The Internet was in fact conceived and designed with the libertarian ideal

127
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:38,505
of self-organization,

128
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:41,625
which left plenty of room for the individual.

129
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:46,472
Also, this system has demonstrated the effective power of this ideology,

130
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,092
which has already profoundly changed the World.

131
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:51,576
However, by becoming a reality,

132
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:53,280
this utopia has taken place.

133
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,387
Now that it’s a place, the Internet is faced

134
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:58,281
with humanity at its most political:

135
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,830
the reconciliation of individual interests

136
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,776
in a shared space.

137
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:06,786
Politics could certainly jeopardize

138
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:08,124
the Internet’s potential,

139
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:10,570
but it also seems like

140
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,217
the most obvious way to preserve it.

141
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:15,424
Nation-States were slow

142
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:17,348
to perceive what was emerging,

143
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:20,559
but now that their sovereignty has been further weakened and compromised

144
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,541
- overwhelmed on all sides -

145
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,287
they are attempting to regain control of their space.

146
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:28,338
This jolt takes unequal forms,

147
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:30,696
ranging from the widespread surveillance techniques

148
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,367
used by the United States

149
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:35,706
to nationalization in China (and Iran even more so)

150
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,949
to the Domain Name System blockades

151
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,640
imposed on Internet Service Providers in France and the U.K.

152
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,395
The premises of the Internet’s future governance

153
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:52,033
are a far cry from those initiated at its emergence,

154
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:54,339
of which TCP-IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol),

155
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,399
messaging and the Web are the heirs.

156
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,361
Though co-authors of this announced catastrophe,

157
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:02,916
individuals are now witnessing the commercial hyper-concentration

158
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,316
of this space in the hands of a few companies

159
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:10,725
and its uncoordinated, misinformed, authoritarian regulation

160
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:13,640
by States legitimately seeking their place

161
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,545
in this space that exceeds their means.

162
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:18,881
Make no mistake about it.

163
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:21,888
The legacy of the Internet’s founders is not steadfast.

164
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:24,992
Changes in protocols, including IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6),

165
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:28,335
will simplify national regulations

166
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:31,041
and the undermining of the network’s “neutrality”,

167
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,941
allowing for unprecedented control of digital practices.

168
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:39,296
A Stateless space, the Internet was created with the illusion

169
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:42,998
that politics were incapable of taking control of it.

170
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:46,159
Pushed to the limits of their intimacy – space –

171
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,875
States are now calling to restore their respective orders.

172
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,993
But because these orders are highly diverse

173
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,716
and in large part contradictory,

174
00:08:55,716 --> 00:09:00,147
the Internet will undergo profound changes in the decades to come.

175
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:02,626
More than ever

176
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,714
people need to be aware of this fragile balance.

177
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,880
States will intervene as best they can

178
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,405
in response to the increasing excesses

179
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:12,341
of a space whose unequal control

180
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:15,385
calls for inevitable regulations

181
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:17,591
to protect fundamental freedoms,

182
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,165
while unable to coordinate

183
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:22,296
their actions at the Internet scale (i.e. the World).

184
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:29,234
Now more than ever, it is not a question of morals but of ethics,

185
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:32,297
because what we do to the Internet

186
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:34,463
we do to the World at large.

187
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,244
That is why the future must choose

188
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,930
between the globalization of politics

189
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,317
and the nationalization of the Internet.

190
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:46,153
The first option would merely be the continuation of a long process

191
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,297
begun in the early coalescences of humanity.

192
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,849
The second would be a terrible decline

193
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:55,131
that would mean not only the end of the Internet

194
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:56,967
as we know it,

195
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,355
but also that of a global, emerging society

196
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:02,524
that is only asking to express itself.

197
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:05,869
A powerful vehicle of the globalization

198
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:08,103
that actively mobilizes individuals,

199
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:10,522
the Internet does suggest

200
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:12,942
that the time has come for humanity

201
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:15,321
to think about this upscaling

202
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:18,124
towards its ultimate horizon: the World.

203
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:21,486
Because the Internet is the ideal public sphere

204
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:23,437
for meeting this challenge,

205
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:25,175
an ideal but fragile place

206
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:27,303
that we must never cease to consider,

207
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:33,573
build, share, feed and preserve, together.
