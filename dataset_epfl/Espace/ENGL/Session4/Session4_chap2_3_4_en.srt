2
00:00:05,844 --> 00:00:07,208
Such changes in modes of contact,

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,288
are not without implications,

4
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:11,348
for the world.

5
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:14,880
The economy, laws, politics and culture,

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,700
– no aspect of social life is spared by such changes.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,990
Distance and the strategies we employ for eliminating it,

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,600
have a structuring effect on our existence.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,860
As such, our values and

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,910
individual and collective capacity for “living together”,

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,170
are inevitably affected.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,360
That is why the Internet is such an important issue,

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,410
now and for the future.

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,710
Understanding the spatial dimension of the Internet,

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,726
is also a way of understanding the extent to which,

17
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:49,066
our relationship to space is undergoing a profound change.

18
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:52,183
Access to information has changed,

19
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:55,503
its distribution being more massive, individualized,

20
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:58,143
disintermediated and dematerialized.

21
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:00,593
Production conditions are changing

22
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,573
as new relationships,

23
00:01:02,573 --> 00:01:05,333
- more scattered but also more numerous -,

24
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,093
are being forged a little more each day.

25
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:12,043
The rules of the economy are also being altered,

26
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:14,691
as contact between supply and demand

27
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,911
has greatly changed.

28
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:18,479
Furthermore,

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,659
our means of evaluating our environment

30
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,209
are changing as intermediaries seemingly become

31
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:28,139
less and less essential.

32
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:31,771
This means that we must not only reevaluate

33
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:33,831
the nature of our social environment,

34
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:36,301
but also those who are in charge of it,

35
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:39,341
discussing expertise and, by extension,

36
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:41,201
the legitimacy of experts.

37
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:44,398
More fundamentally, individuals are recreating

38
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:46,558
their relationship with the world and with themselves,,

39
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:52,258
their identity, otherness and ability to act in a world that is increasingly vast.

41
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:58,956
Politics are also affected by such changes.

42
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:01,616
Changing space means changing coexistence,

43
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:04,706
our relationship to others and politics.

44
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,240
Politics is thus faced with a double burden :

45
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:10,753
On one hand, as political action,

46
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:13,553
it must respond to social change :

47
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:16,103
changes in ownership, privacy,

48
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:20,213
freedom of expression, education, sovereignty, etc.

49
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:23,143
On the other hand, as politics in action,

50
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,633
it must adapt its very framework

51
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,983
to people’s changing modes of expression,

52
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:32,763
commitment, collaboration and responsibility.

53
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:35,685
Understanding what is occurring,

54
00:02:35,685 --> 00:02:39,465
does indeed require perceiving the many modes of existence,

55
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:41,645
and most notably spatiality.

56
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:45,005
Thus it becomes obvious that changing space means changing

57
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:48,245
the arrangement of things, changing interpersonal relationships,

58
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:51,485
changing the World and changing society.

60
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:59,625
The relationships between the Internet, space and society

61
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:03,155
are so complex that it is essential to distinguish clearly

62
00:03:03,155 --> 00:03:06,775
between the societal causes that led to its emergence

63
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:10,105
and the consequences of its spread in society.

64
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:12,895
The causes are generally the result of the widespread desire

65
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:15,925
to optimize social interaction, whereas the consequences

66
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:20,593
are the result of the realization of this desire.

67
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:23,988
The car perfectly illustrates this distinction:

68
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:27,938
it meets an identifiable urge for individual mobility,

69
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:31,289
but the consequences of its use on society

70
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,219
is far more complex.

71
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:36,932
The cognitive dissonance resulting from the common confusion

72
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:38,762
between the causes and consequences,

73
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:42,842
results in expectations, an imaginary and a vocabulary,

74
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:44,872
marked by a strong dichotomy

75
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:46,892
between dystopias and utopias.

76
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:50,317
But such confusion is detrimental

77
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:52,747
to understanding the actual relationship

78
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:55,107
between the Internet and its social environment.

79
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:59,832
The Internet’s emergence brought about not only

80
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,892
the abolition of space and distance, but also

81
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:07,022
the supposed discrepancy between real space and virtual space,

82
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:10,272
and, even more, between real life and virtual life.

83
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:13,709
This discrepancy has raised numerous questions

84
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,639
relative to the Internet’s unique spatiality.

85
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,259
When we go on the Internet,

86
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,669
where are we really going?

87
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:23,269
What does an address or site mean in such a context?

88
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:26,559
Of what is the Internet the virtual version?

89
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,668
Understanding the Internet requires a better understanding of space.

91
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:37,797
Let us speculate that our inability to understand the Internet’s influence

92
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:41,007
on the World stems from an erroneous conception of space.

93
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,842
Space is generally understood as a material reality

94
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:47,152
and is often equated to territory,

95
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,460
in which other realities (individuals, homes, vehicles, resources, etc.) coexist:

96
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,780
individuals, homes, vehicles, resources, etc.

97
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,820
The problem with this perception of space, though widespread,

98
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,680
can be summed up in a relatively simple question:

99
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:04,863
if space is a thing, then where is it?

100
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:08,353
This question highlights the aporia of considering space

101
00:05:08,353 --> 00:05:10,303
as a material support for action

102
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:12,646
and underscores the common confusion

103
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,456
between what is situated and what situates.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,900
Yet, space is neither material,

105
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,670
nor a support.

106
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:23,627
Spaces may be situated,

107
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:26,357
but always in relation to other spaces.

108
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:30,874
That is why we must completely rethink space,

109
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:33,504
as discussed in the previous sessions.

110
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:38,668
Leibniz’s and Kant’s philosophies in the 17th and 18th centuries,

111
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:42,118
and physics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,

112
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:46,668
clearly showed that space is essentially an a priori requirement

113
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:50,928
for the understanding that allows us to situate things in a relative way.

114
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,984
It is not a specific thing,

115
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:55,964
but a specific ordering of things.

116
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:58,994
an arrangement of things relative to one another.

117
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:01,129
This conceptual shift,

118
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:04,439
which significantly changed philosophy and physics,

119
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,699
has not yet fully taken place.

121
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,861
While material realities are an essential part,

122
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:16,051
of our existence,

123
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:18,321
contemporary societies are nonetheless increasingly

124
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:21,941
organized around immaterial resources.

125
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:27,225
Information in particular has become a major resource,

126
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:30,894
whose processing, storage and circulation

127
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:33,754
are the focus of many industries.

128
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:36,684
Today we consecrate more than a quarter of our lives

129
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:40,644
to education, which is nothing other than the transmission of information

130
00:06:40,644 --> 00:06:42,884
that has been deemed useful for our development.

131
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:46,591
Our leisure activities are also affected by the dematerialization

132
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:49,641
of music, films and many games.

133
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,540
Money is also increasingly simple information

134
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,080
that no longer needs to be in material form to be exchanged.

135
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:03,557
That is why the consequences of spatial materialism

136
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,207
are relatively numerous.

137
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:09,089
Such a conception of space, for instance,

138
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:12,679
lends to an incomplete comprehension of the reality of the Internet.

139
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:15,999
The contradistinction between real life and virtual life is undoubtedly

140
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:19,579
one of the most caricatural consequences of this confusion.

141
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:23,106
But this aporia is particularly unfortunate

142
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:28,176
in that it de-realizes our increasingly numerous relationships and acts.

143
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:32,535
Finally, it seems that this confusion between real and virtual

144
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,675
conceals the other, more insidious one between reality and materiality.

145
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:40,085
More precisely, it is the immateriality of the relationships,

146
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,205
created via the Internet,

147
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:44,725
that is at the heart of a larger misunderstanding,

148
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,900
of which the materialist conception of space

149
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,900
is the most structural element.

150
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,260
It is not enough to recall that the Internet is made of cables

151
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,700
and data centers to describe its reality.

152
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,310
The reality of the Internet is far bigger.

153
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,140
It includes all the information

154
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,080
and practices that take place in this space.

155
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,110
And yet, these immaterial relationships are nevertheless

156
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,840
real interactions and, each day,

157
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:14,057
contribute in their own small way to the development

158
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:17,567
of contemporary individual and collective lives.

160
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:25,942
Nowadays, the challenge is understanding the tradeoffs

161
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:29,942
between the material and immaterial, network and territory,

162
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:33,252
and between the Internet and the spaces existed prior to it.

163
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,639
The Internet does not abolish space,

164
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,609
no more so than it eliminates distance.

165
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,304
Rather, it makes distance less relevant

166
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:44,404
in certain configurations and with regard to certain issues,

167
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:47,194
to respond to specific interactions.

168
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,254
For this reason, the Internet creates space,

169
00:08:50,254 --> 00:08:53,014
new relationships between an ever-growing number of realities

170
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:54,484
and new places that are very much real,

171
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:57,124
which become interfaces,

172
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:59,984
that are essential

173
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:02,734
to increasingly numerous practices.

175
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:09,004
Wikipedia, Facebook and YouTube, among others,

176
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:12,294
are spaces that respond to specific problems

177
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:14,994
with amazing efficiency.

178
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,249
They are not degraded forms of space

179
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:20,199
or virtual spaces,

180
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,269
but real, contemporary spaces.

181
00:09:23,993 --> 00:09:27,043
The immateriality of the interactions that characterize them

182
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:29,153
does not detract from their reality.

183
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:32,923
On the contrary, it increases their capacity

184
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:34,783
to fully respond to specific needs.

185
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,287
These spaces emerge in response to problems

186
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:41,287
that territorial spaces

187
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:44,217
cannot resolve as effectively.

188
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:48,883
It is unnecessary to emphasize the virtual nature of the relationships

189
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:52,953
on Facebook or to compare Wikipedia to Britannica.

190
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,783
Instead we should ask of what

191
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:58,243
Facebook and Wikipedia are the spaces,

192
00:09:58,393 --> 00:10:01,043
and take a more symmetrical approach

193
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:04,943
that would require the same thing of territorial spaces.

194
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:09,372
What territorial space could possibly allow for the constant,

195
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:12,192
instantaneous coproduction of an encyclopedia developed by individuals

196
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:16,322
who are scattered all over the world, and disseminate this knowledge for free?

197
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:20,252
What territorial space allows us to interact with people,

198
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:24,322
regardless of their whereabouts, at any moment?

199
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:28,127
What territorial space allows you to view or listen to

200
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:32,127
virtually any contemporary audiovisual resource ever made?

201
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,081
Wake-Up Questions

202
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:48,141
Could you list the top-ten languages used on the Internet in 2014?

203
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:53,071
R: English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese,

204
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:58,761
Japanese, Russian, German, French and Malay.
