1
00:00:03,551 --> 00:00:05,718
There are three ways
of managing distances:

2
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:08,428
copresence, mobility,
and telecommunication,

3
00:00:08,428 --> 00:00:11,089
[which] have roughly merged
at the same time

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:13,520
at the beginning of the Neolithic era.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,717
But each of them has recently experienced
a dramatic change,

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:22,590
namely the global urbanization,
mass tourism and the Internet.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,726
Digital worlds convey
a profound transformation of society

8
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,483
especially through
their relations to space.

9
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:33,458
Let's see how, thanks to Dr. Boris Beaude,

10
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,307
an acknowledged specialist
of the digital society

11
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:40,425
who is also a prominent geographer.

12
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:44,826
Good morning.

13
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:46,704
During this session,

14
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:49,874
we will discuss the spatial dimension of the Internet.

15
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:53,944
I suggest that we consider the Internet as a real space,

16
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:58,238
a space in which an increasing portion of our practices,

17
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:00,716
exchanges and lives take place.

18
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:04,186
While the Internet can be described

19
00:01:04,186 --> 00:01:08,491
based on its technical, economic and social features,

20
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:12,652
it is nonetheless an essentially spatial innovation.

21
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:15,878
The contemporary world is actually more easily understood

22
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:20,098
once we realize the extent to which the Internet is essentially spatial.

23
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:22,220
By accepting this premise,

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,570
the virtual reality we are faced with

25
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,226
are also easier to understand.

26
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:28,260
It becomes possible to take hold of it

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,889
and act more efficiently

28
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:34,597
in an admittedly uncertain, complex,

29
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:37,030
but extremely rich world.

30
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,767
The Internet does indeed present an interesting paradox

31
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:44,224
and thus is the cause of much confusion.

32
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:49,309
The Internet eliminates space and yet is itself a space.

33
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:53,408
The vocabulary is clear regarding the semantic proximity

34
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,028
d'Internet avec between the Internet and space.

35
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:57,931
We “go” online to sites,

36
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:59,808
where we browse and surf,

37
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,076
encountering firewalls

38
00:02:02,076 --> 00:02:03,883
and “virtual spaces.”

39
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:08,495
From its emergence, the Internet has fueled

40
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,392
the already fertile fantasy of ubiquity.

41
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,036
After the telegraph and telephone,

42
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:15,807
the Internet effectively responds to high expectations of contact

43
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:18,951
over the largest distances possible.

44
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:21,502
The rapid adoption of the Internet

45
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:24,161
in this way attests to the many issues

46
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:25,531
it carries with it.

47
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:29,379
It meets the fundamental need of individuals,

48
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,270
to create contact

49
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,105
where there is distance.

50
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:39,127
In just forty short years,

51
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:41,900
the Internet has become a global phenomenon.

52
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,659
No communication technology has ever met

53
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,895
such varied demands.

54
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:52,510
The Internet stands out for its ability to be at once local and global,

55
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,191
synchronous and asynchronous,

56
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:56,215
symmetric and asymmetric,

57
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:58,040
permanent and ephemeral,

58
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,007
in other words qualities that typically correspond

59
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,859
to specific means of communication.

60
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,832
The Internet, though young still,

61
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:12,878
indeed calls into question the organizational strategies

62
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,231
we have developed over the millennia.

63
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:20,112
Like writing, printing, the train, telegraph,

64
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:23,023
radio or television,

65
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:26,391
the Internet increases our ability to act together

66
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,626
over increasingly vast areas.

67
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,726
With each new mean of communication

68
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:33,872
it is society as a whole that is transformed

69
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:38,658
by the renewing of the modalities of social interaction.

70
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:43,793
Such changes have implications for the organization of space,

71
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:46,406
as well as for economic transactions,

72
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:50,852
politics and individual and collective identity.

73
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:55,534
Too often we forget how much our lives are dependent

74
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:58,109
on how we deal with space

75
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,608
and master the distance

76
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:02,166
that separates us from realities,

77
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,560
whose presence and qualities we desire.

78
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:11,148
That is why the virtuality of the Internet is not as we imagine it.

79
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:12,821
it does not preclude reality but rather the actuality.

80
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:16,002
It exists in our every act.

81
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,879
If the Internet warrants special attention,

82
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,846
it is probably because the virtuality it provides

83
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,518
is in part new,

84
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:25,999
and in large part remains to be discovered.

85
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:30,126
The Internet has indeed become the center of a contemporary world

86
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:34,347
whose nature and challenges are important to understand.

87
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:36,589
It is not only intermediary,

88
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:38,431
but a space where a considerable number of events

89
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:42,643
are taking place at every moment.

90
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:48,055
The Internet’s specific qualities have indeed destabilized

91
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,922
even the most established of global players.

92
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:52,426
Their control of territories,

93
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,000
and transport networks,

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,228
guaranteed a secure situation

95
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:58,833
that does not content itself with an emerging space

96
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,682
over which they have only approximate control.

97
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,509
In just a decade,

98
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,357
Google has effectively upset

99
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:07,552
many aspects of our activities.

100
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:11,168
In barely less time Wikipedia has undermined

101
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:13,405
important values of social order,

102
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:16,317
governance, and expertise most notably.

103
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:20,790
Facebook has become one of the main intermediaries between individuals,

104
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:27,321
while Wikileaks has impinged on firmly rooted governmental practices.

105
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,288
This means we must take the Internet’s ability

106
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:36,060
to create hitherto unknown centralities seriously,

107
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,394
allowing for an unprecedented concentration of power

108
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:42,708
in ways that are nonetheless uncertain.

109
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:47,538
The Internet reminds us, if necessary, that society is made of social ties,

110
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,052
and of contact and interaction in general.

111
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,776
Changing space, from this perspective,

112
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:54,194
is changing society.

113
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:57,680
The economy and law are among the dimensions of society

114
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,970
the most torn by this revival,

115
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,873
as the convergence of digital and communications technology

116
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:07,148
renews the meaning of property, value,

117
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:11,571
expression, responsibility and identity.

118
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:16,728
Free access, for instance, has become a model.

119
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:20,218
The marginal cost of copying, storing and distribution

120
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:21,408
of digital works

121
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:25,316
has deeply changed the value of what can be digitized,

122
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:29,731
at the risk of neglecting sometimes considerable production costs.

123
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:32,759
The audiovisual industry is a perfect example

124
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,720
of the changes of an entire sector.

125
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,182
The key players in this sector, like Sony,

126
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:41,489
were overwhelmed by the emergence of widespread practices

127
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:43,487
they did not anticipate

128
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:47,956
and of which they are incapable of containing the spread.

129
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:51,683
The Internet’s ability

130
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:55,361
to create reticular contact where there is territorial distance

131
00:06:55,361 --> 00:07:00,353
is also a great opportunity for organization, production

132
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,902
and coordination.

133
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:05,425
Collective intelligence, the wisdom of crowds and crowdsourcing,

134
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,538
are notions that are emerging from this potential.

135
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:13,138
While the majority of the population is not really involved

136
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:14,422
in this process,

137
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:16,681
it is nonetheless decisive.

138
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:20,446
Humanity is able

139
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:23,379
to share knowledge

140
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,233
accumulated over centuries,

141
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:29,995
which can then be discussed and renewed

142
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:32,746
in a more decentralized manner.

143
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,045
It is not really a question

144
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:36,567
of equal skills or the legitimacy of players,

145
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,797
but of their non-determination a priori.

146
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:41,709
It is a question of rethinking governance,

147
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,490
conforming it to the complexity

148
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,536
that arises from such a multitude of individual expressions and acts

149
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:51,512
whose work is certainly unequally productive

150
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,919
yet potentially useful.

151
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:59,990
The Internet’s ability to create a shared space

152
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,367
is also an opportunity for territories.

153
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:06,584
The city in particular has thus been greatly augmented.

154
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,557
An ideal place for interaction,

155
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,445
the city is even more attractive

156
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:12,285
now that it offers all the possibilities

157
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:15,609
of material and immaterial contact,

158
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:17,417
and optimizes more than ever

159
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:20,401
the potential for interaction between inhabitants

160
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:21,553
and itself,

161
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:23,072
but also the World at large.

162
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:24,978
Moreover,

163
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:27,836
the spread of geolocation technology

164
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:30,205
has accelerated the hybridization of space.

165
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:34,667
Geolocation combines territories and networks,

166
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,000
the material and immaterial,

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,961
analog and digital,

168
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:41,517
giving rise to new practices.

169
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:47,067
This complex hybridization of spaces with different qualities

170
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:50,343
also demands consideration of the body

171
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:52,116
(when senses are missing),

172
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:56,502
of disembodied identity (when the avatar and anonymity are required),

173
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,977
and co-spatiality

174
00:08:57,977 --> 00:08:59,789
(when we’re on the Internet,

175
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,345
but also in our bedrooms,

176
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:02,725
classrooms

177
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,375
or around the table with friends).

178
00:09:05,015 --> 00:09:07,307
It also questions our ability

179
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:08,711
to accompany this change,

180
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:11,530
both individually and collectively.

181
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,364
One may effectively ask

182
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:17,108
how we can reconcile the relatively long time scales

183
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,590
of cities’ materiality

184
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,468
with the relatively short ones of the Internet.

185
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:26,158
Even street furniture does not fit into such time scales

186
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:28,216
whereas the time of its adoption

187
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:31,798
more or less corresponds to that of its obsolescence.

188
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:40,678
All this requires fully considering the Internet as a shared space,

189
00:09:40,678 --> 00:09:42,912
which raises specific issues,

190
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:44,449
that are often unclear,

191
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:46,903
sometimes sudden and increasingly intense.

192
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,279
Undoubtedly, we were slow to adapt to writing,

193
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,671
books and television.

194
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:56,168
But the Internet is more even challenging,

195
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:59,030
given that it changes faster than our ability

196
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,387
to collectively understand its dynamics.

197
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:04,732
And yet, it is essential to organize it,

198
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:07,308
make it habitable and useful.

199
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:11,351
Dealing with this eminently political challenge is not obvious.

200
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,981
The Internet, inherited from cybernetics,

201
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,534
in its very fundaments supposes that,

202
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:19,984
what is good for information – i.e. unhindered movement –

203
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:21,595
is good for society,

204
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:24,139
a legacy that underscores the strengths and weaknesses,

205
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,277
of a space that is structurally decentralized.

206
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,642
For the first time in the history of humanity,

207
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:33,264
this dream has become a reality

208
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,560
and has found a place for its expression.

209
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,834
But the presumptions of such a conception of society

210
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:41,003
are both debatable and debated.

211
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:47,480
With the Internet, space has effectively changed so much

212
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,749
that society is now driven by a movement

213
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,700
whose dynamics are difficult to comprehend because they are unfamiliar.

214
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,224
Denying the reality and spatiality of the Internet

215
00:10:56,224 --> 00:11:00,354
exposes many actions that nevertheless actively contribute

216
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:05,578
to derealization and the risk of

217
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,794
no longer understanding it,

218
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:09,960
entangled with a materialism

219
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,844
that confuses reality and the materiality,

220
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:14,507
but also space and territory.
