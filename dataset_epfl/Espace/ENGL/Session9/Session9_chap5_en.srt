1
00:00:00,114 --> 00:00:02,747
From the very beginning of this course,

2
00:00:02,747 --> 00:00:05,947
we have seen how important
the ‘spatial me’ is,

3
00:00:05,947 --> 00:00:10,092
and, more generally, spatial agency,
or spatiality,

4
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:13,960
is as a power in contemporary societies.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,981
We have equally observed how space can be
a powerful and shaping environment

6
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:22,071
and how it can be seen as a public good.

7
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:25,802
Inhabiting can be identified

8
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:29,768
as a meeting point
between spatiality and space.

9
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:34,687
Let's explain. Even when
they seem immobile,

10
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:40,491
the constitutive elements of a society
function as a dynamic configuration,

11
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:44,509
at least in reproducing
what which already exists,

12
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:47,818
but more often as a process of change.

13
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:51,243
And space is not an exception.

14
00:00:51,963 --> 00:00:53,848
It is composed of actions--

15
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:56,252
those of the actors themselves,

16
00:00:56,752 --> 00:01:01,428
which actors have injected
into objects that become active,

17
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:06,969
and, finally, those which have ended up
by crafting environments,

18
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:10,435
that is to say establishing
frameworks for action,

19
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:14,041
which may be modifiable by new actions.

20
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,511
The relation between spatiality and space

21
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:23,332
opens up the possibility
for multiple actions and futures,

22
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:26,159
shaped by the history of relationships

23
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,480
between societies and their parts -

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,712
individuals, collectives,
organizations, institutions –,

25
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:38,749
the emergence of the individual actor
being a major historical bifurcation.

26
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:43,543
The distinction between
‘Gemeinschaft’ and ‘Gesellschaft’

27
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:47,050
has been largely documented
by social sciences,

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:52,849
since it was first outlined
by Ferdinand Tönnies in 1887.

29
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,403
Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Norbert Elias,
and many contemporary scholars,

30
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:03,432
converge in describing
the contemporary social world

31
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:07,341
in developed countries
as a society of individuals.

32
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,856
This implies that old
communal allegiances,

33
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:15,693
based on biological, religious,
economic or national principles,

34
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:19,395
are challenged by other forms
of social organization,

35
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:23,317
in which traditional structures
may not have vanished,

36
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:29,194
but enable a direct dialog between
individuals and society as a whole.

37
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:33,506
This is made possible
by new social apparatuses:

38
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:36,013
a powerful welfare state,

39
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:39,822
which provides to everyone
minimal ‘primary goods’,

40
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:43,866
a rule of the law state,
that transcends communal rules,

41
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:46,543
and forms of democratic governance,

42
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:50,938
which, at the least, prevent
the exclusion of ordinary citizens

43
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,883
from public deliberation.

44
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:57,887
A society of individuals is therefore
by no means less societal

45
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,270
than the former communal society.

46
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:06,255
On the contrary, it is characterized by
both more individuality and more society.

47
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:10,801
In any case, it is clear enough
that a society of individuals

48
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:14,434
gives a new consistency
to a specific relationship

49
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:17,051
between actors and spatial environments.

50
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:21,612
Finally, spatialities and spaces
generated by the humans

51
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:26,326
do not possess by themselves
any tragic characteristic.

52
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:31,598
Their destiny is not predetermined
and the Earth does not call out.

53
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,802
As a literary genre, space emerges
rather as a ‘drama’:

54
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:42,713
a tension which results from
the capacity of each individual

55
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:47,411
to affect the space of all the others,
as well as their own,

56
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:51,498
and this constitutes
a remarkably dramatic lever.

57
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:57,143
However, the play is written
at the same time as it is being acted out.

58
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:02,657
This is another confirmation
that spatialities as actors’ agency,

59
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:07,316
and space as societal environment,
are not dissociable.

60
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:15,199
In Session 2 we analyzed the limits
of Heidigger's conception of inhabiting,

61
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:20,229
a conception that privileges
rootedness, nearness, and fixity,

62
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,390
and proposed another approach
to inhabiting

63
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,004
that encompasses mobility,
otherness, and historicity.

64
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:31,258
Once reconciled with history,

65
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:34,927
the notion of inhabiting can become
both a fully spatial,

66
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:37,222
and fully social concept.

67
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:42,138
It offers a useful abstract
of an interactive, but balanced, relation,

68
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:45,773
that spatialities and spaces,
geographical actors

69
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:49,040
and geographical environments
can entertain.

70
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,794
But, the very interest of this concept

71
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,716
lies in the fragility
of its pragmatic implementation.

72
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:01,361
Building a single house
in a natural landscape

73
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:04,400
has the effect of modifying this landscape

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,155
in a significant manner.

75
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:11,404
Geographicity presents at once
an individual (spatiality)

76
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:15,009
and a societal (space) characters.

77
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:17,911
This creates a very sensitive tension,

78
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:20,527
and sometimes a very visible one.

79
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,988
Space is that environment which,

80
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:26,402
in a more explicit way than others,

81
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:31,195
inhabits us at the same time
as we inhabit it.

82
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:36,765
This is probably why the geographical
approach of social worlds

83
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:40,460
has a special power
to make visible simultaneously,

84
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,495
what, separately or together,
humans hold,

85
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:47,241
and of what holds humans together.

86
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:51,663
Said differently, how can I
make the world inhabitable

87
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:57,329
without making it uninhabitable
for others, and for me, among them?

88
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,319
That is the fundamental question

89
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,037
citizens ask
the social scientists of space.

90
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,949
Thus, space seems to be

91
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:10,871
a particularly vulnerable
environment par excellence.

92
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:16,688
Since modifications
made by a small number of actors

93
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:20,561
can have consequences
on all of the other actors,

94
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:25,780
it appears also
as a par-excellence expression

95
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,523
of the possible co-operative
dimension of social life.

96
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:33,236
Inhabiting is what happens

97
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:37,523
when environments enhance
the actors’ spatial freedoms

98
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:41,351
and when actors develop
the environment's capability

99
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:46,590
to make a living-together
possible and worthwhile.

100
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,804
This course is now ending.

101
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,012
Let's sum it up in one statement.

102
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:56,783
Spaces are made up by spatial agency

103
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,154
and spatial agency
is about spatial actors,

104
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,819
that is to say, everybody, each of us.

105
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,033
Hence, the last question
I would like to ask you:

106
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:10,232
what spatial actor would you like to be?
