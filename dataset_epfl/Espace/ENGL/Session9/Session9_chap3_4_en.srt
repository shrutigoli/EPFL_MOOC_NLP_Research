0
00:00:02,987 --> 00:00:07,633
At the urban scale, spatial agency is a major issue too.

1
00:00:07,878 --> 00:00:13,584
Action on the city has long been described by the term ‘urban planning’.

2
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:17,778
At the beginning, experts, mainly architects and engineers,

3
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:20,286
were commissioned by the public authority

4
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:26,231
to conceive, design and build material infrastructures and buildings

5
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:29,394
that would shape the future urban spaces

6
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:31,955
and condition their inhabitants’ lives.

7
00:00:32,922 --> 00:00:35,201
But this is changing now,

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,795
and the term ‘urbanism’, that was used to mean

9
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:42,648
‘urban way of life’ in 20th century English,

10
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:47,623
has turned to be a synonym of the reinvention of urban planning.

11
00:00:48,753 --> 00:00:51,875
The table shows the shifts that have taken place

12
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:56,300
from traditional urban planning to the emerging urbanism.

13
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:03,156
As we can see, the experts are becoming actors among other actors,

14
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:07,896
and the empowerment of ordinary citizens is fundamental.

15
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:11,792
Although their opinion is not properly taken seriously,

16
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:17,408
they have conquered powerful means to hinder or cancel projects:

17
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:21,881
Law suits, single-issue street or media activism,

18
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:27,331
direct democracy or even individual moving from a house to another.

19
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:32,244
Switching from urban design to urban becoming

20
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:35,202
is all the more important that simultaneously

21
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:39,500
the process of urbanization as we've seen in Session 5

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,807
has shifted from absolute to relative.

23
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,138
With the end of the absolute urbanization,

24
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:50,720
the issue at stake will less and less be the making of containers

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,042
for urbanized, fixed or mobile life,

26
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:59,073
but more and more the shaping of urban life itself.

27
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:01,664
In a society of urban individuals,

28
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,740
the inhabitants’ choices

29
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,477
become the major strategic parameter of urban dynamics.

30
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,939
These choices are subject to change

31
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:18,199
but much easily in a dense, and open participatory process

32
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,001
in which experts and politicians

33
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:24,959
turn out to be actors amongst other actors.

34
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:30,877
Much has been done in theoretical research,

35
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:34,512
namely by authors such as John Rawls, or Amartya Sen,

36
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:37,802
to explore the concept of justice as a crucial issue

37
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:39,956
in contemporary societies.

38
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:43,397
Now the attention of the adjective ‘spatial’ to a

39
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,718
supposed-to-be-non-spatial justice,

40
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:49,760
raises a number of epistemological and theoretical problems

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,113
that geographers are just beginning to tackle.

42
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:56,581
The risk here is to oversimplify the answer

43
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,943
to one or more of these questions.

44
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:03,111
Who defines what is just and how?

45
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:06,116
To what extent could space be something else

46
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:11,310
than a neutral container of unjust or just items?

47
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,498
Could geographers’ work

48
00:03:13,498 --> 00:03:18,196
bring a specific contribution to the public debate on justice?

49
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:40,734
The example of debates about gentrification

50
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,389
shows that this ‘programme’ for spatial justice

51
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:45,284
is highly controversial.

52
00:03:45,673 --> 00:03:48,150
In the Anglophone geographical literature,

53
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,914
scholars such as David Ley, Chris Hamnett or Richard Florida,

54
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:57,224
can be opposed to David Harvey, Neil Smith or Edward Soja.

55
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,269
The key issue is, first of all, vocabulary.

56
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,641
Gentrification is commonly used

57
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:07,635
as a virtual synonym of the French ‘embourgeoisement’.

58
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:10,062
Should we name the middle class individuals

59
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:15,613
that move to poorer neighborhoods, ‘gentrifiers’ or, instead, ‘ghetto-killers’,

60
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:18,046
or ‘mix-makers’?

61
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:23,493
Although it has rapidly been used in a derogatory way,

62
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:27,636
the term ‘bobo’ coined by David Brooks in 2000

63
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:30,103
is more relevant than ‘gentrifier’

64
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,237
precisely because ‘bourgeois-boheme’ people

65
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:38,127
have the choice to dwell in different kinds of real-estate-price locations,

66
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:42,770
and it's easy to prove that if this group did not exist,

67
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,580
a geography solely made of land-value-generated, homogenous districts

68
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,658
would spontaneously emerge.

69
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:56,665
This is exactly what happened between the 1950s and 1980s

70
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:58,850
in most North American cities

71
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,857
when the ‘urban flight’ involved the huge majority of the middle class.

72
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:07,286
We can see the difference with Europe during this period.

73
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:09,191
In Western European cities,

74
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:15,124
people with high cultural capital remained in the cities historical centres

75
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:18,500
even when their incomes were low.

76
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,708
They arbitrated in favor of smaller or less comfortable flats,

77
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,666
while the social atmosphere was favorable

78
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:32,135
to various kinds of de-densifying urbanization processes.

79
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,979
The word ‘gentrification’ embeds the idea

80
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,915
that deprived persons or already segregated groups

81
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:43,611
should be left in a homogeneous environment

82
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,915
and that this would be a better situation than social mix,

83
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:50,739
which is praised in general but denied in practice

84
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:54,799
as either impossible or dangerous by many authors.

85
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:59,632
In short, it is not because gentrification is a danger for social mix

86
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:02,569
that it should be condemned, they say,

87
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,423
but right on the contrary

88
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:08,347
because it enlarges districts’ sociological spectrum,

89
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,057
and weakens ghettos.

90
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,108
If we connect the history of debates on urban topics

91
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,576
to the history of urban realities,

92
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:22,888
we are inevitably struck by their growing diverging course.

93
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:27,482
On the one hand, after decades of urban flight and its consequences,

94
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:29,887
pervasive violence in the streets,

95
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,034
the emergence of urban renaissance does not appear as a pretentious model

96
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:39,322
but as an effective bifurcation.

97
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:41,849
It suddenly makes sense

98
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,133
that David Ley explicitly used

99
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:48,423
the ‘Vancouver Experience’ of urban regeneration

100
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:50,339
as a primary study case

101
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:55,069
to develop his critical statements on gentrification.

102
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,936
In this city,

103
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:04,206
the urban re-encounter with urbanity began in the late 1970s

104
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:07,738
and the Expo 86 represents a first milestone

105
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:11,402
in the process of urban regeneration.

106
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,536
All the intellectual construction of contemporary urbanism,

107
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:19,922
I mean urban agency here in the European meaning,

108
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:24,389
is underpinned by the idea that through public space

109
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:30,088
sociological and functional diversity is at stake as an issue and a goal

110
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:34,025
in every single action, at any scale of the city.

111
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:39,239
On the other hand, the neo-structuralist approach rejects

112
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,490
the very idea of social mix

113
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:46,281
as the revenge of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat,

114
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:51,750
and understands the right to public space as a synonym of a right to the ghetto.

115
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,720
Between both sides, discussion is not easy.

116
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:03,844
These oppositions are part of a larger paradigm divergence

117
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:06,050
and are not a problem in itself.

118
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:09,697
Pluralism in debates should be the correct response

119
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,754
to plurality of ideas.

120
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:15,605
Trouble begins when the hegemony of one approach

121
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:18,804
practically discards all others.

122
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:22,774
There is clearly a problem here in Anglophone literature.

123
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:27,789
One single point of view appears overwhelming and omnipresent

124
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:32,172
while the others are censored, or self-censored.
