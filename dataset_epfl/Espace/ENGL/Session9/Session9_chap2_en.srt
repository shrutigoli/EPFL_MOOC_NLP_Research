1
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:09,318
This is precisely the case for Europe,

2
00:00:09,318 --> 00:00:11,327
a continent that has been,
for a long time,

3
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:17,777
devastated by the wargame
of its numerous and brutal nation-states.

4
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:24,868
A five-century geopolitical system
has operated between an Eastern area

5
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:28,331
threatened by
Central Asian nomad empires,

6
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:32,566
and the Atlantic Rim,
soon protected from invasions

7
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:35,263
able to construct endured states

8
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:39,803
and to project itself
into overseas empires.

9
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:41,485
Europe was, simultaneously,

10
00:00:41,485 --> 00:00:45,311
the place that brutalized
the rest of the World,

11
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:50,325
and a place from where
universalist inventions emerged,

12
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:54,944
like the rule of law, civil liberties,
democracy, social security,

13
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:59,741
contemporary individuality,
and public space.

14
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:04,876
During centuries, states have tried
to reinforce themselves

15
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:10,010
at the expense of civil society,
by conquering or annexing territories,

16
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,278
creating monopolies, levying taxes,

17
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:20,178
imposing constraints on commerce,
mobility, and urbanization,

18
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:21,576
but, on the other side,

19
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:25,254
the cities, merchant guilds,
local societies,

20
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:29,904
have tried to develop
alternative scales and metrics.

21
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:32,890
The Hanseatic League
is a good example

22
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,764
of this type of network
during the late medieval era.

23
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:43,116
The long dispute
between territories and networks

24
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:48,811
progressively turned to the advantage
of the states and territories.

25
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:54,412
As soon as 1648,
the reinforcement of the states’ power

26
00:01:54,412 --> 00:02:01,019
had led to the Treaty of Westphalia,
to which the states self-identified

27
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,801
as the exclusive players
of European history.

28
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,763
This was not only
a matter of political regime.

29
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:12,134
After absolute monarchy,
the modern states continued the search

30
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:16,571
for a centralized,
unrivaled architecture of power

31
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:23,510
that could help them channel resources
towards their geopolitical projects.

32
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,826
After the first massive mobilizations
during the French Revolution,

33
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:34,024
the number of potential drafted soldiers
became a key criterion

34
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:39,069
for the handling
of ever more bloody conflicts.

35
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:43,377
The states then decided
to exchange democracy and welfare,

36
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:47,942
again, the possibility of sending
millions of young citizens

37
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:50,850
to dreadful battlefields.

38
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,374
World War II appeared, then,
as a paroxysm of a process

39
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,972
that had begun much earlier.

40
00:02:57,972 --> 00:03:01,517
Killing not only soldiers
from the other party,

41
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:03,570
but its own population,

42
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,003
was the final stage
of the European nation states’ supremacy

43
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:11,515
in the age of totalitarianism,

44
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:16,885
with their Communist-Stalinist
and Fascist-Nazi branches.

45
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:20,981
The 1918-1945 period
has been called,

46
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:26,750
not without justification,
the ‘suicide of Europe’.

47
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:33,421
Since the Renaissance,
many thinkers and statesmen

48
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,055
had proposed a European Union,

49
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:39,115
but few paid attention to their voice.

50
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:42,401
The European Construction
really only began

51
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,607
when, after 1945,
almost all the continent

52
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:51,849
was controlled by non-European,
Soviet and American troops.

53
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,373
This was the beginning of what is called
the ‘European Construction’.

54
00:03:56,373 --> 00:04:02,269
The Treaty of Rome, signed in 1957,
was the founding act of birth

55
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,053
of what is currently the European Union,

56
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:11,245
its 28-member countries,
and its 500 million inhabitants.

57
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:17,298
The main idea was, and still is,
to propose a voluntary unification

58
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,731
that deliberately puts aside
the use of force,

59
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:25,021
and announces some principles
for the incremental setting up

60
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:30,244
of a peaceful post-geopolitical
transnational political power.

61
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:37,029
The European Construction
has long been a process

62
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:39,451
that was ignored by the public opinion

63
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:43,089
because it seemed
both opaque and of little importance

64
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:46,133
for the average European state of life.

65
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:50,483
The era of powerful,
but neglected technocracy,

66
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:54,322
probably began to decline
as early as 1992,

67
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:56,826
when the Treaty of Maastricht
paved the way

68
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:59,594
for a single continental currency.

69
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:01,928
The euro, and other aspects
of the instauration

70
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:04,784
of a European supranational power,

71
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:10,468
met a strong resistance
in the less urbanized areas.

72
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:14,593
This period clearly ended in 2005,

73
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:17,975
when the referendums
on the constitutional treaty

74
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:22,404
gave a negative result
in France and the Netherlands.

75
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:27,761
After the 2008 crisis,
many European citizens

76
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,212
welcomed the idea
of a strong commitment

77
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:34,579
from the European institutions
to save the financial system,

78
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:38,588
but blamed the sacrifices
that were demanded

79
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,548
from the workers, taxpayers,
and consumers.

80
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:48,370
In Greece, since 2010,
a significant part of the public opinion

81
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,154
sees its country
as an undesired protectorate

82
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:55,496
of the European Union.

83
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:11,416
As a matter of fact, every day,
European citizens can observe

84
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:15,772
the loss of momentum
of economic growth on the continent,

85
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:20,453
in spite of the incremental,
but substantial, elements of construction

86
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:22,980
of continental institutions.

87
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,097
The maps show that,
after the first stage of the 2008 crisis,

88
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:33,494
Europe was the last part
of the World to recover.

89
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:37,752
Europe is still one of the major,
if not the biggest,

90
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:43,937
node in the global economic network,
but it's relative decline is obvious.

91
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,457
This point wouldn't be so negative

92
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:50,162
if it only meant
that other regions of the World

93
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:54,459
were doing better
than they used to do before.

94
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:58,872
In fact, Europe's problem
has to do with the image of future,

95
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:02,080
its horizon of expectations.

96
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,656
The conservation of
a supposedly threatened heritage,

97
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:09,551
and the fear
that the European social model

98
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:14,050
would be under the assaults
of an unleashed globalization,

99
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,316
largely occupy European citizens’ minds.

100
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:24,197
Will the Europeans be able to invent
a renewed concept of future,

101
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:27,038
a new narrative for a shared progress?

102
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,358
This question remains unanswered so far.

103
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:33,278
The Europeans
will certainly be those required

104
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:36,891
to propose and discuss
fresh ideas on this issue.

105
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:40,895
If they gave up,
the risk of a defensive closing

106
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,409
must not be excluded,

107
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:45,346
as we can observe
the growing electoral success

108
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:47,737
of far-right, anti-EU,

109
00:07:47,737 --> 00:07:52,957
anti-globalization,
and xenophobic parties.

110
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,310
European citizens
will also have to decide

111
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,038
where the border of their society
must be located.

112
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:09,018
Until now, the process of enlargement
has been based on voluntary adhesion

113
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:14,432
under the control of some key economic
and political parameters

114
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:17,708
imposed by the pre-existing members.

115
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,331
Within this process,

116
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:25,273
and although present-day Europe
is a ‘variable-geography’ space,

117
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:30,451
the European Union could include
about 50 states in the next decades,

118
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:32,592
with the entire Balkan region,

119
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:37,738
Turkey, Ukraine,
and why not trans-Caucasian states?

120
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:41,732
The following map
shows the current situation

121
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:44,647
of core and peripheries in Europe,

122
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:50,486
which suggests that inclusion
and integration should continue.

123
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:53,670
However,
there is a strong tendency to stop

124
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,092
or, at least, break,
the enlargement course

125
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,829
by using the argument
that the member states

126
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:05,484
have too many internal difficulties
to be able to welcome new beneficiaries

127
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:10,071
of a generous welfare state
as it exists in Europe.

128
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:15,466
This issue raises
a stimulating geographical problem.

129
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:18,379
When geopolitics is not the rationale

130
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:23,039
of intersociety relationships any more,

131
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,806
which spatial logics will prevail

132
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:29,670
in the construction
of a new kind of political construction,

133
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,030
such as the EU?

134
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,766
Another correlative question
concerns the interscale relation

135
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:40,256
between the EU and the World.

136
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:44,543
If globalization continues,
including its political dimension,

137
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:49,670
and tends to create a fully-fledged
society at level One,

138
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,738
what would be the specific role
of a continental,

139
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:56,168
that is, level Two, entity?

140
00:09:56,168 --> 00:10:01,072
Here, again, the citizens,
inhabitants will have to decide.

141
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:05,586
An interesting study case
is given by Ukraine.

142
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:09,968
As Turkey,
the Western part of the former USSR,

143
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:12,304
has been a twilight zone.

144
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,800
Will it join Europe?

145
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,642
Would it stay back inside new Eurasian
or near Eastern influence areas,

146
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:25,777
or would it remain
in its historical hesitation stance?

147
00:10:25,777 --> 00:10:27,795
Since its independence,

148
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,903
Ukraine has not only been crossed

149
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:33,437
by linguistic, cultural,
and political boundaries,

150
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:37,027
it has been, as a whole,
a border country,

151
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:40,992
a buffer zone
between Russia and Europe.

152
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,812
Since the victory
of the pro-European side

153
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,954
at the end of 2013,

154
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:49,821
after months of turmoil and violence,

155
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:51,795
a new phase has begun.

156
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:53,906
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin,

157
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:57,288
has decided to support separatists
in Crimea,

158
00:10:57,288 --> 00:11:02,951
and annexed this formerly Russian region
to Russia again.

159
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:06,848
Armed separatists
and Russia-supported uprisings,

160
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:10,715
burst out in the southeastern part
of the country.

161
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:14,838
The Russian government
activated the weapon of gas prices

162
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:19,313
to impose a change
on Ukrainian leadership.

163
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,276
Doing this, however,

164
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:24,286
Putin, probably,
has lost a long-term capability

165
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:27,904
of influencing
the Western fringe of Russia.

166
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:31,020
The question whether the border
between Ukraine and Russia

167
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,768
puts Crimea and Donbas
in either of these countries,

168
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:36,591
is not so crucial.

169
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:39,905
The pivotal point is that a borderland

170
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:43,695
has been turned into a borderline.

171
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:45,616
After the Baltic countries,

172
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:49,126
Russian geopoliticians
have had to admit

173
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,787
that the traditional objective
of the Russian Empire,

174
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:56,298
that is, to play its moves in Europe,

175
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,807
which was made explicit
by Peter the Great,

176
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:02,985
at the beginning of the 18th Century,
is fading away.

177
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:05,723
The myth of the dual nature of Russia,

178
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:09,793
and of a continental borderline,
the Urals,

179
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:13,425
located in the very middle
of the Russian society,

180
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:17,652
probably ceased to exist in April 2014,

181
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:20,982
when Putin suggested to the Duma

182
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:24,571
to ratify the annexation of Crimea.

183
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,180
West of Russia,

184
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,871
Belarus remains
the only trophy territory

185
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:34,051
Putin could show
as evidence of a reconquest,

186
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:35,953
and this has been possible

187
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:39,915
only because of the fierce
dictatorial grip

188
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:42,769
his friend, Alexander Lukashenko,

189
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,169
has been imposing on the small country
for two decades.

190
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:53,009
