1
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:05,930
From Session One we have proposed 
to you a rapid journey

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,572
across theories and languages
of space, and spatiality.

3
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:13,460
Two major issues:
the World and the individual.

4
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:17,178
Two essential processes:
urbanity and telecommunication

5
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:20,304
and two major topics: nature and time.

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,923
At the end of this itinerary, 
the question we'd like to pose is:

7
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:28,473
How do spaces as environments 
and spatialities,

8
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:31,809
as sets of actions, interact and combine?

9
00:00:32,547 --> 00:00:35,983
More specifically, how can human agency

10
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:38,983
modify spaces that prefigure agency,

11
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:42,088
but however, are clearly exposed to it?

12
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:46,900
The examples of war, Europe, 
and urbanism will help us

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,845
to comprehend two critical notions: 
spatial justice and inhabiting.

14
00:00:56,716 --> 00:01:00,076
In this session,
we will go back to the questions

15
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:02,466
addressed during 
the previous eight sessions.

16
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:05,994
We will explore the same realities 
and tackle the same issues,

17
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:09,102
but with a particular angle,
that of agency.

18
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:13,339
The starting point is that geographicity
is submitted to actors’ moves.

19
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:19,652
These actors being individual, collective 
or organizational components of a society,

20
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,177
or the society as a whole.

21
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:27,001
We will begin with a global scale 
and continue to downscale,

22
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:32,556
by next, focusing on a continent, Europe, 
and finally the city.

23
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:35,106
As a conclusion of this course,

24
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:40,673
we will introduce two transversal issues:
spatial justice and inhabiting.

25
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:48,839
One of the major reasons why human agency
has become more possible,

26
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:55,105
is that the huge constraints that weighed
on individual and collective leeway,

27
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:58,032
have been progressively eased.

28
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:03,387
Spatial freedoms 
have correlatively increased.

29
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:09,185
The issue of war and peace is a good case 
for us to analyze this change.

30
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:13,865
Let's take an example

31
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:16,979
to make this hypothesis
slightly more intelligible.

32
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:19,825
What can we say about wars?

33
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:24,921
On this controversial topic, 
several theories can be considered.

34
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:30,072
Some simply contend 
that war is not a historical object

35
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:33,099
and consider war is in man,

36
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:37,665
as an expression of 
man's natural propensity to violence.

37
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:44,221
For others, geopolitical logics
have always existed and will do forever.

38
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:48,451
However, we know today

39
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:54,427
that pre-paleolithic wars 
were short-friction, violent episodes,

40
00:02:54,913 --> 00:03:00,153
whose nature changed when the control 
of surpluses became a major issue.

41
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:06,013
About 5,000 years ago, 
within the neolithic era,

42
00:03:06,031 --> 00:03:09,233
the birth of the geopolitical state,

43
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:12,843
endowed with a permanent army 
and fortified places,

44
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:16,873
is a logical defensive, 
as well as an offensive response

45
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:20,173
to the fragility 
of the emerging productive systems.

46
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:27,250
What is called geopolitical wars, 
interstate wars or classical wars,

47
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:34,170
begins then and continues for centuries, 
until the paroxysm of WWII.

48
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:38,276
Now, some converging observations show

49
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:41,305
the decline of classical 
geopolitical wars,

50
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:44,928
namely because
the most developed countries

51
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:48,276
do not make war to each other anymore.

52
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:53,140
Most current wars 
are intrastate, that is to say

53
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,346
they are conflicts that occur
inside a particular state,

54
00:03:56,346 --> 00:04:01,786
such as civil wars, 
like Syria, since 2011.

55
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:07,970
Secession wars like South Sudan,
between 1983 to 2005,

56
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,068
or inter-communal wars
(many conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa).

57
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:18,157
This is what the surveys 
of the ‘Human Security Report’ show.

58
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:21,314
Regarding state based wars,

59
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:24,705
there are fewer wars and less casualties
on the battle fields.

60
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:29,401
Moreover, wars are increasingly 
intrastate conflicts,

61
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:34,258
which make them go beyond 
classical geopolitical wars.

62
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,510
Today, the most developed countries

63
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,040
don't always have 
friendly relationships with each other,

64
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,376
but they endeavour 
not to make war to each other,

65
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:49,442
because they have painfully learned 
that the cost of wars

66
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:51,436
and management of empires,

67
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:54,634
which can be imaginable 
in economies of stock,

68
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:57,798
has lost its sense 
in economies of flows.

69
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:03,449
Conquering territories by force,
generates the risk of elimination

70
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,161
from the international scene,
with few advantages.

71
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:13,907
It is this unhappy end 
that Europe experienced in 1945,

72
00:05:13,907 --> 00:05:16,289
after centuries of bloody wars.

73
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:20,808
Even when pursuing the traditional goal 
of gaining more influence,

74
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:25,916
a state is more efficient 
in ‘soft’, than ‘hard’ power,

75
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,931
as Joseph Nye wrote.

76
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:35,144
Geopolitics is setting back 
as this fear of politics is enlarging.

77
00:05:36,396 --> 00:05:38,258
Hybrid situations appear.

78
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,081
This table shows

79
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:42,725
the possible intersections 
between two rationales;

80
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:48,260
that of intersociety relationships; 
realism versus idealism,

81
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:52,265
and that of intrasocietal
political stances

82
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:55,195
(conservatism versus progressivism).

83
00:05:56,465 --> 00:06:01,280
The upper left and the bottom right boxes
are easy to put into perspective.

84
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:05,684
We can understand 
that a certain kind of conservatism

85
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:10,174
refuses the trend 
toward the universalizing of values

86
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:16,377
and, as a result, believes that we'll live 
more comfortably in a segmented World.

87
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:20,624
Contrarily, it is consistent 
with the idea

88
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:25,317
of self perfectibility of society 
that, sooner or later,

89
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:30,706
the World will become a new,
fully-fledged tier of citizenship

90
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:35,553
with a democratic government 
and a rule-of-the-law justice.

91
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:41,618
Immanuel Kant versus Carl Schmitt: 
this is a fair, bright fight.

92
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:48,185
More mysterious, and yet, present 
on the scene, are the two other boxes.

93
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,073
We recently had the opportunity 
to observe the historical experiment

94
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:58,218
of idealistic conservatism 
epitomized by the neoconservatives

95
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,707
under the George W. Bush administration.

96
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:05,722
In Europe, a significant part 
of the parties

97
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:07,861
belonging to the traditional left,

98
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,219
support the ideology 
of realistic progressivism,

99
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:15,001
characterized by a rejection 
of any intervention

100
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,545
based on human rights, aiming at a state.

101
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:25,110
In the American case, 
the post 9/11 defensive nationalism,

102
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,425
is a resource 
for aggressive interventions

103
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:30,320
all over the World.

104
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:32,282
In the European case,

105
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:35,184
the tetanized clutching 
to the welfare state,

106
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:39,432
protecting against any change, 
hampers the emergence

107
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:43,188
of a post-national vision 
of World affairs.

108
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:47,113
Anti-Americanism, 
although it is wrapped up

109
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:50,580
in an anti-imperialistic ethical speech,

110
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,816
often resembles a nostalgic revival 
of inter-imperial rivalries,

111
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:58,832
especially in France.

112
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,641
In both situations, 
the state functions like a screen,

113
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:08,943
which hinders the capacity 
of addressing the issues at stake

114
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:10,587
at a global scale.

115
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:14,241
For example,
unilateralism and multilateralism

116
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:19,030
take place under the same 
geopolitical and antipolitical paradigm.

117
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:23,121
In a political society 
there is pluralism in opinion,

118
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:27,096
but only one scene, one parliament, 
or one government.

119
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:32,087
Moreover, in a federal political society,
a government accepts

120
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:37,209
the existence of other governments,
on upper or lower tiers.

121
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:42,953
This table can help us understand 
that the invention of politics

122
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:45,504
is a major, non-trivial issue

123
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:48,957
that global civil society 
has on its control panel,

124
00:08:48,957 --> 00:08:52,882
with states being 
alternatively friends and foes

125
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:54,865
of this perspective.

126
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:59,513
A war-less World, is a World 
where social construction

127
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:04,089
loses its tragic character 
and becomes pragmatic,

128
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,197
that is, a complex resultant 
of actors' intentionalities.
