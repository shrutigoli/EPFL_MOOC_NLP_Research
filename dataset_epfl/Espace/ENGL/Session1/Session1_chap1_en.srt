EXPLORING HUMAN'S SPACE
AN INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHICITY

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,600
In the first session 
we will address space

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,719
we will address space

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,283
first from reality that are 
easy to identify ourselves

5
00:00:09,283 --> 00:00:14,148
then we will ask why space 
plays a role in social life.

6
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:18,003
Finally, we will do some social theory
of space

7
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:21,073
through the definition 
of key concepts.

8
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:25,469
SESSION ONE: SPACE AS PRACTICE, 
PROBLEM, AND THEORY

9
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:29,922
Look around. In an 
underground train carriage

10
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:35,032
passengers play themselves as far 
as possible from each other

11
00:00:35,442 --> 00:00:39,810
In a city, we find a concentration 
of people and big objects.

12
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:45,157
These pictures show the 
various ways we use to welcome

13
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:50,027
or conversely reject density 
in our daily life.

14
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:53,901
How can we account for 
this variety of situations?

15
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,950
1.SPACE IS US

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,197
We are spacial realities.

17
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:04,261
Our censorial apparatus
makes up various spaces.

18
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:08,431
Our body's a complex system
that forces and helps us

19
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,725
in creating fixed and moving spaces.

20
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:14,914
For instance, in a given context
the range of our sight

21
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:18,234
is not the same as the range 
of our hearing.

22
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,874
You can hear something you can't see
and vice versa.

23
00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:27,714
In other words, the kind of space 
produced by our visual devices

24
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:32,284
is not the same as the one 
produced by our auditory system.

25
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,380
Sounds and images constitute the base
of two different constructions,

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,904
that combine with each other and 
with other senses

27
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:46,884
and form the representations we have 
of our environment.

28
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:51,661
Now, if we add the senses that our
body in motion uses,

29
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:57,381
we discover different relations to 
the outer world the body makes possible.

30
00:01:57,414 --> 00:02:02,164
And it's no big deal to understand 
there is a strong tie between

31
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:07,955
our biological equipment and our 
representations of space.

32
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:13,396
Without such a biological couplet, 
would the concept of space as it exists

33
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:17,757
in almost all languages have 
been invented?

34
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:20,598
Probably not, and this is what

35
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,258
18th century philosopher Emanuel Kant

36
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:26,700
expresses when he says that 
space and time are

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:34,508
the a priori forms of sensible intuition, 
that is perception.

38
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:41,028
Thanks to these different senses, 
we can generally, in our practical life

39
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:45,348
give a meaning to both notions of contact 
and remoteness

40
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:49,877
which are the basic figures of human 
spacial realities.

41
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:54,573
As a matter of fact, 
the simplest descriptions

42
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,981
CONTACT/REMOTENESS

43
00:02:56,981 --> 00:03:00,541
of distance relations are actually
contact, that is to say - non-distance

44
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:04,454
and remoteness when distance
is effective.

45
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:09,184
Our bodies have three major 
spacial characteristics.

46
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,681
First of all, as we just have seen
there are multi-sensorial senses

47
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:18,625
that is to say, multi-dimensional 
detectors of the outer space..

48
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:22,916
Secondly, they are active, 
that is to say, mobile.

49
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:27,585
In contrast with some objects
and environments they interact with.

50
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:31,682
And finally, they are vulnerable. 
They can be destroyed,

51
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:36,125
either by natural causes,
or social operators

52
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:41,125
at the risk of the annihilation 
of the inhabitant the human being.

53
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:47,621
In short, you, me, we all our 
spacial operators.

54
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:51,153
We are constantly changed 
by space

55
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:54,864
and we constantly change it
through our acts.

56
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:58,504
We experience, as well as 
we create contact,

57
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,050
remoteness, and in between
different kinds of nearness.

58
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,954
WAKE UP! QUESTION

59
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:14,704
HOW DO YOU SELECT YOUR SEAT
IN A RESTAURANT?

60
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:18,356
-I ACCEPT THE WAITER'S SUGGESTIONS.

61
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:20,712
-I SIT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
FROM NOISE SOURCES.

62
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:23,051
-I TRY TO GET THE BEST OUTLOOK
ON THE WHOLE RESTAURANT HALL.

63
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:25,621
-I AVOID LOCATIONS WHERE I WOULD 
TURN MY BACK TO POTENTIAL DANGERS.

64
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:26,471
-OTHER.
