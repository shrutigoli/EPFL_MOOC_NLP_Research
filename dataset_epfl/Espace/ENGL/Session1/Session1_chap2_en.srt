1
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,407
Distance, non-distance,

2
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,947
this position is one of the foundations

3
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:13,455
of human spatial dimension, but why?

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:15,355
Why distance?

5
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:18,878
Let's try to answer this question.

6
00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:22,120
We can notice that contact is required

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,040
to produce a reproducible society.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,238
The bringing up of children,

9
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:30,068
cooperation at work,

10
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:33,102
social cohesion, or cultural diffusion,

11
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:35,142
all suppose interactions,

12
00:00:35,142 --> 00:00:36,681
and, more specifically,

13
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,799
interactions between human beings.

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,597
These interactions imply contact,

15
00:00:42,597 --> 00:00:47,889
that's to say, a non-distance situation
between individuals.

16
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:51,456
By the way,
traditional sexual reproduction

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,955
supposes negative distance
between bodies.

18
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:59,536
However,
human history is also full of situations

19
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:02,678
where people have been forced
to be separated,

20
00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:06,465
or were separated
for natural or social reasons

21
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:09,035
that were out of their control.

22
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,962
In the 19th and early 20th century cities,
for instance,

23
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:15,934
industrial pollution had a repulsive power

24
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:18,042
on geographies of housing for those,

25
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:23,062
of course, who couldn't afford a more
expensive location.

26
00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:26,009
More generally, we can observe
strong tendencies

27
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,524
that make the rich of the dominant groups

28
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:31,912
keep their distance from the poor
or dominated groups,

29
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:33,504
or confine them in ghettos,

30
00:01:33,504 --> 00:01:35,864
like the Jews in medieval Europe,

31
00:01:35,864 --> 00:01:38,275
or the Palestinians in Jerusalem,

32
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:41,695
and the rest of the West Bank today.

33
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:43,917
In the case of the apartheid
in South Africa,

34
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,758
which was officially established in 1948,

35
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:49,962
but, actually, present a long time before,

36
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:52,412
and abolished in 1991,

37
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,891
this unequal separation
was strongly formalized in the law system,

38
00:01:56,891 --> 00:02:00,952
embedded in public policies,
such as spatial planning,

39
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:03,004
and overwhelmingly present

40
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:07,119
in every single act
of people's daily lives.

41
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:13,353
Either or not, a distance
between two or more given realities

42
00:02:13,353 --> 00:02:16,314
things, people, ideas,

43
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:17,965
that is the fundamental question

44
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:21,905
that arises in any geographical situation.

45
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:28,036
Space is a social reality
defined by the relation of distance

46
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:31,006
that links it to and/or separates it

47
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:34,906
from other social realities.

48
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:41,034
Let's complete an elementary vocabulary

49
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:44,957
useful for the understanding
of the concept of distance.

50
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:48,320
Ubiquity, landlocking, fixed, mobile,

51
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,460
copresence, mobility, telecommunication.

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,979
Ubiquity defines the situation
where an operator

53
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:59,451
has an immediate access to,

54
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:02,713
and a possible simultaneous presence in,

55
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:06,246
all locations of a determined space.

56
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,294
Landlocking defines a situation
where an operator can have an access to,

57
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:18,967
and a possible presence in,
only one location of this space.

58
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,579
A fixed reality, such as, for instance,
a city or a state,

59
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,324
is a social reality
that would be affected in its nature

60
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,373
if it were moved away,

61
00:03:30,373 --> 00:03:34,599
while a mobile reality,
like a banknote or a smartphone,

62
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,381
can be easily moved without there being

63
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:41,264
any negative consequences
on its existence.

64
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:43,190
In the case of human beings,

65
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,039
movement is a competence
and an experience

66
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,109
that empowers their autonomy
at any scale.

67
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:56,319
As a result,
let's immediately notice this.

68
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,034
It's an error to assign the smallest scale
to the individual

69
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:02,986
just because the human body is tiny

70
00:04:02,986 --> 00:04:06,635
in comparison
with a city or a state territory.

71
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:08,645
The relevance case of the humans

72
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:12,259
are not reducible
to the size of their bodies,

73
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,943
but they are multiple,

74
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:18,224
as are multiple
the ways we can reach the outer world

75
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:23,560
by the mobility of our bodies
and through immaterial vectors too.

76
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,602
More details will be given on this point
in the next sessions.

77
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:33,224
Now, how do we manage distances?

78
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:38,247
Since the Neolithic Revolution,
12,000 years ago,

79
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:41,979
there are three major ways
of managing distance.

80
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:45,258
Copresence, everything in the same place,

81
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:48,646
mobility, material realities are moved,

82
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:54,911
and telecommunication,
where immaterial realities are moved.

83
00:04:55,575 --> 00:05:01,463
The city is the expression
of copresence within a societal scope.

84
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:06,638
Telecommunication did not begin
with the internet, or even the telephone.

85
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:08,868
Letters provided an efficient,

86
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:14,634
asynchronous mode of communication
well before emails.

87
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:17,157
Furthermore,
contemporary telecommunication

88
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:20,100
is not only synchronized online.

89
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,404
Books, including e-books, CDs, DVDs,

90
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:29,141
and everything that is downloadable,
or uploadable,

91
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:34,753
are good examples of current
offline forms of telecommunication.

92
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:42,524
This diagram presents the three modalities
as related to each other.

93
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:46,408
It is true that they can be seen
as alternatives to each other.

94
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:49,635
For instance, if you want to eat
Thai cuisine,

95
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:52,576
you can do it in a Thai restaurant
round the corner,

96
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:54,047
go to Thailand,

97
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:59,037
or download a Thai recipe from a website.

98
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:04,974
However, the three modalities
can be approached as complementary too.

99
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:08,303
As an example, the best way to profit
from a city

100
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:11,735
is to walk, ride,
or drive to take advantage

101
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:15,143
of the different locations
that are part of a city,

102
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:17,923
and to use the phone, or the internet,

103
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:22,095
to synchronize your encounters
inside the urban area,

104
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:25,689
so, if the main objective is copresence,

105
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,230
the two other ways of managing distance

106
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,680
will be used as means to attain
this objective,

107
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,889
thus e-commerce wouldn't be possible
without logistics,

108
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:44,432
and it's made easier by the concentration
of customers in large urban spaces.

109
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:49,254
We can now introduce the term
of coopetition

110
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:51,939
to sum up the complex relationships

111
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:56,008
between the different ways
of managing distance.

112
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,138
Coopetition defines a situation

113
00:06:58,138 --> 00:07:03,480
where a mix of competition
and cooperation can be observed,

114
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,331
for example, the institutional relations
between universities.

115
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:12,413
There is cooperation
within many research projects,

116
00:07:12,413 --> 00:07:17,824
but competition for attractiveness
and global rankings.

117
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:21,103
The Randstad urban network
in the Netherlands,

118
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:24,302
Rhineland in Germany, Po Valley in Italy,

119
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:28,843
or polycentric megalopolises
in Honshu, Japan,

120
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:31,856
or in northeastern USA,

121
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:37,759
are spaces where the rationale
is the coopetition between cities.
