1
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:08,056
Let's continue now to explore
an elementary vocabulary,

2
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:10,963
useful to address space.

3
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:12,813
In contemporary societies,

4
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:16,474
realities can be classified
into three major categories--

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,819
actors, objects and environments.

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,983
Let's define each of these terms.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,469
Actors are the opposite of agents.

8
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:30,219
The notion of actor means that societies
are animated by operators,

9
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:34,085
who are endowed
with a strategic competence.

10
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,163
The emergence of the actor
in social sciences

11
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:39,382
has also been called
<i>the pragmatic turn</i>.

12
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:41,388
Its concrete significance

13
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:45,544
is mainly that individuals
can be actors of their lives--

14
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:48,787
certainly not at a hundred percent level,

15
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:52,398
but not at zero percent either.

16
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:56,045
In spite of its oversimplicity,

17
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:59,349
the image of a moving cursor can be useful

18
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:04,698
as it makes a variability of a given
actor's power and capabilities

19
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,610
easily understandable.

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,093
Besides, actors are actors also,
because of their reflexivity,

21
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:16,555
which allows them to take
advantage of situations

22
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:19,087
where they <i>cannot</i> get everything,

23
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:23,800
but have to arbitrate between
different imperfect options.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,074
This approach is actually underpinned

25
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:32,147
by the criticism of
the structuralist paradigm,

26
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:38,095
which was dominant in the social
sciences of the 1960s and 70s.

27
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:42,029
Structuralism does not recognize
the existence of actors,

28
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:44,245
but only of agents.

29
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:49,694
Structuralist approaches encompass
four major theoretical bodies--

30
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:52,491
Marxism; psychoanalysis;

31
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:56,489
structural anthropology--
which gave birth to culturalism;

32
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,804
and structural linguistics.

33
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:03,103
After several attempts
to impose themselves,

34
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:04,893
separately or together,

35
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:08,427
as an orthodoxy in social sciences,

36
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:12,097
these theories have experienced
a dramatic decline.

37
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,156
However, in the North American mainstream,

38
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:16,823
in geography or sociology,

39
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:20,200
the structuralist approach
is still deep-rooted.

40
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,371
It is often self-denominated
as <i>post</i>-structuralist,

41
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:28,777
but it could be called
<i>neo</i>-structuralism,

42
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:32,458
because new structures,
such as race or gender,

43
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,756
have been added to
the traditional notion of class,

44
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,957
in the Marxist approach.

45
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:44,530
A generalization of the ahistorical vision
proposed by structural anthopology

46
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,465
has also been incorporated

47
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:51,425
through the polysemic
and slippery term of 'culture'.

48
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:56,456
If we look at what social sciences
consider as dynamic realities,

49
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:59,104
objects are also something new.

50
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:02,898
The philosopher Bruno Latour
uses the term <i>actants</i>

51
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:08,437
to make more tangible the idea
that manufactured items,

52
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:11,189
natural, non-human realities,

53
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,432
or mental and immaterial realities,

54
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:16,799
are active in social interactions.

55
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,864
In the case of artefacts or machines,

56
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:22,321
as well as for institutional realities,

57
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:26,902
such as organizations, religions
or political ideologies,

58
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:33,091
their creator's intentions are obviously
<i>embedded</i> in their very flesh

59
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:37,894
and interact with users' intentionality.

60
00:03:37,894 --> 00:03:44,000
However, even in the case of objects
coming from the biophysical worlds,

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,408
we find realities that are <i>not</i>
intentional at their starting point,

62
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:53,040
but which are <i>included</i>
in systems of social actions.

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,147
For instance, a bear is not an actor,

64
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:59,244
and is not part of the same
intentional complex,

65
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:02,922
if it lives in the wild,
in a natural reserve,

66
00:04:02,922 --> 00:04:05,209
in a zoo, or in a circus,

67
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,679
but in each case, it plays an active
role related to the performance

68
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:13,386
of different human actors involved.

69
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:19,663
Finally, the notion an environment
can seem neutral and banal,

70
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:23,735
but is significant by its own existence.

71
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,896
The decisive point is that
an environment is approached

72
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:32,282
on the same level as actors and objects.

73
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:35,970
An environment is an encompassing reality,

74
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,699
that conditions, partially determines,

75
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,997
and pre-figures the realities,
objects and actors it encompasses,

76
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:48,541
but these encompassed realities
are active too,

77
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,268
and can modify the environment.

78
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:54,833
In other terms, an environment
can condition the actors,

79
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,062
but actors can <i>destroy</i> an environment.

80
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,142
Societies are of course environments,

81
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:03,301
but the components of our societies,

82
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:06,405
such as the working place, or a family,

83
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:09,696
can also be considered environments.

84
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:12,014
Space is an environment.

85
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:13,784
There are natural environments,

86
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:17,233
but there are also purely artificial ones.

87
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,549
As we can see in this diagram,

88
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:24,445
there are different combinations
of the relationship

89
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:26,301
between an individual actor

90
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:30,784
and the environment, the society
as a whole, represents.

91
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:34,029
At one extreme, milieu--

92
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,564
a weak actor needs society,

93
00:05:36,564 --> 00:05:40,968
embodied in welfare state
or public policies, to survive.

94
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:42,694
At the other extreme,

95
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:47,104
the citizen actor maximizes
their capacities

96
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:51,019
in order to try and change
the societal environment

97
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:53,507
through political agency.

98
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:57,592
In between, we find climates
and affordances,

99
00:05:57,592 --> 00:06:01,394
where the respective powers
of actors <i>and</i> the environment

100
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,057
are more balanced.

101
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:08,464
Till now, we have used space
as a generic term,

102
00:06:08,464 --> 00:06:12,020
meaning any kind of reality
is defined by distance relations

103
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,517
between other realities.

104
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:19,720
At this stage, it can be useful
to distinguish space and spatiality.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,358
Space is an environment defined
by relations of distance

106
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:27,851
between its components
and with other spaces.

107
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:33,440
Spatiality is the part of human agency
related to distance relations.

108
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,832
Thus, space is spatial
as an environment,

109
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:42,360
and spatiality is spatial as a set
of actions, as agency.

110
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,549
Spaces impose their conditions
to actors,

111
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:50,217
and actors develop spatialities
that modify those spaces.

112
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:56,440
The notion of geographicity appear
then as an overarching concept,

113
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,971
encompassing <i>both</i> space and spatiality.

114
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:05,442
Geographicity can be defined as a spatial
dimension of the social worlds,

115
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:07,894
that is, human worlds.

116
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:12,513
An important distinction
should be made now

117
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:15,311
between place and area.

118
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:20,487
A place is a type of space in which
distance is non relevant.

119
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:26,030
An area is a set of places separated
by a relevant distance.

120
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,677
From microlocal situations
to the world,

121
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:34,893
any space can be seen either
as a place, or as an area.

122
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:37,096
For instance, a city is a place,

123
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:42,079
if it is addressed as a whole
interurban approach,

124
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,117
but it is an area when understood
as a set of districts,

125
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:49,874
or neighorhoods--
<i>intra</i>-urban approach.

126
00:07:50,964 --> 00:07:52,779
This distinction is fundamental

127
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:58,885
because it gives a concrete, pragmatic
significance to scale thresholds.

128
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:01,404
We switch from a level to another

129
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:05,709
when we consider, as in the case
of intra-, inter-urban,

130
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,941
that what was a place becomes
an area-- downscaling.

131
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:13,994
Or what was an area becomes
a place-- upscaling.

132
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:18,583
Scale is a relation between
the size of spatial realities

133
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,505
and other characteristics
of these realities.

134
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:23,881
It defines significant thresholds

135
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:28,491
that make a space switch
from place to area.

136
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:33,521
A metrics is a way of measuring
and managing distance.

137
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:36,787
There exists an infinity of metrics.

138
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:41,917
We can classify the different
categories of metrics

139
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,552
from their internal style,

140
00:08:43,552 --> 00:08:45,972
or from the perspective of their limits.

141
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:49,515
Traditional geography was obsessed
with a country model,

142
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:53,424
that is to say, a territory locked
by clear cut borders,

143
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:57,006
but many other types of spaces exist.

144
00:08:57,006 --> 00:09:01,383
We can observe that there are
many other combinations of metrics.

145
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:03,343
Territories and networks

146
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:08,154
are the simplest and the most significant
distinctions between spaces.

147
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:13,874
Finally, everything in a society
has a spatial dimension,

148
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:17,709
but society possesses other dimensions.

149
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:24,029
Substance identifies the non-spatial
part of spatial realities.

150
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:25,977
Substance matters.

151
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:28,141
The space generated by a company

152
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:32,979
is not the space of an individual,
or of a State.

153
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:35,139
A major distinction among substances

154
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:39,842
is between society--
social world as totality,

155
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:44,698
and social-- social world
as a component of a society.

156
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:50,129
Scale, metrics and substance
are inter-related.

157
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,069
You can't define one of them
without considering the others.

158
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,319
Taken together, they represent
the minimal compulsory set of attributes

159
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,310
of any space or spatiality.

160
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,667
In other words, it's impossible to define
an elementary spatial configuration,

161
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,110
or <i>chorotype</i>,

162
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,361
without any of the three components.

163
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:18,728
If we consider now how spaces
interact with each other,

164
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:23,376
we can identify three major
categories of inter-spatialities.

165
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:25,712
<i>Interface</i> is the most classic.

166
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:30,450
It connects horizontally
juxtaposed spaces.

167
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:36,100
An example-- two countries meeting
each other at their joint border.

168
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,507
The second inter-spatiality is <i>nesting</i>.

169
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:46,716
It's characterized by the <i>inclusion</i>
of one space in another larger space,

170
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,559
like Russian dolls.

171
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:52,099
The arrangement of political territories

172
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:54,639
is a common nesting configuration.

173
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,791
In the case of federal systems,

174
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,461
we have mimetic, non-hierarchical nesting.

175
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:01,998
As a matter of fact,

176
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:06,456
each tier reproduces
the same kind of institutions

177
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,499
as below and above,

178
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:11,810
and enjoys comparable competences.

179
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,609
Finally, <i>cospatiality</i>
is a <i>vertical</i> connection

180
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,008
between different spatial layers,
through connectors.

181
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:23,204
For instance, a railway network
and a city,

182
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,312
thanks to a railway station.

183
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:30,239
We can imagine a superposition
of layers without connectors,

184
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:33,662
and in this case, cospatiality
doesn't occur.

185
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:38,941
For instance, individual layers
in a city may not interact

186
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:41,947
if there are no opportunities
for them to do so.

187
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:47,391
In this case, the city of each individual
cannot become the city of all.

188
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:51,390
Similarly, the global economic network,

189
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,089
and the territorial partition of States,

190
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,265
are <i>not</i> directly connected.

191
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,195
They are not cospatial.

192
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:01,071
We will see in Session 6

193
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:04,733
that synchronization may be seen

194
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:08,673
as a fourth category of interspatiality.

195
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:12,248
So far, we have placed some cornerstones

196
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:16,445
that help us to address the spatial
dimension of social worlds.

197
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:21,423
By doing this, we have taken on,
in an implicit way,

198
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:26,965
a particular concept of space which
underpins these first statements.

199
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:31,027
This table shows that, historically,

200
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:35,733
conceptions of space have been
controversial on two major points.

201
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:41,007
The first one is about the absolute
or relative nature of space.

202
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:45,564
Is space a pre-existing box
where things are located?

203
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:51,430
Or is space a changing configuration
linked to what is spatialized?

204
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,157
The second position

205
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:56,382
is about the positional
or relational character of space,

206
00:12:56,382 --> 00:13:00,106
where the measurement
of a space be the same,

207
00:13:00,106 --> 00:13:03,893
carried out, for instance,
through Euclidean geometry,

208
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:09,248
independently from interactions
between the realities that compose it?

209
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:13,347
Or is redefining the rules of measurement,

210
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:14,792
each time we observe

211
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:19,582
a new set of spatially interacting
realities, required?

212
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:24,734
These debates were very active
in the 17th and 18th Centuries

213
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:30,518
but eventually the practice of scientific 
research settled the argument.

214
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:35,912
As the table shows, although
contemporary social sciences of space

215
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:40,312
have not completely converged on these
fundamental conceptualizations,

216
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:43,166
we can contend that, by and large,

217
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,891
the relative relational conception--
that of Leibniz,

218
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:51,253
has clearly got an overwhelming
cognitive advantage,

219
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:54,931
because it is consistent with
a dimensional approach

220
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:56,934
to social realities.

221
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:59,656
Space is a dimension that, as others,

222
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:03,107
goes through every single social reality.

223
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,045
The Leibnizian approach to space

224
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,749
is also clearly dominant
in relativist physics.
