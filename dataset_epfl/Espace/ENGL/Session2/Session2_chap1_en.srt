1
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,230
In the first session, we have expressed

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,702
several statements on fundamental points:

3
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:13,576
what space is, why it matters,
and how to address it.

4
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:18,152
In the next two sessions, we'll begin
to apply this first block of notions

5
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:21,473
to two seemingly heterogeneous realities:

6
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:24,531
the world, the most encompassing
human environment,

7
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:28,827
and the individual,
the most basic operator in a society.

8
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:33,691
As for the world, we will see
the apparent complication of this subject

9
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:38,453
can be turned into complexity,
that is, something sophisticated

10
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:42,972
but made simpler thanks to reasoning,
concepts and models.

11
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:45,100
And here, let me tell you,

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,337
a spatial perspective
can really be useful.

13
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:53,427
The world,

14
00:00:53,656 --> 00:00:55,577
an evident geographical reality,

15
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:58,757
but so big, so complicated.

16
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:03,336
Can we identify some simple ideas
to think it out?

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,936
The world has, of course, something to do

18
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:09,814
with "global" and with "globalization".

19
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:11,024
But how?

20
00:01:12,044 --> 00:01:15,577
In this session, we'll begin
with a general discussion

21
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:18,640
about the emergence
of a relevant world-scale space.

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,839
Then, we will propose a multi-stage
historical view of this process.

23
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:27,357
Finally, we'll try to present

24
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:31,271
as simple as possible modelling
to address today's globality.

25
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,751
Let's begin with three defnitions.

26
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:45,315
The world is the most encompassing
human-inhabited space.

27
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:49,357
In this meaning, World has a capital W.

28
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:55,321
Its extent is currently the planet Earth,
a natural environment

29
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:59,473
with which co-spatiality is
less and less optional.

30
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:03,649
The process of invention
of this emerging reality

31
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,625
is called globalization.

32
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,457
Globalization is the process
through which the world becomes

33
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:13,521
not only the frame
including other spaces,

34
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:16,251
but a relevant space in itself.

35
00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:22,931
Globality means, for any social reality,
its global dimension.

36
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:29,075
The global dimension is present
in any spatial configuration.

37
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:32,419
Globality can be addressed at any scale.

38
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:41,071
Looking at the past,
if we try to give dates

39
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:45,263
and place the origin of globalization
in the scope of human history,

40
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:48,307
we immediately realize it's not easy.

41
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:51,359
If, now, we look into the future,

42
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,949
a forecast of how the world will look like

43
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:56,127
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,

44
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:58,582
is by far more trivial.

45
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:03,767
Many decisive bifurcations are emerging
or will emerge later.

46
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:09,170
These bifurcations can alter
the horizon of globalization,

47
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:15,566
Is it irreversible, its content,
what will a globalized world look like?

48
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:21,152
And the modalities of globality,
how will globalization happen?

49
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:28,556
Globalization is an event
with geographical content.

50
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,176
To study it,

51
00:03:30,456 --> 00:03:33,043
geographers should take into account

52
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:37,744
its contrasting temporalities,
which overlap and interact.

53
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:40,899
As we have seen in session one,

54
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:45,349
taking into consideration
what the actors want can be useful,

55
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:50,655
as it allows us not to be content
with [inaudible] tendencies,

56
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:54,251
what positivism-inspired forecasts
classically do,

57
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:59,127
but to seize the weak signals
that develop rapidly,

58
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:04,335
and can become somtimes suddenly
the major components of a given situation.

59
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:09,011
Thus, what can be called
ecological awareness,

60
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:13,017
a notion we will examine
more in-depth in session seven,

61
00:04:13,397 --> 00:04:16,195
which clearly fuels political debates

62
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:19,908
around the open notion
of sustainable development,

63
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:25,235
has profoundly influenced the images
of globalization and globality.

64
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:31,925
Globalization not only includes material
objects and actions on these objects,

65
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:37,126
but also a moving set
of active spatial representations.

66
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:39,254
When we first had the opportunity

67
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:43,555
to see the Earth from the outer space
in the late '60s,

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,653
it was not only a new image
but a new <i>reality</i> which was offered to us.

69
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:51,384
Contemporary globalization,

70
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:55,150
more precisely the contemporary
phase of globalization,

71
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,295
is a process whose one major novelty comes

72
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:01,156
from the fact that it is
conceived, discussed,

73
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:07,050
desired or feared, dreamt, transformed
into myth, narrative or ideology,

74
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,120
in brief, represented,

75
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,047
at the same moment as it is made
as an objective phenomenon.

76
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:18,254
You can be in favor, or in opposition
to what you call "globalization,"

77
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,714
which is not neccesarily the definition

78
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:23,179
your colleague or neighbor has in mind.

79
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:28,185
Anyway, there is no time lapse
between thought and agency.

80
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:33,084
It is even the opposite.
Acting follows imaging.

81
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:37,754
A significant difference
from other worldwide events,

82
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,974
such as the discovery of the Americas,

83
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:41,083
World War 1,

84
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:46,304
or the totalitarian movements
of the 20th century, can be observed.

85
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,539
In all these global events,
representations of what was happening

86
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,445
were generally constructed

87
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:56,740
according to a model conceived
for other objects,

88
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,706
and originally deployed at other scales
than that of the world.

89
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:04,386
It could be argued, however,

90
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:07,329
that some representations
of the world as such

91
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:11,522
were present very early
in the colonial conquests

92
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:13,965
carried out by European states.

93
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:19,636
But, these images were confined
to a specific sphere, mainly geopolitical.

94
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,344
Current visions of globalization,

95
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:25,784
that reduce the event
to its economic dimension,

96
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:30,768
or which are derived from issues
of a different nature, are comparable.

97
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:37,361
So, globalization is not always
comprehended with its full significance.

98
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:42,898
However, essentially, the actors
of globalization think about globalization

99
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:45,613
and speak about it at the same time

100
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,547
that they are inventing it.

101
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,984
This singlularity has encompassed
a double characteristic.

102
00:06:54,984 --> 00:07:00,279
The emergence of a worldwide scene,
where great issues are at stake,

103
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,488
largely diffuse tools
of knowledge and communication,

104
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:08,651
which make possible
an informed exchange between citizens.

105
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:12,017
Globalization can then be approached

106
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:17,360
from a cognitive point of view,
as a moment and an act of knowledge.

107
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,863
Stated otherwise, globalization
is not only a context,

108
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:25,971
which it is, of course,
but also a text,

109
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:29,654
a paradigm, an epistemy, a referential,

110
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:32,320
constructed at the same time
as it is used,

111
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,627
in different registers
and by different types of operators.

112
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,970
From this perspective,
the analysis of the discourses produced

113
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,066
should include the exploration

114
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:51,214
of the cognitive competencies
of the ordinary players,

115
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:55,554
and set aside the idea
that these representations

116
00:07:55,554 --> 00:08:02,108
would only be illusions that science
would have the mission to overcome.

117
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:06,301
From indivudual actors,
to scholars and other kinds of experts,

118
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:10,074
there exists a continuum
that demands caution

119
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,873
in the establishment
of epistemological boundaries.

120
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:16,452
This doesn't mean
that science-oriented research

121
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:20,773
does not have questions, methods
or goals of its own,

122
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:23,606
but it is necessary to go farther,

123
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:27,968
and to place all these
cognitive approaches, including our own,

124
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:31,223
with a comprehensive,
in both meanings of the word,

125
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:36,933
set, that specifically helps us
to better understand

126
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:41,554
the dynamic of this complex machinery
that globalization is.

127
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:49,946
The Earth is approximately
4.5 billion years old.

128
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,622
The world is a much more recent reality.

129
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:57,813
We can easily imagine a situation

130
00:08:57,813 --> 00:09:01,033
where societies would be scattered
all over the planet,

131
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:04,389
and wouldn't have any relations
with each other.

132
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:09,327
That is to say, they would be separated
by infinte distances.

133
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:13,296
and a large number of small worlds
would then exist,

134
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:15,279
but not one world.

135
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:20,071
In this situation, the word "World,"
as a proper noun,

136
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:22,544
would have no significant meaning.

137
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:26,992
The idea of a World with a capital W
can make sense

138
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:30,452
when and only when
the distance relationships

139
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:33,644
between societies
of their parts, to change.

140
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,816
If I can represent myself
or my environment

141
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:42,241
as near or far from another individual,
or another society,

142
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:48,315
this means I could at least in imagination
be nearer or farther from them.

143
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:54,538
Thus, every single person or object,
that is located on the Earth's surface,

144
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:57,666
is somehow tied in a systemic device,

145
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:02,086
which is not reducible
to the sum of its components.

146
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:08,291
If we see the world in this way,
then we can immediately admit

147
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,018
that globalization,
the invention of the world,

148
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:15,434
is a geographical event
that began a long time ago.

149
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:19,263
Many confusing things have been said

150
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,597
about the beginning of mankind.

151
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:26,039
The natural history
of mammals and primates

152
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,734
is often uncontrollably mixed

153
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:31,121
with the social history of humankind.

154
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,513
But as a species, that is to say,

155
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:39,423
with approximately the same
transferrable genetic material,

156
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:44,884
Homo sapiens is only 200,000 years old.

157
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:51,034
It is true that there have been,
on Earth, other intelligent species,

158
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:55,502
some contemporary with Homo sapiens,
such as the Neanderthals,

159
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:59,082
some having disappeared much earlier.

160
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,354
But the genetic material

161
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:07,653
of each of these supposed
biological cousins or remote ancestors

162
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:12,097
actually shows significant discontinuities
with Homo sapiens.

163
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:18,035
Each of these species had
their own history, which is not ours.

164
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:24,653
The idea of a trans-species
human history is dangerous,

165
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:29,183
because it confuses
biological temporality, evolution,

166
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:32,390
with social temporality, history.

167
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,010
This confusion can easily lead
to finalist narratives,

168
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:42,380
and to the myth of a biological
predestination of the social world.

169
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,530
Therefore, let's remain careful
when we have a look

170
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,041
at the geography of the humanoids

171
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:55,451
til the emergence of Homo sapiens
in Africa, two thousand centuries ago.

172
00:11:55,901 --> 00:12:01,926
This moment marked the beginning
of prehistory: that is, history.

173
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,742
This map shows a synthesis
of human migrations

174
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:09,742
during all the Paleolithic era.

175
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,969
The present-day [Cumenae],
including the Pacific islands,

176
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:20,687
has been totally occupied only recently,
no more than a thousand years ago.

177
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:26,137
As archaeological findings show,
there is a correspondence

178
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:28,945
between the first movements out of Africa

179
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:33,464
between 100,000 and 80,000 years ago

180
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:37,936
and the advent of high-significance
technological innovations

181
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:43,169
such as sophisticated tools,
Mousterian and Aterian industries.

182
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,906
Long-distance mobility appears, therefore,

183
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:51,677
as a constitutive characteristic
of advanced human societies.

184
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:55,988
This observation contrasts
with Martin Heidegger's view,

185
00:12:55,988 --> 00:13:00,427
which associates inhabiting,
<i>wohnen</i> in German,

186
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:02,678
to nearness and immobility.

187
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,245
Heidegger rejects
modern technologies of speed

188
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,287
as part of a forgetfulness of being,

189
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:15,407
and of the dimension of care
that is present in the situated practices

190
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:19,075
humans experience
in their existence, <i>Dasein</i>.

191
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:23,588
This approach can be interpreted
as a glorification

192
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:27,046
of the riveted-to-the-ground
rural societies.

193
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:32,954
But this reality represents a small part
of all history over time and space.

194
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,482
Moreover, the maps we have just seen

195
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:42,059
show that mobility
is not a post-rural phenomenon,

196
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:46,243
but clearly started before
the beginning of farming,

197
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:50,883
which appeared approximately
10,000 years before today.

198
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,607
The sedentary nature of rural societies

199
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:58,766
is more of an exception
than a rule in human history.

200
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:02,503
Contemporary mobility is closing

201
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:06,317
the incidental period
of an immobile society,

202
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:09,673
and creates a certain similarity
of our practices

203
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:13,759
with our Paleolithic ascendants.

204
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,014
We can also identify continuity

205
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:19,744
between the first migrations
and our times in another way.

206
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:23,782
One outcome
of our ancestors' migrations

207
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:26,490
is that they have progressively created

208
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,647
many of the places we now live in.

209
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:33,316
Some of them have disappeared,
of course, but not all,

210
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:36,921
and the newly-invented ones,
in the course of history,

211
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:40,200
have generally linked up
to pre-existing ones.

212
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,640
Let's imagine a counterfactual history.

213
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,710
We know that Paleolithic migrations
have to be related

214
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,192
to the predatory system
of this period.

215
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:55,120
Groups of people depleted
their local resources,

216
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,352
and were therefore forced to move.

217
00:14:57,962 --> 00:15:01,840
But if the Neolithic
revolution had bloomed

218
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,435
before global migration,
the increase of soil yield,

219
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:09,803
namely through irrigated farming,

220
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:12,432
would have allowed
the whole of mankind

221
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:14,823
to stay in the same region,

222
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:16,955
and the population might have grown

223
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:20,090
to a dramatic extent,
but in the same area.

224
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,280
Then, the stock of places
existing all over the world

225
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,617
would have been reduced
to a restrictive number.

226
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:32,268
Now, these numerous
and diverse places

227
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:36,200
are the fundamental resource
of what has become

228
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,260
one of the most
productive sectors: tourism.

229
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,722
In 2012, for the first time,

230
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:48,115
the activity created by the crossing

231
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,490
of an international border
to visit a place

232
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:57,614
generated more than
1,000 billion US dollars of receipts.

233
00:15:58,644 --> 00:16:01,907
This industry of elsewhere
has been made possible

234
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:05,919
because the elsewhere makes sense.

235
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,177
The production of these many elsewheres

236
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:14,347
began with Homo sapiens'
first long-distance migrations.
