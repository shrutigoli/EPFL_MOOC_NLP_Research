1
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:07,420
Globalization is not
an elementary, linear process

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,091
but has a long, complicated story.

3
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:14,409
We can consider Paleolithic migrations

4
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:17,679
as the first step towards globalization.

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,099
In the continuation,
six other stages can be identified.

6
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,098
After the Age One,

7
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:29,396
defined by the diffusion
of Homo Sapiens on the planet,

8
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,842
we can identify six great globalizations

9
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:36,735
or rather six phases
of the same globalization process.

10
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:39,672
These phases often overlap.

11
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,998
They can be subdivided
and follow the logic

12
00:00:42,998 --> 00:00:45,355
that is sometimes contradictory.

13
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,745
Connection, the beginning of relations

14
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:53,683
between the different societies
located on the planet.

15
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:56,980
The completion
of the exploration of the earth

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,740
during the Age of Discovery by Europeans

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,389
at the end of the 15th century,

18
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:04,262
must be put into perspective.

19
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:06,606
The technical capacity of coastal shipping

20
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:09,606
to face strong headwinds completed

21
00:01:09,606 --> 00:01:13,468
a process of generalized connections
between societies

22
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:15,806
that had taken place for centuries

23
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:19,756
in their old world, the Eurasiafrica

24
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:24,089
stretching up to the Pacific Northwest,
peopling the Americas,

25
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:26,901
and with the South Pacific Islands

26
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:29,201
more or less linked to South America.

27
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:34,430
The Muslim space constituted
one of the principal links of this world.

28
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,386
It was structured on exchanges,
such as along the Silk Road

29
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:44,159
that was decisive for the empires
that controlled a piece of it only,

30
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,120
and was more durable than these empires.

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,991
We can approach this era

32
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:52,928
by following the journeys of Marco Polo

33
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:55,968
along the Silk Road, a major trade link

34
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,736
between the eastern
and western part of Eurasia

35
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,289
as we can see on the following map.

36
00:02:04,723 --> 00:02:07,731
This stage of globalization appears modern

37
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:09,873
in the sense that it was based

38
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:12,147
more on the research of information

39
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:14,972
and the rationale
of commercial transactions

40
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:19,178
than on conquest and power,
leading to territorial control.

41
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:25,413
Inclusion: the forced incorporation
into worldwide empires.

42
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:29,453
Overlapping with the preceding phase,

43
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:31,548
that of the colonization of the planet

44
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:35,423
by a limited number
of interacting empires,

45
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:37,786
characterizes this moment.

46
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:40,316
Western Europe, joined
at the end of this period

47
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:42,106
by the United States,

48
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:47,244
detaches itself and becomes
a unique actor in this globalization.

49
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:50,871
Europe acts, others must submit.

50
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:06,578
As [Christian Waterloo] has shown,

51
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:10,633
two types of positions
should be distinguished,

52
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:14,796
those which aim to provide
goods not available in Europe--

53
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:16,986
search for otherness--

54
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:22,399
and those that project a given society
beyond its borders--

55
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,411
search for mimetic reproduction.

56
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,603
Beyond the destruction of civilizations,

57
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:30,671
which was not a new phenomenon

58
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,295
but took here a radical turn,

59
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:37,978
the most salient fact was
the contradiction between exploitation--

60
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:42,250
which manifests itself
by a predatory inclusion of men,

61
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,366
institutions, cultures, raw materials--

62
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:49,518
and diffusion, which integrates,
for better or worse,

63
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:53,911
the colonies into a sphere
of the colonizer's culture,

64
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:57,982
involuntarily providing
the dominated people

65
00:03:57,982 --> 00:04:01,794
with their values of liberty,
equality and progress

66
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:05,185
which help them in their emancipation.

67
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:11,090
Internationalization: the creation
of a worldwide space of exchange.

68
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:15,560
The sequence is situated between 1849,

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,997
British overall control over India,

70
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:22,473
and 1939 at the apogee
of imperial systems.

71
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:26,521
To a certain extent,
the openness of developed economies is

72
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:29,823
comparable to the contemporary sequence.

73
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,568
Two key elements set them apart,

74
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:36,001
however-- on one hand the exchanges

75
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,661
of commodities are based

76
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:41,225
on the complementarities
of natural origin.

77
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:44,924
They result from the contrasts
in productivity

78
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:47,216
based on climate differences.

79
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:51,008
This is a continuation
of the first type of colonization.

80
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:56,166
In the next stages,
the relative weakening of agricultural

81
00:04:56,166 --> 00:05:00,192
and mineral raw materials
in trade balances will give

82
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:02,860
the impression of a step backwards,

83
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,567
even if this is due to the emergence

84
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:09,347
of more sophisticated
productive technologies.

85
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:15,669
On the other hand, the world wars
and the impact of countries closing down

86
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:20,453
in the aftermath
of the 1929 economic crisis show

87
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,298
that a reversibility of globalization,

88
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:27,831
which does not seem absurd
to the majority of people of this era,

89
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:29,638
is always possible

90
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:32,696
at the price of massive diseconomies

91
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:35,076
and considerable destruction.

92
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:41,098
Globalisation refused:
the victorious resistance of states.

93
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:47,703
The 1914 - 1945 period marks
a complete halt

94
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:49,909
in the process of opening.

95
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:53,865
The two world wars
and the treatment of the economic crisis

96
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:55,988
put the states back in the center

97
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,982
in their refusal
to weaken their prerogatives.

98
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:03,233
While they were at the pinnacle
of their power,

99
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,909
the active states easily succeeded

100
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:09,049
in mobilizing their respective societies

101
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,860
through their hatred of the other

102
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,817
and in a exacerbated nationalism.

103
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:21,109
Logically, this paroxysm of the state is
a low point for globalization.

104
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:24,239
We must wait for the 1980s

105
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:28,928
to find an economic openness
equivalent to that of 1914.

106
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,189
It is true that in between times,

107
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,775
the content of these exchanges had
profoundly changed

108
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:44,303
from the trade of tropical products
shipped to colonial metropolises.

109
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,883
The world of commerce moved
to a map of trade,

110
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:50,263
based on the exchange of the same type

111
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:53,718
of manufactured production
in both directions,

112
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:56,376
in particular between rich countries.

113
00:06:57,176 --> 00:07:01,012
With the collapse
of the Berlin Wall, 1989,

114
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:04,048
marked the end of the communist hypothesis

115
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,853
of an imperial couner-globalization,

116
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:10,306
wrapped up
in a universalist-like ideology.

117
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:19,202
Interdependence: acceleration.
multidimensionality and irreversibilty.

118
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:25,513
After 1945, changes in the geopolitical
and political context

119
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:28,443
played a considerable role in the return

120
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:32,143
to the processes
of globalization of exchanges.

121
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:35,267
The new element is
the growing role of exchanges

122
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,210
between comparable spaces,

123
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,219
as seen in western Europe,

124
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:41,885
where, during the post war decades,

125
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:45,189
the swing from 25 percent to 60 percent

126
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,812
of the international exchanges
made on the continent,

127
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,437
accompanies the political construction,

128
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:55,174
more than just being
a result of this construction.

129
00:07:57,836 --> 00:08:01,950
It is also the moment
when giant national firms are bulit,

130
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,099
conceived at first
in a mercantilist spirit,

131
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:09,397
that is to say, as part
of the geopolitical logic

132
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:11,603
that states developed,

133
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:16,246
then changing with the development
of transnational firms.

134
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,440
These created an industrial,
then financial,

135
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,835
more and more international network

136
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:26,839
and this network space made
their citizenship elusive.

137
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:29,415
In the end, the technical aspects,

138
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,945
reduction of the cost of transportation,

139
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,751
the emergence of digital telecommunication

140
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:37,514
gave an extra push to the process.

141
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:43,843
It is not simply a question
of monetary exchanges.

142
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:47,473
It is the moment where everything
that can be exchanged

143
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:49,778
between different types of operators

144
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:51,773
is actually exchanged.

145
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:55,173
Businesses,
but also nonprofit organizations,

146
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:57,698
can communicate much more quickly

147
00:08:57,698 --> 00:09:01,761
and at a volume
that has never before been seen.

148
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,959
The current period is characterized
by a generalization

149
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,075
that emphasizes speed
and the changes induced.

150
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,630
An important part
of the circulatory dynamic--

151
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,713
fluidity of information,
cultural exchanges,

152
00:09:17,713 --> 00:09:19,957
increased opportunities for interactions

153
00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:22,334
between the inhabitants of the planet--

154
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:23,763
is very old.

155
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:28,822
Globalization of science and the arts goes
back to the 19th century.

156
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,048
This time, however,

157
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:37,163
all of the exchanges experienced
a rapid growth

158
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:42,463
and this multidimensionality includes
political debates and issues.

159
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,763
We can follow this political emergence

160
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:49,447
by examining the phenomenon
of public opinion--

161
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,693
the protests against the Vietnam War,

162
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:55,583
for example, from 1963 to 1975--

163
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,088
of an increasingly common agenda,

164
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:01,456
in particular about natural environments

165
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:05,746
after the nuclear accident
at Chernobyl, 1986,

166
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,924
and the Rio Conference in 1992--

167
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:14,290
of growth in the role
of thematic international institutions,

168
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,181
IMF, World Bank, WTO--

169
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:19,868
and the birth of a legal framework

170
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:22,815
with the International Criminal Tribunal

171
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:26,533
for ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s.

172
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:31,588
Cosmopoliticisation:
the World-society at stake.

173
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:35,908
Recently, from a date
that is conventionally established

174
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:39,235
as the fall of state communism, 1989,

175
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:42,421
appearing as an alternative
to globalization,

176
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:45,027
interdependencies between different places

177
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,207
on the planet have become generalized

178
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:51,183
and have reached areas
that did not yet belong

179
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,686
to the usual sphere of exchanges
and public debates.

180
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:59,815
It would not be absurd
to make this phase start in 1945,

181
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:03,353
the trials of Nuremberg marking
the introduction

182
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:06,276
of the "crime against humanity" notion

183
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:10,315
and of a worldwide
domestic justice conceived

184
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,516
to punish this type of crime.

185
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:18,423
The International Criminal Court,
ICC, created in 1998

186
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:22,848
and effective since 2002,
embodies this idea.

187
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:28,928
Ever since the last decade
of the 20th century

188
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:31,185
the questions of developments

189
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:35,580
such as economic growth,
income distribution, education,

190
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,877
public health, natural environment,

191
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:40,755
but also of migrations and tourism,

192
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:42,875
have become more visible

193
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,663
as explicit world-scale political issues.

194
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:50,073
The emergence of versatile digital systems

195
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:53,353
connecting almost everyone
around the world,

196
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:56,624
including across small,
formerly landlocked routes,

197
00:11:57,364 --> 00:12:01,703
has made possible a somehow
common perception of these topics.

198
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,147
The general issue
of globalization can then be defined

199
00:12:06,147 --> 00:12:09,278
as the emergence of a complete society

200
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:11,068
at a worldwide level--

201
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:12,708
of a world society,

202
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:16,379
which will add a new level
to geographical situations,

203
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:19,473
of a societal substance already present--

204
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:24,293
local, regional, national,
or in construction, continental--

205
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:28,050
without substituting them,
but by influencing them

206
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,016
and being influenced by them.

207
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:39,357
All of this contributes
to make politics the crucial point

208
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:42,043
from which the term,
proposed by Immanuel Kant

209
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:44,440
at the end of the 18th century,

210
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,172
and recently revisited
by Ulrich Beck, 2006,

211
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:50,966
of cosmopolitics.

212
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:56,365
Only politics deployed
on a planetary scale can create,

213
00:12:56,365 --> 00:13:00,531
through governmental institutions,
public policies, parties,

214
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,516
non-state actors, public opinion,

215
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,687
minimal cohesion of a societal type,

216
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,425
between all of the paths
of an already active civil society.

217
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:16,747
Behind these political debates lie
ethical problems.

218
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:21,177
What are the fundamentals
of coexistence on a planetary scale,

219
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:25,534
beyond the incontestable differences
between societies?

220
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:30,019
It is because this type
of question cannot be eluded

221
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,492
that we can characterize
the current process

222
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,862
as universalization.

223
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,954
This can give way
to paradoxical expressions

224
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:43,478
like the different forms
in which globalization is contested

225
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:47,713
and to alternative propositions,
more or less coherent.

226
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:52,762
From the ultra-globalism
to Islamist terrorism

227
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:56,182
it is also within anti-system postures,

228
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:59,809
that reinforce
the supposedly challenged system.

229
00:14:00,564 --> 00:14:05,667
Those who oppose to all globalization,
could be distinguished

230
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:09,683
from those who support
a different globalization,

231
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,656
that would differ
from the one that they blame

232
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:18,493
as dominated by transnational firms
and the neoliberal agenda.

233
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:22,769
In fact, these distinctions are
not so simple,

234
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:26,719
because there is an intermix
between both attitudes.

235
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:30,191
The anti-globalization movements combine,

236
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:32,656
in a manner that is more or less coherent,

237
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:37,236
several orientations--
the criticism of capitalism in general,

238
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:40,581
that more specific
of its transnational players,

239
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:43,416
the condemnation of the United States,

240
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,212
the defence of the nation-state

241
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:49,596
as the ideal and single-level place
for economic production,

242
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:52,933
political regulation and social cohesion.

243
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:58,073
The question of knowing
whether globalization will prevail

244
00:14:58,073 --> 00:15:00,076
is an issue in itself.

245
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:04,261
Can we imagine a future
for a non-globalized world?

246
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:06,898
It is not a mere academic query.

247
00:15:06,898 --> 00:15:10,393
Since the last time
globalization was rejected,

248
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:13,343
after the crisis of 1929,

249
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:15,855
World War Two started.

250
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:21,398
In few words,
world-as-society is a major issue

251
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:24,753
of the seventh stage of globalization.

252
00:15:24,753 --> 00:15:27,721
The world is not a full fledged society,

253
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:29,908
but it probably is becoming one.

254
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:32,383
It is not a society

255
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:37,862
1) because intercommunal
or interstate separations continue

256
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:41,966
to organize a significant part
of global-scale social life

257
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,525
and profoundly divide the world,

258
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:50,086
and 2) because the interactions
that tend to unify the world

259
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:53,421
remain largely based on transactions

260
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:57,316
and therefore lack
an assumed political dimension.
