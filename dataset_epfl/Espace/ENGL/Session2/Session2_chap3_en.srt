1
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,966
If we try to address
contemporary globality,

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:12,755
we face a complicated assemblage
of heterogeneous realities.

3
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:15,701
Clearly, the society model--

4
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:19,520
that is, considering the world
as an ordinary society,

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,130
such as local or national societies--

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,323
does not easily suit
this apparent ontological mess.

7
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:32,845
Nevertheless, if we bring together
inter-societal approaches--

8
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:35,605
using, for instance, geopolitical logics,

9
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:39,938
as if the world was a mere aggregate
of independent societies,

10
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:45,410
and intra-society approaches--
identifying possible political issues

11
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,045
as if the world <i>were</i> working
as a full-fledged society--

12
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:55,075
we can transform complication
into complexity.

13
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:59,089
In this perspective,
we get to the provisional conclusion

14
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:03,290
that the four principles shown
in the following diagram,

15
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,355
in their combination,

16
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:08,817
offer a good approximation
to summarize the rationales

17
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:10,830
of the contemporary world.

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,692
We'll have an overall view
on these four rationales,

19
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:17,847
and we will briefly examine each of them.

20
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,447
The world as a set of worlds

21
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:27,750
is the part of reality
which most takes us back

22
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,751
to our Paleolithic past.

23
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:35,109
A world made of human groups who are,
for the most part,

24
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:38,835
unaware of each other,
meeting by chance

25
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:42,053
and not imagining any communication
between each other.

26
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:45,485
In this case, it is not even necessary

27
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:50,333
to recognize the human quality
to non-members of the group.

28
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,947
The distance
between societies is infinite.

29
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:58,730
Despite appearances,
this situation has not disappeared.

30
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:04,701
What is often called "cultural areas"
pertains to this dimension.

31
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:08,259
These areas can be defined
on a global scale

32
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,624
according to religious
or linguistic criteria,

33
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:14,256
but also on a more restricted scale,

34
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:17,441
according to all those
specific characteristics

35
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:20,388
defining communal identities

36
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:25,016
which make genuine exchanges
with the outside world difficult.

37
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:30,094
This is the case
for religious, biological, race,

38
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:34,363
blood, ethnicity, and physical--
soil, land-- allegiances.

39
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:40,284
Communal identities do not necessarily
take an aggressive form.

40
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:43,907
Aggressiveness can be a response
to perceived threats

41
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:48,390
which may be external--
the invasion of foreign concepts--

42
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,765
or internal--
the secularization of identity.

43
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:59,388
More is now known
about the way this works,

44
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,368
thanks to the body of contributions

45
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:04,873
made by anthropology
over the last century.

46
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:09,819
An awareness of difference,
not as incompleteness

47
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:14,038
as 19th Century evolutionists
naively believed,

48
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:16,621
but as profound exteriority,

49
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:20,280
also constitutes a tool
with which we can gain

50
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,088
a better understanding
of our relation to the world,

51
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:28,571
and avoid destroying the universes
which exist alongside us--

52
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,938
or being destroyed by them.

53
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:36,667
The following maps show
the existence of ethnic divides

54
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,501
at different scales of sub-Saharan Africa.

55
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:43,006
Some of them are very old.

56
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:47,710
Some have been created or revived
in the colonial period.

57
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,424
The third map shows an extreme
but common ethnic fragmentation,

58
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,007
in Ivory Coast.

59
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,761
This configuration
has been used as a resource

60
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:02,277
by the different political actors
in the unrests

61
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:07,502
that stained the country with blood
between 2002 and 2011.

62
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:16,048
The worlds as a field of forces
is the geopolitical model

63
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,995
that is widely used in the analysis
of international relations.

64
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:23,512
Even if this model uses the resources
of the previous one,

65
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,595
it is substantially different from it.

66
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:30,490
The tendency for larger and larger
human groups to coalesce

67
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,800
has been strengthened but also obstructed
by the formation of states,

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,069
which, in various conditions,

69
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:43,711
have managed to capture a significant
share of society's resources.

70
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:46,107
The state, then, appears to be a structure

71
00:04:46,107 --> 00:04:51,249
that is territorially rigid, and either
incorporates non-state groupings,

72
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,018
or adapts to the other states
by brute force,

73
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:58,923
as in the partition of the world
carried out by European states

74
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,307
and their epigones.

75
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:03,738
and fully completed
at the end of the 19th Century,

76
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:07,091
except for the seas and the Antarctic.

77
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:12,101
The term "geopolitical logic" can thus
be applied to all the processes

78
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:17,670
whose focus is on the existence
and territorial integrity of states.

79
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,154
This logic creates configurations
that lead to violence,

80
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:25,245
because each state, real or virtual,

81
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:30,108
tends to increase its power
by keeping or extending its territory--

82
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:32,986
reservoirs of resources, people--

83
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:35,861
which involves confronting its neighbors

84
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:39,996
and neutralizing any paths
towards border changes

85
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:43,157
which might result
in the loss of territory.

86
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:48,514
This widespread non-communication
is manifested

87
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,155
in the existence of as many different ways
of measuring distances

88
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:57,057
as each state is an actor,
independent from any other.

89
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:01,909
As geopolitical atlases show,
every single vision of the world

90
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,205
has its own approach to space,

91
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:07,026
with no common way
of measuring the planet.

92
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:11,044
Hence, there is a great fluidity
in geopolitical situations,

93
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:15,860
with their always-fluctuating
alliances and blocs.

94
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,204
The importance of a place--
which might be a town, or a strait--

95
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:25,129
can change, depending on the use
that is expected of it

96
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:30,232
Thus, the three Kuril Islands
that are at issue

97
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:34,501
in delicate, endless negotiations
between Russia and Japan,

98
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:36,173
are perceived by the former

99
00:06:36,173 --> 00:06:39,209
as a technical element
in a defense scheme,

100
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:43,046
and by the latter -- as a marker
of national identity.

101
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:50,316
Geopolitics, therefore, appears
to be the very antithesis to politics.

102
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:55,580
Because, unless rapidly toppled,
the most savage of despots

103
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,756
has to deal with at least some sectors
of the society they are leading.

104
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,926
For a conqueror, on the other hand,

105
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:08,335
the hypothesis of the massive
destruction of the population

106
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:10,106
is always conceivable,

107
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:13,562
if it at least guarantees
the appropriation of territory,

108
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:17,325
which also has the prospect
of potential wealth.

109
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:24,001
The map that summarizes
the field of forces model is very common.

110
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:27,695
It is the state-based map of the world.

111
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:32,488
In 1996, Samuel Huntington tried to apply
the same rationale

112
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:35,374
to what he called "civilizations".

113
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:38,923
These grouping areas,
based on a combination

114
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,641
of ethnic and religious allegiances,

115
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:46,331
were supposed to show the threats
that the West had to cope with,

116
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:50,189
including, Huntington thought,
preemptive wars.

117
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:53,991
This conservative, aggressive framework

118
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:57,827
sees the exchanges between societies
as a mere zero-sum

119
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:00,837
or even as a negative game.

120
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:06,366
This approach can be criticized
both as simplistic and static,

121
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:10,585
as ignoring the complexity
and the dynamic of societies,

122
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:14,445
and seriously underestimating the
communication flows

123
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:16,565
of the contemporary world.

124
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:20,727
It shows the limits
of the geopolitical model.

125
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,797
The world as a hierarchical network

126
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:27,367
is quite different from the previous case.

127
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:32,375
This model clearly applies to the world
economies described by Fernand Braudel

128
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:37,643
and adapted by Immanuel Wallerstein
to take account of their evolution.

129
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:43,389
What already existed over
a part of the world five centuries ago,

130
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,129
is today experiencing
a remarkable expansion

131
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:50,481
following the unification of the world
by the West,

132
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:54,152
and the integration of the major part
of human production

133
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:58,280
into a unified system of world trade.

134
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,761
This model defines cores,
currently made up of the USA,

135
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:07,121
Europe, Japan, and emerging countries,

136
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:11,221
and peripheries linked to the cores
by dissymmetric flows

137
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:13,946
which maintain the existing
gap with the cores

138
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:16,366
in the exploited peripheries,

139
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:20,583
increase it in the neglected
or abandoned peripheries,

140
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:25,170
or reduce it in the integrated
or annexed peripheries.

141
00:09:26,602 --> 00:09:29,752
What is at stake here is not only
a matter of trade,

142
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:33,349
or even of monetary exchanges,
it applies more generally

143
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:35,481
to what has been called
"development"--

144
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:38,747
that is, a dynamic
in the concerned society

145
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:42,899
which is both multidimensional
and directed towards

146
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,905
what the dominant representations
of this society consider to be progress.

147
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:52,991
The examples of Japan,
then the Asian Tigers, and now China,

148
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:58,048
show that the movements
of the periphery toward the core

149
00:09:58,048 --> 00:10:02,838
do not necessarily suppose a common
definition of what progress is,

150
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:05,485
or a global unification of values.

151
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:08,893
In other words,
the unversality of the system

152
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:16,414
adapts to the existence of cultural areas
(model one) and states (model two).

153
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:18,432
It takes advantage of it,

154
00:10:19,197 --> 00:10:24,049
and the hierarchical differentiation,
as unstable as it is,

155
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:26,454
operates on the scale of a system

156
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:31,688
as a complementarity
that reinforces its stability.

157
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:34,329
In this regard, it is important
to remember

158
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,953
the theoretical misadventure of Max Weber,

159
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:42,231
who believed possible to contend
that the Chinese religions--

160
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:46,174
namely, Confucianism and Taoism--

161
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:49,033
represented unsurmountable obstacles

162
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:53,717
to the emergence
of an entrepreneurial class in China.

163
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:58,058
Today, perhaps with comparable inadequacy,
we have no qualms

164
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,277
about demonstrating the opposite.

165
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:05,647
We are then a long way from a rationale
of territorialized power,

166
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:07,888
and in the case of states,

167
00:11:07,888 --> 00:11:12,379
it is rather a question of networks
made of places,

168
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:16,704
that are equally accessible
by modern transport and communications,

169
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:20,231
where the issue is not to occupy areas,

170
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:25,396
but to activate nodes and links
or to create new ones.

171
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:28,449
The world-space formed in this way

172
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:31,586
does not have the rigidity
of state partitions.

173
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:36,111
Even, it is partly driven
by states and other actors

174
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:41,441
some of whom, the transnational firms,
very powerful.

175
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:45,079
De-territorialization, like the freeing

176
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,233
of the classic constraints of distance,

177
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:52,671
is a notion that is essential
to understanding this system.

178
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:57,826
Nevertheless, this space
is not as abstract and arbitrary

179
00:11:57,826 --> 00:12:03,952
as the speed and size of financial flows
crossing it might suggest.

180
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:08,269
Looked at closely, these flows
do not spread by chance,

181
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:14,897
and even if they are speculative,
they are subject to determining factors--

182
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:18,407
sometimes constraints,
sometimes resources--

183
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:20,601
which impose them their locations.

184
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:25,626
These networks cannot be understood
without taking into account

185
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:29,448
their geographical backgrounds,
including territories,

186
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:34,566
and the system of places
that organizes these territories.

187
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:38,063
The internet is simultaneously
global and local,

188
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:42,576
if we look at its accessibility
and its usages.

189
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:45,664
It is good expression
of this world network,

190
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,850
and a resource for it.

191
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:54,192
The world as a society is basically
a successful combination

192
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:58,475
of the three other models--
collective identity,

193
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:02,687
economic and social integration,
political legitimacy,

194
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:05,823
structure-- at a global level.

195
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,500
This concept appears both so grandiose

196
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,995
and so remote from more sordid realities

197
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:16,218
that one might be tempted
to rank it alongside

198
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:21,313
the more optimistic myth
of humanist eschatology.

199
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:25,458
A dispassionate approach
to contemporary globality,

200
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,206
in any case, leads to the affirmation

201
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:33,341
of at least the partial relevance
of this model.

202
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:35,486
There are in fact global issues.

203
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:42,324
We know that neither nuclear radiations
nor CO2 emissions respect borders.

204
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:45,551
We also know that AIDS or other epidemics

205
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:48,309
represent a new kind of phenomenon,

206
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:52,494
in that they are the result of a global
configuration of ways of life,

207
00:13:52,494 --> 00:13:57,580
and might interfere with global
demographic dynamics.

208
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,604
The question is, to know
whether there is a global way

209
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:03,930
of dealing with global problems.

210
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,764
And yet, it can be said,
at least in certain spheres,

211
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,523
that the answer seems to be positive.

212
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:17,467
Let's take the case of global justice.
Since the Second World War,

213
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:20,648
firstly in a confused way,
then more clearly

214
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:29,192
during the wars in Indochina (1946-1954),
Algeria (1954-1962),

215
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:33,902
and particularly Vietnam (1963-1975),

216
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:38,146
we have seen the emergence
of international public opinion.

217
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:43,174
The origin of this movement
goes back to 1859,

218
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,943
on the battlefield of Solferino,

219
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:49,700
where Henry Dunant,
the founder of the Red Cross,

220
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,584
invented humanitarian consciousness.

221
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:58,567
Another seminal event has been

222
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:03,002
the unexpected creation
by the Nuremberg Court, in 1945,

223
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:07,007
of a first catch
of a global criminal law,

224
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,959
with the notions of genocide
and crimes against humanity,

225
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,530
that definitely trespass states' borders.

226
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:18,828
The responsibility to protect

227
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:21,563
was experimented to prevent a genocide

228
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:25,702
against the Kurdish population, 1991,

229
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:30,891
and validated
by the United Nations in 2005.

230
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:37,342
Finally, after ex-Yugoslavia
and Rwanda's first implementations,

231
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:43,869
the idea of an international criminal 
court, was officially created in 2002.

232
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:47,221
It is now accepted
by large numbers of states.

233
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:52,377
There exists no democratic
global government and global parliament,

234
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:55,906
and the most powerful states
can still impose their rule

235
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:59,391
on many places and on many topics.

236
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,642
However, we have observed
the complete failure

237
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:08,737
of the unilateral US war
in Iraq in 2003-2008.

238
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:13,159
The construction of a world-scale
political legitimacy is not easy,

239
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:18,348
but no plausible alternative is in sight.

240
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:24,051
Although relatively autonomous
from each other,

241
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:27,974
these models interact,
and the following diagram shows

242
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:31,867
how each rationale
can emerge from the others.

243
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:38,140
Thus, the formation of an ethnic,
territorial or religious identity

244
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,604
can create a base for the construction
of an independent state,

245
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:46,562
as it happened in 19th Century Europe.

246
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:50,398
Conversely, the withdrawal
of societal solidarities,

247
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:54,858
and the overwhelming re-emergence
of communal allegiances

248
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:57,380
can lead to the crumbling of the state,

249
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:03,372
like in Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990.

250
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:09,328
Finally, we can read these models in
a diachronic-- that is, historical-- way.

251
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,995
We can consider each explaining model

252
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:15,440
and each layer of the encompassing cake,

253
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,920
whose layout is differentiated
depending on the period analyzed.

254
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:25,762
Some thousands of years ago,
the communal model was clearly dominant,

255
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:30,556
while the 1789-1945 period was marked

256
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:35,256
by the predominance of a geopolitical,
state-centered model.

257
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:38,041
Where are we now?

258
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,474
The hypothesis proposed by this graph

259
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:44,784
is that a world-society model
is slowly emerging,

260
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:51,085
challenging the domination
of an economic-geopolitical couple.

261
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:52,915
In conclusion of this session,

262
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:56,012
we can say that in the current stage
of globalization,

263
00:17:56,012 --> 00:17:59,235
an evolution towards
a full-fledged world society

264
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:02,351
is not guaranteed,
but it's clearly at stake.
