1
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,378To conclude the making process of maps,

2
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:13,482
this last part will address the
question of cartographic “design”.

3
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:16,590This expression aims at
expressing a simple idea:

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,186
The map proposes a singular combination

5
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,211
of a message and an ergonomics.

6
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:24,596
The object design proceeds
in a similar manner,

7
00:00:24,596 --> 00:00:27,944
through the association of
an identity and a functionality.

8
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,742
A chair’s design, for example,

9
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,074
requires an originality of creative
form or an innovative material

10
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:36,906
and the presentation of a comfortable seat.

11
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:39,106A map must be comfortable.

12
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:41,590
A good map is a comfortable device

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,809
to gain access to an idea concerning space.
14
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:46,762The interest of this kind of approach
in cartography also resides

15
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:48,702
in the fact that itoften requires

16
00:00:48,702 --> 00:00:50,848
making geographic thoughts clearer.

17
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:53,458
The act of mapping often
acts in practice

18
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,442to reveal unthought-of issues
in a spatial problem.
19
00:00:57,276 --> 00:01:00,093Cartography is thus the search
for an equilibrium.

20
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,518
It does not exclude beauty, nor the search of aesthetics more generally,

21
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:05,882
a search which must guide the cartographer.

22
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:08,298
It demands of itself a finished
geographical thought

23
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,068
and the search for the right picture,

24
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:12,440
even before the technical and graphical mastery,

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,178
which can also be confided to specialists.

26
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:17,016That to say that the map is, above all,

27
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:19,150
an affair of intuition and creation.28
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:27,082“Open” cartography, of which I have
sketched the broad outlines here,

29
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:29,722
clashes with a cartographic tradition

30
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,342
which tends to impose norms

31
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,956
whose justification is not
always evident,

32
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:36,338
especially concerning what is
traditionally called

33
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:37,994
the « dressing » of maps.

34
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:40,747Certainly, titling a map is
doubtlessly essential.

35
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:42,828However, a legend is not 
always necessary,

36
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:46,879
for certain simple maps can use
the title in place of a legend.

37
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,714As for the scale, it is only
useful in the measure

38
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:53,068
that the instrumental component of the map is sufficiently important,

39
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:55,656
if distances must be measured for example.

40
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:57,174
Be careful about the projection,

41
00:01:57,174 --> 00:02:01,038
which will often change the scales
from one end of the map to another!
42
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,834The prescription of scholarly cartography
the most worthy of criticism

43
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,645
is probably that of mentioning
an orientation, a compass,

44
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,338
or a North arrow.45
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,908Essential to topographical map

46
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:16,498
and useful to a map whose
statement is sun exposure,

47
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:19,954this indication of orientation is
for the most part useless.

48
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:23,046However, in a general way,
this question introduces another:

49
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:25,990
that of cartographcal
implicit understanding.

50
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,742As has been mentioned,
cartography is also a tongue,

51
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:31,610
with its culture, conventions, and grammar.

52
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,078
Conventionally, North is at
the top of a page.

53
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:36,254
It is only indicated if this is not the case,

54
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:38,338
and not placing it at the
top can effectively be

55
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:40,985
part of the cartographic message.

56
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:42,630Since conventions exist,

57
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,656
cartography can count on them.

58
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:47,018
It can partly be constructed upon implicit understanding,

59
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:48,926
and not over-emphasise
recourse to coding,

60
00:02:48,926 --> 00:02:51,230
which is characteristic of very technical

61
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,902
and specialised instrumental maps,

62
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:55,310
and sometimes even rather esoteric maps.63
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:01,822Another subject touching upon
comfort and cartographic ergonomics

64
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:04,240
concerns the basemap.

65
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,802The basemap is in some ways
a layer for propping.

66
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:10,634
It is a common world
for several spaces,

67
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:13,574
a common metric and scale.

68
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:16,336The basemap often appears as
a secondary map,

69
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:18,366
a map which is slipped under the principle map

70
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,114
and aiding its interpretation.

71
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:22,974Nevertheless, this vision is
perhaps a bit too simplistic,

72
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:25,320
for it could be remarked that it is highly probably

73
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,685
that this underlying map could
also considerably modify

74
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:30,542
the sense of the “principle” map.

75
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:33,982In a way, the basemap cannot be
disassociated from the map itself.

76
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:35,915
It is an essential component.

77
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,178
It is not simply a neutral and arbitrary surface

78
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:40,862
on which geographic data are projected.

79
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:43,362It must be treated as
a fully-fledged map,

80
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:47,258
as well as being a means
of expression in itself.

81
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:50,206
It is for example a good means for
identifying a collection of maps,

82
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:52,788
giving them a style (vintage),

83
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:56,466
even breaking with usual codes
by using unconventional colours

84
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:58,810
(the sea in black or red…).85
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,898But can we do without basemap?

86
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:01,990Yes.

87
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:04,164
There exist auto-extensive maps,

88
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:06,804
which form of themselves their own base.

89
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:10,926
Only the locations of places in
relationship to one another count.

90
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:13,606
This kind of map can be read in terms of shapes.

91
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:16,514
They can be compared according
to their general look

92
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:18,534
and their similarities.

93
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:23,066The interest of this kind of map is not
to induce visual groupings

94
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,278
through graphical objects the places
of which they represent are not thought

95
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:29,154
to have a geographical function

96
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:31,760
in the spatial issue represented. 

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,190Representing a map of the cities of
the world without a basemap of continents

98
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,338
can allow, for example, to better discern
the great masses of planetary settlement,

99
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:42,310
and this without being influenced
by continental groupings

100
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,494
or oceanic discontinuities.101
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:55,918To finish, I wish to highlight an
essential point in the act of mapping:

102
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,330
Every map is inserted within a world
of signs which pre-exist it,

103
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,204
and to be effective, every map must take this into account.

104
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:05,506This relationship to the
graphical world of the map

105
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,930
can firstly be found within itself.

106
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,906
It is marked by the style of the map.

107
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:13,538
Whether it is desired or not, whether it be
the result of a voluntary and creative act

108
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:16,506
or the application of predefined 
oftware automatisms,

109
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:19,786every map is endowed with
a certain graphical style.

110
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,354It implicitly answers to
a cartographic charter,

111
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:24,410
even to a graphical charter.

112
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,694The work of the cartographer
does not thus stop

113
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,815
simply at colouring polygons on a sheet of paper.

114
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:33,078
It also consists in mastering
the style of the product,

115
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:36,338
even in developing one’s own style,
a cartographic signature,

116
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:40,114
in a way in which a person’s maps can
all be recognisable as that person’s.

117
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:42,778The remainder depends upon
the professional cartographer’s skill

118
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:45,882
to conform oneself as little as necessary
to the graphical charter which is imposed

119
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:48,131
by the publication environment for the maps.

120
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,786
Even if, otherwise, the cartographic
charter he gives himself

121
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:53,551
can sensibly differ

122
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:57,518
in order not to restrain
his creative capacity.

123
00:05:57,518 --> 00:06:00,138
However, this liberty is all
the easier to conquer

124
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,418
if the cartographer who
proves to be original

125
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:06,042
can claim the status of the author
of a cartographic work.
126
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:09,950The second step in successfully
inserting a map into its environment

127
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,298
concerns its relationships
with its immediate vicinity.

128
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:15,206It is rare for a map to be
presented on its own,

129
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:17,830
alone, without complement, without an editorial environment,

130
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,730
without accompanying text, nor table,

131
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,542
nor even that it accompany something,
and be sufficient on its own.

132
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:26,092The cartographic work at this
level thus consists firstly

133
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:29,998
in fixing a principle for the demarcation of cartographic space.

134
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:32,018
It can be contained within a frame,

135
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,976
in a once again very traditional
and expected manner

136
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,382
according to scholarly cartography.

137
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:38,086
It could to the contrary be conquering

138
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:40,800
and interfere in the interstices
of its environment.

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,254
This is essentially an affairfor negotiation,

140
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:45,850
but definitively marks the
place given to cartography

141
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,892
in a statement about space.

142
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:50,594The second work of cartographer

143
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:53,530
thus also consists in giving
an opinion on the repartitioning of roles

144
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,544
amongst different “media”.

145
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:57,966
The best principle consists
in letting the map say

146
00:06:57,966 --> 00:07:02,588
what it says best, better than
a text or paintings could,

147
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,802
and to the contrary it must renounce mapping

148
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:06,810
that which the properties of other media

149
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,940
could treat with more finesse or dexterity.
150
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,278However, there also exists a third
level of integrating a map

151
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:15,680
into its environment,

152
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,890which is related to its insertion
within a communicational system,

153
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,538
at once both symbolic and material.

154
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,598At the material level, the work of
the cartographer also consists

155
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,057
in knowing the different physical bases for the map.

156
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:30,567
Of course, this includes screens and
their optical characteristics,

157
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,361
but also papers and inks

158
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,543
as well as their ability to render
such-and-such a colour nuance.

159
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:38,549
A map projected onto
a screen is not under

160
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:41,284
the same demands as that printed in a book.

161
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:44,073However, a cartographer is
also partly a “communicator”.

162
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:47,278
That is to say someone who not only knows how to say things

163
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:51,038
but knows to whom to say them, when,
how, in which exact manner,

164
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,214
and especially what not to say,
what may cause a problem.

165
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:57,410
A cartographer also
understands the orders

166
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,514
given to emphasise
such-or-such a space 167
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,870when this order cannot be
obviously stated.168
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,388A cartographer can be a
communications counsellor,

169
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:09,338
even if it means advising not making a map.

170
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,974
This is the case when he thinks
that cartographic media

171
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:14,722
is inappropriate to the role
which it is to be made to play,

172
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:17,938
and ultimately the message
to be conveyed.

173
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,800This happens more often
than might be realised,

174
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,678
for the effect of a truth produced
by the geographic image

175
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:26,058
associated with the necessity
of locating things

176
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:29,198
sometimes obliges the client
to clarify the positions

177
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:33,062
which she would have preferred to
leave aside to verbal imprecision.
178
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:35,717At the end of this conference,
which is presently ending,

179
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:38,058
I would like to insist upon a point which has guided us

180
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,566
all throughout this introduction
to “mapdesign”:

181
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:43,070
The cartography of human spaces

182
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,950
is a human activity.

183
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,282This guiding statement
seems important to me,

184
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:51,808
for it is a necessary condition for the opening up of cartography

185
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:54,614
well beyond the world of
cartographers and specialists,

186
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:56,202
and all the way to geographers.

187
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,200Curiously, as much in their
education as in their practices,

188
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,532
geographers are not always either very interested nor very involved

189
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:04,440
in this technological discipline.

190
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,614
Its richness is however amusing,

191
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,686
and training in it offers
both an exciting study

192
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:11,350
of the statistical processing

193
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,758
and of the history of Art.

194
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,340This open cartography

195
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,102
is also a free cartography.

196
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:19,246
Free to try new images,

197
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:22,062
free to make mistakes, and to lack effectiveness.

198
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,186
However, it is also free in an
essential thing for geography itself:

199
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:29,206
Free to outline new spaces. 

200
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:33,394
For - and this is also one of
the essential points of our statement - ,

201
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:37,806
for many, the map is  to be found in
the definition of spaces in particular,

202
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:40,086
and space in general.

203
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,148
Its renewal is one of the certain means

204
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:45,350
of making progress in geography.
