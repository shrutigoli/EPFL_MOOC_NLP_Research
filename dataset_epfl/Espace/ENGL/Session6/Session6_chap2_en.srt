1
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:11,939
The fundamental link between
geography and cartography

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,154
is none other than  distance.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,533
Geography thinks about distance,
cartography gives it a face.


4
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:19,855
Cartography, as a general rule

5
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:22,255
practiced on planar
or assimilated surfaces,

6
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,690
a sheet of paper,
χάρτης, <i>kartès</i>, in Greek,

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,619
or a screen,

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,365
thus represents distances
through drawings.

9
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,769
Let us take a simple example :

10
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,898
a circle drawn on a page.

11
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:35,859
It is made up of all of the points equidistant from the centre.

12
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:39,275
It is thus well-defined by a distance,
its radius in this case.

13
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:41,831
The centre is located somewhere
on the map,

14
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:44,421
perhaps at a certain distance from other points,

15
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:47,198
or even from other circles
or geometric shapes.

16
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:50,890
In any case, it is located at a certain 
distance from the edges of the page.

17
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,214
The principle of cartography
is to consider

18
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:57,111
that such a circle could be
an adequate representation

19
00:00:57,111 --> 00:00:59,335
of a real or imagined
geographical space.

20
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:02,569
A space defined by a centre
and a distance to this centre,

21
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:06,125
the circle possibly portraying
a border, a city limit,

22
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,597
the interior disc its extent, etc.

23
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:10,974
It is in this way that
a geographic place

24
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:14,580
can be represented by a
cartographic circle, for example.

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,233
This simple analogy is
unfortunately not completely suited

26
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,686
to the representation of geographical space.

27
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:23,394
For, to the contrary of
cartographic space,

28
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:25,406
that is to say to that of a sheet of paper,

29
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:27,829
a geographical space is not
entirely “Euclidean”.

30
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,403
It may happen that the shortest
route from one place to another

31
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:32,098
is <i>not</i> a straight line,

32
00:01:32,098 --> 00:01:35,351
or that the travel time of a trip may differ
according to its shape or its direction.

33
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:38,750
Cartographic metrics, that is to say
the way of measuring distance

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,648
on a map is thus a poor, unequivocal metric,

35
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:43,594
compared to the richness of metrics

36
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:45,894
structuring a real geographical space.

37
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:51,031
Cartographical work is thus partly
made up of finding a compromise

38
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,537
between the Euclidean positions of
the places represented,


39
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:56,595
in brief their location in relation
to the map’s framework,

40
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:58,905
and their location in
relationship to one another,

41
00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:01,795
taking account of every distance involved

42
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:03,844
and which no drawing can render.43
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:08,482The second limit to the cartographic
expression of geographic reality

44
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:10,351
touches upon scale.

45
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,796A map is mono-scalar overall,

46
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:14,609
whereas every space is characterised

47
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:17,011
by what I will call a scalar spectrum.

48
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,618That is to say a reduced
ensemble of distance values

49
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:23,233
which are more represented there than others.

50
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:26,908
This constitutes in some measure
its spatial signature.51
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:30,374However, the usual
cartographical principle

52
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:34,303
is that of a unequivocal rule of correspondance valid in any point,

53
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:36,122
between a distance on the ground

54
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,541
and its representation on the map.

55
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:41,816Even if this principle is not
respected in many maps,

56
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:44,549
first because of the 
cartographic projection,

57
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:47,653
it remains that the cartography
considerably impoverishes

58
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:50,800
the representation of a space
as soon as he has to sooner or later

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,542
choose a certain size for geographical objects

60
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:57,561
within the spaces which have geographical
objects of different sizes.

61
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:00,289For example, on a traditional map

62
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:02,833
the circumscriptions of urban and
rural voting offices

63
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,057
cannot both be represented together,

64
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:07,661
for the scalar spectrum of
the voting office’s space 

65
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,029carries two scales,

66
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:10,850
one which is urban
and the other rural,

67
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,147
small for the former,
and large for the latter.68
00:03:14,837 --> 00:03:18,904In any case, the practice of
cartography in many cases

69
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:21,814
leads to making a radical choice by transforming metrics,

70
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:25,808
by losing the ability to measure
kilometric distances

71
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:27,771
between cartographical objects

72
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:31,345
to the contrary trying to produce
shape-types and simple images

73
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,408of spaces, such as zones
or hamlets, for example.

74
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:35,791In technical terms,

75
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,774
it thus means weakening
the singular component of maps,

76
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:41,367
and weakening the representation
of the <i>geon</i>

77
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:44,509
in order to arrive at a figuration
preferring <i>geotypes</i>,

78
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:48,094
that is to say visual forms of
the organisation of cartographic space,

79
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,831comparable among themselves,
and similar to standard shapes

80
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,512
or models of organisation
of geographical space,

81
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:56,269
such as the centre-periphery model,
for example.82
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,539The arbitration between
geon and geotype

83
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,650
is at the heart of cartographic work.

84
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,523A map is not an aerial photo
or a satellite image,

85
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:10,506
any more than a painting is
similar to a photograph.

86
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:13,654
It is not a work capturing reality,

87
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,413
but rather progressively
constructing an image,

88
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:21,366
element by element, layer by layer,
“touch”after“touch”.

89
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:24,632The map is not a simplification
of reality.

90
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:26,141
It is to the contrary the result

91
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,539
of a progressive accumulation
of graphical elements

92
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:31,040
leading to a more-or-less
complex image.

93
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,293
However, more often,
these graphical elements

94
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:36,527
proceed from an initial simplification of principles,

95
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:40,860
so that their combination does not too
rapidly result in an unreadable image.

96
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,918These elementary objects thus tend

97
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,872
to express geotypical part
of geographical space.

98
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:51,978
It is their combination which results
in the expression of a geon,

99
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:53,281
the singularity of space.

100
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:58,862For example, for the four types
of geographical spaces,

101
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:01,790
two manners each of representing them

102
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,629
in an archetypical manner
could be proposed.

103
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,491
A primary form and a secondary
form could be proposed.

104
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:08,905
An envelope and a framed content

105
00:05:08,905 --> 00:05:12,407
could be proposed
for the « territory »,

106
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:16,819
a punctual level and an areal
gradient for the « horizon »,

107
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:20,939situations and links
for the « rhizome »,

108
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:26,385
and connections and nodes
for the « network ».
109
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:28,507Creating a map thus implies using

110
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:33,289
a certain number of elementary
geographical concepts – the geotypes - 

111
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:37,636
which can be expressed with the help of signs
which are, themselves, relatively simple.

112
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:40,131In the graphical domain,
we may mention

113
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,751
the Egyptian hieroglyph for “city”.

114
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:45,438
It is a cross within a circle.

115
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:48,458
The underlying spatial
concepts are obvious.

116
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:52,358The cross, made of two lines,
symbolises a road-crossing.

117
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:55,839The city is truly a crossroads,
and not merely commercial,

118
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,430
and a meeting-point.

119
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:01,238It is moreover demarcated
within space by a boundary,

120
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:02,823
which may be fortified,

121
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:05,538
or it may more simply form a territory,

122
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:08,488
which is signified by the circle.

123
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:11,894It can easily be understood
how these few lines can establish

124
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:15,711
a fairly solid link between
the spatial idea and a graphic.
125
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:20,441However it is also interesting
to study the visual symbolism of space

126
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,777
through systems of expression which are

127
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:26,460
real sign-languages,
with their own cultures,

128
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,705
such as the national
sign-languages

129
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:32,087
used by the deaf and
hearing-impaired.
130
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:35,655The expressive variations of
the notion of territory, network,

131
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:37,350
cities, or even rhizome 132
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,969allow the variety of possible
visual expressions

133
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:43,132
for a spatial idea to be understood,
as can be seen.

134
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,834
However, they also allow
this variety to be understood

135
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,323
as a cultural difference

136
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,321
and to foresee connotation processes

137
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:51,344
which must be taken into
account in cartography.138
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:15,038A characteristic of contemporary
geographic thought

139
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,021
is distinguishing spaces
and spatialities.

140
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,718
Spaces are complex realities,

141
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:24,968
aggregates, the study of which could be called synthetic geography,

142
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:29,658
and which are the objects which
cartography best knows how to represent.

143
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,885Spatialities are to
the contrary aptitudes, skills,

144
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,894
and capacities, relationships with space,

145
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:36,930
and localised actions.

146
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,824
They are the subjects
of analytical geography.

147
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,290
These are the things which cartography
has much difficulty in representing,

148
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,025
for it is necessarily synthetic and direct

149
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,839
from the fact of
its graphical nature.150
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:50,888In reality, the map
represents spatialities

151
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:54,297
through the intermediary
of correspondences with spaces.

152
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:57,553
This system of correspondences
has been theorised

153
00:07:57,553 --> 00:08:00,998
by spatial intelligence in the “spatial balance” model.

154
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:04,259
It identifies spaces to spatial assets

155
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,310
and spatialities
to liabilities.156
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,538Like in a financial
balance sheet,

157
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:12,970
spatial assets are organised
by increasing liquidity:

158
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,009territories, horizons,
rhizomes and networks.

159
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:20,286
Spatialities: city-ness, mobility,
and connectivity, for example,

160
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:23,533
are organised by increasing
degree of social intermediation.

161
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,753It is this theoretical
and structural order

162
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:28,293
which allows a space and its
dominant spatialities

163
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:30,421
to be simultaneously
shown cartographically.

164
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,996However the expressive
leeways can also be freed

165
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:37,959
by “vertically” shifting the correspondence
between spaces and spatialities,

166
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,575
that is to say between liquidity
and intermediation.

167
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:43,955For example, in order
to map a network,

168
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:47,083
it is enough to preferably
retain its territorial component,

168
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:47,083
as this map of the rail transportation
network for Ile-de-France shows.

170
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:53,359
It displays a network
accessibility indicator

171
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,528
at every point of the territory.

172
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:58,731This “territorialization” of
the rail network then allows

173
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:01,086
another network to be shown

174
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:02,542
under the classical
form of a trellis,

175
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,461
and to thus compare the two spaces,

176
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,125
whereas the superpositioning
of two irregular “grids”

177
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,219
would have rendered
the map unreadable, 

178
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:12,598neither of the two forms
being salient to the other.179
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,949There remains a limit which seems
to greatly affect cartography,

180
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:22,047
which is the representation
of urban spaces.

181
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:25,038In fact, a map by its
geometric nature

182
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:28,141
encourages the representation
of spreading, 

183
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:31,375continuous, homogenous, stable,
unvarying, flat spaces.

184
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,425
This is generally the contrary of urban space,

185
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,775
which is dense,
diverse, mixed,

186
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:40,100
and presents some variability,
which is moreover arbitrary.

187
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:42,646Must we then abandon the map

188
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,965
to represent the geography
of the city ?189
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,531A sort of answer can be found
in subway maps,

190
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:51,384
especially when they
are very effective.

191
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:53,517
In practice, subway maps

192
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:56,609
condition the reality,
the functioning,

193
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:59,913
the subdivision into neighbourhoods,
and the names (after the station names)

194
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:02,703
of urban space in its entirety
in an important way.

195
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:05,630
What is more, in a city endowed
with a very good subway network,

196
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,796
the metric of space
is certainly patchy,

197
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:11,100
but Euclidean overall, with
a scalar spectrum with two levels:

198
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,314
that of a network in its ensemble,
where speeds are constant,

199
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:18,070
and that of neighbourhoods with
foot traffic, also at a constant speed.200
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,921Thus everything is going on in the background
as if the city had been produced

201
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,138
as a territory by its map.

202
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:27,004
Instead of being the map
which attempts

203
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:29,849
to reproduce the reticular
spatialities of mobility

204
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:32,582
at the heart of the metropolitan network,
sometimes well and sometimes badly.

205
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:35,369The theoretical idea of a
fundamentally non-Euclidean city

206
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,897
thus loses its interest
if we change perspectives

207
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:41,098
by considering that the correspondence
between the map and geography, 

208
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,485
between representation
and reality

209
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:46,663
is in fact the same as
an active reality of society.210
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,717Consequently, cartography
truly appears as it is:

211
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,097
the expression of
an intention about space.

212
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:59,121
Far from a simple recording,
cartographic work

213
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:01,826
must begin firstly by
a sketch.

214
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:03,879
That is to say by a 
rough drawing of the space

215
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,044
such as it is thought that
it could be represented,

216
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:08,434
with the help of some
simple elements calling upon

217
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,486
identifiable geographical concepts.

218
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:13,421Then only comes the work

219
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:15,472
of collecting
geographical information

220
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:16,975
allowing to
“flesh out” a map

221
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:19,919
illustrating the related idea
and based on proven facts.
