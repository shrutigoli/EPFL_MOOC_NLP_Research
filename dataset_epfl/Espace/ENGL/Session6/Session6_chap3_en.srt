1
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:10,435
Most objects which are the matter
for geographic reflection

2
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:12,707
are only summarily situated,

3
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:14,390
or in an implicit manner,

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,051
often leaving the concrete modalities
of this location unresolved.

5
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:20,696As for cartography,

6
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:22,408
it gives itself the right
to decide upon a location,

7
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:26,359
or more precisely a mode of location
within the Euclidean space of the map.

8
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:29,400
More plainly, on the map.

9
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:32,231Space once again becomes a base,

10
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:34,302
a limiting idea for geography,

11
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:37,028
and which it has taken
much time to undo.

12
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:40,961Thus, the places of cartographic
space must have coordinates.
13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,900Not only must objects’ positions

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,939
be decided upon, but also their shapes,
more-or-less complex shapes,

15
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:48,198
but planar: polygonal,
in a network,

16
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:50,036
simple points, and lines.17
00:00:50,173 --> 00:00:52,640A cartographic place is
thus always the result

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,930
of an initial arbitration
as to its graphical form,

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,280
and we have seen that
this form could be defined

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,792
by a type of reference space
and its properties.

21
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:04,947Thus, there always remains a residual
error to location in cartography.

22
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:07,123
When a city is 
resumed to a point,

23
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:09,207
a county to its geometric centroid,

24
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:12,529
or to the contrary, that which is less
often perceived as an error in location

25
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:14,840
but which remains an
important approximation,

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,831
when a punctual measurement
is attributed

27
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:18,620
to a polygonal space.

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,133Within the framework of
a cartographic reading,

29
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,846
one single rule applies:

30
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:26,018
every piece of information related
to a point is supposed to be “local”,

31
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,681
that is to say valid for this point
and its immediate neighbourhood,

32
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:32,921
and loses its relevancy the
farther away one distances oneself.

33
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:37,080As per need, graphical separations

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,172
such as administrative borders can be
used to define this neighbourhood.

35
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:43,379
However it is often an artifice
which complicates the map’s reading,

36
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:44,483
even to the point of
being parasitical.

37
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:46,902Moreover, the geographic coordinates

38
00:01:46,902 --> 00:01:4
of a spatial reality on
a terrestrial globe,

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,465
and the distances separating it
from another reality

40
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:55,700
can be very different once
the terrestrial surface is flattened

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,921
by the operation called
<i>projection</i>.

42
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:01,315
Projection allows
a map to be drawn

43
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:05,141
over a planar base, when the geographic
reference space is not planar,

44
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,067
since it is the surface of a globe.

45
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:10,669As you could verify it with the help
of the instrument at your disposal,

46
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,304
these projections are innumerable.

47
00:02:13,304 --> 00:02:15,513
By transforming coordinates originally

48
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:17,391
given in longitude and latitude,

49
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,740
according to meridians and parallels,
and into rectangular coordinates,

50
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,134
that is to say relative
to the edges of a map,

51
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:26,599
the neighbourhood can be recomposed
in a very unexpected manner.

52
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,155These deformations can be
a source of creativity.

53
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:31,418
Used wisely,

54
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,578
they can reinforce a geographic
idea by a simple image,

55
00:02:34,578 --> 00:02:36,198
made of alignments for example.56
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:42,247In reality, cartographic location
is an integral part of the work

57
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,071
of cartographic conception.

58
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:47,360
It is not only concerned with the choice
of the geometric shapes of places,

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,858nor of their projections.

60
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:51,443Projections can certainly
respect areas,

61
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,092
and then it is called
an equal-area projection.

62
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:54,885
It can also respect local shapes,

63
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:56,484
but not over a long distance,

64
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:57,908
and that is called
a conformal projection.

65
00:02:57,908 --> 00:02:59,508
However the two are not
possible at the same time.

66
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:02,489
Projections which do not respect anything,
called aphylactic projections,

67
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,549
can provide very appropriate
location bases

68
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,118
for the geographic 
messages of the map.

69
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:11,065
This is the case for
Buckminster Fuller’s projection,

70
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,203
which displays
the world as an island,

71
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:15,704
that of a unified
human species.72
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:17,510We could go much further

73
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,795
into the configuration
of cartographic reference.

74
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:21,838
It is more and more
common today

75
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:23,580
to have recourse
to anamorphosis.

76
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,402
They allow the map
to be deformed

77
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:27,421
in a way to give
more visibility

78
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:30,378
to spaces which are the most
important to the map’s theme,

79
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,565
the most populated
areas for example.

80
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:37,723The maps drawn on these kinds of
bases are called <i>cartograms</i>.

81
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:41,192
By increasing or decreasing
the size of territorial units

82
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:43,951
in proportion to the
population of voting age,

83
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:46,400anamorphosis “according
to population” for example

84
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
allow a weight to be given equivalent
to the inhabitants of a county

85
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,269
in electoral cartography.

86
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:57,000
A person equals one vote equals
a fixed area on the cartogram.

87
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:58,943
By default, on a traditional map,

88
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:01,397
the votes in rural places
and places lacking density

89
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:03,146
seem to dominate the map.90
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,167By generalising the
process yet further,

91
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,680
we could construct
inverted cartograms,

92
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,767
which could be called
“anti-cartograms”,

93
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,866
for example by using
an anamorphosis

94
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,981
inversely proportional
to the population.

95
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:18,817
The resulting map displays
a filamented structure,

 96
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:21,707taking up the great axes
of settlement pattern,

97
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:23,451
the opposite of
a classical cartogram,

98
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:26,580which to the contrary juxtaposes
bubbles at the spot where cities are,

99
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,380
but almost makes
intermediate spaces

100
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,072
and the inter-urban relationships
which they compete to disseminate.

101
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:38,396If the two cartograms are associated
to a traditional Euclidean map,

102
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,671
the latter could be equated
to cartogram according to area.

103
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,362
The ensemble forms a triptych

104
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:47,586
in fact enlightening what
I call the three phases of space:

105
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,892
the co-presence phase
for the cartogram,

106
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:51,967
focusing on urban spatialities ;

107
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:55,116
the circulatory phase
for the anti-cartogram, 108
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:58,097focusing on the spatialities
of mobility;

109
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,05
and logically the
tele-communicational phase

110
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,229for the traditional Euclidean map,

111
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,852
since for this kind of map

112
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:08,160
no deformation seeks to reduce the connective spatialities

113
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,742
normally being substituted
for co-presence

114
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:12,064
or circulation.115
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:16,980Often disregarded
by cartographers,

116
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,719
very simple maps
such as tourist maps

117
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,451
or subway maps are however examples
of cartographic effectiveness.

118
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,185
Cartographic places are fabricated

119
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:29,475
by the means of a figurative image
or a symbol perhaps indicating

120
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,160
their distinctive qualities,

121
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,880
such as the activities are proposed,

122
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,304
their function or the weather.

123
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,321These maps are not meant
to be studied as a whole,

124
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:43,257
to analyse the overall structure
of space for example.

125
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:45,030
However they remain efficient

126
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,790
for comparing places one to another,

127
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,583
measuring their remotness,

128
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,669
or even planning an itinerary.
129
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:55,620Provided that sufficient localised information
is available, which is often digital,


130
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,670
it is however possible to draw maps
according to statistical bases.

131
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:04,226
For example, the size of a figurative image

132
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:07,108
representing a place in relation
to its population could be varied.

133
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,519Many geo-statistical techniques today

134
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:13,100
allow maps with continuous colour
nuances to be created,

135
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,291
often revealing the deep
structures of a territory

136
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,146
in a very efficient or
even attractive way.

137
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:21,512
Its demographic dynamic
regarding fertility for example.
138
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:24,854A branch of quantitative cartography

139
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:27,526
has focused on statistical concepts

140
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:29,340
to develop techniques

141
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,874
allowing graphical contrasts

142
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:34,776
within a map to be better controlled
in a way as to make them clearer,

143
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:37,501
and to produce sharper maps.
This can be done for example by contrasting

144
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,670
two or three place categories
based on their characteristics

145
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,504
which are however much more varied.

146
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,895These methods, called
<i>discretisation</i>,

147
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:48,100
answer to two distinct

148
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,960
and sometimes contradictory logics.

149
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:53,764
The first one consists in distinguishing
the statistical values characteristic

150
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:57,511
of places according to thresholds
which are significant

151
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:59,288
according to the map’s theme.

152
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:01,360
Places on the map can thus be ordered

153
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,352
into classes defined
by these thresholds,

154
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:06,465
for example the threshold would be
the majority in an election

155
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:10,390
or zero degrees Celsius
for frozen areas.

156
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:14,881Another logic consists in calculating
the cut-off thresholds 

157
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:18,273
based on the statistical data
themselves for all places,

158
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:22,876
allowing either a maximal
differentiation of space

159
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,999
- the median is thus used -,

160
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:28,691
and making maps on different
themes easily comparable,

161
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:32,077
or a location of each place
into a scale of existing values

162
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,744
- thus the average and
standard deviation are used.

163
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:37,840It is certainly a technical approach,

164
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,248
requiring specific skills

165
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:42,360
and a sensitivity to biases

166
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,016and the particularities of
statistical manipulations.

167
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,581
However once mastered, it can be understood
that the real issues in cartography

168
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,230
are not about these techniques.

169
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,119An instrument will allow you
to test different discretisations

170
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,374
for the cartography of two indicators

171
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:59,819
whose geography is very different.172
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,671The treatments which
I have just addressed

173
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:08,658
are widely practiced today
with the help of software.

174
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:12,497
There certainly exists software
specific to cartography.

175
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:15,960
However, until now the trend has rather
been for an increasing disassociation

176
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,130
between pre-treatment,

177
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,467
carried out by what is called
<i>geographic information systems</i>

178
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,315
- GIS, SIG in French - , 

179
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:26,274allowing for the creation of
raw cartographic layers,

180
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:29,664
and vectorial drawing software used downstream,

181
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:32,645
carried out by specialised
cartographers and graphic artists

182
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,971
to end up with editorial-quality maps.

183
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,303GIS can also suffice for the creation

184
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:41,848
of maps which are relatively
less elaborate graphically.

185
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:44,321
However, cartography practiced
beyond a certain level

186
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,807
and beyond the exploratory stage

187
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:49,930
cannot do without real
work on the image,

188
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,891
requiring appropriate instruments,

189
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:54,214
but also and especially

190
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:56,797
specific skills, close to design work

191
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,999
and fairlyd istant from
computer programming.192
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,532For their part, GIS are
none other than

193
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:04,376
information systems devoted
to spatial information.

194
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,371
They are thus based
on a database system,

195
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:10,538
in general made to store
elaborate geographic information

196
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:13,095
allowing for a description
of complex spaces.

197
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,044
For example spaces with
holes or discontinuities,

198
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:17,937
territories with lakes,

199
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:20,982
or networks where the direction of traffic
must be recorded could be evoked.

200
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,254As to its storage capacities,

201
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:26,437
GIS add calculation modules

202
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:28,893
which are made to treat
geographic information.

203
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:32,1
For example, they allow distances
and areas to be calculated,

204
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:35,198or for polygons to be cut
using a network, etc.

205
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:39,336The main advantage of GIS
for cartography is to unify

206
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:41,773
geographic information into
a normal framework

207
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:44,508
at the heart of which
can be developed standards

208
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:47,021
facilitating a sharing
of information.
209
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:50,001Efficient, free,
and freely-available GIS

210
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,994
are now being developed.

211
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:53,862
It is only to be expected

212
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:56,890
that cartographic modules of an
increasing quality will improve them,

213
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,214allowing cartographic expression to go
further with only these instruments,

214
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:02,513
which at the beginning were
very much for programmers only.

215
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,381Let us add that the opening
of these software platforms

216
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:07,539
designate them as choice
instruments for the research

217
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,205
and development of
spatial intelligence

218
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:10,511
or in applied geography.

219
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,940
They in fact allow
the practical validity

220
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,591
of new theoretical concepts
to be tested,

221
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:17,378
such as that of scalar spectrum
for example.222
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,301However, the cartographic process
does not stop at the creation

223
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:28,918
of thematic layers such as
administrative boundaries,

224
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:31,694
built space, roads, demographic
or economic data,

225
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:33,901layers which could then
be superimposed

226
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,626
to create a finished
and effective map.227
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,761I would even say that the real issue
of the relationship between

228
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:43,410
cartography and geography consists
in the art of this combination.

229
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,032Cartographic mediology is
the ensemble of graphic techniques

230
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:49,031
specific to the objects which are maps,

231
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:52,532
techniques which allow a maximisation
of the range of expression

232
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:55,130
for spatial ideas through design.

233
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,638Starting from a modulated
superpositioning

234
00:10:57,638 --> 00:10:59,905
of crude spatialised
information layers,

235
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:03,365
it means making a patchwork
or a juxtaposition of plates.

236
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:05,790
Each will then correspond to a geographical place

237
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,363
and return the image’s content

238
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:09,663
into the register of geography and its concepts.
