The fundamental link between geography and cartography is none other than  distance.
Geography thinks about distance, cartography gives it a face.
Cartography, as a general rule practiced on planar or assimilated surfaces, a sheet of paper,
Ï‡Î¬Ï�Ï„Î·Ï‚, <i>kartÃ¨s</i>, in Greek, or a screen, thus represents distances through drawings.
Let us take a simple example : a circle drawn on a page.
It is made up of all of the points equidistant from the centre.
It is thus well-defined by a distance, its radius in this case.
The centre is located somewhere on the map, perhaps at a certain distance from other points, or even from other circles or geometric shapes.
In any case, it is located at a certain distance from the edges of the page.
The principle of cartography is to consider that such a circle could be an adequate representation of a real or imagined geographical space.
A space defined by a centre and a distance to this centre, the circle possibly portraying a border, a city limit, the interior disc its extent, etc.
It is in this way that a geographic place can be represented by a cartographic circle, for example.
This simple analogy is unfortunately not completely suited to the representation of geographical space.
For, to the contrary of cartographic space, that is to say to that of a sheet of paper, a geographical space is not entirely â€œEuclideanâ€�.
It may happen that the shortest route from one place to another is <i>not</i> a straight line, or that the travel time of a trip may differ according to its shape or its direction.
Cartographic metrics, that is to say the way of measuring distance on a map is thus a poor, unequivocal metric, compared to the richness of metrics structuring a real geographical space.
Cartographical work is thus partly made up of finding a compromise between the 
Euclidean positions of the places represented, in brief their location in relation to the mapâ€™s framework, and their location in relationship to one another, taking account of every distance involved and which no drawing can render.
The second limit to the cartographic expression of geographic reality touches upon scale.
A map is mono-scalar overall, whereas every space is characterised by what I will call a scalar spectrum.
That is to say a reduced ensemble of distance values which are more represented there than others.
This constitutes in some measure its spatial signature.
However, the usual cartographical principle is that of a unequivocal rule of correspondance valid in any point, between a distance on the ground and its representation on the map.
Even if this principle is not respected in many maps, first because of the cartographic projection, it remains that the cartography considerably impoverishes the representation of a space as soon as he has to sooner or later choose a certain size for geographical objects within the spaces which have geographical objects of different sizes.
For example, on a traditional map the circumscriptions of urban and rural voting offices cannot both be represented together, for the scalar spectrum of the voting officeâ€™s space carries two scales, one which is urban and the other rural, small for the former, and large for the latter.
In any case, the practice of cartography in many cases leads to making a radical choice by transforming metrics, by losing the ability to measure kilometric distances between cartographical objects to the contrary trying to produce shape-types and simple images of spaces, such as zones or hamlets, for example.
In technical terms, it thus means weakening the singular component of maps, and weakening the representation of the <i>geon</i> in order to arrive at a figuration preferring <i>geotypes</i>, that is to say visual forms of the organisation of cartographic space, comparable among themselves, and similar to standard shapes or models of organisation of geographical space, such as the centre-periphery model, for example.
The arbitration between geon and geotype is at the heart of cartographic work.
A map is not an aerial photo or a satellite image, any more than a painting is similar to a photograph.
It is not a work capturing reality, but rather progressively constructing an image, element by element, layer by layer, â€œtouchâ€�afterâ€œtouchâ€�.
The map is not a simplification of reality.
It is to the contrary the result of a progressive accumulation of graphical elements leading to a more-or-less complex image.
However, more often, these graphical elements proceed from an initial simplification of principles, so that their combination does not too rapidly result in an unreadable image.
These elementary objects thus tend to express geotypical part of geographical space.
It is their combination which results in the expression of a geon, the singularity of space.
For example, for the four types of geographical spaces, two manners each of representing them in an archetypical manner could be proposed.
A primary form and a secondary form could be proposed.
An envelope and a framed content could be proposed for the Â«Â territoryÂ Â», a punctual level and an areal gradient for the Â«Â horizonÂ Â», situations and links for the Â«Â rhizomeÂ Â», and connections and nodes for the Â«Â networkÂ Â».
Creating a map thus implies using a certain number of elementary geographical concepts â€“ the geotypes - which can be expressed with the help of signs which are, themselves, relatively simple.
In the graphical domain, we may mention the Egyptian hieroglyph for â€œcityâ€�.
It is a cross within a circle.
The underlying spatial concepts are obvious.
The cross, made of two lines, symbolises a road-crossing.
The city is truly a crossroads, and not merely commercial, and a meeting-point.
It is moreover demarcated within space by a boundary, which may be fortified, or it may more simply form a territory, which is signified by the circle.
It can easily be understood how these few lines can establish a fairly solid link between the spatial idea and a graphic.
However it is also interesting to study the visual symbolism of space through systems of expression which are real sign-languages, with their own cultures, such as the national sign-languages used by the deaf and hearing-impaired.
The expressive variations of the notion of territory, network, cities, or even rhizome allow the variety of possible visual expressions for a spatial idea to be understood, as can be seen.
However, they also allow this variety to be understood as a cultural difference and to foresee connotation processes which must be taken into account in cartography.
A characteristic of contemporary geographic thought is distinguishing spaces and spatialities.
Spaces are complex realities, aggregates, the study of which could be called synthetic geography, and which are the objects which cartography best knows how to represent.
Spatialities are to the contrary aptitudes, skills, and capacities, relationships with space, and localised actions.
They are the subjects of analytical geography.
These are the things which cartography has much difficulty in representing, for it is necessarily synthetic and direct from the fact of its graphical nature.
In reality, the map represents spatialities through the intermediary of correspondences with spaces.
This system of correspondences has been theorised by spatial intelligence in the â€œspatial balanceâ€� model.
It identifies spaces to spatial assets and spatialities to liabilities.
Like in a financial balance sheet, spatial assets are organised by increasing liquidity: territories, horizons, rhizomes and networks.
Spatialities: city-ness, mobility, and connectivity, for example, are organised by increasing degree of social intermediation.
It is this theoretical and structural order which allows a space and its dominant spatialities to be simultaneously shown cartographically.
However the expressive leeways can also be freed by â€œverticallyâ€� shifting the correspondence between spaces and spatialities, that is to say between liquidity and intermediation.
For example, in order to map a network, it is enough to preferably retain its territorial component, as this map of the rail transportation network for Ile-de-France shows.
It displays a network accessibility indicator at every point of the territory.
This â€œterritorializationâ€� of the rail network then allows another network to be shown under the classical form of a trellis, and to thus compare the two spaces, whereas the superpositioning of two irregular â€œgridsâ€� would have rendered the map unreadable, neither of the two forms being salient to the other.
There remains a limit which seems to greatly affect cartography, which is the representation of urban spaces.
In fact, a map by its geometric nature encourages the representation of spreading, continuous, homogenous, stable, unvarying, flat spaces.
This is generally the contrary of urban space, which is dense, diverse, mixed, and presents some variability, which is moreover arbitrary.
Must we then abandon the map to represent the geography of the city ?
A sort of answer can be found in subway maps, especially when they are very effective.
In practice, subway maps condition the reality, the functioning, the subdivision into neighbourhoods, and the names (after the station names) of urban space in its entirety in an important way.
What is more, in a city endowed with a very good subway network, the metric of space is certainly patchy, but Euclidean overall, with a scalar spectrum with two levels: that of a network in its ensemble, where speeds are constant, and that of neighbourhoods with foot traffic, also at a constant speed.
Thus everything is going on in the background as if the city had been produced as a territory by its map.
Instead of being the map which attempts to reproduce the reticular spatialities of mobility at the heart of the metropolitan network, sometimes well and sometimes badly.
The theoretical idea of a fundamentally non-Euclidean city thus loses its interest if we change perspectives by considering that the correspondence between the map and geography, between representation and reality is in fact the same as an active reality of society.
Consequently, cartography truly appears as it is: the expression of an intention about space.
Far from a simple recording, cartographic work must begin firstly by a sketch.
That is to say by a rough drawing of the space such as it is thought that it could be represented, with the help of some simple elements calling upon identifiable geographical concepts.
Then only comes the work of collecting geographical information allowing to â€œflesh outâ€� a map illustrating the related idea and based on proven facts.
