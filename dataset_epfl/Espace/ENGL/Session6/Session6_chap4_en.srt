1
00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:04,267

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:06,417

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,780To guide a map’s conception,
a hypothesis

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,900
could be made about
the manner of reading it.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,410
Let us grant that
a map’s reading proceeds

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,850
through a series of eye motions
where it zooms in and out.7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,080Thus a cartographer’s job
could be conceived as that

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,520
of conditioning the back-and-forth
motions of the eye by the image itself,

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,000
and this in a manner so that the eye successively identifies

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,530
visual objects which it will
associate with places.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,450
These places will create the backbone
of the geographic statement,

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,180
and the examination of their relationships on the map
will allow for the development of this statement.

13
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:42,173Thus the reader must be presented
with sorts of visual “stops”

14
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:45,853
upon which the eye can rest.
In addition, every visual element

15
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:49,343
which could interfere with the image must be eliminated as much as possible.

16
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:53,422
Visual <i>noise</i> must be eliminated
to only keep the music of the map.

17
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:56,075Let it also be noted that
a model of reading

18
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:59,695
which plays upon objects’ scales through the zooming of sight is preferred.

19
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:03,614
For contrarily to seeing
a figurative image such as a photo

20
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,904
or a painting, objects which
must be shown,

21
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:08,444
thus the geographic places displayed on the map,

22
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:12,104
are often of novel and unknown forms,
and of a very diverse size.

23
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:15,104
It is less often about
recognising a form,

24
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:18,514
such as a face, a tree, or a person,

25
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:20,608
as discovering and memorising
abstract elements.26
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:23,718In response to this challenge,

27
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,928
the cartographic theory presented here
means to be simple,

28
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:28,745
global, and open.

29
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:31,745
It is based on a play of
four “components”:

30
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:35,875
shape, size, colour,
and visual effects.

31
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:40,613It does not seek to guarantee the absolute
validity of the cartographic options.

32
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:45,408
In general, this has as an effect
greatly limiting imaginable solutions.

33
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:49,559
To the contrary, it encourages creativity,
innovation, and even unorthodox solutions

34
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:52,779
from the point-of-view of more
traditional cartographic theories.

35
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:56,428Let us recall that this approach
considers that the map’s validity

36
00:01:56,428 --> 00:02:00,328
can in any case only be judged at the end,
based on its efficiency

37
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,328
in regards to its communicational project, and not in respect

38
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:06,548
to abstract recipes applied in
a scholarly fashion

39
00:02:06,548 --> 00:02:08,548
during the entire process of its creation.40
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:13,498The idea of shape is fundamental
to that of information.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,650
That which has a specific shape vehicles information,

42
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,790
to the contrary of
that which has none.

43
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:21,737A shape can be seen as
a collection of angles.

44
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:24,927
Let us take for example
two triangles.

45
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:28,097They really differ in shape only if
the angles composing them are different.

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,604
If not, they cannot be distinguished
one from the other apart from their size.

47
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:36,051Playing upon shape in cartography
can serve to differentiate

48
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:39,631
geographic objects, at least 
for certain spatial configurations.

49
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:43,261
However, it is firstly and above all
a means of defining an arbitration

50
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:47,261
between the geonic component and
the geotype component of a space.

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,900Thus, very simply, representing
cities of a country

52
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,330
by similar disks is a way of cancelling

53
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,860
their geographic singularity
in large part

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,970
to keep only the relative location

55
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,980in relationship to other cities.

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,670In exchange, each of these places
is identifiable to the others.

57
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,250
Each constitutes an instance of a geotype which
can be called

58
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:09,105
“a city” in this country.59
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:13,892More generally,
using geometric symbols,

60
00:03:13,892 --> 00:03:16,204
parallel lines,
or other simple

61
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:20,204
and repetitive shapes rather than the exact
geographic contours of spatial objects

62
00:03:20,204 --> 00:03:24,204
allows not only for a unification of them
in terms of meaning, but also

63
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,644
allows the map to simultaneously be more effective in visual terms.

64
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:30,227
It thus better transmits its message.

65
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:32,937For example, to promote the use
of a rapid transit link

66
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:36,277
between an airport and a downtown, it would be better

67
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:39,537
to draw a “dynamic” and straight arrow
proposed at the airport

68
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:42,357
linking the two places, rather than
a line which exactly respects

69
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:45,137
the planned path, but which may be confused

70
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:47,407
with the ordinary road
network with which

71
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:50,197
this transit in fact wants to compete.

72
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,517Moreover, this example shows
that the play on shape concerns

73
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:56,647
not only a contrast between graphical objects,

74
00:03:56,647 --> 00:04:00,647
but also affect the composition,
that is to say the overall form of the map.

75
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:04,647
Yet the composition of a map
gradually guides its reading.

76
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:07,387
Like a painting, a map must present
a composition

77
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:08,637
which is at the service of
its statement.
78
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,548As has just been suggested,
once the shape has been decided upon,

79
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:16,358
the other parameter of given geometric object is size.

80
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:20,114However, if comparing shapes
is relatively simple,

81
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:22,144
that of size is distinctly less so.

82
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:25,694This is because “size”ca
 mean height, depth,

83
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:28,824
area, or even the
overall impression.

84
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,911And this impression can
be strongly affected

85
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:35,011
by the optical effects of the rest,
as we shall see.86
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,797In cartography,
size is often used

87
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:40,467
to indicate the quantitative
attribute of a place.

88
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,209
The general principle is that
the importance of a phenomenon

89
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:46,069
in a place - let us say population
for example - may be analysed

90
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:49,549
using the size of the figurative image representing this place on a map.

91
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,500It may be understandable that
this is not really possible

92
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,300
if the shape of the figurative image does vary from one place to another,

93
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,320
for comparing the size of two
different shapes is difficult.

94
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,760However, the notion of size can also
be more generally useful to differentiate

95
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,500
object categories if their scale is manifestly

96
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,360
a means of distinguishing them,
without nevertheless having to respect

97
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,850
the actual geographic sizes of the objects.
Here can be found the idea,

98
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,540
which is already advanced,
of scalar spectrum.

99
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,670Care must be given however to the fact
that the size of objects on the map

100
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,940
and the importance given to them
is also partly dependent

101
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,940
on the size of the map itself.

102
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,480
This is what causes an object of a size
nearly as big as the map

103
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,120
to go unnoticed…

104
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,310
Said otherwise, it is not true that
the bigger it is, the more visible it is.
105
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:33,801Finally, there exists no absolute
rule of proportionality

106
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,851
when it comes to proportioning symbols with the local values

107
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:41,061
of a variable. It has become
a habit that the area of a symbol

108
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:43,361
be made proportional to the
characteristic value of a place.

109
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:45,271
Essentially to make

110
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:47,951these local shapes
mutually comparable.

111
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:51,811
However, it is often to the detriment of realism in regards to the values considered.

112
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:52,811
For in this case

113
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,081
their distribution is
<i>de facto</i> crushed

114
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,711
and their important
values weakened.

115
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,911For example, it would be a pity to diminish
the great cities of a country,

116
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:02,491
when their importance for a whole
series of social phenomena

117
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:05,491
is in proportion to the number of relationships among their inhabitants

118
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,901
rather than the number
of inhabitants themselves.

119
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,203What is more, experimental
psycho-physics has demonstrated

120
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:14,793
in the 1920s that the eye’s
relative perception of size itself

121
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:18,793
follows a specific rule,
which varies according to

122
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:21,043
if length, area,
or volumes are compared.

123
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:23,267Many other choices
are thus possible

124
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,987
as soon as the final image creates
the nuances of the geographic idea

125
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:28,987
which one wishes to convey
in a satisfying manner.

126
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:32,367
Moreover, it is always useful to think about
the exact and singular nature

127
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,817
of the geographic objects represented and the manner

128
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:37,737
in which the map’s geometry
can take account of this.129
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,800Colour is a very general concept
which can be coded and quantified

130
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,670
through different models, including the HSL model,
combining an indication of hue

131
00:06:47,912 --> 00:06:51,912
- the colour - , an indication of
saturation - the colour’s intensity - ,

132
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,182
and an indication of lightness
- the amount of black in a colour,

133
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,612
giving it its dark or pale character.

134
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,490With such a model it is also possible

135
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,200
to construct a greyscale,
from black to white.
136
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:08,018Colour can firstly serve in
making objects visible.

137
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:10,938
It more generally serves in modulating their visibility relative

138
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:14,938
to objects among themselves. This can be done
by a simple play upon contrast,

139
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:17,508
between dark and
light colours for example,

140
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:20,766
whether it depends upon differentiating
objects among themselves or objects

141
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:22,686
from the basemap.

142
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:25,406Secondary information can also be
played down and attention drawn

143
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:28,956
to the important objects.However, care must be given to the fact that

144
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,526
certain colours are pale
and others dark,

145
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:34,296and others neither pale nor dark.

146
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:37,717
A map coloured in red and green
will come out uniformly grey

147
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,587
once photocopied
in black and white!

148
00:07:39,587 --> 00:07:42,577
Using blue and yellow would solve this problem.149
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:47,202However, colour can also often serve
in graduating a phenomenon in cartography,

150
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:49,632
or yet to distinguish phenomena
amongst themselves.

151
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,558In that case, the fact that
colours succeed each other

152
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:55,368
around the colour wheel can be played upon,
as well as that they can be discoloured

153
00:07:55,368 --> 00:07:58,418
or darkened to create shades
or colour scales.

154
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:01,816
The rules for creating colour
scales can be technical,

155
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,886
but they are also fairly intuitive.

156
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:06,306
Everyone has in fact learned,
when they were little,

157
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:09,762
to put away their felt pens in
a harmonious order of colour.

158
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:12,262
Also, each of us has doubtless
found a solution

159
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:15,852
to overcome the difficulty
of categorising browns and greys.

160
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:19,367If, on the other hand, the use of
intermediate colours is not permitted

161
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:22,707
and one is limited to using a number of
hues widely-distributed across the spectrum,

162
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:24,677
such as the colours of
the rainbow for example,

163
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:27,287
colour can become a tool
for cartographic

164
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,267
place differentiation.
However, be careful!

165
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,467
Colours also tend to be associated
together in different ways:

166
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,297warm and cool colours,

167
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:37,547
dark and pale, primary,
complementary, etc.

168
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:41,707
However rest assured that studying
general colour theory is very easy

169
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:43,597
and will allow success to be found

170
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:46,037
in using colours in cartography.171
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:49,845Let us address optical illusions.
This may seem superfluous,

172
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,735
but optical illusions are not a marginal phenomenon in cartography,

173
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,655
since the images created are abstract.

174
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:57,635They do not concretely mean anything
in the same way as an object, a tree,

175
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,531
can serve as a guide to interpreting

176
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:00,952
and avoiding ambiguities.

177
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:04,623
What is more, the coding and decoding logic via the legend

178
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:07,755
makes the message conveyed by
the map very directly dependent

179
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,065
upon the quality of the coding

180
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:11,105
and its own graphic modalities.

181
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:15,761
Such a shade of red represents such a rock, and mixing it up
with such a shade of red-orange

182
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:18,241
may lead to mistaking shale for gneiss,

183
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,641
or worse, a conglomerate for marble.

184
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:24,271There are many of these illusions,
and the best would be to learn from then,

185
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:25,331
to know how to best use them.

186
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:29,936Let us cite two very classic and
somewhat impressive examples.

187
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,149The first concerns colour perception.

188
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:37,149
It should be noted that a colour changes slightly in relation to the size of the area

189
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:39,539
across which it is spread, as well as

190
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:40,539
to the neighbouring colours.

191
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:44,519The second concerns the perceived
shape of visual objects.

192
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,089
As can be seen in the illustration,

193
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,659
the central circle appears to be
a different size in each picture,

194
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:51,939
whereas it is the same size
in each of them.

195
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,874
The circles around it change
its apparent size.
196
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:59,418The second great category of
visual effects that

197
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:03,418
can be played upon by a cartographer concerns the clipping of the map into layers.

198
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,130
To do this different shading

199
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,610
or perforation techniques must be used,
allowing a dissociation from thematic layers.

200
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,900
It may also limit visual interference

201
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,950
and encourage the map’s reading
through a layering effect.
202
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,165There are many other useful
effects in cartography,

203
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:22,255
especially those allowing relief to be created, and the only limit

204
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:26,255
is the cartographer’s imagination combined
to the techniques at his service.

205
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:28,941Let us recall the major effect categories:

206
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:32,491-Interventions to the background,
especially its framing,

207
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:35,441
the orientation of its segments, tearing, anamorphosis,

208
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:38,501
or yet its regularisation through
simple geometric shapes,

209
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,571
squares or hexagons for example.

210
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:44,763-Thereafter accumulations which
consist in multiplying

211
00:10:44,763 --> 00:10:47,963
the superimposed figures,
which combined with layering effects,

212
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:50,533
allow volume to be created and display quantities

213
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:53,103
through an overall reading when even
the concerned places pattern

214
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:55,563
is very constricted.215
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:59,766-Let us also highlight the play upon
typography and symbolisation,

216
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:02,816
which can be very elaborate
and very effectively enrich

217
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:05,526
a map’s message, with the advantage of introducing

218
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:08,196
specific information at least cost.

219
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:11,596-Finally, let us quickly note
cinematic effects.

220
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:13,516
By creating cartographic movies,

221
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:15,278they allow certain types


222
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:17,874
of spatial dynamics
to be displayed

223
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:19,114
by using rhythmic effects
or simple visual changes.
