Spaces, from local to global and specialities produced by both small and big actors combining in creating a powerful component of social words we can call geographicity.
As this dimension and efficience specificity to justify the use of a special language different from the others
Of course, social sciences of space commonly use verbal and mathematical languages or all the classical communication tools.
However, geography as a special language talking about space occupies a unique position in the cluster of these courses be them scientific or not that deal with the inhabited space.
That is why we logically decided to devote an entire session to maps.
For this exploration, that will also be an initiation to cartographic practice we have invited Dr. Patrick Pense with both brilliant theoretician and active practitioner in cartography to bring us his ideas.
Hello,
During this session we will speak about maps.
It is a mental object which cannot be understood in a simple and unequivocal manner.
Everyone intuitively sense what cartography has to do with geography.
Besides, geography and cartography are often confused, that is to say the scientific expert with the technical artist.
However this close relationship between the two professions, between science and technology, a relationship which seems obvious, does not fit well with the diversity of representations which can be designed under the generic term of â€œmapâ€�.
This session could doubtlessly shed light upon the logics of these intricacies, perhaps better than a definition of the map which may be hasty and simplistic.
It is thus in a minimal way, and without excessively normative ambitions, that we can content ourselves to start off with a simple definition of the map: 
A graphical representation of space which does not play upon effects of perspective, thus which has no foreground nor background.
This very simple definition may be surprising.
It combines a great functional openness
- representing space - and a single condition concerning its style, that is, no depth, which most often leads to a zenithal viewpoint, that is to say, from above.
It is thus a very free and creative practice but which can also mobilise specific and codifiable techniques.
In brief, it is an art more than a mechanical action.
Perhaps a practical component should be nevertheless added to this first definition, for the issue of cartography is the production of stable, transmittable images which escape their creatorsâ€™ influence to sometimes be interpreted contrarily to their original meaning.
The map is the crystallised form of a singular geographical thought, just like any text, table, graphic or other basis of linguistic expression.
This mediological property of the map, the fact that it renders a thought tangible and real, has otherwise a feedback effect ultimately giving it its true importance.
It fixes an image of space and, from this fact, it conditions geographical thought and spatial action, which end up by conforming to it.
If it is not possible to teach â€œcartographyâ€� within the confines of this session, it is however possible, and perhaps even useful to present the major issues and great principles of cartography in an organised manner.
This goal thus comes back to dissociating geography from cartography, identifying their respective scientific and technological logics, in view of improving your geographical thinking and your spatial intelligence.
So that you do not take the maps you may have to deal with for granted.
We will first clarify the epistemological and theoretical relationships uniting and distinguishing geography from cartography.
If they share the concept of distance as a common point, they each give it a slightly different, although compatible, content.
It will thus involve understanding how to move from a geographical idea to a cartographic project.
Secondly, we will more concretely approach the steps of making a map:
An informational step, on the primary matter of the map and its treatment.
A mediological step, which proposes four simple and general principles for making maps.
A design step, which imagines the map from the point-of-view of a creation inserted into a rich and complex communication system.
A map is a visual, graphical object.
It can be looked at, and differs from a text in that verbal expression is often secondary, with a few exceptions.
The sequence for reading an image is not immediately obvious.
To the contrary, it constitutes the central issue and object of cartographic work.
It is this issue which defines the cartographic genre, which is very specific, despite its variations.
We have stated that the only constraint is the absence of perspective.
It is by this detail that the map can be distinguished from landscapes, which are the other great tradition in spatial representation.
On a map, all of the visual objects are deemed to be at the same distance from the observer.
Their size or shape do not depend upon the point-of-view or the position in the geographical scene represented.
Two places with the same spatial importance are represented in the same way.
However, in reality, this constraint allows for a very great variety of forms, and only serves to specify the genre â€œmapâ€�.
Nevertheless, here again a normative approach must not mask the fundamentally practical character of cartography.
A character common to technologies, in contrast to sciences.
Beyond expressing formal constraints, that which is most important is communicational efficiency.
For example, a point-of-view on a terrestrial globe is affected by a perspective effect.
However in practice, the concrete uses for a globe do not play upon this effect.
The cartographic work of making globes is above all a cartographic task.
Behind the abstract idea of cartography can in reality be distinguished the three â€œOccupationsâ€� corresponding to the three principle types of maps.
Every real map principally pertain to one of these three types, but can borrow some distinctive secondary traits from the two other types. 
A road map, a city map, or for example a topographical map are instrumental maps. 
They are a tool to be used on-site, or in preparation for this use, in a sort of simulation.
This is the domain of the â€œtraditionalâ€� map, which requires great technical skill in its preparation.
It is work for professional cartographers, who manipulate and localisedata.
These maps are decoded more than read, the decoding being permitted by the legend, which is an essential component of these maps.
On the semiological level, for these maps denotation is more important than connotation. 
The second occupation is that which we may call â€œmapdesignâ€�.
More than â€œmapsâ€�, let us say that it produces â€œcartographiesâ€�.
By balancing connotation and denotation in its expression,
MapDesign seems more like a tongue than a code.
It multiplies the internal references in the universe of the map, as well as external references, with other graphical universes.
MapDesign is the cartographic domain of spaces more than that of data.
That is to say the domain of spatial objects that it has complex and complete objects.
These cartographies entirely acquire the status of objects, including in the concrete and material sense of the term.
They are largely autonomous objects, which are the work of true authors.  
The third type of cartography is that practiced by anyone, when a quick and practical drawing of a space is worth more than an involved explanation.
It is the cartography of non-cartographers.
We can speak of a â€œcartoâ€� as we speak of a â€œphotoâ€� to distinguish popular art from professional and artistic â€œphotographyâ€�.
Neither instruments, nor even objects, these cartos are media.
In reality they express spatialities rather than spaces, that is to say actions and capacities of a project inscribed into a space.
For this, they have recourse to what may be called a language
- such as a computer language - that is to say a simplified and purified language, which is minimally structured, often created on the go, borrowing from a number of existing or implicit conventions between speakers, using many obvious connotations and a minimalist denotation.
That is to say that it has very little for a legend, or simply explained orally, and economical graphical means.
Making maps does not require a total mastery over the three forms of cartographic expression which we have just presented.
However it must be recognised that cartographic production can give results only within one or another of these three communicational â€œpolesâ€�.
For cartography is above all about communication.
Even if it is only a dialogue with oneself, it is still about communicating. 
Like every means of advanced communication, cartography leaves lots of room for creativity, and the message must be sensitive to the context.
That which is technique in cartography is thus not an ensemble of automatic rules, but rather means at oneâ€™s disposal to concretise the image of a space, or the principles for its construction, which one has in mind into a geographical form.
Cartography thus comes from art in the sense that it cannot be resumed to techniques or recipes, but is first of all based on an intention, and it develops an assumed statement more-or-less effectively according to the mastery over the technique at its disposal.
In other words, cartography is not only the business of cartographers.
It can be practiced with as much effectiveness, or even more, by someone who has put in the effort of thinking carefully about the means at their disposal or that he can create to express a spatial idea.
A good map is not the result of the application of automatic treatment to geographic information, but only the result of good suitability, and often good compromises between the spatial idea to be maintained and the means of its expression.
It is the logic of the image which is important.
If the map works, it is a good map.
This exonerating approach to cartography has two goals.
On the one hand to free ourselves from dependency on ready-made maps, and at least be able to criticise their implicit logics.
This simple criticism of maps has already and often served as a means for entering into a spatial reflection.
On the other hand, to draw attention to the fact that the person who thinks about space is responsible for the means he uses to make it.
Mistaking the map used can lead to mistaking ourselves about the space used.
In brief it runs the risk of mistaking the geography and in short making mistakes in the spatial action taken.
It could lead to mistaking the path to take, as well as mistaking the urban development plan or the commercial conquest of the world.
We can thus see that the functional link uniting cartography and geography is an incitation to deepen that which composes it.
If the map conditions thought on space, if the expression of geographical ideas requires a certain cartographic mastery, upon what is this relationship founded, and until what point does it go ? 
Until what point are cartographic space and geographic space alike?
Can maps really be counted upon to think about space? If yes, until what point are they useful?
