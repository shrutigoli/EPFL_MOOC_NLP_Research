1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,363
Spaces, from local to global

2
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:09,530
and specialities produced 
by both small and big actors

3
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:13,936
combining in creating a powerful 
component of social words

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,305
we can call geographicity.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,732
As this dimension 
and efficience specificity

6
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:23,879
to justify the use of a special
language different from the others

7
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:28,268
Of course, social sciences
of space commonly use

8
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:30,597
verbal and mathematical languages

9
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,714
or all the classical
communication tools.

10
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:38,819
However, geography as a special 
language talking about space

11
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:42,914
occupies a unique position 
in the cluster of these courses

12
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:46,973
be them scientific or not that deal 
with the inhabited space.

13
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:52,650
That is why we logically decided 
to devote an entire session to maps.

14
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:58,078
For this exploration, that will also be 
an initiation to cartographic practice

15
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,982
we have invited Dr. Patrick Pense

16
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,200
with both brilliant theoretician and 
active practitioner in cartography

17
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:07,475
to bring us his ideas.

18
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:11,362


19
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:13,162
20
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,409Hello,
21
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:17,298During this session
we will speak about maps.

22
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:20,360It is a mental object
which cannot be understood

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,223
in a simple and unequivocal manner.

24
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:24,290Everyone intuitively sense

25
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:27,291
what cartography
has to do with geography.

26
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:31,161
Besides, geography and
cartography are often confused,

27
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:35,081
that is to say the scientific expert
with the technical artist.

28
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:38,091However this close relationship
between the two professions,

29
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:40,087
between science and technology,

30
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:41,612
a relationship which seems obvious,

31
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:44,379
does not fit well with the
diversity of representations

32
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,414
which can be designed under
the generic term of “map”.

33
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:52,105
This session could doubtlessly shed light
upon the logics of these intricacies,

34
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:56,321
perhaps better than a definition of
the map which may be hasty and simplistic.35
00:01:57,234 --> 00:02:01,453It is thus in a minimal way,
and without excessively normative ambitions,

36
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:05,841
that we can content ourselves to start off
with a simple definition of the map: 

37
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:08,436
A graphical representation of space

38
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:11,355
which does not play upon
effects of perspective,

39
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:15,419
thus which has no foreground
nor background.

40
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,832This very simple definition
may be surprising.

41
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,626
It combines a great
functional openness

42
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,781- representing space -

43
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:25,155
and a single condition
concerning its style,

44
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:29,590
that is, no depth, which most often
leads to a zenithal viewpoint,

45
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,088
that is to say, from above.

46
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:34,342It is thus a very free
and creative practice

47
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:38,172
but which can also mobilise
specific and codifiable techniques.

48
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:42,234
In brief, it is an art
more than a mechanical action.49
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:46,442Perhaps a practical component

50
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:47,706
should be nevertheless added
to this first definition,

51
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,657
for the issue of cartography
is the production of stable,

52
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:54,945
transmittable images which escape their creators’
influence to sometimes be interpreted

53
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:56,866
contrarily to their original meaning.

54
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,743The map is the crystallised form of
a singular geographical thought,

55
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:05,001
just like any text, table, graphic

56
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,481
or other basis of linguistic expression.

57
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,282This mediological property of the map,

58
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:15,446
the fact that it renders a thought
tangible and real,

59
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:18,159
has otherwise a feedback effect
ultimately giving it its true importance.

60
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,602
It fixes an image of space and,

61
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:23,722
from this fact, it conditions
geographical thought and spatial action,

62
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:26,482
which end up by conforming to it.63
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:32,746If it is not possible to teach “cartography”
within the confines of this session,

64
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:36,478
it is however possible,
and perhaps even useful

65
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:39,229
to present the major issues
and great principles

66
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:42,959
of cartography in
an organised manner.

67
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,048This goal thus comes back to dissociating
geography from cartography,

68
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:51,368
identifying their respective scientific
and technological logics,

69
00:03:51,368 --> 00:03:55,041
in view of improving
your geographical thinking

70
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,849
and your spatial intelligence.

71
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,784
So that you do not take the maps

72
00:03:59,784 --> 00:04:01,715you may have to deal with for granted.73
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:06,513We will first clarify the epistemological
and theoretical relationships

74
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,568
uniting and distinguishing
geography from cartography.

75
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:13,162
If they share the concept of
distance as a common point,

76
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:17,048
they each give it
a slightly different,

77
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,098
although compatible, content.

78
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:22,013It will thus involve understanding
how to move from a geographical idea

79
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,658
to a cartographic project.
80
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:28,016Secondly, we will
more concretely approach

81
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,438
the steps of making a map:

82
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,201An informational step,

83
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:34,468
on the primary matter of
the map and its treatment.

84
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:40,281A mediological step, which proposes
four simple and general principles

85
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,761
for making maps.

86
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:45,723A design step, which imagines the map
from the point-of-view of a creation

87
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:49,784
inserted into a rich and
complex communication system.88
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:52,32089
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,031A map is a visual, graphical object.90
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:58,848It can be looked at,
and differs from a text

91
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:02,026
in that verbal expression
is often secondary,

92
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:03,881with a few exceptions.

93
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:07,042The sequence for reading an image
is not immediately obvious.

94
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:11,455
To the contrary, it constitutes the central
issue and object of cartographic work.

95
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:14,618
It is this issue which defines the cartographic genre,

96
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,658
which is very specific,
despite its variations.97
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:21,316We have stated that the only constraint
is the absence of perspective.

98
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:24,995
It is by this detail that the map
can be distinguished from landscapes,

99
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:28,157
which are the other great tradition in spatial representation.

100
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:31,002
On a map, all of the visual
objects are deemed to be

101
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:33,035
at the same distance
from the observer.

102
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:37,038
Their size or shape do not depend upon
the point-of-view or the position

103
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,827
in the geographical scene represented.

104
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:43,884
Two places with the same spatial
importance are represented in the same way.

105
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:48,503However, in reality, this constraint
allows for a very great variety of forms,

106
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:52,695
and only serves to specify
the genre “map”.
107
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:56,442Nevertheless, here again
a normative approach must not mask

108
00:05:56,442 --> 00:05:59,998
the fundamentally practical
character of cartography.

109
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:03,792
A character common to technologies,
in contrast to sciences.

110
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:07,244Beyond expressing formal constraints,

111
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:10,101
that which is most important is communicational efficiency.

112
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:14,474For example, a point-of-view
on a terrestrial globe

113
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,252
is affected by
a perspective effect.

114
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:20,436However in practice, the concrete uses
for a globe do not play upon this effect.

115
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:24,816
The cartographic work of making globes
is above all a cartographic task.116
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:31,420Behind the abstract idea of cartography can
in reality be distinguished the three “Occupations”

117
00:06:31,797 --> 00:06:35,159
corresponding to the
three principle types of maps.

118
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:39,533
Every real map principally pertain to
one of these three types,

119
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,380
but can borrow some
distinctive secondary

120
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,486
traits from the two other types. 121
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:48,837A road map, a city map,
or for example a topographical map

122
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:50,916
are instrumental maps. 
123
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,366They are a tool to be used on-site,

124
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:57,342
or in preparation for this use,
in a sort of simulation.

125
00:06:57,342 --> 00:07:00,422This is the domain of
the “traditional” map,

126
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:03,128
which requires great technical
skill in its preparation.

127
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:05,449
It is work for professional cartographers,

128
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,988
who manipulate and localisedata.

129
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:11,425
These maps are decoded more than read,

130
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:15,432
the decoding being permitted by the legend,
which is an essential component of these maps.

131
00:07:16,232 --> 00:07:22,432On the semiological level, for these maps
denotation is more important than connotation. 132
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,446The second occupation is that
which we may call “mapdesign”.

133
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:35,354More than “maps”, let us say that
it produces “cartographies”.

134
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:39,052
By balancing connotation and
denotation in its expression,

135
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:42,000
MapDesign seems more like
a tongue than a code.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,041
It multiplies the internal references
in the universe of the map,

137
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,469
as well as external references,
with other graphical universes.

138
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:52,508
MapDesign is the
cartographic domain of spaces

139
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:56,081
more than that of data.

140
00:07:56,081 --> 00:08:00,014
That is to say the domain of spatial objects
that it has complex and complete objects.

141
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:03,454These cartographies entirely
acquire the status of objects,

142
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:06,161
including in the concrete and
material sense of the term.

143
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:10,743
They are largely autonomous objects,
which are the work of true authors.  144
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:15,986The third type of cartography
is that practiced by anyone,

145
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:18,861
when a quick and practical
drawing of a space

146
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:21,655
is worth more than
an involved explanation.

147
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:24,921
It is the cartography of non-cartographers.

148
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,360We can speak of a “carto” as
we speak of a “photo” to distinguish

149
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,395
popular art from professional
and artistic “photography”.

150
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:34,482
Neither instruments, nor even objects,
these cartos are media.

151
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:39,484
In reality they express spatialities
rather than spaces,

152
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:44,137
that is to say actions and capacities
of a project inscribed into a space.

153
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:48,082
For this, they have recourse to what may be called a language

154
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:49,434
- such as a computer language -

155
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:51,781
that is to say a simplified
and purified language,

156
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:56,952
which is minimally structured, often created
on the go, borrowing from a number of

157
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:59,619
existing or implicit
conventions between speakers,

158
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:03,892using many obvious connotations
and a minimalist denotation.

159
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:07,471
That is to say that it has very little
for a legend, or simply explained orally,

160
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:10,082
and economical graphical means.161
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:17,286Making maps does not require
a total mastery

162
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:22,767
over the three forms of cartographic expression which we have just presented.

163
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,598
However it must be recognised that cartographic production

164
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:31,086
can give results only within one or another
of these three communicational “poles”.

165
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:35,077For cartography is above all
about communication.

166
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:39,326
Even if it is only a dialogue with oneself,
it is still about communicating. 167
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:43,636Like every means of advanced communication,
cartography leaves lots of room

168
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:47,081
for creativity, and the message
must be sensitive to the context.

169
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:50,166
That which is technique
in cartography is thus not

170
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,475
an ensemble of automatic rules,

171
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:56,820
but rather means at one’s disposal
to concretise the image of a space,

172
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,244
or the principles for its construction,which one has in mind into a geographical form.

173
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:04,425Cartography thus comes from art
in the sense that it cannot be resumed

174
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:06,355
to techniques or recipes,

175
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,561
but is first of all based on an intention,

176
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,159
and it develops an assumed statement

177
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,868
more-or-less effectively according to the
mastery over the technique at its disposal.178
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:18,682In other words, cartography is not only
the business of cartographers.

179
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:22,732
It can be practiced with
as much effectiveness, or even more,

180
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:26,308
by someone who has put in the effort of thinking
carefully about the means at their disposal

181
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:30,540
or that he can create
to express a spatial idea.

182
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,094A good map is not the result
of the application

183
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,481
of automatic treatment
to geographic information,

184
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:39,527
but only the result of good suitability,
and often good compromises

185
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:43,073between the spatial idea to be maintained
and the means of its expression.

186
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:45,483
It is the logic of the image
which is important.

187
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:48,23If the map works,
it is a good map.
188
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:53,760This exonerating approach
to cartography has two goals.

189
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,234On the one hand to free ourselves
from dependency on ready-made maps,

190
00:10:57,234 --> 00:11:00,614
and at least be able
to criticise their implicit logics.

191
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:04,114
This simple criticism of maps
has already and often

192
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:06,234
served as a means for
entering into a spatial reflection.

193
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:10,611On the other hand, to draw attention to
the fact that the person
who thinks about space

194
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:13,467is responsible for the means
he uses to make it.

195
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:16,177
Mistaking the map used can lead to mistaking ourselves about the space used.

196
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:19,081
In brief it runs the risk of mistaking
the geography and in short

197
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:21,789
making mistakes in
the spatial action taken.

198
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:24,649
It could lead to mistaking the path to take,
as well as mistaking the urban development plan

199
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:27,094
or the commercial conquest of the world.200
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:30,041We can thus see that the functional link
uniting cartography and geography

201
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,521
is an incitation to deepen
that which composes it.

202
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:34,962If the map conditions thought on space,

203
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:38,501
if the expression of geographical ideas requires a certain cartographic mastery,

204
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:41,344
upon what is this relationship founded,
and until what point does it go ? 205
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:45,009Until what point are cartographic space
and geographic space alike?

206
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:49,421
Can maps really be counted upon
to think about space? If yes,

207
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:52,247
until what point are they useful?
