To guide a mapâ€™s conception, a hypothesis could be made about the manner of reading it.
Let us grant that a mapâ€™s reading proceeds through a series of eye motions where it zooms in and out.
Thus a cartographerâ€™s job could be conceived as that of conditioning the back-and-forth motions of the eye by the image itself, and this in a manner so that the eye successively identifies visual objects which it will associate with places.
These places will create the backbone of the geographic statement, and the examination of their relationships on the map will allow for the development of this statement.
Thus the reader must be presented with sorts of visual â€œstopsâ€� upon which the eye can rest.
In addition, every visual element which could interfere with the image must be eliminated as much as possible.
Visual <i>noise</i> must be eliminated to only keep the music of the map.
Let it also be noted that a model of reading which plays upon objectsâ€™ scales through the zooming of sight is preferred.
For contrarily to seeing a figurative image such as a photo or a painting, objects which must be shown, thus the geographic places displayed on the map, are often of novel and unknown forms, and of a very diverse size.
It is less often about recognising a form, such as a face, a tree, or a person, as discovering and memorising abstract elements.
In response to this challenge, the cartographic theory presented here means to be simple, global, and open.
It is based on a play of four â€œcomponentsâ€�: shape, size, colour, and visual effects.
It does not seek to guarantee the absolute validity of the cartographic options.
In general, this has as an effect greatly limiting imaginable solutions.
To the contrary, it encourages creativity, innovation, and even unorthodox solutions from the point-of-view of more traditional cartographic theories.
Let us recall that this approach considers that the mapâ€™s validity can in any case only be judged at the end, based on its efficiency in regards to its communicational project, and not in respect to abstract recipes applied in a scholarly fashion during the entire process of its creation.
The idea of shape is fundamental to that of information.
That which has a specific shape vehicles information, to the contrary of that which has none.
A shape can be seen as a collection of angles.
Let us take for example two triangles.
They really differ in shape only if the angles composing them are different.
If not, they cannot be distinguished one from the other apart from their size.
Playing upon shape in cartography can serve to differentiate geographic objects, at least for certain spatial configurations.
However, it is firstly and above all a means of defining an arbitration between the geonic component and the geotype component of a space.
Thus, very simply, representing cities of a country by similar disks is a way of cancelling their geographic singularity in large part to keep only the relative location in relationship to other cities.
In exchange, each of these places is identifiable to the others.
Each constitutes an instance of a geotype which can be called â€œa cityâ€� in this country.
More generally, using geometric symbols, parallel lines, or other simple and repetitive shapes rather than the exact geographic contours of spatial objects allows not only for a unification of them in terms of meaning, but also allows the map to simultaneously be more effective in visual terms.
It thus better transmits its message.
For example, to promote the use of a rapid transit link between an airport and a downtown, it would be better to draw a â€œdynamicâ€� and straight arrow proposed at the airport linking the two places, rather than a line which exactly respects the planned path, but which may be confused with the ordinary road network with which this transit in fact wants to compete.
Moreover, this example shows that the play on shape concerns not only a contrast between graphical objects, but also affect the composition, that is to say the overall form of the map.
Yet the composition of a map gradually guides its reading.
Like a painting, a map must present a composition which is at the service of its statement.
As has just been suggested, once the shape has been decided upon, the other parameter of given geometric object is size.
However, if comparing shapes is relatively simple, that of size is distinctly less so.
This is because â€œsizeâ€�ca
mean height, depth, area, or even the overall impression.
And this impression can be strongly affected by the optical effects of the rest, as we shall see.
In cartography, size is often used to indicate the quantitative attribute of a place.
The general principle is that the importance of a phenomenon in a place - let us say population for example - may be analysed using the size of the figurative image representing this place on a map.
It may be understandable that this is not really possible if the shape of the figurative image does vary from one place to another, for comparing the size of two different shapes is difficult.
However, the notion of size can also be more generally useful to differentiate object categories if their scale is manifestly a means of distinguishing them, without nevertheless having to respect the actual geographic sizes of the objects.
Here can be found the idea, which is already advanced, of scalar spectrum.
Care must be given however to the fact that the size of objects on the map and the importance given to them is also partly dependent on the size of the map itself.
This is what causes an object of a size nearly as big as the map to go unnoticedâ€¦
Said otherwise, it is not true that the bigger it is, the more visible it is.
Finally, there exists no absolute rule of proportionality when it comes to proportioning symbols with the local values of a variable. It has become a habit that the area of a symbol be made proportional to the characteristic value of a place.
Essentially to make these local shapes mutually comparable.
However, it is often to the detriment of realism in regards to the values considered.
For in this case their distribution is
<i>de facto</i> crushed and their important values weakened.
For example, it would be a pity to diminish the great cities of a country, when their importance for a whole series of social phenomena is in proportion to the number of relationships among their inhabitants rather than the number of inhabitants themselves.
What is more, experimental psycho-physics has demonstrated in the 1920s that the eyeâ€™s relative perception of size itself follows a specific rule, which varies according to if length, area, or volumes are compared.
Many other choices are thus possible as soon as the final image creates the nuances of the geographic idea which one wishes to convey in a satisfying manner.
Moreover, it is always useful to think about the exact and singular nature of the geographic objects represented and the manner in which the mapâ€™s geometry can take account of this.
Colour is a very general concept which can be coded and quantified through different models, including the HSL model, combining an indication of hue
- the colour - , an indication of saturation - the colourâ€™s intensity - , and an indication of lightness
- the amount of black in a colour, giving it its dark or pale character.
With such a model it is also possible to construct a greyscale, from black to white.
Colour can firstly serve in making objects visible.
It more generally serves in modulating their visibility relative to objects among themselves. This can be done by a simple play upon contrast, between dark and light colours for example, whether it depends upon differentiating objects among themselves or objects from the basemap.
Secondary information can also be played down and attention drawn to the important objects.
However, care must be given to the fact that certain colours are pale and others dark, and others neither pale nor dark.
A map coloured in red and green will come out uniformly grey once photocopied in black and white!
Using blue and yellow would solve this problem.
However, colour can also often serve in graduating a phenomenon in cartography, or yet to distinguish phenomena amongst themselves.
In that case, the fact that colours succeed each other around the colour wheel can be played upon, as well as that they can be discoloured or darkened to create shades or colour scales.
The rules for creating colour scales can be technical, but they are also fairly intuitive.
Everyone has in fact learned, when they were little, to put away their felt pens in a harmonious order of colour.
Also, each of us has doubtless found a solution to overcome the difficulty of categorising browns and greys.
If, on the other hand, the use of intermediate colours is not permitted and one is limited to using a number of hues widely-distributed across the spectrum, such as the colours of the rainbow for example, colour can become a tool for cartographic place differentiation.
However, be careful!
Colours also tend to be associated together in different ways: warm and cool colours, dark and pale, primary, complementary, etc.
However rest assured that studying general colour theory is very easy and will allow success to be found in using colours in cartography.
Let us address optical illusions.
This may seem superfluous, but optical illusions are not a marginal phenomenon in cartography, since the images created are abstract.
They do not concretely mean anything in the same way as an object, a tree, can serve as a guide to interpreting and avoiding ambiguities.
What is more, the coding and decoding logic via the legend makes the message conveyed by the map very directly dependent upon the quality of the coding and its own graphic modalities.
Such a shade of red represents such a rock, and mixing it up with such a shade of red-orange may lead to mistaking shale for gneiss, or worse, a conglomerate for marble.
There are many of these illusions, and the best would be to learn from then, to know how to best use them.
Let us cite two very classic and somewhat impressive examples.
The first concerns colour perception.
It should be noted that a colour changes slightly in relation to the size of the area across which it is spread, as well as to the neighbouring colours.
The second concerns the perceived shape of visual objects.
As can be seen in the illustration, the central circle appears to be a different size in each picture, whereas it is the same size in each of them.
The circles around it change its apparent size.
The second great category of visual effects that can be played upon by a cartographer concerns the clipping of the map into layers.
To do this different shading or perforation techniques must be used, allowing a dissociation from thematic layers.
It may also limit visual interference and encourage the mapâ€™s reading through a layering effect.
There are many other useful effects in cartography, especially those allowing relief to be created, and the only limit is the cartographerâ€™s imagination combined to the techniques at his service.
Let us recall the major effect categories:
-Interventions to the background, especially its framing, the orientation of its segments, tearing, anamorphosis, or yet its regularisation through simple geometric shapes, squares or hexagons for example.
-Thereafter accumulations which consist in multiplying the superimposed figures, which combined with layering effects, allow volume to be created and display quantities through an overall reading when even the concerned places pattern is very constricted.
-Let us also highlight the play upon typography and symbolisation, which can be very elaborate and very effectively enrich a mapâ€™s message, with the advantage of introducing specific information at least cost.
-Finally, let us quickly note cinematic effects.
By creating cartographic movies, they allow certain types of spatial dynamics to be displayed by using rhythmic effects or simple visual changes.
