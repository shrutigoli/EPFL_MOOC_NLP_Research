00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,172
Welcome back to this section
on system templates and design.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,096
In the last section, we mostly discussed
waterless pit-based systems,

3
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:14,644
whereas in this section, we'll focus
on systems that are mostly water-based

4
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:17,917
but still contained at the household
or decentralized level.

5
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:19,693
This system is called

6
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:23,646
the Pour Flush Pit System
without Sludge Production.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,149
The name is a bit long,

8
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:28,497
but it also describes very clearly
what happens in the system.

9
00:00:29,348 --> 00:00:32,171
First, it is a system
based on a pour flush toilet.

10
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:34,848
Unlike previous systems,
there is not a choice

11
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,810
when it comes to the user interface.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,716
This is because the pour flush toilet
is water based,

13
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:41,952
but it doesn't require too much water.

14
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:45,770
Too much water would flood the twin pits.

15
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:48,909
You can see here that there is only one
technology option

16
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:50,626
for the collection and storage.

17
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,697
To prevent too much water in the pits,
the gray water is diverted,

18
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:57,052
although small quantities could be added.

19
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:01,670
Because only one pit is used at a time,
the black water in the pit

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,750
degrades over time into a thick,
relatively stable hummus-like material.

21
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:10,072
Unlike sludge
which accumulates in single pits,

22
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:12,672
the materials from the twin pits
cannot be pumped

23
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,587
and must therefore be removed by hand,

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,755
probably with a shovel.

25
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:21,629
Again, there is only one option
shown here for the conveyance technology.

26
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,936
The material underwent
treatment in the pit,

27
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:27,045
so there is no need for further treatment

28
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:30,470
and therefore no technology choice
for the treatment option.

29
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:34,653
The material can be used or disposed of
depending on local needs.

30
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,869
The biogas system is designed

31
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:42,032
with the goal of producing biogas
for use in cooking or lighting.

32
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:44,336
This, like the previous system,
would be chosen

33
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,526
if there was a specific need
for the use of the end products,

34
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:50,443
but care must be taken to ensure
that the right technologies

35
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,722
are selected and organized before.

36
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,180
In this template we can see
several choices for the user interface,

37
00:01:57,444 --> 00:02:01,764
either a pour flush toilet can be used
for all of the excreta and flush water,

38
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:04,042
or if there is a desire for urine

39
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,281
so that it could be used
in a liquid fertilizer,

40
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,436
then a urine diverting toilet
or urinal could be installed.

41
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:13,990
If urine is separated, it must be stored
and transported separately.

42
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:17,380
Of course, it could also
be directed towards a soak pit,

43
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,995
although there is really
no reason to do this

44
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:22,375
and this option
is indicated by the thin line

45
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,021
leading from the urine to the soak pit.

46
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:29,192
The black and brown water
that is generated

47
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:32,961
should be mixed with some sort
of organic material in the biogas reactor.

48
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:37,287
Biogas can be produced
without the addition of organics,

49
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:39,620
but if they are available,
they should be added.

50
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:43,136
The reactor will produce
a fairly constant supply of gas

51
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:47,161
which must not be allowed to build up,
or the pressure could become too high

52
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,287
and the tank could crack or explode.

53
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:55,122
Important to note also is the fact
that sludge is formed within the reactor.

54
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:58,959
Depending on the design of the reactor,
the sludge will either be pushed out

55
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,415
as the gas pressure builds,
or it must be emptied periodically

56
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:06,218
so that the reactor continues to function
and so that there is still enough space

57
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,089
for the gas to accumulate.

58
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:12,564
Notice again that gray water
is treated separately

59
00:03:12,564 --> 00:03:14,695
in a parallel treatment train at the top.

60
00:03:14,836 --> 00:03:17,400
This is to prevent the mixture
in the biogas reactor

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,081
from becoming too diluted.

62
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:23,725
If a significant quantity of organics
or animal waste is added to the reactor,

63
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:25,747
some gray water could be useful.

64
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,146
The last system template

65
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:31,509
from this section of water-based,
mostly decentralized systems

66
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:34,486
is called the Blackwater
Treatment System with Infiltration.

67
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:39,016
As the name implies, a key feature here
is the infiltration that happens.

68
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:43,058
A water-based user interface
generates black water,

69
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:46,294
which is collected
in an on-site storage technology

70
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:48,490
like the septic tank shown here,

71
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:52,065
that produces both effluent and sludge.

72
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,820
Sludge, as we have seen,
requires a number of sequential

73
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,645
and sometimes parallel technologies
to transport, treat, and use it.

74
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,703
The effluent, though, in this case,
will simply be infiltrated into the soil

75
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:09,636
using a soak pit or a leech field,
both of which require

76
00:04:09,636 --> 00:04:11,949
appropriate ground water
and soil conditions,

77
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,212
not to mention sufficient space.

78
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:19,426
This system would not be appropriate
for a very dense urban area like this one,

79
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:23,168
but would be suitable for a rural
or peri-urban application,

80
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:27,093
where the distance between houses
would not make it possible to connect them

81
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,598
with any kind of sewer,

82
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:31,556
but where sufficient quantities
of water would be available

83
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:34,916
to ensure that the septic tank
or ABR would function properly.

84
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:40,399
In summary then, water-based systems
can be contained at the household level

85
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,134
and do not all require
water-based transport.

86
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,609
Infiltration is the key mechanism

87
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:48,100
that removes the need
for off-site transport.

88
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:52,266
For this reason, however,
greywater must be carefully managed

89
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:54,907
so that it does not
overload the technologies.

90
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:57,951
And, end use of some products
is still possible

91
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:00,005
with the use of water-based technologies,

92
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:02,513
but as before, requires careful planning.

93
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:07,406
In the next module I will present
the final section on system templates.
