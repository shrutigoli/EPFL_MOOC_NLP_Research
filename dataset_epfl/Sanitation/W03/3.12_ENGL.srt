00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,564
This week closes our overview
of sanitation systems,

2
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:12,086
and the many different 
sanitation technologies.

3
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:16,640
Next week, we go to the field 
and explore some of the case studies

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,460
of urban sanitation planning
and implementation,

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,437
and some of the lessons learned
at both neighborhood and citywide level.

6
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:28,541
In this week, we've looked at 
different sanitation systems

7
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:32,179
from the very simple to more complex ones,
like the one shown here,

8
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:36,700
System 8: Blackwater Transport to 
(Semi-) Centralized Treatment System.

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,157
We've introduced the different
functional groups

10
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:41,832
like the user interface,

11
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:43,991
the collection and storage treatment,

12
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,760
and we've also introduced
the input and output products

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,807
that come out of these
treatment technologies.

14
00:00:53,237 --> 00:00:56,292
Furthermore, we've taken
a closer look at

15
00:00:56,292 --> 00:01:00,447
some of the centralized and
(semi-) centralized treatment processes,

16
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:05,052
and dealt with issues like the
anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR),

17
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:07,733
or technologies like the anerobic filter,

18
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:08,862
the aerated pond,

19
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:10,336
or constructed wetland.

20
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:15,603
We've also looked at how the safely
treated output products

21
00:01:15,603 --> 00:01:18,045
can be used for reuse and disposal.

22
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:21,541
We've look at applications like
the application of urine,

23
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:27,315
the application of dehydrated feces
for compost or irrigation.

24
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:31,911
We've presented some off-site
decentralized treatment systems

25
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:35,928
like the pre-fab modular decentralized
wastewater treament plant shown here,

26
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:37,751
developed by BORDA,

27
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:42,099
or off-site centralized
treatment plants like this one,

28
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,885
the waste stabilization ponds
of Cuenca, in Ecuador.

29
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:49,374
Up next is our first on-line quiz.

30
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:54,311
Please take part to see and evaluate
what you have learned so far.

31
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,093
The hard deadline is
November 9th.

32
00:01:57,783 --> 00:02:00,929
And please also send us
your questions to the Forum.

33
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:03,486
We'll be collecting these
and answering them

34
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:07,589
during a Q&A studio session
in the last week of this course.

35
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:09,377
Looking forward to hearing from you.
