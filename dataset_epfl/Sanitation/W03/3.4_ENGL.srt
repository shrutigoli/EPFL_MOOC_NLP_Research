00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:08,058
Hello and welcome to this last module
on treatment technologies.

2
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:10,144
After reviewing the technologies

3
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,113
treating waste 
water and effluent,

4
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:14,419
we will now tackle 
a very important

5
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:17,812
but often neglected
topic: sludge.

6
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:21,156
Sludge in all its forms 
and all its names.

7
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:24,377
Faecal sludge, septage, 
secondary sludge.

8
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:27,319
One product: sludge.

9
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:32,625
Sludge is a very
variable product.

10
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:39,017
It can be fresh, old, 
stabilized, unstabilized,

11
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:42,099
thick, diluted, yellow, black.

12
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:45,354
What is sure is that it is 
much more concentrated

13
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:46,445
than wastewater.

14
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:50,970
Let's consider for example
faecal sludge, meaning

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,536
the sludge coming from on-site
sanitation technologies

16
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:56,765
such as pits or septic tanks.

17
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,103
The factors which influence 
the characteristics

18
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:03,190
of faecal sludge are the 
tank emptying technology

19
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,566
and the patterns of emptying,

20
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:08,322
the performance of septic tanks,

21
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:12,978
the intrusion of groundwater, temperature,

22
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:16,791
admixtures to faecal sludge ,
like grease, kitchen, or solid waste,

23
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:19,328
and of course, the storage duration,

24
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:22,355
which can last from months to years.

25
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:26,577
These characteristics have
practical implications for treatment.

26
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:28,963
For example, sludge
which is still rich

27
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,335
in organic matter 
and has not undergone

28
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:35,149
significant degradation
is difficult to de-water.

29
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:37,801
Conversely, sludge 
that has undergone

30
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:40,255
significant anaerobic degradation

31
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:43,507
such as from septic tanks
or ABRs - in other words,

32
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:47,323
which is stabilized,
is more easily dewatered.

33
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:51,178
All these factors influence
faecal sludge characteristics.

34
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,806
Faecal sludge is a very
variable material.

35
00:01:55,312 --> 00:01:58,538
Consequently, management
systems need to be designed

36
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:00,725
on a case-by-case basis.

37
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:03,723
The four main functions
of sludge treatment are:

38
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,171
the solid-liquid separation,

39
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,061
stabilisation,

40
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,514
dewatering or drying,

41
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:11,727
and pathogen reduction.

42
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:15,042
It is important to define 
the end use or disposal option

43
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:18,820
and select the appropriate 
treatment level accordingly.

44
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,283
Sludge will not be treated 
the same if it is to be used

45
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:24,409
for agriculture or in
a cement factory.

46
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,874
Potential beneficial end uses
are dry side as a fertilizer,

47
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:32,485
dry side as a fuel, 
or biogas.

48
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,456
For example,

49
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:36,787
the different treatment technologies,

50
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:40,580
can be categorized according to the four
functions which I just mentioned:

51
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:43,755
solid-liquid separation,

52
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:45,863
stabilization,

53
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:49,162
dewatering or drying, 
and pathogen reduction.

54
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:52,134
The technologies in dark yellow

55
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:54,476
are those which are commonly applied

56
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:56,000
for faecal sludge treatment

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,643
in low- and middle-income countries,

58
00:02:57,683 --> 00:03:00,441
and which are presented 
throughout this course,

59
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:04,537
some which already in Module 3.2.

60
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:07,715
The technologies in pale yellow,
on the other hand,

61
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:09,444
are mainly applied in Western countries

62
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:11,939
such as the filtre press,

63
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,828
or under investigation
in low- income countries,

64
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:18,547
such as the sludge pelletiser.

65
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:21,578
Please note that some technologies
may fulfill two functions,

66
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:26,679
such as the Imhoff tank or
the planted drying beds.

67
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,136
Let's start with the 
sedimentation thickness ponds

68
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:33,019
whose function is
solid-liquid separation.

69
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:35,973
Such ponds allow 
the sludge to thicken.

70
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,587
As the sludge settles 
and digests,

71
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:43,758
the supernatant must be decanted
and treated separately.

72
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:48,408
The thickened sludge can then
be dried or further composted.

73
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:51,858
Two tanks operated in parallel
are required so that one

74
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:55,319
can be operated while 
the other is emptied.

75
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:59,849
To achieve maximum efficiency,
loading and resting periods

76
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:02,767
should not exceed
four to five weeks.

77
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,992
The main drawback
is that the thickened sludge

78
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,641
needs to be removed
by a front-end loader.

79
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,661
This technology is relatively low-cost

80
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:13,328
but requires a large land area,

81
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:15,855
if possible, far from habitations,

82
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,332
as it generates odors and flies.

83
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,671
Let's now move to the most common
sludge treatment technology:

84
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:26,775
the unplanted drying bed.

85
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:28,429
The bottom of a drying bed

86
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:32,643
is lined with perforated pipes
to drain the leachate away.

87
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:37,688
On top of the pipes are layers of gravel
and sand to support the sludge.

88
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:40,740
The bottom layer should be coarse gravel,

89
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,401
and the top one, fine sand.

90
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,876
Thus, the liquid part of the sludge

91
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:48,872
can both infiltrate and evaporate.

92
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:52,692
The sludge, however,
is not effectively stabilized

93
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:55,582
and its pathogen content is still high.

94
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:59,494
According to the end use,
for example, as a fertilizer,

95
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:02,455
it must be further 
stored or treated.

96
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:05,655
Dried sludge can be removed
after ten to fifteen days,

97
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:08,179
according to the climate conditions.

98
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,497
After the unplanted drying beds,

99
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:13,543
let's move to the planted drying beds,

100
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:16,625
which is much better
at pathogen reduction.

101
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:18,926
The key improvement of the planted

102
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:20,923
over the unplanted drying beds,

103
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:25,760
is that they don't need to be desludged
after each filling and drying cycle.

104
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,192
The plants and their root
systems maintain the porosity

105
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:32,888
of the filter, which means that
sludge can be added

106
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:37,847
layers after layers, which imply also
a much longer retention time.

107
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:40,630
Thus, this technology leads
to a much better stabilization

108
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,789
of the sludge, which is partly
converted into humus.

109
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:50,005
The appearance of the bed is similar
to a vertical floor constructed wetland,

110
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:51,938
as we saw in the last module.

111
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,627
The filtrate flows down
through the filter

112
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,773
and is collected through
a drainage system.

113
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:00,560
Ventilation pipes connected
to the drainage system

114
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,337
contribute to aerobic
conditions in the filter.

115
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:08,763
When constructing the bed,
a free space of about 1 metre

116
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:13,897
should be left above the top
of the sand layer to account

117
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:17,507
for about three to five years
sludge accumulation.

118
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:21,032
Sludge should be applied
in layers between 75

119
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:26,466
and 100 millimetres thick
and re-applied three to seven days.

120
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:30,903
Obviously, plants are crucial
in planted drainbeds.

121
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,622
The start out and acclimation
phases are very important,

122
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:36,616
and requires much care.

123
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:41,496
Finally, let's have a look
at co-composting.

124
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:46,957
Co-composting is like compost,
but using mold and [inaudible].

125
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:51,317
In this case, sludge is added
to organic solid waste.

126
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:57,097
Composting is the aerobic
degradation of organics.

127
00:06:57,097 --> 00:07:02,214
It can be done in two ways,
either open or in vessel.

128
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:07,920
In open composting, such as shown
in this figure, the mix material

129
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,067
is piled into long
heaps or windrows

130
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:13,743
and left to decompose.

131
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:16,099
The piles are periodically turned

132
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,926
to provide oxygen and
ensure a homogenous treatment.

133
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:26,747
For de-watered sludge,
a ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 of sludge

134
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,175
to solid waste should be used.

135
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:31,580
Composts are simple,
but the mixture must

136
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,205
be carefully designed
so that it has the proper

137
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:39,166
carbon-nitrogen ratio,
moisture, and oxygen content.

138
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:43,709
Co-composting is quite labor
intensive, so it only makes sense

139
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:45,933
if there is a demand 
for the product

140
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,542
from customers that
are willing to pay.

141
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:51,436
To sum up, we saw that sludge
is a highly concentrated

142
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:53,838
and variable material.

143
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:57,217
Before constructing a faecal sludge
treatment plant, it is necessary

144
00:07:57,217 --> 00:08:00,436
to make a good assessment
of the initial situation in the city

145
00:08:00,787 --> 00:08:05,910
and estimate the characteristics
and quantities of the sludge to treat.

146
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,188
This can strongly influence
the choice of technologies.

147
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:14,132
For example, first sludge
from public toilets,

148
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,219
needs to be digested
and stabilized

149
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:19,359
with the possibility 
to produce biogas.

150
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:22,526
On the other hand,
sludge from septic tanks

151
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:25,036
is already digested
and usually ready

152
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:26,852
for de-watering or drying.

153
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:31,513
Faecal sludge management
requires an integrated

154
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:32,826
planning approach.

155
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:35,349
It is more complex than 
conventional systems

156
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:37,925
where a sewer network
brings the wastewater

157
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:39,472
to the treatment plant.

158
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:42,701
In faecal sludge management,
there are many more stakeholders

159
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:45,905
to bring on board, starting with
the manual and mechanical

160
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:51,657
service providers as 
discussed in module 2.8.

00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:54,224
For faecal sludge 
to reach treatment plants,

162
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:58,005
there are often new management
and financial schemes to be put in place,

163
00:08:58,065 --> 00:09:00,017
agreements to be reached,

164
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:03,619
and sometimes even new policies to draft.

165
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:08,311
Think about it.

166
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:12,097
To learn more about the different
sludge treatment technologies,

167
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:14,901
and about faecal sludge 
management planning,

168
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:18,028
we recommend you to refer
to Eawag Sandec FSM book,

169
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:21,560
which you can download
for free at the link below.

170
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,618
Finally, do not forget that
the sanitation system

171
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:26,356
does not end 
at the treatment plant.

172
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:30,376
A treatment plant also generates
products which need to be

173
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:33,907
disposed of, or in the
best case, re-used.

174
00:09:34,837 --> 00:09:38,620
How to dispose and how to use:
that's what you will discover

175
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,626
in the next series of modules
with Lukas Ulrich.

176
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:43,077
Enjoy.
