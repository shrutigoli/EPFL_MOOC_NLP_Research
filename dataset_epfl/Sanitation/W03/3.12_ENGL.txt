This week closes our overview of sanitation systems, and the many different sanitation technologies.
Next week, we go to the field and explore some of the case studies of urban sanitation planning and implementation, and some of the lessons learned at both neighborhood and citywide level.
In this week, we've looked at different sanitation systems from the very simple to more complex ones, like the one shown here,
System 8: Blackwater Transport to 
(Semi-) Centralized Treatment System.
We've introduced the different functional groups like the user interface, the collection and storage treatment, and we've also introduced the input and output products that come out of these treatment technologies.
Furthermore, we've taken a closer look at some of the centralized and
(semi-) centralized treatment processes, and dealt with issues like the anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR), or technologies like the anerobic filter, the aerated pond, or constructed wetland.
We've also looked at how the safely treated output products can be used for reuse and disposal.
We've look at applications like the application of urine, the application of dehydrated feces for compost or irrigation.
We've presented some off-site decentralized treatment systems like the pre-fab modular decentralized wastewater treament plant shown here, developed by BORDA, or off-site centralized treatment plants like this one, the waste stabilization ponds of Cuenca, in Ecuador.
Up next is our first on-line quiz.
Please take part to see and evaluate what you have learned so far.
The hard deadline is
November 9th.
And please also send us your questions to the Forum.
We'll be collecting these and answering them during a Q&A studio session in the last week of this course.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
