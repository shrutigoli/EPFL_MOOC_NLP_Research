00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:07,946
Hello, and welcome to this module
on waterless pit based systems.

2
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:11,321
In this module we're gonna discuss
three different system templates

3
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:14,617
that are similar because they're all
based on pit technologies

4
00:00:14,617 --> 00:00:16,366
that are mostly waterless.

5
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:19,664
The first system is called
the Single Pit System.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,518
Unsurprisingly,
it's based on a single pit.

7
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:26,333
So moving from left to right
and starting with the products,

8
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,095
we note that the two main products
are urine and feces,

9
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:31,360
as they have the thick lines
attached to them.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,459
The other products are optional,
or not necessary depending on the system,

11
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:38,947
but we'll have to consider those
as we move forward.

12
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:42,652
The first question we're presented with
is whether to choose

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,545
a dry waterless toilet
or a pour flush toilet.

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,125
The choice will depend on whether or not
there is water available,

15
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:55,107
but also whether or not there are
the resources and capacities

16
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:58,122
to build up the necessary infrastructure
that comes later.

17
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:02,775
It's important to note that although
we build up the system from left to right,

18
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:05,567
it is often necessary
to revise your choices,

19
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:07,996
and so, the process
can become quite iterative.

20
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:11,922
The key element of this system
is the single pit.

21
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:18,242
Either a basic pit or a VIP,
Ventilated Improved Pit design.

22
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:23,972
In both cases sludge will be produced,
so the quality of this sludge will vary,

23
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:26,992
of course, depending
on the user interface chosen,

24
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:31,361
the amount of water used, the lining
of the pit, and the soil conditions.

25
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,766
You can see on the diagram
that the sludge,

26
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:36,375
once it arrives for treatment,

27
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:41,273
will be split into two fractions:
the treated sludge, and the effluent.

28
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:46,671
Looking at this system template
is both interesting and important

29
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:50,570
because the first half,
the dryer toilet, plus a single pit,

30
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,238
is very, very common
in most parts of the world;

31
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,517
however, as we have discussed before,
the second half of this system,

32
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,313
the transport, treatment
and uses of the products

33
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:03,942
becomes quite complicated,
involves a lot of technical components,

34
00:02:03,942 --> 00:02:05,983
and potentially very difficult decisions.

35
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:09,906
The lesson here is to never assume
that a single pit system

36
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:11,160
is a simple system.

37
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,034
System two: Waterless Pit System
Without Sludge Production.

38
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:19,331
seems from the name
that it might be quite simple,

39
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:23,134
but in fact, it is complicated
by the variety of products.

40
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:27,122
This system is based
on the idea of alternating pits,

41
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:30,996
so either a double VIP or a <i>fosa alterna</i>.

42
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:35,091
You can see that organics,
shown here on the left,

43
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:38,008
is an optional product,
but it's not optional

44
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:42,145
if a composting chamber is chosen
for the collection and storage technology.

45
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:46,102
If the double VIP
or the <i>fosa alterna</i> is chosen,

46
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:48,150
no additional organics are needed.

47
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:52,288
The quality of the product that emerges
will, of course, be different

48
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,942
so the type of [inaudible]
you will have will influence

49
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,386
the collection and storage
technology that you choose

50
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,764
and of course,
the availability of the organics

51
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,914
as well as the willingness to add them

52
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:05,509
and the need to use the final product.

53
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:10,480
This application goal will essentially
determine your choices.

54
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:15,480
This is the template for the classic
urine diversion system.

55
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,106
It is interesting to look at this template
because it's not very straightforward.

56
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:21,437
There are multiple flow paths
to take into account,

57
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:23,768
and parallel technologies
that need to be designed.

58
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,327
Bear this in mind when you hear

59
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:29,114
that Ecosan or waterless sanitation
technologies are called simple.

60
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:33,036
The individual technologies may be,
but this system certainly is not.

61
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,603
In fact, we can see from this template
that although the actual toilet,

62
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:39,945
the urine-diverting toilet may be simple,

63
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:42,585
there are numerous parts
and products to consider.

64
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:46,226
Also, because the system is waterless,

65
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,992
the gray water
must be considered separately.

66
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:52,814
Whereas in other systems it could be
simply mixed in with the gray water,

67
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:58,732
here it remains entirely separate
through the duration of the process.

68
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:02,385
This system is not necessarily
complicated to build,

69
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:05,080
but it certainly requires
careful planning,

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,499
especially in terms of how
to use the final products,

71
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,091
so the stored urine and the dried feces,

72
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:15,206
and determine how they can be
either applied or disposed of.

73
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:18,548
Here is a photo from Durban, South Africa,

74
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:22,026
where you can see a whole community
with urine-diverting dry toilets.

75
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,916
Take a minute and see
if you can identify where they are.

76
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:29,531
Clearly, we have one in the front,

77
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:34,521
but there's also one here,
there's one here, there's one here,

78
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:37,502
there's one here, there's one here,
there's one here.

79
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:41,811
In fact, you could basically
spend the whole day identifying

80
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:44,724
the hundreds of urine-diverting toilets
that dot this community.

81
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:50,363
In this particular community, the urine
is collected in storage containers

82
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:52,722
and then collected
by trucks for recycling.

83
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,426
The dried feces that come out
of the storage chambers here

84
00:04:57,426 --> 00:04:59,601
are simply buried on site.

85
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:02,502
This is one of the technology
combinations that is possible

86
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,972
on the system template
that we just went through.

87
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,086
So in summary, waterless technologies,
or technologies like pour flush toilets

88
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:14,768
that do not require a lot of water
are not necessarily simple,

89
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:17,572
and the systems built
around waterless technologies

90
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:20,308
can in fact become very complicated.

91
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:23,667
System building is left to right,
but may require iteration,

92
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,377
especially when the needs and uses
of the products that remain

93
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:28,936
at the end of the system
are taken into account.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,870
In the next module, we'll take a look
at decentralized water based systems.

95
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:35,852
I hope you'll join me then.
