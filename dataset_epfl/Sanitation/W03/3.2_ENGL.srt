1
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:06,947
Hello and welcome to the
second module about treatment

2
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:08,631
In the last module,

3
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:11,246
we looked at the different
treatment stages

4
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:14,081
as well as pretreatment technologies.

5
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:17,130
We are now moving further along
the treatment process

6
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:20,130
and having a look at
primary treatment technologies

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,673
as well as anaerobic
technologies as a whole.

8
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,727
We saw already what primary treatment is.

9
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:28,858
Primary treatment is the separation
of the settleable solids

10
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:30,408
from the liquid part.

11
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,587
You learned about anaerobic processes

12
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:35,820
in module 2.7, presented by Lucas Ulrich.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,248
Anaerobic means processes that happen
without the presence of oxygen.

14
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:44,642
Anaerobic means literally, no air.

15
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:47,887
Anaerobic bacteria live
in the absence of oxygen

16
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:51,771
and transform the organic matter
into carbon dioxide or C02,

17
00:00:51,981 --> 00:00:55,898
and methane or stage four, 
also called biogas.

18
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,420
Anaerobic processes are used both

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,297
in primary and secondary
treatment technologies.

20
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:06,041
They are very efficient, 
especially in warm climates.

21
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:09,413
Sometimes smelly, but exciting isn't it?

22
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,299
Let's start with the 
primary treatment technologies.

23
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,883
Don't forget that for each 
technology that we present,

24
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,089
you will find more information here,

25
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,266
in the compendium.

26
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:23,112
For example, the settler.

27
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:31,118
The settler is the classical,

28
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:33,265
primary treatment technology.

29
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:35,418
It is designed to remove suspended solids

30
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:37,272
by sedimentation.

31
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:39,366
The low flow velocity in the settler

32
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,386
allows sediment particles

33
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:43,619
to sink to the bottom,

34
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:47,226
while the lighter constituents

35
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:48,734
will float to the surface,

36
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:51,086
forming the scum.

37
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:55,461
The outlet is placed between these two layers

38
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:59,003
in order to collect the settled effluence.

39
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:02,781
A settler may also be called

40
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:05,084
a sedimentation or septic tank

41
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,368
or in conventional treatment plants,

42
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,389
a clarifier.

43
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:14,803
Settlers can achieve an initial reduction
of up to 50% to 70% of suspended solids,

44
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,557
and up to 20% to 40% of organic material.

45
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,942
Settlers can be independent units,

46
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:23,568
or merged into other technologies.

47
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:26,363
Like in the septic tank that you saw before,

48
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:28,495
and others that we will see later.

49
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:30,779
The performance of settlers can be enhanced

50
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:32,377
by including inclined plates

51
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:35,090
called lamella or tubes

52
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,227
or with the use chemical coagulents.

53
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:40,858
Let's now have a look at the Imhoff tank.

54
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:43,284
The Imhoff tank is a primary 
treatment technology

55
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:45,673
that combines solid liquid separation

56
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:48,390
and digestion of the septic sludge.

57
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,460
Because there is sludge digestion,

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,497
there is production of biogas.

59
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:55,035
whose bubbles may disturb
the settling process.

60
00:02:55,195 --> 00:02:57,185
For this reason the flow tank,

61
00:02:57,785 --> 00:02:59,595
or settling compartment,

62
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,589
is designed with a "V" shape.

63
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,525
which prevents gas bubbles to come up

64
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:07,570
and fold them to the sides,

65
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,352
as well as the scum.

66
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:12,767
Depending on the design and conditions,

67
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,981
the Imhoff tank may have the advantage

68
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:17,501
to lead to good sludge stabilization.

69
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,032
which is not the case 
with the standard settler.

70
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:21,729
So to sum up,

71
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:24,385
the advantage of the Imhoff tank
over a standard settler

72
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:28,362
is the production of a more 
stabilized sludge, easier to treat.

73
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,534
The sludge removal frequency

74
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,328
is also much lower.

75
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:33,581
On the other hand,

76
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,979
it is a more complicated system to build,

77
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:39,121
it is quite a high or deep infrastructure,

78
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:43,437
and consequently, also more expensive.

79
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:47,768
That's it so far for the purely
primary treatment technologies.

80
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:50,033
Let's look now at anaerobic technologies

81
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:53,497
which also fulfill secondary treatment functions.

82
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:59,163
[inaudible] the ABR or anaerobic baffled reactor
and the anaerobic filter.

83
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:03,162
You may already have heard about
them in the module 2.7

84
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:07,482
as they can also function as a collection,
storage and treatment system

85
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,916
at building or neighborhood level.

86
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,370
Now we will consider them
as proper treatment units.

87
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:15,939
Same thing for the biogas reactor.

88
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,938
It was presented in Module 2.7 by Lucas Ulrich.

89
00:04:19,938 --> 00:04:23,302
Please refer to that module 
to learn more about it.

90
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:25,497
Let's talk about ABRs.

91
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:28,311
An ABR is a kind of improved septic tank,

92
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,382
with a series of baffles and a ridge
where the wastewater is forced to flow

93
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:34,604
The baffles can be replaced by tubes

94
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:36,013
as shown here

95
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:38,718
which is a hydraulic design improvement.

96
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,359
The settler can be integrated

97
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,956
to the ABR, or separate.

98
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:46,120
The wastewater is forced
to flow through the sludge

99
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,913
which is a thriving, active biomass.

100
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:52,103
The anaerobic bacteria
present in the sludge,

101
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:54,379
degrades part of the suspended matter

102
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,551
present in the wastewaster
passing through it.

103
00:04:56,551 --> 00:05:00,529
Usually the ABR counts between
three and six upflow chambers.

104
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:03,383
Upflow, because the water
flows in the bottom

105
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:06,784
to the top of each compartment.

106
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:11,187
The technical advantage is to
allow for contrary release of the gases.

107
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:14,059
In an ABR, the hydraulic retention time

108
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:17,289
is between 48 and 72 hours.

109
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,660
ABRs can be very efficient
to remove organic matter

110
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,454
with a reduction up to 90%.

111
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:25,976
The ABR presents many positive aspects

112
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:28,060
for low- and middle-income areas.

113
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,277
It has low operation and maintenance costs,

114
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:32,283
no electrical energy is required,

115
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:35,441
and it is resistant to organic
and hydraulic shock loads.

116
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:37,652
As for the sludge.

117
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:39,170
the retention time is long,

118
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,654
from six months to several years.

119
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:43,714
It is then well stabilized

120
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:45,704
and easier to treat further.

121
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:48,435
And sludging is not required frequently.

122
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:51,670
An ABR is quite compact
as shown here in Egypt.

123
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,493
What is more, it can be built underground,

124
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,419
which gives flexibility 
for their implementation.

125
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,408
They can even be implemented
under a garden or parking space.

126
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:04,539
However, if the ABR looks simple,

127
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:05,976
one should not forget that,

128
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,548
as all the treatment
systems presented here,

129
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:11,453
it relies on biological processes.

130
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:14,017
It is like a living organism.

131
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:16,445
The start up period is crucial

132
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:18,292
to reach an optimal performance

133
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:20,001
and requires expert follow up

134
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:22,159
at least for the first six months.

135
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,879
The ABR is particularly appropriate

136
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,022
for small-scale or sometimes called

137
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,400
decentralized wastewater treatment plants.

138
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,016
It is important to mention here

139
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,557
two opportunities linked
with such systems,

140
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:37,641
modularity and prefabrication.

141
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:40,628
Modularity, such as
represented in this figure

142
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:43,022
from the German organization BORDA,

143
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:45,475
provides much more flexibility

144
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:47,709
and a low symmetrical plant,

145
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,241
much closer to the needs,

146
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:53,582
with the possibility to add
further modules as the population grows.

147
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:55,801
The prefabrication of treatment units

148
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:58,300
allows for a much better quality control,

149
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,552
a material which stands better
in anaerobic wastewater.

150
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:05,127
It also dramatically reduces
the construction time.

151
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:07,507
Such units can be locally manufactured,

152
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:10,839
such as here in Indonesia.

153
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:14,545
Let's close this [inaudible]

154
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:16,714
and go back to our technologies.

155
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:18,879
Usually the effluence from an ABR

156
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:20,879
needs further treatment.

157
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,331
To improve its effluent quality,

158
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:26,511
a few compartments packed
with [inaudible} can be added.

159
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:29,793
These are known as an anaerobic filter.

160
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,837
Anaerobic filters can also be built

161
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:35,795
immediately after the settler,
as shown in this figure.

162
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,310
It works on exactly on
the same principle as the ABR

163
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,506
with the addition of filter media

164
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:47,142
like gravel, crushed rocks, cinder,
pumice or plastic chips.

165
00:07:47,362 --> 00:07:53,495
Typical filter material sizes range from
12 mm to 55 mm in diameter.

166
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:58,653
The ideal filter should have a large
surface area for the bacteria to grow,

167
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:01,062
with pores large enough
to prevent clogging.

168
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:02,818
As in th ABR,

169
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,613
the water flows from the bottom

170
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:06,459
to the top of the compartment

171
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,003
and the vent is installed on the top.

172
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,839
The water level should cover at least

173
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,825
0.3 meters to guarantee an even flow.

174
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:21,013
The filter is supported by a grid

175
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:24,494
so not as to clog the bottom
of the compartment.

176
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:26,345
The hydraulic retention time

177
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:28,972
is the most important design parameter

178
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:31,539
influencing the filter performance.

179
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,492
The hydraulic retention time of

180
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:36,588
12 to 36 hours is recommended.

181
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:40,440
Clogging is a main stress
in an anaerobic filter.

182
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,514
When the efficiency decreases

183
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,316
the filter must be cleaned.

184
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,606
This is done by running the system
in the reverse mode,

185
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:49,300
or if you prefer, backwashing.

186
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,668
Or by removing and cleaning 
the filter material.

187
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:54,201
This being difficult,

188
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,348
it is better to avoid clogging
as much as possible.

189
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:01,178
The picture here shows
four parallel ABRs and anaerobic filters

190
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:03,466
at a construction in India,

191
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:07,278
for a design capacity of 150 cubic meters,

192
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:12,284
which is equivalent to
about 1,500 inhabitants.

193
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:16,393
Let's now have a look at a more

194
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:19,421
sophisticated anaerobic technology,

195
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:22,772
the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor

196
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,959
or UASB.

197
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,471
The UASB is a single tank process.

198
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,621
Wastewater enters the reactor 
from the bottom,

199
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,187
and flows upwards.

200
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:34,866
A suspended sludge blanket

201
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:37,108
filters and treats the wastewater

202
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:39,344
in its early flow through it.

203
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:41,197
The sludge blanket is comprised of

204
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:43,994
small agglomerations of microorganisms

205
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:47,299
with a diameter of about 1 mm to 3 mm,

206
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,992
which because of their weight,

207
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:51,834
risk being washed out in the upflow.

208
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:55,610
Basically, the crucial point here is
to maintain its equilibrium

209
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,446
so that the sludge blanket does not settle

210
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:00,802
but is not washed out either.

211
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:03,680
That's what makes it a sensitive system.

212
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:09,167
An upflow velocity of 0.7 to 1 meter
per hour must be maintained.

213
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,528
During the digestion process

214
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,869
biogas is produced and goes up.

215
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:17,968
Critical elements for [inaudible] reactor

216
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:20,665
are the inflow and distribution system,

217
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:25,054
the gas solid separator,

218
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:32,091
and the effluent [inaudible] design

219
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,724
The UASB allows a high reduction of BOD,

220
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:39,341
can withstand high organic loads,

221
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:42,065
at least to allow low sludge production.

222
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:44,415
It requests high-strength wastewater,

223
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:47,139
and so it is often used for
industrial wastewater.

224
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,926
However, for it to run properly,

225
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:51,793
it needs skilled operators,

226
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,562
and a constant wastewater
supply and electricity.

227
00:10:55,646 --> 00:10:57,504
Developing the granular sludge

228
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:59,272
may take several months.

229
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:02,712
So expert follow up during
the start up period is very important.

230
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:05,572
To sum up, we consider anaerobic systems

231
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:08,362
are among the most efficient and compact.

232
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:10,545
They work at best in warmer climates

233
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,301
so are particularly appropriate

234
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,370
for tropical areas.

235
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,282
What is more,

236
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:17,284
anaerobic baffled reactors and filters

237
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:19,872
require very little operation
and maintenance.

238
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:24,762
However, if they are very performant
at removing organic matter,

239
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:27,645
they remove little pathogen and nutrients.

240
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,971
Thus, the effluence and the sludge

241
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,755
need further treatment.

242
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:33,899
In the next module we will review the

243
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,629
different aerobic treatment technologies.

244
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,745
See you then.
