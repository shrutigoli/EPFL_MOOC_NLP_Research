1
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:07,258
Hi, and nice to see you again!

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,847
We now arrive
at the last functional group

3
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:13,405
which describes the technologies
for use or disposal

4
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:15,487
of the sanitation end products.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,197
The use and disposal technologies
are split in two modules.

6
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:24,665
Now I will discuss the use of products
as fertilizers and soil conditioners.

7
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:27,265
In the following lecture,
we will be looking

8
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:30,663
at what can be done with effluent
and other products.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,599
In this module, I will show you
how products can be used

10
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:39,007
as fertilizer and/or soil conditioner
in agriculture,

11
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:42,556
and I will explain
what the difference is between the two.

12
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:45,978
In order for the agricultural
use to be safe,

13
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:50,579
it's important that measures
are in place to control the exposure

14
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:52,621
and manage the health risks.

15
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:57,674
I will give you a brief introduction
of the so-called <i>multi-barrier</i> concept.

16
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:00,986
When a single pit fills up,
it is often abandoned

17
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:03,182
and its content, left to degrade.

18
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:06,822
<i>Fill and cover</i> describes the way
of disposing of the pit content

19
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:08,876
by leaving it where it is.

20
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:13,478
A so-called <i>arbor loo</i> is the simplest way
of upgrading this solution

21
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:16,097
and making use of the nutrients
contained in a pit.

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,053
After moving the toilet superstructure
to a new site,

23
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:23,626
the full pit is covered
with a layer of earth

24
00:01:23,757 --> 00:01:25,883
and a tree is planted on top of it.

25
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:29,269
The photo on the left shows a banana tree

26
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:33,592
that grows vigorously on the nutrients
of an abandoned pit in Malawi.

27
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:37,480
Papaya is the one from Zimbabwe
on the right side

28
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:40,728
and guava have also
proven to be successful.

29
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:43,278
Compared to the arbor loo,

30
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:45,611
there are more targeted
and more effective ways

31
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:48,318
to use the nutrients
contained in human excreta.

32
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:53,011
Urine, for example, is nutrient-rich
and normally sterile,

33
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:56,940
and can therefore be used
as a liquid fertilizer when diluted.

34
00:01:57,606 --> 00:02:00,918
Its nitrogen to phosphorus
to potassium ratio

35
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:03,980
is similar to that
of conventional fertilizers.

36
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,128
Dehydrated feces, peat humus and compost

37
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,517
typically contain
lower levels of nutrients,

38
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:15,781
but are rich in organic matter and/or
decomposed organic matter.

39
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:19,112
They have good
soil conditioning properties,

40
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:23,827
meaning that they enhance the water
and nutrient retaining properties of soil.

41
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:26,432
We therefore call these products

42
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,978
soil conditioners,
rather than fertilizers.

43
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:32,336
As you know from the previous lectures,

44
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:35,158
the properties of sludge
can vary greatly.

45
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:40,027
Sludge may be seen
as a both fertilizer or soil conditioner

46
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:42,695
depending on its form
and characteristics.

47
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:47,376
Before applying excreta-derived
products in agriculture,

48
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,172
we should be sure it is safe,
and put in place

49
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:52,267
adequate health protection measures.

50
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:56,539
The World Health Organization
published guidelines for the safe use

51
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:59,149
of wastewater, excreta and greywater

52
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:02,859
with detailed recommendations
for different products and conditions.

53
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,881
You can find those guidelines
on our Courseware page.

54
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,433
The guidelines promote
a multi-barrier approach

55
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:13,884
for managing the health risks
related to the use of excreta.

56
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:20,201
In other words, WHO recommends
to put in place several barriers if needed

57
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:24,064
in order to reduce the health risk
to an acceptable minimum.

58
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:30,029
The figure shows different barriers
between toilet and food consumption

59
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:31,759
for the case of urine use.

60
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:36,715
For example,
treatment mechanisms like storage

61
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:39,576
can decrease the number
of pathogens in urine

62
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:44,860
and the use of protective equipment
reduces contact.

63
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,846
Maintaining those barriers
helps to control exposure

64
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:50,790
and to keep the health risks low.

65
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:55,589
I have taken this figure
from the very useful publication called,

66
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:59,490
<i>Practical Guidance on the Use
of Urine in Crop Production</i>

67
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,068
which can also be downloaded
from the course page.

68
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,004
In these pictures you can see
the fertilization with stored urine

69
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:08,916
and its effect on plant growth.

70
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:13,130
Urine that has been diluted
with water can be applied to plants

71
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,708
either manually or using troughs.

72
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,763
A three to one mix of water and urine

73
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:21,149
is an effective dilution for vegetables

74
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,509
although the correct amount depends
on the soil and the type of vegetables.

75
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,912
In the pictures at the bottom,
you can see impressive trials

76
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:32,055
with maize and spinach,

77
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,248
with and without urine fertilization.

78
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:39,022
The photos here show how
the content of a dehydration vault

79
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:42,640
is brought to a field
to be used as a soil conditioner.

80
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:46,752
As you can see, ash was used
as a cover material

81
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:49,302
Hence the grayish color of the material.

82
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:55,171
If the end user is hesitant about using
the dehydrated feces on his or her fields,

83
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:59,626
the possibility could be
to further store and compost the material

84
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:02,483
before application as shown
on this picture here.

85
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:07,107
Those two pictures here
show the excavation of humus

86
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,049
from <i>fosa alterna</i> pits,

87
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,373
after one year or more of storage.

88
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:16,405
In this photo you can see human excreta
after thermophilic composting.

89
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:21,807
Both humus and compost can be used
as soil amendments in gardening.

90
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:24,415
For example, when planting a new tree.

91
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:27,398
In the case of sludge
we have to distinguish

92
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:31,981
between the application
of liquid and solid sludge.

93
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:37,257
Liquid sludge can be, for example,

94
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,973
the [digestate] from biogas reactors
as shown in this photo from Morocco.

95
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:47,888
Solid sludge can originate
from unplanted drying beds, for instance.

96
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:52,317
The characteristics of the sludge
and how it has been treated

97
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:56,657
determine the necessary health precautions
and application strategies.

98
00:05:57,128 --> 00:06:00,833
As we have seen from the examples
presented in the last few minutes,

99
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,665
improved soil quality and higher yields
are two clear benefits

100
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,936
from the agricultural use
of excreta-derived fertilizers

101
00:06:07,936 --> 00:06:09,782
and soil conditioners.

102
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:14,527
Besides that, the controlled application
can contribute to reducing

103
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,829
the environmental degradation
through uncontrolled discharge

104
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:20,032
and to closing the nutrient loop.

105
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:23,731
Ideally, resource recovery
should be the economic driver

106
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:26,463
of the sanitation chain,
but the market value

107
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:28,946
of the different products
is quite low.

108
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:32,559
Research is currently going on
in order to develop

109
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,947
higher market value end products.

110
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:41,004
WHO's multi-barrier approach
helps to control exposure to pathogens

111
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:44,584
and to minimize health risks
associated with the use

112
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:47,102
of end products of a sanitation system.

113
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,369
WHO guidelines should be consulted
for specific guidance.

114
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:56,398
In the following module I will talk
about the use and disposal

115
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:59,257
of treated effluent
and a few more products.
