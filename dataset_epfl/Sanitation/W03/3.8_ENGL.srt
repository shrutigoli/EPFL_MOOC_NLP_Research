00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,582
Hello and welcome to this module
on building sanitation systems.

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,208
In this module, we are going to combine

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:10,224
everything that was covered
in the previous modules,

4
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:13,205
the products, the functional groups,
and the technologies,

5
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:14,834
into complete systems.

6
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:17,598
The goals of this module are to first,

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,665
introduce what a santitation template is,

8
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:24,434
second, to understand how to
work with the sanitation template

9
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:27,103
by following the flow paths
of each product

10
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:30,060
and then selecting each technology
for each functional group,

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,215
and finally, to be able to build
a complete, logical sanitation system.

12
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,614
This is an example of what we call
our system template.

13
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,569
We will discuss each of the parts
in detail as we progress,

14
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:46,131
but for now, let's focus on the products.

15
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:48,750
The products, as you will remember,

16
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:50,884
are the materials that flow through

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,069
and are generated
within the sanitation system.

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,161
We read the system template
from left to right.

19
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,416
On the left, you can see a list of the
products in the first column:

20
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:05,634
input products.

21
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:10,130
You can identify the products
by the rounded side and the color,

22
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,927
as well as the name, of course.

23
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:15,237
You can see that there are lines
connecting the products

24
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:17,434
to the rest of the elements
in the diagram.

25
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:21,515
These lines indicate the flow path
of the particular products

26
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:24,848
so it shows you what technology
the product will pass through.

27
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,938
You can see also that there are
two thicknesses of lines.

28
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:31,182
The thicker black lines are those which
are most commonly followed

29
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:33,248
and should be considered as
the most important.

30
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:37,458
The thinner lines are those that are
somewhat less important or optional.

31
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:39,693
For example,

32
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:44,210
the main products are
feces, urine and flushwater.

33
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:46,843
These are all connected together

34
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:51,866
with a thick black line that flows
into the first red box.

35
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:53,879
We'll talk about these boxes later,

36
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,408
but for the moment,

37
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:58,904
look at the bottom of the products,
and look at the anal cleansing water

38
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:01,338
and the dry cleansing material.

39
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:04,393
These two products both have
thin lines attached to them

40
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:06,252
because realistically,

41
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:10,719
they're not the most important
thing to consider.

42
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:14,147
Also, you'll notice that the thin line
goes in two directions.

43
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:16,273
up and across here.

44
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:18,908
That means that the products can go

45
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:21,905
either to this first technology box
over here,

46
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:25,343
or be mixed in with the products above.

47
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:30,293
The choice would basically depend
on the local context and conditions.

48
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:34,374
It's worth stressing here
that although we use system templates

49
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:36,766
to help us guide
the decision making process,

50
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:39,293
they cannot solve all of your problems.

51
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,826
There's still a fair amount
of context specific information

52
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:44,474
and engineering,

53
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:47,191
that's needed to build a proper system.

54
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:51,669
What we can also see are the
products that are within the system,

55
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,433
blackwater for example.

56
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:58,159
Fecal sludge is another example
of a product

57
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,055
that did not go into the system.

58
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:02,763
Notice it was nowhere here on the left.

59
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:07,424
Fecal sludge, like all the other products
that you can see within the system,

60
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:10,074
emerged from different technologies.

61
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:13,447
Some of the products will emerge
in the same form as they entered

62
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:15,476
and some of them will be transformed,

63
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:17,946
like how urine, and feces, and flushwater

64
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:22,717
were transformed into
fecal sludge and effluents.

65
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:25,295
Now we are going to focus
on the functional groups.

66
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:28,828
The titles of each functional group
are listed across the top

67
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:32,085
and are color coded
in the way they were before.

68
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:36,367
Within each functional group column
there are technology boxes.

69
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:38,738
Each technology box,

70
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:41,238
under each functional group heading,

71
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,790
lists the possible technology choices

72
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,915
for that functional group,
for that product.

73
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,329
In essence, it is like a matrix.

74
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:54,250
The products are listed on the left
and are flowing from left to right.

75
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:57,805
The functional groups are the columns,

76
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,067
and where the functional groups

77
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,443
intersect with the product paths,

78
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,505
for example here,

79
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,306
the technology options
are listed in the technology boxes.

80
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:16,017
You will notice that there is not
a technology box

81
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:17,630
for every functional group.

82
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:22,053
Not every product requires a technology
from every functional group.

83
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:24,313
Gray water, for example,

84
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:27,445
does not enter the system
through the user interface.

85
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:28,800
Remember it comes in

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,908
from another water source
in the house, but not the toilet.

87
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:37,210
Therefore, the gray water
bypasses the user interface

88
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:39,114
and enters the sanitation system

89
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,178
directly at the point
of collection and storage.

90
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:47,214
In this case it could be a septic tank,
an AVR, or an anaerobic filter.

91
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:50,131
Your job therefore, as the engineer,

92
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:53,052
is to follow each product
along its flow path

93
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:55,964
until it intersects with a
relevant functional group

94
00:04:55,964 --> 00:05:00,621
and then choose the most appropriate
technology from the options listed.

95
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:04,842
The choice will depend entirely
on the local context and conditions.

96
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:08,931
Let's actually do that now
and select the technologies

97
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:12,327
that we will need to form
a complete sanitation system

98
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,430
using this template as an example.

99
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:17,813
Normally, we would know
much more about the population,

100
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:20,295
but in this case we are going
to have to make some assumptions.

101
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:24,109
Let's assume that the population
is made up of wipers,

102
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:26,651
and that they throw paper in the toilet,

103
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:28,960
so we don't need
a separate technology for it.

104
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:32,978
Our gray cleansing material
will follow this light line

105
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:36,010
and mix it in with our urine,
feces and flushwater.

106
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:40,024
The urine, feces and flushwater,
along with the toilet paper,

107
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:42,554
will all flow into the user interface,

108
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,840
and here we have two options.

109
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,756
We can either choose a pour flush toilet
or a cistern flush toilet.

110
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:53,379
Let's, for the case of this example,
choose a pour flush toilet.

111
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:56,998
Here it is, we've marked it down

112
00:05:56,998 --> 00:06:00,357
so that we can build our system
and continue from here.

113
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:04,359
Once all the products
go into our pour flush toilet,

114
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:08,042
they are mixed together
and referred to as blackwater.

115
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:11,185
The blackwater
needs to be collected and stored.

116
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:16,095
So here, it flows into the collection
and storage functional group

117
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:19,265
and again we see
we have three choices,

118
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:22,699
a septic tank, an AVR,
or an anaerobic filter.

119
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,095
Let's say that we were designing
for a small group of houses

120
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:28,880
and there's a little bit of space,

121
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,917
so we want to install something
that 's a little bit robust

122
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:35,030
that can handle the variation
of the blackwater inflow

123
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,092
and we decide
on an anaerobic baffled reactor.

124
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:42,031
Here it is, we've selected it

125
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:45,433
for this technology interface.

126
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:48,654
The AVR creates two different products,

127
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:51,984
the effluent and the sludge
which settles to the bottom.

128
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:57,933
The effluent, which is created constantly,
needs to continually leave the system.

129
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:02,041
In our example, let's say
we have a bit of space

130
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,998
so we can pipe our effluent
into a soak pit shown here.

131
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:10,523
The effluent will infiltrate through,
and because we have some space,

132
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:12,516
will be absorbed by the soil

133
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:17,397
without any real impact
on the surrounding area.

134
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:21,421
So we've taken care of the effluent,
we've followed it through.

135
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,659
Now we need to deal with the sludge.

136
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:30,683
The sludge that accumulates into the AVR
will need to be emptied periodically.

137
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:32,696
So let's assume

138
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:37,040
that we are working in an area
that has emptying businesses

139
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,841
that own and operate pump trucks

140
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,062
to suck out and transport
the accumulated sludge.

141
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:44,646
Here's our truck,

142
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:49,593
it's come along and it is emptying
this layer of sludge from our AVR.

143
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,020
The truck will now need to transport it.

144
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,548
We're lucky in this case,

145
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:59,840
because there is a functioning
treatment plant dedicated for the sludge.

146
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,714
It happens to be based
on a planted drying bed.

147
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:07,309
Here we can see the planted drying bed

148
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:12,412
with the truck emptying the sludge
into the grit chamber.

149
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,919
The sludge will be layered
on top of the filter.

150
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:24,267
The effluent will filter
through the porous layers beneath

151
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:26,974
and will come out on this side.

152
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,547
The sludge, as it accumulates,

153
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,279
will dry and be turned
into a dry sludge product.

154
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:44,323
This dry sludge that comes off
will need to be taken care of in some way.

155
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:46,441
So what we're actually going to do

156
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:49,724
is just give it away
to some of the local farmers

157
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,740
so that they can use it
as a soil ammender

158
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,118
and help to improve the porosity
and water storing properties of the soil.

159
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,718
Remember however,
the planted drying bed

160
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:04,464
produces two products,

161
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:06,412
the dried sludge
which we've given away,

162
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,423
but also the effluent
which comes out here,

163
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:14,332
and which needs further treatment.

164
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:16,694
What we're going to do

165
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:20,695
is dump it into one of the small,

166
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:24,666
local waste stabilization ponds
that happens to be nearby.

167
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,270
Quite lucky for us, but also,
a very useful technology.

168
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:35,217
So the effluent from the planted
drying bed that we have here

169
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,419
will flow into our waste
stabilization plant.

170
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:40,833
Now as a final step,

171
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:44,016
we need to get rid
of all this effluent somehow,

172
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:45,619
so what we're going to do

173
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:51,375
is we're going to actually put fish
into a final finishing pond

174
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:53,598
and dilute that effluent

175
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,470
so that we can grow fish

176
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:59,235
and hopefully generate
some revenue in the process.

177
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:01,951
Of course, we could have chosen

178
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,910
different technologies
at each step for every product

179
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,882
so this is just one of many
possible combinations.

180
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,433
But still you can see
how we linked

181
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:15,682
all of the technologies
for each of the products

182
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,189
all the way through to the very end.

183
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,414
Furthermore, this is just one template.

184
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:26,213
The choices we have were limited
because of the type of input products

185
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,502
and the logical sequence of technologies

186
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,123
that were specific to this template.

187
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:34,111
In summary, the system template

188
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,055
is like a matrix of products
and functional groups.

189
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:40,334
Technologies are selected
by following flow paths

190
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:44,100
that guide each product
through the necessary functional groups.

191
00:10:44,383 --> 00:10:46,918
There are a variety of technologies
that can be chosen

192
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:49,627
so the ultimate decision
is based on the context,

193
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:52,610
the designer,
and the end use objectives.

194
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:56,877
In the next section we will discuss
the nine different templates

195
00:10:56,967 --> 00:11:00,535
that include nearly every possible
technology combination.
