1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,124
The goals of this module
are to first, know what the

2
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:11,040
five functional groups are;
secondly, to understand why

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,293
we use functional groups
for sanitation system planning;

4
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:18,282
and finally, to be able to identify
what functional groups some simple

5
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:20,238
technologies belong to.

6
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:25,300
Before we begin on functional groups, 
let's quickly review what a system is.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,347
A system is a set of things working
together as parts of a mechanism

8
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:33,617
or an interconnecting network;
a complex whole.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,169
Building a complex whole requires
a way of organizing all of the parts

10
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:42,967
so that you're not putting the pieces 
out of order or using more pieces than you

11
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:43,880
actually need.

12
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:47,343
Let's start with the example 
of a computer.

13
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:51,277
First, you need some way to control it:
a mouse or a keyboard.

14
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:56,241
Then you need some way to see the output.
There's a variety of options here.

15
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:59,935
There needs to be some way 
to power the computer.

16
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:03,396
And of course, some way to store 
and process the information.

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,812
These categories could also be called
functional groups.

18
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:12,748
They help us to categorize the components
so that we include all the necessary parts

19
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:15,700
but don't end up with too many 
that aren't necessary.

20
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:19,221
The same is true with the functional
groups for sanitation planning.

21
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:24,156
The first of the five functional groups
that we will discuss is called the

22
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:25,199
user interface.

23
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:29,914
In this, and subsequent lectures, we will
always use the same color for each of the

24
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:31,183
functional groups.

25
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:34,823
The user interface in our lectures 
will always be red.

26
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:39,360
The user interface, just as in our
computer example, is how you

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,421
physically interact with the system.

28
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:46,805
It is where the products enter the system
so basically, the toilet.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,099
But there are many different types
of toilets.

30
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,740
You can see five examples of different 
toilets here.

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,737
Some use water, some do not; but because
they all serve the same function they are

32
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:03,381
all categorized into the user interface
functional group.

33
00:02:04,894 --> 00:02:08,867
The collection and storage functional 
group contains all the technologies that

34
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:14,155
collect and store the products that enter
into the sanitation system at the user

35
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:14,969
interface.

36
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:20,326
A simple pit latrine is an example of a 
technology from this functional group.

37
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:25,392
It stores the excreta and the toilet paper
and doesn't do anything else.

38
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:28,772
It doesn't provide any type of treatment,
for example.

39
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:30,396
It just collects and stores.

40
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,087
One of the most important but least 
considered functional groups is the

41
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,504
conveyance group.

42
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:40,463
Technologies in this category are 
responsible for the movement of products.

43
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:44,758
The trucks that move fecal sludge that we 
saw in the last module on products will

44
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:46,730
belong to this functional group.

45
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:49,988
Big sewers that run beneath 
cities and transport black water

46
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:51,378
are another example.

47
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:55,536
The fourth functional group is where most
of the treatment takes place.

48
00:02:56,334 --> 00:03:00,588
It is important to remember that a system
may include two or more technologies

49
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:04,511
from the same functional group; 
or on the other hand, maybe none.

50
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:09,014
Depending on the number and composition
of the products that enter the system

51
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,702
several parallel or sequential 
technologies may be required

52
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:14,986
from this treatment functional group.

53
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:19,398
Treatment for sludge and effluent
for example would be parallel treatment

54
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:21,767
technologies that would be required.

55
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,344
The final functional group is called 
Use or Disposal.

56
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:29,811
This is a special functional group 
because it includes not just technologies

57
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:32,048
but also processes or actions.

58
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:37,745
The application of urine, for example,
after it has been stored and hydrenized

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,126
can be applied as a liquid fertilizer 
to crops.

60
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,878
The application of urine therefore
would be considered as part

61
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:45,544
of this functional group.

62
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,952
Let's look at a really simple system 
and see how the functional groups

63
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:53,717
can be used to help explain 
what's going on.

64
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:58,717
In rural areas of low-income countries
where there is little water but a lot

65
00:03:58,717 --> 00:04:02,726
of space, a simple squatting slab 
like this one can be placed over

66
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:03,632
a deep pit.

67
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:09,542
The slab is the user interface and the
pit, as you can see being built here,

68
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:13,493
is a technology from the collection 
and storage functional group.

69
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:19,013
This simple system requires technology 
from only two functional groups.

70
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:26,321
The sanitation system that exists across
most of Europe consists of a flush toilet

71
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:30,333
connected to a sewer; the sewer 
transports the black water to a waste

72
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:34,029
water treatment plant where it is treated
to an acceptable quality before it is

73
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:34,879
discharged.

74
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:39,176
Here we can see that the system requires
a combination of technologies from three

75
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:40,944
different functional groups:

76
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:46,174
User interface, conveyance, and treatment.

77
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:51,482
What about the dense urban areas 
of low-income countries?

78
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:55,521
How many functional groups would 
be needed to design a sanitation system

79
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:56,104
here?

80
00:04:56,736 --> 00:05:00,730
In fact, there's no single answer 
to this question, as there are many

81
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,151
different factors and constraints
that need to be considered

82
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,972
on a case-by-case basis.

83
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,925
The rest of this course will focus on 
thinking about the challenges and possible

84
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:12,851
solutions for urban areas 
in low-income countries.

85
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:17,932
In fact, the sanitation systems required 
can become quite complex so the

86
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:22,250
functional groups will become very useful
in helping us to organize and select the

87
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,692
technologies that will be needed 
to build a complete system.

88
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:31,505
Here we can see a schematic of a dense
area with different technologies in place.

89
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:35,646
The technologies are color-coded to match
the functional groups that they came from.

90
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:39,672
First, you can see a pour-flush squatting
slab.

91
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,770
The black water from here flows into a 
septic tank.

92
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,460
It is collected and stored until it can be
transported by the pump truck

93
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,692
to the fecal sludge treatment plant.

94
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,300
Once the sludge has been treated, 
it can be mixed into soil to improve

95
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,459
the quality and potentially be used
in agriculture.

96
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:02,355
This is just one possible design, but it 
demonstrates a system that includes

97
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:06,112
technologies from each of the functional
groups and illustrates how they can be

98
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,133
put together.

99
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:13,473
So, to summarize, we build our sanitation
system using technologies from five

100
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:18,128
different functional groups, but not every
system requires a technology from each

101
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,362
functional group.

102
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:23,645
The dense urban areas in low-income
countries are complex and, as such, there

103
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:27,970
is no strict formula for how to design
them, but we can use functional groups

104
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,395
to help organize and plan an appropriate
system based on the products

105
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:34,800
and technologies that we have available.

106
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,948
The next module will introduce you
to the different technologies that belong

107
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,868
in each of the functional groups.
