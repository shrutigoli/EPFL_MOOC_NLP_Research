00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:13,103
In this lecture, we are going to look at
technologies for on-site blackwater and

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:08,613
Hi...and welcome to the third module,
on collection and storage technologies.

3
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:17,503
greywater management, including the
septic tank and the biogas reactor.

4
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:21,524
These technologies are based on
anaerobic processes, and I will just

5
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:23,198
explain what that means.

6
00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:28,558
The word 'anaerobic' describes 
biological processes that occur in the

7
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:30,308
absence of oxygen.

8
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:34,398
These processes naturally take place in
swamps, marshes, ponds and other

9
00:00:34,404 --> 00:00:38,404
standing water bodies.
They can easily be recognized

10
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:42,417
by the formation of gas bubbles,
as shown in these beautiful photographs.

11
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:46,417
The gas is formed, for example, at the
bottom of a pond, where the anaerobic

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,710
bacteria decompose carbon-rich organic
substances into methane and carbon dioxide

13
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:54,724
(also called 'biogas').

14
00:00:55,086 --> 00:01:01,036
The gas bubbles then rise to the surface.
In cold areas, where the lake surfaces

15
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:04,055
freeze in wintertime, it can
sometimes be observed that

16
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:08,395
the bubbles get trapped below the ice
surface, as shown on the two pictures

17
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:09,364
on the right side.

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,240
In wastewater engineering, we
often talk about 'anaerobic digestion.'

19
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:21,499
The term 'anaerobic digestion' refers
to the degradation and stabilization of

20
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:25,719
organic matter by microorganisms without
oxygen, leading to production of biogas.

21
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:30,545
Both anaerobic and aerobic processes
are used for wastewater treatment.

22
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:35,601
The aerobic ones need aeration systems to
provide enough oxygen and are technically

23
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:36,691
a bit more complex.

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,950
They are, therefore, not so commonly
used at the collection and storage level.

25
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:45,418
We will introduce those technologies later
in the collectors about centralized and

26
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:47,498
semi-centralized treatment.

27
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:51,655
So much for an introduction to the
general processes. Now we want to look

28
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:53,383
at a few technologies.

29
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:57,711
The septic tank is among the most
widespread onsite sanitation technologies.

30
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,885
There are two important things you
have to know about the septic tank.

31
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:06,651
First - it is a water-tight tank,
typically made of reinforced concrete,

32
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:11,523
polyethylene or fiberglass and,
second - it has an outlet, through which

33
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:17,197
the clarified effluent leaves the tank.
In practice, people are not always aware

34
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:18,727
of those two aspects.

35
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:23,191
They may even call an open-bottom pit
a septic tank, which is actually wrong.

36
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:27,805
Blackwater and greywater 
enter the tank through an inlet T.

37
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:33,923
Settleable solids fall down to the
bottom, where they accumulate as sludge.

38
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,449
With time, the sludge undergoes 
some stabilization by anaerobic digestion.

39
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:43,618
It has to be removed every 3-5 years.

40
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:47,942
Floatable substances move up to
the surface, forming a scum layer.

41
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:52,498
The effluent from the clearwater zone, in
the middle, flows out through an outlet T

42
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,750
and is then typically infiltrated,
for example, in a leach field.

43
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:02,235
One or two separation walls in the
tank can improve the solid / liquid

44
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:04,114
separation process.

45
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:09,629
The good thing about septic tanks is
that they are passive and do not require

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,270
electrical energy to function.
This makes this technology quite robust.

47
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,221
Construction is relatively costly but
the technology has a long service life

48
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:21,528
and requires little maintenance.

49
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:25,568
The costs for mechanical 
emptying, however, may be considerable.

50
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:30,183
Little space is required because this
technology is typically built underground.

51
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:34,913
On the negative side - it has to
be mentioned that the removal of

52
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:39,838
pathogenic organisms, suspended matter,
organic substances and nutrients is

53
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:43,856
relatively low, therefore, the
effluent, as well as the sludge,

54
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:47,693
require further treatment
and / or appropriate discharge.

55
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,900
To ensure optimum performance of the
septic tank, it has to be regularly pumped

56
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,690
as shown in the photo.

57
00:03:56,518 --> 00:04:01,458
An anaerobic baffled reactor, or ABR, is
like an improved version of a large

58
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:06,288
septic tank. Its functioning is very
similar, but it is equipped with baffles,

59
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:11,582
which form several anaerobic chambers
to remove and digest organics and improve

60
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:18,392
the treatment performance. The treatment
can be further improved by providing 1-3

61
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:22,392
fixed-bed filter units, which helps to
trap non-settleable suspended particles

62
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:26,369
and provide an increased
surface for microbial growth.

63
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:29,275
This technology is called 
"anaerobic filter."

64
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,270
An ABR, or an anaerobic filter, can be
installed at the small scale for on-site

65
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,269
collection and treatment, but also
at semi-centralized or centralized

66
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,401
treatment level.

67
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:43,683
More detailed explanations 
of these two technologies

68
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,823
will be provided in module 3.2.

69
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:49,917
In the septic tank, ABR 
(or anaerobic filter),

70
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:54,188
the gases produced in the anaerobic
processes are just released into the

71
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:58,373
atmosphere because their quantities
are relatively low. The biogas reactor,

72
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:04,444
or anaerobic digestor, however, is
designed to generate as much biogas

73
00:05:04,444 --> 00:05:08,431
as possible and to capture and collect
it, so that it can be used as a renewable

74
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:11,451
energy source for
cooking or other purposes.

75
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:15,467
The blackwater from a toilet can be
directly connected to the digestor.

76
00:05:15,838 --> 00:05:21,767
In order to produce significant amounts of
biogas, additional inputs like cow dung or

77
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:26,137
organic solid waste, are
normally mixed in at the inlet.

78
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:30,351
The substrate flows into the reactor,
where it has a retention time of,

79
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,951
typically, 15-to-25 days.

80
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:38,319
The biogas collects in the dome at
the top of the reactor, and is transported

81
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:43,423
to the point of use, through a gas pipe.
When new substrate is added to the reactor

82
00:05:43,437 --> 00:05:49,617
or when the gas pressure rises, the
digestate flows into the expansion chamber

83
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,649
from where it can be removed.
In the photos, you can see some examples

84
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:59,277
of different biogas reactor designs.
Picture on the upper left shows a thick

85
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:04,517
stone reactor under construction. This is
another thick stone digestor, similar to

86
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:09,971
the one previously shown the drawing.
As you can see, the space requirement is

87
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:13,905
quite low, because it
can be built underground.

88
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,817
On the right side, you can see a
floating dome reactor, where the

89
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:23,157
gas storage can move up and down,
depending on the gas volume inside;

90
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:29,385
and this one here is a biogas stove.
This technology has the clear benefit that

91
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:33,444
no energy is required for operation,
but energy is actually produced.

92
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:38,815
A high reduction of organic
matter and particles can be achieved.

93
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:43,811
The digestate is almost odorless and
still contains all the nutrients, so it

94
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:49,111
can be used as an excellent fertilizer,
however, the agricultural application

95
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:53,874
has to be done correctly and carefully
because the digestate may still contain

96
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:57,914
some pathogens.
This technology has many benefits

97
00:06:57,914 --> 00:07:02,114
but its success depends on correct
implementation by experts, proper

98
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:05,354
operation and regular maintenance.

99
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:09,392
We have seen that there are several
anaerobic technologies that are robust

100
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:13,142
and easy to operate for on-site
treatment of blackwater and greywater.

101
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,879
I want you to remember
two things from this module:

102
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:21,621
First - septic tanks can be a good 
solution but it is important that the

103
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:25,931
effluent is properly disposed of and
that the sludge is regularly removed.

104
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:30,665
The second thing that I want you to
remember is that the biogas reactor

105
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:35,775
can be an attractive technology, but the
economic benefits do not mean that it is

106
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:39,995
always automatically successful.
Whether or not the initial investment

107
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:44,058
costs can be recovered will depend on
the correct design and implementation

108
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,830
and their motivated operator.

109
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,019
That was it. We've gone through the
technologies of the functional group,

110
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:52,699
Collection and Storage.

111
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,187
Now - my colleague, Philippe Raymond,
will take over to talk about the different

112
00:07:57,187 --> 00:08:01,307
technologies on transport, or conveyance.
