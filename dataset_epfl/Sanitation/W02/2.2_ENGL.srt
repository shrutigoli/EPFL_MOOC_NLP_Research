1
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:07,104
Hello, and welcome to this module
on sanitation products.

2
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:10,505
My name is Elizabeth Tilley,
and I'll be presenting this module

3
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:13,358
as well as the next one
on functional groups.

4
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:16,928
In this section, we're going to talk about
the different types of products.

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,584
So the different liquids and solids

6
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:21,003
that go into and out
of a sanitation system.

7
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:23,457
We have three goals in this module.

8
00:00:23,664 --> 00:00:26,143
The first is to understand
why it is important to consider

9
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:29,168
a range of sanitation products
when you're planning a system.

10
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,828
Secondly, is to learn about what those
different products are.

11
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:35,570
And third, is to be able
to describe the characteristics

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,287
of each of those products,
so we know how to best treat

13
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:40,344
and potentially use them later on.

14
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,986
Typically, when we think about sanitation,
we think about two things, pee and poo.

15
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:49,291
So the liquid and solid excreta that
come out of our bodies.

16
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:52,179
But in reality, there are a lot more
elements to consider.

17
00:00:52,977 --> 00:00:56,436
Certainly, urine and feces are two
of the most important aspects to consider.

18
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,017
But there are also many other materials
that make the sanitation system work.

19
00:01:00,482 --> 00:01:02,033
Flush water, for example.

20
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,820
You can't have a sewer system without
water to transport the urine and feces,

21
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:09,915
and in many dry cities around the world
there is simply no flush water,

22
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:13,554
and therefore, you would need to consider
a different form of transport.

23
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,716
There are other products
that are generated

24
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:17,435
throughout the sanitation system.

25
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:20,182
Sludge, for example,
is the thick, mucky layer

26
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:22,249
that forms at the bottom of a septic tank.

27
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:27,547
Sludge, because of its high solids content
and viscosity, may be difficult to pump,

28
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:32,050
but it is also easily dried, and therefore
can be used as a soil amender.

29
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:34,501
We'll come back
to these examples later on.

30
00:01:35,604 --> 00:01:39,428
Here is a fairly comprehensive list
of the products that should be considered

31
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:41,046
when planning a sanitation system.

32
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:43,778
There are others of course
that are not listed here,

33
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:46,728
but we'll focus on these ones
for the remainder of this module

34
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:48,042
and throughout this course.

35
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,693
Let's start with primary products.

36
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:56,555
Primary products, or the input products,
are those that enter the sanitation system

37
00:01:56,555 --> 00:01:57,903
at the very beginning,

38
00:01:57,903 --> 00:01:59,603
so they enter through the toilet.

39
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:02,128
Products of course, do not stay separate,

40
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:03,927
so they get combined and diluted.

41
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:06,883
They take on different names
as this happens.

42
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:10,223
First we have urine, and feces.

43
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:14,254
The name for these two things
together is excreta.

44
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:20,956
If you just add flush water to the feces,
this is referred to as brownwater.

45
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:25,968
Brownwater only exists when urine
is separated at the source,

46
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:28,921
and we'll talk more about this later
in the module on technology.

47
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,409
When anal cleansing water,
so that's the water that's used

48
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:36,125
for washing instead of toilet paper,
or dry cleaning material,

49
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:38,471
are mixed in with the excreta
and flush water,

50
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:41,284
the whole mixture is referred to
as blackwater.

51
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:44,044
You may have heard of the term
"waste water" before,

52
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:46,168
but blackwater is a more descriptive term,

53
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:50,076
and because any sort of unneeded water
could be called waste water,

54
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:51,611
we prefer the term "black water"

55
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:53,072
to be more specific.

56
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:56,931
Greywater is the other water
that's discharged from the house,

57
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:59,870
and may include
all the other types of water

58
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,869
that are generated in the kitchen
or from laundry, or from hand washing.

59
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,832
Here in this photo,
from Maputo, Mozambique,

60
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:14,183
we can see two men collecting water
in small storage containers.

61
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:19,408
If you can imagine the water it would take
to flush a toilet constantly

62
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:23,094
in order to transport
all of the household wastes in a toilet,

63
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:25,425
you can imagine how much work
would be needed

64
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:27,742
to collect the quantity of water required.

65
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,569
It's one of these examples

66
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,377
where we would have to think
of a different transport system

67
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:36,748
for the products that would be entering
into the sanitation system.

68
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:40,202
Here we can see
the different characteristics

69
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:41,917
of greywater, urine, and feces.

70
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:46,265
Looking first at volume, we see that
the quantity of greywater generated

71
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:47,883
per person is immense.

72
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:51,873
Whereas the volume of feces,
only 50 liters per person per year,

73
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:53,310
is relatively tiny.

74
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:56,803
We can see also that the majority
of the nutrients,

75
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:59,565
nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium,

76
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:03,969
are in urine, with a smaller amount
in feces and very little in the greywater.

77
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:08,553
In the last row, we can see the quantities
of fecal coliforms that are present,

78
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,958
and clearly, they are concentrated
in the faeces.

79
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,261
Greywater has what may
be a surprising amount,

80
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:17,235
and these come mostly
from hand washing and showering.

81
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:19,702
Urine, you'll notice, has none.

82
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,307
The small star indicates that urine
is pathogen free in the bladder

83
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:26,427
of healthy people, so pathogens
in urine that is collected

84
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:29,048
outside of the body maybe
still be pathogenic.

85
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:33,245
In summary then, we have
large quantities of greywater,

86
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:35,443
with relatively no nutrient value.

87
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:38,762
Urine, which is generally clean,
and nutrient rich,

88
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,878
and a very small amount of feces,
that are highly pathogenic.

89
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,808
Knowing all of these characteristics
can help us decide on the best ways

90
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:49,696
to store, transport, and use
the products in our sanitation system.

91
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:53,644
Secondary products are those products
that are generated

92
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:57,383
within the sanitation system,
because of some type of transformation.

93
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,333
If you store urine for long enough,
so about a month or so,

94
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,506
the pH and ammonia concentration
with increase to the point

95
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:06,662
that it becomes self-sterilising.

96
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:10,503
So that means that most of the pathogens
in the urine will be destroyed,

97
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:13,283
and that urine can safely
be used as a nutrient source.

98
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,821
All that's needed for this type
of transformation is time.

99
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:23,952
Similarly, faeces can be dried,
simply in the presence of time and heat,

100
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:27,967
and once fully desiccated,
the feces will be,

101
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,508
depending on the temperature
and storage time, quite hygienic.

102
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:35,991
These processes, however,
are only applicable to the products

103
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:37,380
if they are separate.

104
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:41,277
If excreta is left in a pit,
remember the mixture

105
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:46,508
of urine and feces, and is allowed
to degrade naturally and slowly over time,

106
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:49,238
the resulting product would be
an organic material

107
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:51,813
not unlike compost or humus.

108
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,460
Blackwater, on the other hand,
is a mixture of all the things

109
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,433
we discussed before,
feces, flush water, toilet paper,

110
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,801
and after time, or with some
kind of physical process,

111
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:05,137
the solids with separate,
so that you'll be left

112
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:08,897
with two new products:
a semi-clarified effluent,

113
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:11,017
and a dense sludge of the solids.

114
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:15,287
Here we can see a bit
of what the sludge looks like.

115
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:18,357
It's a thin sludge,
but it's still a typical sludge.

116
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:22,883
These are trucks that have collected
the sludge from septic tanks

117
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:27,357
or pit latrines, and are discharging it
onto an empty field, which unfortunately,

118
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:28,647
is not uncommon.

119
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:33,570
Fecal sludge must be removed constantly
from many household level technologies,

120
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,269
and yet there are few treatment processes
available that are able to treat it.

121
00:06:40,262 --> 00:06:42,849
Here is a great example
of a sludge drying bed.

122
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,196
The sludge trucks from the previous slide
would come here, dump their sludge

123
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:49,204
onto one of these dedicated drying beds.

124
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:52,830
The beds are made from layers
of gravel and sand.

125
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:56,938
The sludge layer is applied on top,
and the solids stay on the sand layer

126
00:06:56,938 --> 00:07:00,049
and dry out under the sun,
while the effluent percolates

127
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:03,289
through the sand and down
through the gravel, where it's collected.

128
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,352
The effluent, don't forget,
is another new product

129
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:09,600
that must be treated in a separate process
before it can be discharged

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,972
into the environment.

131
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:15,577
In the same way that sludge
settles to the bottom of blackwater,

132
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:18,239
lighter particles will rise to the top.

133
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:23,575
FOGS: fats, oils, grease, and surfactants,
F.O.G.S.

134
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:28,312
is the name given to all the frothy scum
that floats to the top of a wastewater,

135
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:30,093
particularly greywater.

136
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:35,480
FOGS generally comes from the cooking fat
and soaps that are used in the kitchen.

137
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:39,001
FOGS can clog pipes and pumps
if it's not removed early

138
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,535
in the sanitation chain.

139
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:44,246
Here, you can see a nice example
of a simple interceptor tank

140
00:07:44,705 --> 00:07:49,841
that prevents the FOGS
from entering into the small pipes.

141
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:53,981
After some time, that little strainer
on the left will be used to remove

142
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:57,543
the FOGS and keep the small
interceptor functioning well.

143
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:02,790
Most of the products that we've discussed
so far are materials that are pathogenic

144
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,727
or harmful to the environment
in some way,

145
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:06,709
but the products
we're going to talk about here

146
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,673
are ones that can be produced
by a sanitation system,

147
00:08:09,673 --> 00:08:11,386
and are actually beneficial.

148
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:15,742
Compost, or humus,
can be created with the dry fecal sludge

149
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:19,594
we saw in the earlier slide,
simply by processing it

150
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:22,469
with some sort of organic material,
like market waste.

151
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:26,665
Biogas, which is the result
of anaerobic digestion,

152
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:30,857
and consists mostly of methane,
can be collected and used as a fuel

153
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:32,288
for cooking and lighting.

154
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:35,970
These types of beneficial products
are not difficult to produce,

155
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,806
but they must be considered in the early
stages of sanitation planning

156
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:44,333
so that the most value from the system
can be obtained without waste.

157
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:51,382
Here we see a diagram and an example
of a fixed dome biogas reactor.

158
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,639
So just wrapping up
what we've discussed so far:

159
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,433
There are a lot of products besides
pee and poo that need to be considered.

160
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:02,938
Each product will contain a different
quantity and variety

161
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:06,865
of nutrients and pathogens, which will
influence the treatment requirements

162
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:08,823
and also the potential use options.

163
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:13,080
The volume of each product
will great influence how it's transported

164
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,735
and treated within the sanitation system.

165
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:19,860
The range and type of products
in a sanitation system

166
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,125
will determine the number, type,
and sequence of technologies

167
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,484
that will be needed in the final design.

168
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:28,259
Choosing these technologies

169
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:30,605
will be discussed
in the following modules.

170
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:34,116
In the next module, I will discuss
the functional groups,

171
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,687
and I hope you will join me then.
