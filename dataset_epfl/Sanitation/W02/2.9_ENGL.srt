00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:06,468
Hello and welcome
to the second module

2
00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:09,279
on conveyance 
and transport technologies.

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,341
In the last presentation,

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:14,603
we took a closer look 
at container based technologies

5
00:00:14,603 --> 00:00:17,857
and got a glimpse into 
manual and motorized emptying

6
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:20,239
of on-site sanitation systems.

7
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:24,544
We will now look at 
the different types of sewer systems.

8
00:00:24,727 --> 00:00:28,065
We distinguish between 
three categories of sewer systems.

9
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:34,552
The simplified sewer system, or so-called
shallow or condominial sewer system,

10
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:39,809
the solids-free sewer system, or so-called
settled or small-bore sewer system,

11
00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:42,978
and the conventional
gravity sewer system.

12
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:46,672
Basically, the differences
between the three systems

13
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,735
can be summarized 
in terms of the size,

14
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:50,667
the depth,

15
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:52,899
and the slope of the pipes.

16
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:56,670
Let's have a closer look 
at these three systems.

17
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:00,754
The best known system
is the conventional gravity sewer.

18
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:05,591
Conventional gravity sewers 
are large networks of underground pipes

19
00:01:05,697 --> 00:01:10,557
that convey black water,
gray water, in many cases stormwater,

20
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:13,587
from the houses 
to the wastewater treatment plant,

21
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:16,889
using gravity and often pumping stations.

22
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:21,454
The sewer is designed so that
it maintains self-cleansing velocity,

23
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:25,853
which means guaranteeing a flow that will
not allow particles to accumulate.

24
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:31,563
Access manholes are placed 
at set intervals above the sewer

25
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:36,018
at pipe intersections, 
and at changes in pipeline direction.

26
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:39,122
When the sewer 
also conveys storm water,

27
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:41,655
which is known as combined sewer,

28
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:43,939
sewer overflows are required

29
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,022
to avoid hydraulics charge
of the treatment plant.

30
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:52,154
However, nowadays, a separate
drainage system for rainwater,

31
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:56,037
or local retention and infiltration, 
are recommended instead,

32
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:59,495
which leads to cheaper 
and more efficient systems.

33
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:04,665
Conventional sewers involve 
less maintenance than the other systems

34
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:08,065
but are very expensive 
and require major works,

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,433
like shown here in Egypt.

36
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:16,701
The costs can reach often more than 60%
of the cost of the entire sanitary systems,

37
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,778
the treatment plant included.

38
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:23,747
Operational costs may be high as well,
depending on the pumping requirements.

39
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:27,386
For this reason, it is often
a too expensive

40
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:30,399
and capital intensive option
for low income contexts.

41
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:33,965
Wherever possible, simplified sewer
systems should be preferred,

42
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:38,895
as it is 20% to 50% less expensive
than conventional sewers

43
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:40,789
and much easier to implement.

44
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:43,761
A simplified sewer
describes a sewage network

45
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,682
that is constructed 
using smaller diameter pipes

46
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:48,888
laid at a shallower depth,

47
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:51,548
and at a flatter gradient 
than conventional sewers.

48
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:55,853
Simplified sewer can be installed 
where there are no heavy traffic loads,

49
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,715
for example within a condominium,

50
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,105
in narrow allies, or at or near sidewalks.

51
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,848
Thus, they allow
for a more flexible design at lower costs.

52
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:10,369
Some of the main differences 
with conventional sewers

53
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:15,121
are the minimum depth, which is 
about 70cm instead of 80cm,

54
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:20,164
the minimum gradient, 
which is about 0.5% instead of 1%,

55
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,732
and the minimum diameter of the pipes,

56
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:27,457
which is about 100mm
instead of 200mm to 300mm.

57
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,186
Another important difference

58
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:31,724
is that expensive manholes
are unnecessary.

59
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:38,506
Instead, simple inspection chambers, 
or clean-outs, are sufficient.

60
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:42,148
Inspection boxes are also 
built for each house connection.

61
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,838
Simplified sewers are especially 
appropriate for dense urban areas

62
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:49,569
where space for 
on-site technologies is limited,

63
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:51,508
such as in this picture.

64
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:54,554
The drawback of the lower gradient 
and diameter of the pipes

65
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:57,924
is that repairs and removal 
of blockages are more frequent.

66
00:03:57,924 --> 00:04:01,794
However, this can be done 
easily by locals at little cost.

67
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:05,252
Such a system can be 
operated by the community itself.

68
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,582
It is important that the users

69
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:10,913
avoid disposing trash 
or other solids into the system.

70
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:16,054
In all cases, occasional flashing is
recommended to ensure against blockages.

71
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:20,269
The last option is the solids-free sewer system.

72
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:24,318
As its name indicates, 
the specificity of the system

73
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:28,786
is that solids are separated 
before entering the sewer system itself.

74
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:31,047
This is done at house level.

75
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,322
For example,
with single chamber septic tanks.

76
00:04:34,832 --> 00:04:39,260
Removing the solids dramatically reduces
the risk of deposition and plugging.

77
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,080
Thus, there is no need for a minimum 
flow velocity and for a minimum slope.

78
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,548
This system 
can even bear negative slopes,

79
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,803
as long as the downstream end
is lower then the upstream end.

80
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,647
A minimum diameter of 75 mm 
is required to facilitate cleaning.

81
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,103
Storm water must be
excluded in this system.

82
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:02,749
The critical point is, of course,
is not to let solids in.

83
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:05,011
For that purpose, it is very important

84
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:07,786
that the interceptors
are regularly de-sludged.

85
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,486
Solids-free sewers

86
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:12,780
are the least expensive
of all sewer systems.

87
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:17,551
However, it requires good training 
and acceptance by the users.

88
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:20,564
Otherwise, the risk of failure is high.

89
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,928
The choice of the appropriate sewer system
is a trade off between the price

90
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,005
and the maintenance requirements.

91
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:31,651
Conventional sewers 
lead to little maintenance problems.

92
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:35,136
However, the price is often prohibitive.

93
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:39,579
On the other hand, 
simplified and solids-free sewers

94
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:43,750
are much less expensive, 
but requires more inputs from the users.

95
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,706
In summary, 
the conveyance technology choice

96
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:49,882
generally depends
on the following factors:

97
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:53,364
The type and quantity 
of product to be transported,

98
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:55,747
the distance to cover,

99
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,978
the accessibility,

100
00:05:58,077 --> 00:05:59,425
topography,

101
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:01,875
soil and groundwater characteristics,

102
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,127
the financial resources,

103
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,680
the availability of service providers,

104
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:09,160
and management considerations.

105
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:12,800
To conclude this module 
on conveyance technologies,

106
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,877
it is important to know that

107
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:20,333
if sewer systems are often seen
as the gold standard target to reach,

108
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:25,004
it does not always make sense 
to use water to convey excreta in sewers,

109
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:27,298
especially in water scarce areas.

110
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:30,859
Non-sewered systems 
are sometimes the best option.

111
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:35,945
In the next module, Chistoph Luthi
will sum up the learnings from the week.

112
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:40,275
As for me, I will join you again
for the treatment technologies.

113
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,037
See you then.
