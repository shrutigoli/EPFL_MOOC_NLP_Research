00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:08,289
In this second week
of our sanitation course

2
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:11,303
we presented sanitation products,

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:14,331
the five functional groups
of the sanitation chain,

4
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:19,008
and finally, a first introduction
to different sanitation technologies.

5
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:22,725
The primary input products
are those that are, for example,

6
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:26,331
generated by us human beings,
such as urine or feces.

7
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:31,349
Secondary output products
are those that are generated

8
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,805
as a function of storage
or treatment of different products.

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,424
Example, compost or pit humus.

10
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:42,030
We also provided an overview

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,388
of the different terminology
that we use in sanitation

12
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:49,345
differentiating between
blackwater and greywater

13
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:52,690
and between blackwater,
brownwater, and excreta,

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,332
and what is often confused, the difference
between urine, feces, and excreta.

15
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:01,974
We then went on to propose
the five functional groups

16
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:04,928
used to categorize sanitation technologies

17
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:08,883
starting in red on the bottom
with the user interface,

18
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:12,187
going on to the collection
and storage in orange,

19
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:14,654
the conveyance in yellow,

20
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:18,241
the semi-centralized treatment in green,

21
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:24,460
and finally, the use and disposal
of the treated waste.

22
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:28,837
In the second part of this week,
we've provided an overview

23
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:30,610
of different technologies,

24
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,520
starting with the user interface or toilet

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,882
and we showed a number of different
toilets that are used around the world --

26
00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:42,488
dry toilets, UDDTs, urinals
or pour flush toilets.

27
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,319
We then went on to present different
collection and storage technologies

28
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,411
as the one shown here, the single
ventilated improved pit on the left,

29
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:57,892
or the double ventilated improved pit,
VIP, on the right.

30
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:02,206
We also presented some of the more
advanced anaerobic treatment technologies

31
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,747
such as the biogas reactor,
shown on the left,

32
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:08,424
or the septic tank, shown on the right.

33
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:12,588
Finally, we also provided an overview

34
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:16,052
of different transport
and conveyance technologies

35
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,654
ranging from the non-sewered,
motorized emptying and transport

36
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:24,559
shown here on the left,
to simplified sewers or sewers in general,

37
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,980
like the one shown here in Nepal.

38
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:33,142
Next week we'll be looking
at different sanitation systems

39
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:38,570
and providing an overview
of sanitation technologies, part two.
