1
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:06,563
Hi!
My name is Lukas Ulrich

2
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,915
and I am an Environmental Engineer.

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,405
I work at the Department Sandec
at Eawag

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,721
in the research group on Strategic
Environmental Sanitation Planning.

5
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:21,763
In this module we will start looking
at the different technologies

6
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:24,804
which can be used to design
a sanitation system.

7
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:30,313
We will go through the technologies,
functional group by functional group,

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,501
from the user interface
to final disposal or end use.

9
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:38,667
In this course we cannot cover
all technologies in detail,

10
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:41,593
but we will give a brief introduction
to most of them.

11
00:00:42,786 --> 00:00:45,845
If you would like to learn more
about a specific technology,

12
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:49,167
I recommend you to read
the corresponding section

13
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:52,485
in the Compendium of Sanitation
Systems and Technologies.

14
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:56,895
The Compendium provides
a double-page description

15
00:00:56,895 --> 00:01:01,316
with further explanations
for 54 different technologies.

16
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:07,701
So, let's get started with the first
functional group: the User Interface.

17
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:13,538
The User Interface describes
the type of toilet, pedestal, pan,

18
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:16,797
or urinal with which the user interacts.

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,876
It is the way by which the user
accesses the sanitation system.

20
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:23,945
The user interface must guarantee

21
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:28,352
that human excreta is hygienically
separated from human contact

22
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:31,334
to prevent exposure
to fecal contamination

23
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:33,429
In this module, you will get to know

24
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:37,368
which different user interface
technologies there are,

25
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:38,962
and how they function.

26
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:43,037
You will learn which input products
they can deal with,

27
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:45,807
and which output products they generate.

28
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:49,758
You will also find out
what needs to be considered

29
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:54,284
to choose and design a user interface
for a specific context.

30
00:01:54,642 --> 00:02:01,255
So, let's take a look
where our friends Pee and Poo can go.

31
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:07,760
The oldest and most widespread
user interface option is the dry toilet.

32
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:12,012
In its simplest form,
it consists of a slab with a drop hole

33
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:15,708
and possibly footrests
to provide some user guidance.

34
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:20,032
This design is suitable
for those who prefer to squat.

35
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:25,619
For users who prefer sitting on a toilet,
a pedestal can be installed.

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,873
Let's take a look at the products
which can go into a dry toilet,

37
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:35,282
and what comes out of it.

38
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,797
Obviously, feces and urine
go into the toilet.

39
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:42,704
Anal cleansing water
and dry cleansing materials

40
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,203
can also possibly be input products;

41
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:50,418
however, they do not always occur,
and for some subsequent technologies,

42
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,096
it is not recommended
to put them into the toilet.

43
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:59,912
This is indicated by the grey font
and the dashed lines.

44
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:06,360
Whether anal cleansing water
or dry cleansing materials occur or not,

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,704
of course, depends
on the user preferences.

46
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,645
As you can see on this diagram,

47
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:14,772
flush water is not listed
among the inputs.

48
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,197
That is why we call it "the dry toilet".

49
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:23,528
When urine and feces are mixed,
they are called <i>excreta</i>.

50
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:27,530
This is the principal output product
of a dry toilet.

51
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:31,324
Depending on the local context,

52
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:34,454
anal cleansing water
and dry cleansing materials

53
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:38,004
may be mixed into it, indicated by the "+".

54
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:44,349
This way of structuring the input
and output products of a user interface

55
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,617
may seem unnecessarily complex,
but when we design a sanitation system

56
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:54,118
it allows us to select
a compatible technology which can follow.

57
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,935
In this case, the subsequent technology
should be able to deal with excreta

58
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:01,487
as an input product.

59
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:07,208
In these photos, a few different
dry toilet designs are shown.

60
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,695
You can see
that different materials can be used,

61
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:13,836
from wood, which may be
a bit difficult to clean,

62
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:18,796
to concrete, and prefabricated plastic.

63
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:22,815
Also, the drop hole
can take different shapes.

64
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:26,942
The keyhole design, for example,
is a very common one.

65
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:32,382
A round slab has the advantage
that it can be rolled.

66
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:37,456
For example, to move it to a new pit
when the old one is full.

67
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:43,676
A lid may provide a certain barrier
against odors and flies,

68
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,147
but is not always recommended, especially
for subsequent collection technologies

69
00:04:49,147 --> 00:04:51,197
which need to be ventilated.

70
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:54,827
Now, let's look
at another type of dry toilet,

71
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,629
the Urine-Diverting Dry Toilet or UDDT.

72
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:03,249
This option allows
to separately collect urine and feces.

73
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:09,539
The one I have here
is a plastic model from China.

74
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:16,176
It has a lid which a user can open
with one foot, and close again.

75
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,915
The special thing
about this user interface technology

76
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:23,489
is that it has
kind of a funnel in the front

77
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,315
where our friend Pee can go.

78
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:33,597
For our other friend, Poo,
there is the drop hole at the back,

79
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:35,521
where he just can jump in.

80
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:45,034
This technology option
is of particular interest

81
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:48,447
for those who want to use
the normally sterile

82
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:52,732
and nutrient rich urine
as a fertilizer in agriculture.

83
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:57,671
A Urine-Diverting Dry Toilet
can be designed in various ways

84
00:05:57,671 --> 00:06:00,688
to suit the preferences
of almost all users.

85
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:04,947
It can be a squat model,
as the one from China I showed,

86
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,618
or it can be a pedestal to sit on.

87
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:13,758
For those who use water to cleanse
rather than dry cleansing materials,

88
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:16,619
designs exist which have a separate bowl

89
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:19,270
for the collection
of anal cleansing water.

90
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:28,336
The input products of a urine-diverting
dry toilet are exactly the same

91
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:30,540
as for the regular dry toilets.

92
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,463
The difference can be seen
in the output product,

93
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:40,175
where pee and poo stay separate
and do not form excreta together.

94
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:43,626
Depending on the dry
cleansing materials used

95
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:46,458
and the subsequent collection technology,

96
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:50,854
dry cleansing materials may go
into the drop hole with the feces.

97
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:55,713
Anal cleansing water
is never mixed with feces,

98
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:57,956
because they should always stay dry.

99
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:02,540
Where anal cleansing water is used,
it should always be collected

100
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,281
in a separate compartment of the toilet
and disposed of separately.

101
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:16,563
These pictures show a wide range
of different urine-diverting dry toilets

102
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,931
with squatting models above,
and sitting models below.

103
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:29,137
Urine-diverting dry toilets can be made
of ceramics, concrete, or plastics.

104
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:34,558
They can even be self-made
using a funnel and a bucket

105
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,934
as shown in this image here.

106
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:43,527
Where men prefer to stand for urination
rather than sitting or squatting,

107
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:48,242
it can be a good idea to install a urinal
to collect their urine.

108
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,438
Urinals also exist in different designs,

109
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:56,354
and they can be
water-flushed or waterless.

110
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:02,889
Inputs include urine, and in case
of flush models, also flushwater.

111
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:07,814
Depending on the design, urine emanates

112
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:12,099
in undiluted form,
or diluted with flushwater.

113
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:15,618
Especially where the urine
is collected in a tank

114
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:18,653
and where it is supposed
to be used as a fertilizer,

115
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:23,301
it is recommended to collect it
without dilution, to reduce the volume.

116
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:27,426
Urinals can take a variety of shapes,

117
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:31,651
and are usually made of materials
like plastics or ceramics.

118
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:35,287
All the urinals shown here
are waterless ones,

119
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:40,672
except this one here, which has later on
been retrofitted to be waterless

120
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:43,785
by closing all the holes
in the drain except one

121
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:45,662
to limit the odor emissions.

122
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,627
Waterless urinals should always
be fitted with an odor seal,

123
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:53,483
such as the rubber one
shown in this picture.

124
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,898
There are also designs for women,

125
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:59,670
but they are not widely available
and implemented.

126
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:04,475
Those two here on the right side
are female designs.

127
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:09,187
The next technology
is the Pour Flush Toilet.

128
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,408
It has its name from the bucket

129
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:16,102
that is used to pour water
into the bowl to flush it.

130
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:20,457
Pour flush toilets
should be equipped with a U-bend,

131
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:25,558
also called S-trap or gooseneck,
which acts as a water seal.

132
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:30,083
This seal effectively prevents
odors or insects

133
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,657
from returning to the user interface.

134
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:36,356
In addition to the input products

135
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:39,324
that we already had
for the dry toilet options,

136
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:43,665
the pour flush toilet depends
on a source of flush water to function.

137
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:49,344
The product that comes out
of the user interface

138
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:54,088
is the mix of excreta, flushwater,
and possibly anal cleansing water

139
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:56,924
or dry cleansing materials,
called <i>blackwater</i>.

140
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:03,352
Pour flush toilets
are mostly made of ceramics

141
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,912
and typically in the squatting design.

142
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,466
Pour flush sitting toilets
have also been developed,

143
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:12,464
but they are not
widely available and implemented.

144
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:16,585
The Cistern Flush Toilet or water closet

145
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:20,812
is another very widespread and well-known
water-based user interface.

146
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:25,493
It also has a water seal, and is equipped
with a water-filled cistern.

147
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:29,639
When the user operates the flush mechanism

148
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,186
the water from the system
is released into the toilet bowl

149
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:36,193
to carry away the excreta
to the next functional group.

150
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:39,804
Both sitting and squatting models exist.

151
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:45,509
The input and output products
of a cistern flush toilet

152
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:46,896
are exactly the same

153
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,203
as those previously shown
for the pour flush technology.

154
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:53,928
Blackwater is also generated as an output

155
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:57,784
but normally in larger quantities
than in the pour flush toilet,

156
00:10:57,784 --> 00:10:59,771
due to the higher water use.

157
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:04,876
Cistern flush toilets exist
since more than two centuries,

158
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,874
but only became
a popular industrial product

159
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:09,831
in the late 19th Century,

160
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:12,486
with its worldwide spread
starting from Europe.

161
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,834
As you can see on the right-hand side,

162
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:18,687
flush toilets looked
quite different in the beginning

163
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:20,718
from how we know them today.

164
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:23,741
The urine-diversion principle

165
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:26,536
has also been applied
to the cistern flush toilet

166
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:30,993
as urine-diverting flush toilets
were developed in more recent years.

167
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:36,749
This user interface technology is equipped
with a bowl for the collection of urine

168
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:41,174
and with a water seal through which
the feces are carried away.

169
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:45,755
There are designs with valves
which close during the flush

170
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,658
to collect undiluted urine.

171
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:52,283
Other designs do not prevent
a small quantity of flush water

172
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:54,227
from entering the urine pipe.

173
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:59,132
The urine-diverting flush toilet has,
again, the same inputs

174
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:02,890
as a pour flush system
or a cistern flush toilet:

175
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,587
Feces, urine, flush water,
anal cleansing water

176
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:09,622
and dry cleansing materials;

177
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:14,216
however, the urine is not mixed
with the other products,

178
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,773
but separately collected.

179
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:20,017
The resulting urine-free product
which is flushed away

180
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:22,066
is therefore called <i>brownwater</i>.

181
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:27,960
This technology also exists
in different shapes and colors,

182
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,233
and as sit and squat models.

183
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:34,572
This design here is also installed
at the Eawag offices.

184
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:38,237
It collects urine,
which we use for our research,

185
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:42,489
mainly to study ways
how to recover nutrients

186
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:44,746
for the production of fertilizers.

187
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,563
The blue diversion toilet,
which was developed by Eawag

188
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:53,494
in collaboration with industrial designers
from EOOS in Austria

189
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:57,089
is a special variant
of the urine-diverting flush toilet.

190
00:12:57,418 --> 00:13:02,350
It also has a flush, but only to clean
the urine collection bowl

191
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,630
as you can see here in the image.

192
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:08,212
The water is then treated and recycled.

193
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:14,546
Feces and urine, they are not
mixed with flush water.

194
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:18,932
Therefore, this design does not generate
brownwater as an output.

195
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,285
Urine-diverting flush toilets
are not very widespread yet

196
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:27,789
because of some design challenges,
high cost, and limited demand.

197
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:32,590
We now have seen six different options
for the user interface,

198
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,778
but how can we choose the right one
for a given context?

199
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,313
There are a number of factors
on which the technology choice depends.

200
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:45,506
The availability of water is crucial
for all technologies which depend

201
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:48,555
on flush water
to carry away the excreta.

202
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:53,129
The user interface should, of course,
also take into account

203
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:56,130
the preferences and habits
of the people who use it.

204
00:13:56,565 --> 00:14:00,139
Are they sitters or squatters?
Washers of wipers?

205
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:04,616
Another important factor
is the local availability.

206
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,730
Can I find the technology
on the local market,

207
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,647
or can I build it myself?

208
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,711
As we have seen,
the different technologies

209
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:18,474
generate different output products
with very different characteristics.

210
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:22,476
This influences the technology
which can come next,

211
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:26,788
be it a collection and storage technology
or a conveyance technology.

212
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:32,376
Last but not least, special needs
of user groups should also be considered,

213
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:36,366
such as the needs of children,
elderly, or disabled.

214
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:40,101
People's needs change
based on age, location,

215
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:44,308
health, physical ability,
mental state, etc.

216
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:49,449
The concept of inclusive design
takes this into consideration.

217
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:54,675
Inclusive design aims to remove
barriers that exclude people

218
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:59,245
from being able to use facilities
as a result of their evolving needs.

219
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:05,242
It ensures equitable access for all,
including marginalized user groups

220
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:08,163
which may, in some cases,
also face some barriers

221
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:11,813
and exclusion from sanitation
and hygiene facilities.

222
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:16,699
An example of inclusive design
is the provision of ramps

223
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:20,082
or the installation
of handrails in toilets

224
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:22,123
to ensure easy access.

225
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:26,933
Inclusive design considerations
are of particular importance

226
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:32,119
for facilities at schools
or health centers and for public toilets.

227
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:35,276
In the last few minutes
we have gone through

228
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:39,543
a variety of designs through which
people access a sanitation system.

229
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,509
To sum it all up,
I would like to highlight four key points.

230
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:49,608
Different designs have been developed
for different user preferences and habits,

231
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:51,664
such as squatting and sitting toilets

232
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:56,053
as well as options which allow the use
of different materials for cleansing,

233
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:59,812
such as water for washing,
or dry materials for cleansing.

234
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:04,453
Second, there are two
main types of interfaces:

235
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:07,454
dry technologies
that operate without water,

236
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,119
and water-based technologies
that need a regular supply of water

237
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:14,108
to properly function.
Third,

238
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:18,746
different user interface technologies
generate different output products.

239
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:22,012
This, of course, influences
the subsequent type

240
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:26,350
of collection and storage technology
or conveyance that is possible.

241
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,443
FInally, the design
should not only consider

242
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:32,976
technical aspects
and user preferences,

243
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:36,390
but also the barrier-free access
for all users.

244
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:40,696
In the next modules, we will be looking
at the following functional group:

245
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:43,988
Collection and Storage,
and on-site treatment.

246
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:49,523
The following modules will also answer
the question of this fellow here:

247
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:53,911
Where do the products generated
at the user interface go?

248
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:56,954
See you later.
