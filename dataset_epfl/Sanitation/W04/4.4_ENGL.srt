1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,352
Good morning, good afternoon, 
or good evening everybody,

2
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:08,631
depending where you are.

3
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:13,102
My name is Isabel Blackett.
I'm the senior sanitation specalist

4
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:17,826
working for the World Bank [Worsham?]
sanitation program based in the

5
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:20,588
East Asian regional office in Jakarta.

6
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:26,561
Today I'm going to present an overview
of some work I did a few years ago

7
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:29,557
when I first arrived in Indonesia.

8
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:33,845
It was a very exciting, it was a huge 
and very challenging project

9
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:36,485
in a very complex and diverse country.

10
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:42,811
For me, it was a fantastic experience
and the teamwork that resulted

11
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:46,132
in a very good outcome, so something 
I will always remember.

12
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:49,627
I hope you find it useful and inspiring,
and if you ever want to get

13
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:52,813
in contact with me for more information, 
please do so.

14
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,130
But, in the meanwhile, I'll say there's 
several publications which I'm sure

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,231
[Sendac]? will let you know about.
Thank you.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,279
Hello everybody. Today we're going 
to talk about the Indonesia Sanitation

17
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:06,074
Development Program.

18
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:10,293
This is going to be a case study
in which we're going to look at

19
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:14,100
how a national program was started up
and has gone to scale.

20
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:18,771
We will do a quick overview of how 
that happened and the purpose and

21
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:23,373
output of the project, the program 
design, and the inputs and resources.

22
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:28,574
First of all, if you look at slide 3, 
this is a cartoon that I think illustrates

23
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:33,231
really how sanitation is perceived
in many countries.

24
00:01:33,286 --> 00:01:37,218
I've heard the story
in Africa and in East Asia,

25
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:39,855
which is mainly where I've worked.

26
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:41,422
No one wants responsibility.

27
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:45,377
Sanitation is a dirty, 
unpleasant, smelly little child

28
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:48,160
that no one 
really wants responsibility for.

29
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,110
The situation in Indonesia was just 
the same as that in 2005.

30
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:55,170
But four and a half years later

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,661
we found the situation
had changed quite dramatically.

32
00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:02,113
This is a situation where people had
begun to accept their responsibility,

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,320
but it was seen very much
in terms of self interest.

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,416
They would be involved in sanitation 
because it was good

35
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,072
for what their ministry would do,

36
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,800
and they would do it together, not -- 
with no one ministry taking responsibility

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,329
but everyone playing their part,
doing that formally.

38
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:23,672
The question for this session today,
and for part 1 and part 2,

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,301
is why did the decision-makers change 
their mind and what led them

40
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:29,763
to changing their minds?

41
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:33,560
Let me give a bit of background on 
the situation of sanitation in Indonesia

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,846
prior to starting this program.

43
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:41,033
The country is a very large one, 
240 million people,

44
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:43,799
and it's almost 50% urbanized.

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,448
Sanitation has historically,
and to this current day,

46
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:49,832
very much seen as a private matter.

47
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:52,916
And, this is something that
is the perception of the household

48
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,080
but also of local government
and national government.

49
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,254
It wasn't clear to government
what they're supposed to do.

50
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:01,748
There was no history
in which the government expected

51
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,793
to have to undertake
public health interventions.

52
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:11,820
This had evolved partly through a rural
situation where people looked after

53
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,566
their own waste, and then
the country had become urbanized,

54
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,751
and then that attitude
had never really changed.

55
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,005
This is illustrated very well by under 
2% of the urban areas have actually

56
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:26,692
access to sewer systems, and in global
terms, especially for a country that's

57
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:32,033
middle-income or lower-middle income,
it's very exceptionally low.

58
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:38,606
In fact, in this stage the only country 
that has lower sewage access is Laos

59
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:43,520
and their capitol of Vientiane, which has
about half a million people has actually

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,431
got no sewage system at all.

61
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:48,427
Of the perception -- the country is quite
wet, quite high rainfall,

62
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:52,620
and there are lots of rivers,
channels and drains, and the perception

63
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,063
is that you don't need a system because 
the waste just goes into these drains,

64
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:59,346
and into these rivers,
and it gets washed away.

65
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:01,706
Out of sight, out of mind.

66
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,956
But at the same time there is quite
high coverage of household toilets.

67
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:10,634
I won't call it sanitation, we'll just say
people have access to toilets,

68
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,979
typically 80-90% in urban areas.
People use very simple pour flush pans

69
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:23,021
connected either to a soakpit
or to a drain or a river.

70
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,626
The confusing thing about soakpits is 
they call them "tanky septics,"

71
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:29,322
which, they certainly aren't septic tanks.

72
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,861
And there's still a really quite high,
again for a middle-income country,

73
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:38,770
quite high open defecation around
18%, and if you look in the picture,

74
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:42,829
you see there actually a toilet, a 
overhung toilet directly into the river,

75
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:45,722
and the woman there
is waiting to use it,

76
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:48,822
and she's queuing because she's
certainly not the only one who uses it.

77
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,116
Very often you see large queues there.

78
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:59,438
So moving on to slide 6.
This program came in 2006,

79
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:02,207
the Indonesian Sanitation
Sector Development Program,

80
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:05,858
and the purpose of the program
was not to build anything at all.

81
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:09,719
It was to establish a sector, a 
sanitation sector,

82
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:14,863
which had been completely absent.
It was seen that this would happen

83
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:19,722
through development
and operationalizing policies,

84
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:23,771
through institutional and regulatory 
reforms,

85
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:27,899
through introduction
of sanitation strategic planning,

86
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,687
and through a great deal
of advocacy and awareness building,

87
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:32,315
and capacity building.

88
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,126
The program had
four main areas of outputs.

89
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,882
First of all,
the intention was to establish

90
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,036
an enabling environment for sanitation,

91
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:45,336
which really covers a lot of the things
mentioned in the previous slide.

92
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:48,940
An environment in which sanitation 
could be developed at the local level

93
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,650
and at the national level.

94
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,763
A coordination
and investment framework was needed,

95
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:57,315
and next to that you'll see a
question mark in the tick.

96
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:01,169
I think the coordination framework
has been very successfully established.

97
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,614
It started off partly by all the donors

98
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,700
getting together and working together
and after a couple of years of that,

99
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:10,490
in a sense, the government said, 
"well, what are you guys up to?"

100
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,434
and they joined in and we now have a
meeting every one or two months,

101
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:18,930
could be called in by donors or by 
government on particular subjects,

102
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:22,660
it could be urban, it could be rural, 
it could be policy, it could be a review

103
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,601
that's come out...a particular subject
and that's a good dialogue between

104
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:33,134
all the donors and the government.
Works very well.

105
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:36,434
Investment framework perhaps
has been a little less successful.

106
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:40,175
The government didn't seem to see
the need for an investment framework

107
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:44,330
and they have increased their budgets
as you will learn about in part 2,

108
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,328
but a strategic investment framework
was something that didn't appeal

109
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:51,485
to the way they do the national budgeting.

110
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:55,794
The third item was the sanitation 
awareness and hygiene campaigns.

111
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:58,379
These would be designed,
they would be tested, implemented

112
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,955
and they would have
a particular focus on the urban poor.

113
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,666
Again, this has
a question mark and a tick.

114
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,407
At one level this has been
very successfully achieved.

115
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:09,440
At the other level it was
a fairly painful learning process

116
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,400
in which we realized you
couldn't design these campaigns,

117
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,251
and raise awareness,
when you had no delivery mechanism

118
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:18,898
and you didn't even know what type
of sanitation you were promoting.

119
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,081
So the local governments
were very reluctant to do

120
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:24,732
any public awareness work,

121
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:27,370
because they hadn't got
anything to offer the public

122
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,727
and they didn't have answers 
for many tricky questions.

123
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,994
So that became much more
an advocacy program,

124
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:36,421
and at that level
it was very successful.

125
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:39,843
Advocacy to get national government
and local governments more involved.

126
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:43,992
And, as they became more involved, they
had some very specific programs.

127
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,293
They became more confident about doing
sanitation awareness and hygiene work

128
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:49,840
within communities.

129
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:54,963
And the third component which I think--
the fourth component was probably

130
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:59,980
the main hub of this program was
to develop local capacity

131
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,861
and citywide sanitation strategies.

132
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:08,168
This is where a lot of the initial 
focus was built, and we would say

133
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:12,131
that the national change of attitude
came from the local governments,

134
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:16,033
not the other way around, and I'll talk a 
little more about that later.

135
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,015
We move on to slide 8.

136
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:22,166
This is a diagram that describes
a very comprehensive program design.

137
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,709
It was designed strategically
to impact at the national level.

138
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:30,006
But the actual operational focus
of what we were doing on the ground

139
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:32,375
was happening in specific cities.

140
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,302
This started with six cities, it seemed 
to be going very well and we expanded

141
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:39,386
this to twelve cities. And here we
modeled what we thought could

142
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:43,054
become a national approach to 
dealing with sanitation.

143
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:45,288
I will talk more about that in part 2.

144
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:49,032
And then our very specific clients
were poor urban dwellers,

145
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:52,522
and so we had
some pilots happening at that level

146
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:55,966
but the community focus
was in poor urban areas,

147
00:08:55,966 --> 00:09:00,041
rather than more generally, and we
call this a <i>poorer inclusive approach</i>.

148
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,456
So what did it take to achieve this?

149
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,033
Very broadly, a great deal of time and
effort, blood, sweat and tears would

150
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:11,535
be one way of putting it, but we had very
strong buy-in from the government

151
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:15,543
of Indonesia, initially from the planning
department and the health department

152
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:19,941
and the ministry of works. Public works
came on board perhaps a little later.

153
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:23,925
But very strong commitment. They had a
budget and they had staffing

154
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:27,338
into this program,
so it wasn't a donor-driven program.

155
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,618
We contributed, we contracted

156
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:33,016
a multi-disciplinary
technical assistance package.

157
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:36,900
It cost around
$10 million over four years,

158
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,289
but that was done in two sections.

159
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,898
First of all we did two years 
to see how that was going

160
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:42,946
and it was going well,

161
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:45,154
and then it was extended
for another four years.

162
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:49,062
So we tested things out and halfway 
through we make quite a lot of changes.

163
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:53,640
There was a government working group
and government staff working alongside

164
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:57,250
the TA hand-in-hand and they worked
together in a shared office.

165
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,719
This had a lot of benefits.

166
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,514
And the TA was sitting near government,
not near WSP or the World Bank.

167
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:06,775
At the same time WSP
had a number of other activities

168
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:09,817
that it was running in parallel,
in very close coordination.

169
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,939
These were the ones
that you may have heard of;

170
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:16,241
the economics, the sanitation
initiative, a big hand-washing program.

171
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,727
And finally, the point of flexibility.
You cannot design a program like this

172
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:24,644
up front, five years in advance. 
There has to be a continual reflection:

173
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:28,358
Is this working? Is it not working? 
and how do we adjust it?

174
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:30,703
So that was
the sort of broad framework

175
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:32,912
of what we set out to do
and what we used.

176
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:36,281
In part 2, I'm going to talk a bit
more about how it actually happened

177
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:37,692
and what was achieved.
