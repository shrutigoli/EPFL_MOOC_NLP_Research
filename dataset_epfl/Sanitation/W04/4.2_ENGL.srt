00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,356
Welcome to module 4.2, 

2
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:08,974
our second case study
on urban sanitation.

3
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:13,907
This time we move to China
and explore an urban eco-san pilot project

4
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:18,963
implemented between 2004 and 2009
in inner Mongolia, in China.

5
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:21,032
We chose this case study

6
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:23,233
because it is one
of the best-documented cases

7
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:28,589
of a failed attempt to introduce
innovative ecological sanitation solutions

8
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,538
to a new housing estate.

9
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:34,684
We'd like to thank
the Stokholm Environmental Institute,

10
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:37,367
and especially Jennifer [McConnville]

11
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:40,419
for providing us
with the information shown here.

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,593
Erdos was a Chinese/Swedish
eco-town project

13
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:46,526
that aimed to test new frontiers
of waste management.

14
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:52,222
It involved 832 apartments
and housed around 3,000 people.

15
00:00:53,108 --> 00:00:55,729
When the project was initiated in 2003,

16
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:58,750
Erdos was just beginning
its rapid expansion

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,198
and much of the existing
sanitation provision

18
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:02,530
was still very poor.

19
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:06,329
Only one third
of urban hoseholds in Erdos

20
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:08,672
used modern flush toilets,

21
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:12,290
and the city periphery
was not connected to any sewers

22
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,493
and mostly relied on on-site solutions.

23
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:19,824
This slide shows the location
of the Erdos project area,

24
00:01:19,824 --> 00:01:22,191
in inner Mongolia, Northern China.

25
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:25,353
It is one of the fast-growing areas
of inland China

26
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:28,831
thanks to exploration
of gas and oil fields.

27
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:31,568
Some of the features of Dongsheng District

28
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:35,078
The population was about 250,000
back in 2003.

29
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:39,845
The area is between 1,400
and 1,600 meters high

30
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:46,890
with a wide range of temperatures
from -30º in winter to +30º in summer.

31
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:52,509
However, by 2007, already 75%
of the urban area was sewered.

32
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:54,794
In line with many Chinese cities.

33
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:58,380
It should be noted that Erdos
lies in a water-stressed region

34
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:01,401
with low rainwater fall,
and that historically,

35
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:04,910
the use of waste as a fertilizer
was quite common.

36
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:10,068
The project developers decided
that this was an enabling base

37
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,106
for testing newly proclaimed
Chinese recycling economy.

38
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:18,532
This slide shows the project rationale.

39
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:22,087
On the right side you can see
a promotional flyer

40
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:26,906
that was shown and distributed
to attract buyers

41
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:29,919
for the residential property in Erdos.

42
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:34,748
The modern apartments
tried to sell the eco-features:

43
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:39,142
energy saving,
innovation in sanitations systems,

44
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:40,741
and water savings.

45
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:45,574
It thus formed a keystone
of the recycling economy

46
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:47,714
that became the national policy of China.

47
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:51,124
The housing estate was developed
by a private-public partnership

48
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:55,180
with a private developer,
the Daxing Estate Co.

49
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,536
as the main investor.

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,450
This slide shows the project timeline.

51
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:05,044
The project was initiated in 2003
by the Dongxing District government

52
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:07,492
and the Stokholm Environmental Institute.

53
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:12,582
In 2004 and 5, the housing estate
was constructed.

54
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:15,282
One of the buildings is shown
in the middle on the bottom.

55
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:19,982
In 2006, 832 apartments were completed

56
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:21,709
and the households started moving in.

57
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:26,946
The photo on the right shows
the source separating toilet,

58
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:30,829
dry toilet used
for all apartment buildings.

59
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:39,631
In 2008 two of the buildings
were retrofitted with improved dry toilets

60
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:44,969
and in 2009, due to high dissatisfaction
with the sanitation system,

61
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:49,653
all households decided to change
the entire sanitation system

62
00:03:49,653 --> 00:03:53,678
and to revert back
to conventional flush toilet systems.

63
00:03:54,238 --> 00:03:59,178
In 2011 SEI conducted
a project evaluation

64
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:03,198
and published a book
about its findings in 2012.

65
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:08,573
Some of the design considerations
of the Erdos project:

66
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:12,432
It featured a sustainable
environmental sanitation system

67
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:16,485
with closed loop separated waste streams.

68
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:22,082
This included separation of feces,
urine, greywater and solid waste,

69
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:25,575
and the recycling use
of human waste for fertilizer.

70
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,816
This slide shows an overview
of the sanitation system.

71
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:35,852
Firstly, feces and urine
being separated in the dry toilet,

72
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:38,329
shown here in the user interface.

73
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:42,487
The feces and sawdust were collected
in the cellar in plastic bins,

74
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:48,605
collected and transported and brought
to a thermal composting plant,

75
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:50,579
and finally after treatment,

76
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,343
brought to a demonstration garden.

77
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:56,243
The urine was collected
in an underground urine tank,

78
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:59,065
pumped out at regular intervals,

79
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,989
and also brought
to the demonstration garden.

80
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:05,152
This slide shows the system design

81
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:09,467
in a section of one
of the apartment buildings.

82
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:11,977
It shows the different
urine-diverting dry toilets,

83
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,941
shown here in green

84
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:20,319
which are connected
to dry collection systems or chutes

85
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,398
which were used as pipes
with 280 mm dimensions.

86
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:32,966
Additionally, there were vent pipes
connected to each toilet

87
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,001
that ventilated the toilet systems.

88
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,578
These pipes were 110 mm.

89
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,392
Finally the bottom of the system
in the cellar, the feces bins

90
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:48,284
that were connected
to each of the toilets.

91
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:51,239
The system as it is shown here
is the first attempt

92
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:54,376
at introducing
urine diverting dry toilets

93
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:56,351
in multi-story apartment buildings.

94
00:05:57,671 --> 00:06:00,539
Let's look at the system design.

95
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,701
The picture on the left
shows the dry chute

96
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,841
that are connected
to the collection bins in blue.

97
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,015
Additionally, there were 22
underground urine tanks

98
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:14,036
that collected the urine
from the different toilets,

99
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:18,125
and there was also a ventilation system
connected to each toilet

100
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,848
that led to the roof.

101
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:23,409
The image on the bottom left
shows the onsite treatment station.

102
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:26,386
Thermal composting of feces

103
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,157
that could treat
1.5 tons of feces per day.

104
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:33,482
Additionally, there was
a greywater treatment system

105
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:39,041
that consisted of anaerobic tanks
and sedimentation tanks

106
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,904
that could treat
up to 250 cubic meters per day.

107
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:45,855
The compost and urine could both be used

108
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:48,651
in the adjacent demonstration garden

109
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:50,283
next to the housing estate.

110
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:52,517
This slide shows the user interface.

111
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:55,570
The heart piece
of the eco-sanitation system.

112
00:06:56,346 --> 00:07:01,311
It featured an innovative
dry separating toilet

113
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:05,864
with a teflon coated turning bowl
that separated the users from the waste.

114
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,229
It also featured sawdust
instead of water.

115
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:15,256
The sawdust was added
to minimize the odor problems,

116
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:19,812
but also to speed up
the drying process of the feces.

117
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:22,795
The separated urine was collected
in an underground tank,

118
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:25,311
shown here in this section,

119
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,296
and was initially used in agriculture.

120
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:31,840
Later on in the project
it was also dumped

121
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,810
at municipal landfill sites,

122
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,606
or even at clandestine locations
by the emptying company.

123
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:42,515
The project also included
user sensitization.

124
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:46,785
This was conducted
through initial training events

125
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:50,169
after the households moved in.

126
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:52,965
They also distributed
flyers and reminders

127
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:55,397
about the correct use of the facilities

128
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:59,526
and introduced a telephone hotline

129
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:04,052
where people could complain
about malfunction of their system.

130
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:06,854
The Stokholm Environmental Institute

131
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,122
also conducted regular
user satisfaction surveys

132
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:14,892
and this user survey from 2007 and 2008

133
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:20,452
shows two of the main problems
that arose quite early in the project.

134
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:23,811
In blue, the odor problem,

135
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:26,302
which was most pronounced
during the cold months,

136
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:28,769
especially in December and January,

137
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:34,105
and the toilet mechanism,
especially the turning bowl parts

138
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:36,989
and the ventilation,
which are featured in red.

139
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:39,874
In the next model we'll be looking

140
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:43,577
at some of the reasons
for the system failure

141
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:45,430
of the Erdos project,

142
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:48,801
and why the dissatisfaction

143
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:52,004
with the toilets
and the sanitation system

144
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,403
eventually led to the dismantling
of the existing system

145
00:08:56,592 --> 00:09:00,274
and replacement with conventional
sanitation flush toilets.
