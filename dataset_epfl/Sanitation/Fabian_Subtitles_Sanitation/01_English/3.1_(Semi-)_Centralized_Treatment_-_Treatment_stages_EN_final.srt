00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,561
Hello, and welcome 
to the third week

2
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:10,081
of this lecture on planning 
and design of sanitation systems

3
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:15,033
and technologies. Unfortunately,
around the world, huge amounts

4
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:19,950
of waste water and sludge end up
untreated into rivers, lakes,

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,720
and into the sea. 
What does it take to treat them?

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,248
After reviewing last week
the different conveyance systems,

7
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:29,975
which have the potential 
to bring waste water and sludge

8
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:32,152
to proper disposal points.

9
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:34,456
I will now introduce you
to the centralized

10
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:37,474
and semi-centralized 
treatment technologies.

11
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:40,994
The treatment process can be
divided into several stages.

12
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:44,890
The pre-treatment,
the primary treatment,

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,061
the secondary treatment, 
the tertiary treatment,

14
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:52,611
or post-treatment.
Within these categories,

15
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:56,290
some technologies are based 
on biological processes:

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,717
aerobic, anaerobic or both.

17
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:02,451
And some others on 
physical, chemical ones.

18
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:04,898
In this module, 
we'll have a look

19
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,006
at the different 
treatment stages

20
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:09,663
and then focus on 
pre- and post-treatment,

21
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:12,565
which can be implemented in any system.

22
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:14,747
Later, in the next modules,

23
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:17,200
we will review the 
anaerobic technologies,

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,598
then the aerobic ones, 
and finally the technologies

25
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:22,673
for sludge treatment.
The learning goals

26
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:24,939
of this series of modules 
on treatment are:

27
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:28,258
get to know the different 
treatment technologies,

28
00:01:28,258 --> 00:01:31,579
understand the different 
treatment stages and processes,

29
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:34,008
and understand 
the different functions

30
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:39,326
of the treatment technologies. 
Let's start. First, let's review

31
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:42,941
the different treatment stages.
The two main treatment stages

32
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:47,655
are called primary and secondary. 
"Primary treatment" consists

33
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:52,575
in the liquid/solid separation.
For example, through sedimentation.

34
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:56,294
As for the "Secondary treatment", 
it consists of the removal

35
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:59,192
of organic matter 
and suspended solids.

36
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:01,854
The "pre-treatment" is 
the preliminary removal

37
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:05,628
of waste water or sludge
constituents, such as oil,

38
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:10,200
grease and various solids,
like sand and trash.

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,420
Pre-treatment is a must. 
On the other hand,

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,998
the "tertiary treatment"
and "post-treatment"

41
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:19,533
consist of removing elements 
like remaining pathogens,

42
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,759
nutrients such as nitrogen 
and phosphorous,

43
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,694
or micropollutants 
from the effluent.

44
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:30,772
Tertiary treatment embraces 
a large spectrum of technologies,

45
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:34,869
and most of them are not implemented 
in low- and middle-income countries.

46
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:37,855
Too expensive and too complex.

47
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:41,007
Let's have a look at a few 
pre-treatment technologies.

48
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:44,016
Pre-treatment is a preliminary 
removal of waste water

49
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:47,322
or sludge constituents, 
either before conveyance,

50
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:49,220
or before treatment systems.

51
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,133
It is meant to prevent 
the accumulation of solids

52
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:56,076
in further stages and avoid blockages.
It can also help produce abrasion

53
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,669
of mechanical parts 
and extend the life

54
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:02,013
of sanitation infrastructure. 
Pre-treatment technologies

55
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:09,163
use physical removal mechanisms
such as screening, flotation, settling,

56
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:11,337
and filtration.

57
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:15,937
"Screening" is used, for example, 
in the screens to prevent trash

58
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:20,057
and coarse solids to end up 
in the sewerage system

59
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:22,693
or the treatment plant.
"Flotation" is used,

60
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:25,524
for example, in grease traps 
and grids interceptors

61
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:28,992
to remove the fats, oil and grease.

62
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:35,064
Finally, "settling" is used, 
for example, in the sand trap,

63
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:41,907
or grit chambers, to remove 
the heavier solids.

64
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:48,089
As you can see in this figure, 
grease traps and grit chambers

65
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:51,446
can be combined 
in one technology.

66
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:54,374
On the other end of 
the treatment process,

67
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:57,403
there are different possibilities
to polish the effluent:

68
00:03:57,423 --> 00:04:00,482
the so called post-
treatment technologies.

69
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:04,360
Depending on the design 
and use of the effluent,

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,603
or on national standards 
for discharging water bodies,

71
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:10,175
a post-treatment step 
may be required

72
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:13,495
to remove pathogens, 
residual suspended solids,

73
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:15,830
or its soil constituents.

74
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,066
This can be mainly achieved 
through tertiary filtration

75
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:20,508
and disinfection techniques.

76
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:23,037
Filtration process 
can be classified

77
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:26,623
in two categories: 
first, the depth,

78
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:29,921
or "packed-bed filtration", 
as shown in this figure,

79
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:33,723
where the effluent passes 
through a filter medium,

80
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:36,566
such as sand 
or activated carbon.

81
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:38,979
On the other hand, 
“surface filtration“

82
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,591
removes undesired elements 
through sieving; for example,

83
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:44,378
through membranes.

84
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:47,288
As for "disinfection", its target
is the elimination

85
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,382
of pathogenic micro-organisms.

86
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:52,450
Chlorine is the most 
widespread technique.

87
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,471
Chlorine is mixed with effluent 
at the outset of the treatment plant,

88
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,550
as shown in this figure, 
with a chlorine diffuser

89
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,976
and a chlorine mixer.

90
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:05,967
You can also do disinfection 
through UV radiation or ozonation,

91
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,777
the two being more 
energy intensive.

92
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:11,558
However, you have to be 
cautious with disinfection.

93
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:15,135
For example, chlorine together 
with organic matter

94
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,948
can form toxic byproducts, 
harmful for the environment.

95
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:22,766
It should thus only be applied 
if strictly necessary.

96
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:27,212
You don't want to create more
problems than you actually solve.

97
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:31,077
To sum up, we saw that treatment
is a succession of different steps,

98
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:34,352
the main ones being the primary 
and secondary treatment.

99
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:38,593
Pre-treatment is a must, 
as a kind of preventive measure,

100
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:41,703
either at the household level, 
at the street level,

101
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:44,500
or at the inlet 
of a treatment plant.

102
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,074
Post-treatment is 
not always necessary,

103
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:49,495
and a pragmatic approach 
is recommended.

104
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:52,843
The effluent quality should
match the intended end use

105
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:56,390
practice, or the quality 
of the receiving water body.

106
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,031
In the next modules, we will dig
further into treatment processes,

107
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:03,943
reviewing different anaerobic
and aerobic treatment technologies.

108
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:07,164
Looking forward 
to seeing you then.
