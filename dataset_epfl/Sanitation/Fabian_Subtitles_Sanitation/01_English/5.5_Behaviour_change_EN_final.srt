1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,740
Welcome to the module on

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,290
Behavior Change in Urban Sanitation.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,310
The focus of this MOOC
is on how to deliver

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,280
and sustain quality sanitation
services city-wide,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,870
and to achieve that
it’s important to remember

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,260
that a vital link
in the value chain

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,830
is the customers.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,190
They create the pull that
makes the value chain work;

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,890
if they don’t create this pull,

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,320
then the system doesn’t
work efficiently.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,810
So how do we make sure
that demand is created

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,400
for the sanitation services

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,510
that we implement
or strengthen;

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,660
that the sanitation products
we develop

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,560
are purchased and used;

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,010
and that the sanitation hygiene

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,800
and behaviors we are promoting
are adopted and maintained?

18
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,030
In this module, we will
explore some principles

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,340
and steps to make
our demand creation

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,190
and behavior change
programs more effective.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,230
Before starting
any behavior change program,

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,650
we need to be clear
on the behaviors

23
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,420
at the household or citizen level

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,400
that will affect
the outcomes of our program

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
and ultimately its success.

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,590
Here are some examples
of urban sanitation behaviors

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,150
which we might want to achieve:

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,920
Households connect to a sewer;

29
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,300
utility customers
pay their bills on time;

30
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,250
households empty
their septic tank

31
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,060
on a regular basis

32
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,020
using an accredited supplier;

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,090
citizens use public toilets

34
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,190
and stop using flying toilets,

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,310
or users upgrade existing
on-site sanitation facilities.

36
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,120
Once you’ve identified
the desired behavior,

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,450
the next step is to
understand the barriers

38
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,270
to and drivers of the behaviors

39
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,950
from a customer perspective.

40
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,320
We often assume that
the target population

41
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,350
is not aware of the service
or its benefits.

42
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,830
But more often than not,
there are other factors at play.

43
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,920
Here is a framework that's
commonly used to organize questions

44
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,490
related to the barriers
and drivers:

45
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,980
Does our target population
have the opportunity,

46
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,170
the ability and the motivation

47
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,710
to practice
the desired behavior?

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,150
Some typical questions

49
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,380
asked under this framework might be:

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,210
How easy or difficult is it
to access the service?

51
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,150
How affordable is the service
to the household?

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,720
Are there drivers,
such as increased social status,

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,160
that can create
the pull we want?

54
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,350
In its 2015 World
Development Report,

55
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,870
the World Bank proposes

56
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,440
a simple way
of understanding behaviors:

57
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,760
Humans think socially,

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,460
in other words,
what other people do,

59
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,390
or what we think
they are doing,

60
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,170
will influence our own behavior.

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,190
We think with mental models;

62
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,260
our beliefs about the services,
their providers,

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,370
and those who use them,
shape our behaviors.

64
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,250
We think automatically;

65
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,760
many of our behaviors

66
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,830
don’t involve conscious thinking

67
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,170
or planning at all.

68
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,420
The more we know
about the particular behavior

69
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,860
or biases involved,

70
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,040
the more effective our behavior
change programs will be.

71
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,850
So, how you diagnose
the situation?

72
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,040
At the minimum, a desk review
of previous studies

73
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,030
or a literature review

74
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,810
will help you better
understand the context.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you have time
and resources available,

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,880
you can commission
a diagnostic study.

77
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,620
Depending on the objectives,

78
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,210
this can be a market
or consumer research study

79
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,530
including surveys,

80
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,400
focus group discussions
and other techniques.

81
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,310
For example,
a research technique

82
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,890
called “mystery clients”

83
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,910
can be used.

84
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,650
Mystery clients
are trained individuals

85
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,730
who visit service providers

86
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,570
in the assumed
role of clients,

87
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,290
and then report back
on their experience.

88
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,020
Some organizations use
an approach called

89
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,510
a “deep dive”

90
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,240
where researchers
and stakeholders

91
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,750
immerse themselves
in the community.

92
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,110
Once you have
identified the factors

93
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,690
preventing or facilitating
the desired behavior,

94
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,500
then the next step
is to develop

95
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,860
a program or intervention

96
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,130
that will address them.

97
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,710
There are many courses
on marketing

98
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,060
and behavior change communication

99
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,370
so this is really
just an introduction.

100
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,000
Here are some principles to remember:

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,740
Use the lens of
your target population

102
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,700
to analyze the situation.

103
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,890
This means for example,

104
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,180
not thinking in terms
of the technology ladder,

105
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,790
but thinking in terms
of the incremental benefits

106
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,790
to the customer.

107
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,100
Be holistic and use
multiple approaches.

108
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,540
When it comes to
behavior change,

109
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,380
there is no silver bullet;

110
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,760
there's not always
a single trigger

111
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,780
to achieve the desired
behavior change.

112
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,160
Get the expertise you need.

113
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,890
You wouldn't get
an advertising agency

114
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,290
to build a wastewater
treatment plant.

115
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,280
Conversely you do not
want an engineering firm

116
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,110
to design your behavior
change campaign.

117
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,520
The Behavioral Insights
Team in the U.K.

118
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,000
uses a framework

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,170
called EAST
which stands

120
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,390
for make it Easy, Attractive,
Social and Timely.

121
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,840
Easy: reduce
the "hassle factor"

122
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,360
of taking up a service;

123
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,200
prioritize and simplify messages;

124
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,790
harness the power of default options
whenever possible.

125
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,610
Attractive:

126
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,040
Use human-centered design

127
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,810
or other techniques

128
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,200
to ensure the service

129
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,030
and product features meet customer
needs, desires and aspirations.

130
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,380
Social:

131
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,360
If most people are already
paying their bills on time,

132
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
make that information known;

133
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,300
leverage the power
of social networks

134
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,140
and peer-pressure;

135
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,410
encourage people
to make public commitments.

136
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,360
Timely: Promote
products or services

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,480
when the cash
constraints are lower

138
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,510
and mental bandwidth greater;

139
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,920
foster new habits
during major life changes

140
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,740
like marriage or a new baby;

141
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,250
let households know when it’s time
to empty their septic tanks.

142
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,510
To illustrate the EAST
framework further,

143
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,470
let’s take the example
of wanting households

144
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,110
to use improved pit
emptying services.

145
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,530
You could make it:

146
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,140
Easy by enabling households

147
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,630
to order by mobile phone;

148
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,880
attractive by stressing
that there will be no digging up

149
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,080
of the backyard
to bury the sludge;

150
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,000
social by not discharging
sludge into open drains,

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,200
by appealing to neighborly
and civic pride,

152
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,760
and timely by promoting
the services prior

153
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,270
to the rainy season,

154
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,350
when pits can otherwise overflow.

155
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,010
Another framework
is the “4ps”

156
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,060
used in commercial
and social marketing.

157
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,170
The 4ps are Product, Price,

158
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,030
Place and Promotion.

159
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,140
The more you get the 4ps right,

160
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,110
the greater the likelihood of getting

161
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,680
the behavior change you
are interested in.

162
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,810
If you want households
with a septic tank

163
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,050
to connect to a sewer,

164
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,380
for example,

165
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,560
you can think through
the 4ps as follows:

166
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,230
Product:

167
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,300
Based on the research
insights,

168
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,720
what additional benefits
or advantages

169
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,560
are they getting
from connecting?

170
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,540
What do they value
most: Modernity?

171
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,840
Peace of mind?

172
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,590
Freedom from overflows?

173
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,660
Remember that most households

174
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,330
don’t care what happens
to their effluent

175
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,830
and may be satisfied
with their current system.

176
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,810
Consider bundling services or solutions
that can reduce the hassle

177
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,090
or can add value

178
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,760
while construction is going on.

Make sure the customer contact
points are easy to access,

181
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,690
efficient and service-oriented,

182
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,490
from order-taking, installation,

183
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,760
post-installation service,

184
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,530
and paying a monthly tariff.

185
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,910
Price:
Offer installment payments

186
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,320

187
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
through mobile money.

188
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,050
Promotion: Tell
potential customers why,

189
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,050
where and how
to get the service,

190
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,310
but go beyond Information,

191
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,900
Education and Communication
or IEC as is it called.

192
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,370
Frame your messages based
on the diagnostic study.

193
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,550
Consider developing
a strong brand

194
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,250
through which you can
also connect emotionally.

195
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,980
If you’re targeting
the poorest customers,

196
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,460
face-to-face communication,

197
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,570
product demonstrations
and community-based

198
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,010
events are likely to be
more effective than mass media.

199
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,880
To summarize what we have
covered in this module

200
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,670
about behavior change
in urban sanitation:

201
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,690
Define what behavior
and whose behavior

202
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,960
are important to
the success of your program.

203
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,150
Understand what factors
are influencing these behaviors.

204
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,480
Design a comprehensive intervention

205
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,700
that will aim
to remove barriers

206
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,600
and activate drivers.

207
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,420
Remember two frameworks
that can be used:

208
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,290
EAST and the 4 Ps.

209
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,750
And finally, get the type
of expertise you need

210
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,440
for your program
to be most effective.
