00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,640
Hello, and welcome to the MOOC module
Shit Flow Diagrams:

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,070
A tool to illustrate and communicate
sanitation service delivery.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,960
My name is Lars, I'm an environmental
engineer and I'm working

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,610
in the department of sanitation, water
and solid waste flow development.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,310
<i>Shit flow diagrams
are often referred to as SFDs,

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,470
<i>and in 2015 a team of organizations
came together

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>to develop a consistent approach
for the production of SDFs,

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,730
<i>and the description
of sanitation service delivery.

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,970
<i>I hope you are excited to learn
about the SFD, excreta management,

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,320
<i>and the overall link
to sanitation systems

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,397
<i>and fecal sludge management.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,390
At the end of this module, you'll be able

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,910
to describe what an SFD could be used for,

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,820
explain the different pathways
excreta can take in the environment,

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,200
and provide examples of safely managed
and unsafely managed excreta.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,890
To start, let's answer the question
of what the SFD can be used for.

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,470
The SFD is an assessment
of sanitation service delivery,

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,010
which is helpful for understanding
the current situation.

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,790
The SFD is a communication tool,

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,570
which presents complex information
in a simple illustration.

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,920
And the SFD is an advocacy tool.

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,860
It can be used to demonstrate the need

23
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,310
for improved sanitation service delivery.

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,080
Now, let's discuss
what the SFD can convey.

25
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,600
The SFD conveys percentages of excreta
transported through sewers

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,160
or emptied from containment,
but it's not a detailed planning tool.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,470
It also shows how much
is delivered to treatment,

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,950
but it's not a quantification tool
with accurate volumes.

29
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,890
Lastly, it shows percentages of excreta
treated or not treated,

30
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,230
but doesn't assess treatment performance.

31
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,020
<i>Let me just briefly introduce you
to the research behind the SFD.

32
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,470
<i>Discussions about SFDs are only possible

33
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,240
<i>if results are based
on a consistent approach.

34
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,250
<i>On this slide, you can see an example.

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,800
<i>This SFD is based
on the methodology and tools

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,030
<i>which are available on the website.

37
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,130
<i>Green and red arrows illustrate
safely and unsafely managed excreta

38
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,750
<i>along the sanitation service chain.

39
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,850
<i>The SFD method provides guidance
to derive these percentages,

40
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,070
<i>but also defines terminology.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,510
<i>During the following minutes,
I'll guide you through a city

42
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,080
<i>to explain this terminology
in more detail.

43
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,640
<i>Here you can see an example city.

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,426
<i>Excreta is managed
with off-site and on-site sanitation.

45
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,630
<i>The SFD starts out by separating
those two sanitation options.

46
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,650
<i>This pictures shows
a typical wastewater treatment plant.

47
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,290
<i>Ideally, wastewater
is delivered to treatment.

48
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,020
<i>If not delivered, or not treated,

49
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,270
<i>we refer to it
as "excreta unsafely managed,"

50
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,980
<i>as shown here in red.

51
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,990
<i>But if the wastewater is treated,

52
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,280
<i>then we refer to it
as "excreta safely managed,"

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,180
<i>as shown here in green.

54
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,000
<i>Here you can see a pit latrine,
which is an on-site sanitation technology

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,760
<i>used by the majority of the population
in low-income countries.

56
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,050
<i>Fecal sludge accumulates
in these technologies,

57
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,720
<i>and once the containment fills up,
the sludge needs to be removed.

58
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,800
<i>In this example,
a manual emptying-service provider

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,930
<i>collects fecal sludge in barrels,

60
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,760
<i>which are then transferred
to a pickup truck.

61
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,090
<i>On the SFD, this is described
as "fecal sludge emptied."

62
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,220
<i>The terms "fecal sludge contained"
and "fecal sludge not contained"

63
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,570
<i>will be explained in a later scene.

64
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,090
<i>Ideally, fecal sludge
is then delivered to treatment,

65
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,860
<i>the next step
of the sanitation service chain.

66
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,210
<i>If delivered,
the arrow on the SFD is green.

67
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,800
<i>In this example,
you can see a septic tank,

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,790
<i>another common
on-site sanitation technology,

69
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,380
<i>which is connected
to flush or pour-flush toilets.

70
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,330
<i>If the groundwater
and soil conditions allow,

71
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,780
<i>the effluent infiltrates
through a soak pit

72
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,390
<i>into the ground for natural treatment.

73
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,260
<i>Solids settle at the bottom of the tank,

74
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,130
<i>and fecal sludge has to be removed
on a regular basis.

75
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,620
<i>If not removed, tanks can overflow,

76
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,200
<i>and this can result
in groundwater pollution.

77
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,750
<i>Instead of using barrels, septic tanks
are usually emptied by vacuum trucks.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,220
<i>If delivered to treatment,
the arrow on the SFD is green.

79
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,050
<i>Here you can see
a typical fecal sludge treatment plant.

80
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,370
<i>Liquids and solids
are separated in settling tanks.

81
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,390
<i>The solids are then transferred
to drying beds,

82
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,660
<i>while the liquid part
is often treated in ponds.

83
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,130
<i>If treatment is effective, fecal sludge
is described as "treated" on the SFD,

84
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,480
<i>and therefore safely managed.

85
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,780
The next scenes will provide you

86
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,750
with more examples
of unsafely managed excreta,

87
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,490
which is a common situation
in many places.

88
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,300
<i>Where sanitation facilities don't exist,

89
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,110
<i>open defecation is practiced,

90
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,690
<i>which directly contaminates
the environment,

91
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,990
<i>and is considered unsafely managed.

92
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,130
<i>The next examples show situations
where fecal sludge is emptied,

93
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,020
<i>but then not delivered to treatment,
as described on the SFD.

94
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,780
<i>Where sanitation facilities exist,

95
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,550
<i>but vacuum trucks
cannot access the facility,

96
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,500
<i>dumping of fecal sludge
directly into the environment is common.

97
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,400
<i>Fecal sludge is directly flushed out
into nearby drains

98
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,880
<i>by removing bricks from the containment,
or by installing pumps.

99
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,250
<i>Informal emptying practices
also often lead

100
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,290
<i>to dumping of fecal sludge
into the nearby environment.

101
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,820
<i>On the SFD,
both scenarios are referred to

102
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,500
<i>as "fecal sludge emptied,
but then not delivered to treatment,"

103
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,990
<i>and therefore unsafely managed.

104
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,560
Let us now look in more detail
into the definition

105
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,858
of "fecal sludge contained"
and "not contained."

106
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,820
<i>To do this, we need to look
at the water table and soil conditions.

107
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,010
<i>The animation provides you
with an example

108
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,630
<i>of a septic tank and a pit latrine
that infiltrate into the ground.

109
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,150
<i>In this first scenario,
the water table is low,

110
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,610
<i>and therefore the risk
of groundwater pollution.

111
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,910
<i>The result is fecal sludge contained,
as you can see on the SFD as green.

112
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,630
<i>Another scenario
is that the water table is high,

113
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,550
<i>and in this case, infiltrate
from the septic tank and pit latrine

114
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,590
<i>drains into the groundwater.

115
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,840
<i>This situation causes a significant
risk of groundwater pollution.

116
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,170
<i>The result is
"fecal sludge not contained,"

117
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,530
<i>which you can see on the SFD as red.

118
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,010
<i>In places where there's enough space,

119
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,970
<i>a common practice
is to cover a full pit with soil,

120
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,830
<i>and then build a new one.

121
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,420
<i>If groundwater pollution is not an issue
because of good soil conditions,

122
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,370
<i>and low water table, this practice
could be considered as safely managed.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,820
<i>While it can provide a solution
in rural settings,

124
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,474
<i>this should not be promoted
in urban settings.

125
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,950
You have now learned about scenarios

126
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,000
where fecal sludge is not safely managed
due to a number of reasons.

127
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,900
But I hope you're not surprised
if I tell you

128
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,450
that even fecal sludge emptied
and collected by vacuum trucks

129
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,070
often is not delivered to treatment.

130
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,620
<i>There are many possible reasons for this.

131
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,260
<i>Firstly, treatment plants
for fecal sludge

132
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,350
<i>may simply not yet exist.

133
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,060
<i>Fecal sludge is dumped
into the environment,

134
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,370
<i>and on the SFD considered
as "not delivered to treatment,"

135
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,290
<i>and therefore unsafely managed.

136
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,830
<i>Another common scenario
is that treatment may exist,

137
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,790
<i>but is located far outside of the city.

138
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,070
<i>In overcrowded cities
where traffic jams are the reality,

139
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,680
<i>fecal sludge gets dumped
into the environment,

140
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,780
<i>which again is referred to
as "unsafely managed" on the SFDs.

141
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,150
<i>But even where treatment exists
and is reachable,

142
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,400
<i>high fees for discharge
may discourage service providers

143
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
<i>to actually deliver sludge to treatment.

144
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,920
<i>The last situation shows trucks
that deliver fecal sludge

145
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,720
<i>to a wastewater treatment plant.

146
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,790
<i>This typically results
in failure of treatment processes.

147
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,299
<i>The SFD illustrates this as "fecal sludge
or wastewater not treated,"

148
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,660
<i>and therefore unsafely managed.

149
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,030
<i>Let's zoom out of our city again.

150
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,179
<i>You have now learned
about the SFD terminology,

151
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,920
<i>and what unsafely
and safely managed excreta means.

152
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,990
I hope you enjoyed this animation.

153
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,330
So now, before we finish this module,

154
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,240
I would like to show you
one more example of a real SFD.

155
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,750
<i>Here you can see the SFD
for Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.

156
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,170
<i>On the left-hand side, you can see

157
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,430
<i>that 9% of the population
uses off-site sanitation.

158
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,740
<i>90% of the population
use on-site sanitation,

159
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,300
<i>and 1% practices open defecation.

160
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,350
<i>In total, we found that 43% of excreta
are safely managed,

161
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,050
<i>and 57% are unsafely managed.

162
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,410
<i>Of the 57% that is unsafely managed,

163
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,980
<i>the majority results from fecal sludge
that is not contained and not emptied.

164
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,970
<i>This is the scenario we have shown you
in the animation,

165
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,700
<i>where the water table is high

166
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,200
<i>and excreta infiltrates
into the groundwater.

167
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,610
<i>Additionally, more than half
of the emptied fecal sludge

168
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,510
<i>is actually not delivered to treatment,

169
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,730
<i>and directly dumped
into the environment.

170
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,490
<i>This contributes another 18%
to unsafely managed excreta.

171
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,380
<i>Of the 43% safely managed excreta,

172
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,820
<i>a major contribution is fecal sludge
contained and not emptied.

173
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,490
<i>SFDs represent the current situation.

174
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,140
<i>At the time this one was made,

175
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,340
<i>many pit latrines
were built quite recently,

176
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,270
<i>and simply not yet full.

177
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,010
<i>Once these pit latrines
need to get emptied,

178
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,920
<i>treatment infrastructure
needs to be available

179
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,210
<i>so that emptying service providers

180
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,110
<i>have an appropriate location
for discharge.

181
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,560
<i>If not, the percentage
of unsafely managed excreta

182
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,970
<i>would increase significantly.

183
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,620
The SFD promotion initiative
has developed a methodology,

184
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,770
tools, and templates
for worldwide production of SFDs,

185
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,380
using the terminology presented here.

186
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,160
To learn more about SFDs,
please visit the project website,

187
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,760
where all those materials
can be downloaded.

188
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,680
Is there an SFD for your city?

189
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,560
If not, maybe you can start producing one,

190
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,320
and use it to raise awareness

191
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,170
about the gaps
in sanitation service delivery.

192
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,330
Thanks for listening to me today.

193
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,740
We really hope you enjoyed this module.
