1
00:00:05,226 --> 00:00:10,044
So in part two we're gong to look
at a little bit more

2
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:11,826
about the content of the program

3
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:14,628
or what was actually done,
and in particular focusing

4
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:17,934
on our systematic sanitation cycle
that was developed for the cities.

5
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:22,714
Developed within the program
and has since been scaled up nationally.

6
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:28,678
Also about the importance and how
high-level national support was secured,

7
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,316
and the importance
and the role that played

8
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:33,114
in moving the program forward.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,247
And a bit about budgets
and mainstreaming them

10
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:38,230
and how that has worked out since then.

11
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:42,190
Let's have a look at slide number three.

12
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,515
The sanitation city cycle.

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,499
This cycle was very fundamental

14
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:51,210
to developing a model
that could be scaled up,

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,391
so we started in the six cities
and then went to twelve,

16
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,347
and as we did the twelve,
we had to simplify it a great deal.

17
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:02,594
The vision became that this would be
 rolled out nationally.

18
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:07,647
There were at the time
around 100 cities in the country.

19
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:10,915
Although the vision has been
 that

20
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:14,181
the approach is applied
in a similar way in districts as well,

21
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:16,254
- there are around 300 of them altogether - ,

22
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:18,300
so we're looking at very large scaling up.

23
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:22,150
The cycle incorporated,
first of all, advocacy.

24
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,103
Now, the advocacy depended
on which stage the city was at.

25
00:01:26,324 --> 00:01:29,219
Initially the program was looking
for cities which were willing

26
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,137
to throw their hat
in the ring and have a go,

27
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:34,678
and to become those first six cities.

28
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:38,217
Those cities then became
advocates for the next cycle

29
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:42,162
and gradually, the cities began
to advocate to the national level

30
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:46,435
and then the national level became
the main hub of the advocacy

31
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:49,224
to the cities that were
a little further behind.

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,489
So having the city
committed itself come onboard,

33
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,533
it was very much a voluntary,
demand-driven program.

34
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,049
No one had to do anything.

35
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,798
Cities volunteered, put their hands up
and became part of it.

36
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,869
They then established a working group
and some institutional structures

37
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:06,478
through which they would work.

38
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:08,997
The first activity
that the working group undertook

39
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:12,922
was to establish
what was called a white book,

40
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:15,517
and it was really a sanitation
situation assessment

41
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:17,119
and sanitation mapping.

42
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,252
It involved quite a bit of survey work

43
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:21,933
and bringing together existing data,

44
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,406
local knowledge
and some primary research,

45
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:27,042
looking at what the situation
was in the city.

46
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:30,054
And from that white book,
which was quite transformational

47
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:33,771
because the working groups
were working together for the first time,

48
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,060
they began to see things

49
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,819
that their departmental silos
had not seen before.

50
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,256
They developed a sanitation strategy.

51
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,963
And from that strategy
would become what was called

52
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:48,160
"a program memorandum" which is really
a project shopping list, or a plan,

53
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:51,815
and applications to put in
for particular projects

54
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:53,937
to national level or to donors.
So this was it,

55
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:56,960
the name "project memorandum",
was how it was coined.

56
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,981
Then, finally, there would be
a process of monitoring

57
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:05,298
and evaluation during implementation,
and that would be an ongoing cycle.

58
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:08,120
So, this cycle
was perceived at the city level

59
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,564
and what we tried out.

60
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:12,302
If we can move on to slide four now,

61
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:14,496
we find is that the center of this program,

62
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:16,859
as I mentioned in part one, was the city.

63
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:19,687
And the cities had an impact
at the national level.

64
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:23,264
At the national level we had the buy-in
of the planning department,

65
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,118
and to some extent,
the health department.

66
00:03:25,432 --> 00:03:28,354
The other departments
that should have been involved,

67
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:30,235
the ministry of public works
and local government

68
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:32,058
were a little bit
more ambivalent about it.

69
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:34,972
So we went down to the cities
that were interested,

70
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:37,752
where there was commitment
and where there was very strong ownership,

71
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:40,359
they established their groups,
they did their assessments,

72
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:42,149
and then they started holding.

73
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:44,819
This idea came from one particular city:

74
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,241
a sanitation summit, in which
the project cities would get together

75
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:51,451
and they would, to some extent,
show off, share what they'd done,

76
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:55,125
and try and hold each other
accountable for what they were doing.

77
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:58,590
We call this friendly peer review,
and a bit of competition.

78
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,951
But this process evolved
over a couple of years.

79
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:07,844
The national government
was invited and the very first time,

80
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:11,393
they were called to come and join
one of these sanitation summits.

81
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:15,275
We managed to secure a director general
from the ministry of public works to come,

82
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:19,073
and I remember the look on his face
when he heard the man talking

83
00:04:19,073 --> 00:04:21,775
about his sanitation budget
and his sanitation strategy.

84
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:24,664
He looked shocked, and he said,

85
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,748
"I never expected to hear this
coming from a city.

86
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:30,223
"I had no idea cities
were taking this so seriously.

87
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:32,233
"I need to go back now to Jakarta,

88
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,725
and I need to look at what
our national department is doing"

89
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,159
I can say this was in April 2009, I think.

90
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:41,163
Everything changed from then on.

91
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,792
He went back to Jakarta.
He talked to the minister,

92
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:46,967
and a national program began to formulate
quite soon after that.

93
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:49,553
But someone articulated this as,

94
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:53,047
"the cities produced the wake-up call
to the national government."

95
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:57,052
The national government responded.
They increased their attention,

96
00:04:57,052 --> 00:05:00,737
they got a national program in place
called "the national acceleration

97
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:03,523
of sanitation development
in settlements program"

98
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:06,835
commonly called PPSP,
and they used that sanitation cycle

99
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:10,803
and what the cities had done
during this ISSTP program

100
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:13,275
as the basis for rolling out
a national program.

101
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:16,324
So moving on to slide five,

102
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:19,424
we call this one, the high-level support
for the unmentionable.

103
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:23,473
If you get your, in this case
it's the vice-president,

104
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:27,145
you get them talking about sanitation
at the national level,

105
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:29,828
this is something
that had been unthinkable

106
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:33,483
even two years earlier. And it had been very much triggered

107
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:37,368
by vocal articulate mayors
at the national level

108
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:41,114
showing that they had done something,
and if we can do it, why can't you?

109
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:46,261
The national government got on board
when there was something there

110
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:48,149
that they could copy,
they could scale up.

111
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:51,635
I think it's quite
an important lesson for this,

112
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:54,009
that if you want to motivate
at the national level,

113
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:55,454
they need to have
something to roll out.

114
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,191
The peer pressure
and competition among cities

115
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,638
had been very instrumental.

116
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:01,844
It increased the motivation,

117
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:04,286
mayors increasingly, the city
became embarrassed

118
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:07,276
to come to the summit
without their mayor,

119
00:06:07,276 --> 00:06:09,686
so more mayors started attending.

120
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13,004
Sanitation was seen
as a good public interest platform.

121
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:17,248
It became mentioned in elections,
one mayor actually said to us

122
00:06:17,248 --> 00:06:19,912
"I was reelected through
my sanitation mandate."

123
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:22,080
Very satisfying to hear that.

124
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,698
The mayors have a lot of clout
at the national level.

125
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,845
The cities' strategies became
a very tangible outcome

126
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:32,150
for local government planning,
and it fitted into the government's cycle.

127
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:34,630
We had worked entirely
within the government

128
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,323
planning and budgeting cycle,

129
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:38,776
which had a lot of limitations,
quite a few frustrations,

130
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:42,120
but that was the way
to institutionalize what was happening.

131
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:46,430
I'll show you later
a picture of some products.

132
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,393
We used a lot of very high quality
media communications.

133
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:55,552
A very inspired local company
who had wonderful, wacky ideas

134
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:59,539
to appeal to people,
and there was a lot of video images,

135
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,843
a lot of posters, and visual images
that the media could pick up,

136
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:06,136
that people could catch on to.

137
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,210
By 2009, this became
quite a big national issue.

138
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,887
And the program, which was due
to finish in early 2010,

139
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:17,082
then helped the government to develop

140
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:21,103
their national acceleration
of sanitation program

141
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:25,316
and this is slide six, sort of a summary
of what they intended to do

142
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:28,861
from 2010 to 2014.

143
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:33,706
So they have almost come to the end
of this first five-year plan

144
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:35,842
and they are now developing
their second five-year plan.

145
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,611
What you'll see here
is that this is an integrated

146
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:42,789
wastewater, solid waste,
and drainage plan.

147
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:46,694
That was very much the demand
of the cities and what was required,

148
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:50,853
and it has very specific targets
for each of those subsectors.

149
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:53,243
I forgot to mention in part one

150
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:56,113
that actually the city focus
had all three of these areas

151
00:07:56,113 --> 00:07:58,454
because this was what
the government wanted to do.

152
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:02,178
We went with what they wanted.
We ended up getting two sets of funding

153
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:05,788
to enable us to do that.
We'd initially gone in only on wastewater,

154
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:09,305
but when it became clear that wastewater
probably wouldn't fly on its own,

155
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:14,883
we managed to get co-funding to add
the solid waste and drainage sectors.

156
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:19,607
There was a great deal of government
support for an integrated approach.

157
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,892
If you look at the five year
acceleration program on slide seven,

158
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:26,223
you will see some very large numbers.

159
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:29,414
The government was very ambitious,
and again on the left hand side,

160
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:30,987
you see that cycle.

161
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:33,467
They want you to work
through that cycle systematically

162
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:35,591
in the number of cities
that they were working in,

163
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:40,437
so even to go from the twelve cities
to 41 cities in 2009

164
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,137
was already very ambitious.

165
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:46,833
The roles and responsibilities
for who would be implementing

166
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,689
these different parts of the cycle varied

167
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:51,407
depending on what needed to be done,

168
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,703
so you can see that
on the right hand side of the slide.

169
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:59,398
So if we look now at slide eight,
what actually has happened,

170
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,919
what is very clear, investment
has gone up enormously.

171
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,628
Slide nine will give you a graph
of what this looks like in practice,

172
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:11,974
but we've gone from a miniscule
national proportion of the national budget

173
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:14,146
to a third of one percent.

174
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:18,019
In a country the size of Indonesia,
a third of one percent

175
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,227
of the national budget
is a lot of money.

176
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:24,313
A 1000% increase from $50 million a year

177
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,237
to $540 million a year
over the seven years

178
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:28,822
in terms of the national budget.

179
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:31,059
This has included
not only national commitment,

180
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:33,572
but an even greater increase
in the spending

181
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:35,309
of local governments on sanitation

182
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,700
so it's very much a co-funded initiative

183
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,630
between central government
and local government.

184
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:43,987
The PPSP program which was to scale up

185
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:46,032
those figures you saw
in the previous slide

186
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,649
was not fully funded,
but it went a very long way

187
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:51,857
and given how ambitious
the targets were,

188
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,646
there's a big question
about whether the capacity

189
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:55,483
to spend all that money was there.

190
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:59,034
Slide nine, you just
briefly see that scale.

191
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:04,886
I would like to point out again
that the program finished in early 2010,

192
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:08,522
so if you can look at the escalation
in funding since the program finished,

193
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:13,719
you can see how much funds
were leveraged by that $10,000 investment

194
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,871
over five years.

195
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:17,796
Finally, I just want to focus

196
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:21,986
on a few lessons learned
along the way.

197
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,625
There are many, but here are a few.

198
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:28,003
First of all, to get
the national government

199
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:31,564
or to get the high level leaders,
whether it's the mayor of the city

200
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:35,880
or the vice president or the ministers
prioritizing sanitation,

201
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,370
is an essential step to going to scale.

202
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,660
It is not enough, but it is necessary,

203
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,265
but not sufficient.

204
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:45,917
Talking about money to decision makers

205
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:48,528
is more effective than talking
about infant mortality

206
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:51,324
or health or anything else, really.

207
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:56,411
We had done this economics
of sanitation work.

208
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:59,196
The first results
had come out in Indonesia

209
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:03,781
about 2008, so we could use those figures
as part of the advocacy campaign,

210
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,568
and there's no question that they were

211
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:07,558
the most effective element
of that campaign

212
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:09,964
and we built that in at that time.

213
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:13,918
Local government capacity
varied a great deal,

214
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:18,193
so although we had this sanitation cycle,
this city sanitation cycle,

215
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:20,735
the way it worked in different cities
varied a great deal.

216
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:23,348
Some cities could almost run
on their own quite early,

217
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:25,624
others needed a great deal
more technical support,

218
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:27,327
hand-holding and capacity building.

219
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,857
We had to find a balance
between technical facilitation

220
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,612
without compromising ownership.

221
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:35,189
Now, this is a really tricky one.

222
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:38,426
Do you get the consultants to go in
and do a very high quality

223
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:42,597
city sanitation strategy,
or do you let the city do it on its own,

224
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:44,564
and it's perhaps
a little bit lower quality.

225
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:49,870
Do you take over, and this is a balance
that all the time we had to work out,

226
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,485
and I think to some extent
that balance is going on.

227
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:57,415
The city needs support
from a technical assistance team

228
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:59,732
or from local consultants,
but how do they do it?

229
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:02,647
Keep the decision making
at the local government level,

230
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:06,203
don't let any project or program
take over that decision making.

231
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:09,807
And a real lesson learned,
we had worked with local government

232
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:10,966
and at national level,

233
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:13,446
and we'd kind of forgotten
about the provincial government,

234
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:16,369
and that was a role
that we began to see was very important

235
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,942
and towards the end of the program
we began to realize

236
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:20,511
that we needed to strengthen that program

237
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:22,903
and use the national government
more significantly

238
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:25,136
and at that stage, they began
to see what was happening

239
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:28,062
and they were interested,
began to work out quite well.

240
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:30,391
So this is a very brief overview.

241
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:34,996
There's a couple of publications available
that Sandec will let you know about

242
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:37,099
and you'll be able to read
a bit more about this.

243
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:40,400
Well, I've very much enjoyed
sharing this program.

244
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,950
It was five years of my life,

245
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,829
and I hope you found it inspiring.

246
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,210
And thank you for listening.
