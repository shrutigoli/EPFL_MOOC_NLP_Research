1
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:06,269
We are now going to look
at technologies

2
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:09,000
for using or disposing
of treated effluent.

3
00:00:09,437 --> 00:00:12,448
I will also briefly talk
about surface disposal

4
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:15,145
and storage of sludge
and other solid products

5
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:16,711
that cannot be utilized.

6
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:19,189
Biogas is another sanitation product

7
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:21,025
that can be used beneficially.

8
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:22,722
We will shortly see how.

9
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:25,178
Let's start
with the utilization of effluent.

10
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:28,037
Remember that effluent
is the general term

11
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:30,520
for a liquid that leaves the technology,

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,073
typically after blackwater or sludge
has undergone solid-liquid separation

13
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:37,122
or some other type of treatment.

14
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,532
Depending on the level of treatment,

15
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:42,300
the effluent may be completely sanitized

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,531
or may still require further treatment

17
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:46,631
before it can be used or disposed of.

18
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:52,041
In general, only water that has had
secondary treatment, for example,

19
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,906
in a physical and then a biological
treatment step, should be used,

20
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,658
to limit the risk of crop contamination
and health risks to workers.

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,979
To reduce dependence on fresh water

22
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:08,010
and increase crop yields by supplying
increased water and nutrients to plants,

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,992
properly treated wastewater
can be used for irrigation in agriculture.

24
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:15,077
There are two kinds
of irrigation technologies.

25
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:20,882
First, "drip irrigation", where the water
is slowly dripped on or near the root area

26
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:22,793
as shown in this drawing here,

27
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:28,111
and second, surface irrigation
where water is routed over land

28
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:30,212
in a series of dug channels or furrows,

29
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:31,972
as you can see on this photo.

30
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:37,460
Of course, it is also possible
to manually apply water to plants

31
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,043
using watering cans.

32
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:43,246
To minimize evaporation
and contact with pathogens, however,

33
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:45,281
spray irrigation should be avoided.

34
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:48,355
WHO published a volume of guidelines

35
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:51,096
specifically on wastewater
use in agriculture.

36
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:53,230
These should be consulted

37
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,659
for detailed information
and specific guidance.

38
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,333
You can find this document
for download on the course webpage.

39
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:02,067
Another way of generating benefits

40
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,859
from treated effluent
is the use in aquaculture.

41
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:08,258
Aquaculture refers
to the controlled cultivation

42
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,357
of aquatic plants and animals.

43
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:14,608
Two examples are fish ponds
and floating plant ponds.

44
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:17,615
Fish and plants growing in such ponds

45
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:20,190
remove the nutrients from the wastewater

46
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,989
and are eventually harvested.

47
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:25,234
Fish are typically used for consumption

48
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:27,910
or as a source of protein
for other animals,

49
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,000
and plants like duckweed can be used
to feed animals, for instance.

50
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,492
Plant ponds can even achieve
additional reduction of organic matter

51
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:38,285
and suspended solids.

52
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:42,299
It is possible to combine fish
and floating plants in one single pond.

53
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:44,789
There are also WHO guidelines

54
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,491
on wastewater and excreta use
in aquaculture

55
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,219
containing detailed information
about health aspects

56
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,673
and specific guidance for risk reduction.

57
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:56,660
You can also download them
from the course page if you're interested.

58
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,610
In case there is no use for the effluent,

59
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,714
it can be discharged to a "soak pit",

60
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,072
also known as a "soakaway" or "leach pit".

61
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,370
A "soak pit" is a covered,
porous walled chamber

62
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,139
that allows water to slowly infiltrate
into the ground.

63
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:15,659
It can be left empty and lined
with a porous material

64
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,175
to provide support and prevent collapse,

65
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:21,752
or left unlined and filled
with coarse rocks and gravel

66
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:23,517
as shown in the photo.

67
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:26,812
Primary treatment of the wastewater
is required in both cases,

68
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,071
In order to prevent clogging.

69
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:32,869
As the effluent percolates
through the filter material,

70
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,704
into the surrounding soil,

71
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:37,830
small particles are filtered out
by the soil matrix

72
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,679
and organics are digested
by microorganisms.

73
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:45,323
This relatively simple technology
is best suited for soils

74
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:47,180
with good absorptive properties.

75
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:50,009
A "leach field" or "drainage field"

76
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:53,084
is also designed to infiltrate
pre-settled effluent.

77
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:56,005
It is a network of perforated pipes

78
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:58,775
that are laid in underground,
gravel-filled trenches,

79
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:02,897
to dissipate the effluent, typically
from a water-based collection

80
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:05,138
and storage technology,
like a septic tank.

81
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,724
The piping system
distributes the effluent

82
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:11,840
into the subsurface soil
for absorption and further treatment.

83
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:15,045
The treatment takes place
by soil microorganisms.

84
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:19,790
To prevent contamination,
a leach field should be located

85
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,988
sufficiently away
from a drinking water source.

86
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,805
This technology
is particularly appropriate

87
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:29,583
for rural areas, where the risk
of over-saturating the soil is low,

88
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,409
and where there is sufficient space.

89
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:35,740
Like for the soak pit,
primary treatment of the effluent

90
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,558
is crucial to prevent clogging.

91
00:04:38,063 --> 00:04:41,937
Treated effluent or stormwater
can also be directly discharged

92
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:45,228
into receiving water bodies
such as rivers or lakes,

93
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:47,831
or into the ground to recharge aquifers.

94
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:51,317
The use of the surface
water body, for example,

95
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:53,146
as a resource for drinking water,

96
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:56,668
influences the quality and quantity
of treated wastewater

97
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:59,174
that can be introduced
without negative effects.

98
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:05,012
Parameters such as turbidity,
temperature and nutrients, among others,

99
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:06,863
should be closely monitored

100
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:09,694
when releasing effluent
into a natural water body.

101
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,844
Groundwater recharge
is most appropriate

102
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:15,982
for areas where groundwater
resources deplete,

103
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,966
and in coastal communities
where saltwater intrusion from the sea

104
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,283
becomes a threat.

105
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,217
In the previous module, we already
looked at agricultural application

106
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:28,156
of treated feces, compost, or sludge.

107
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:31,456
In case there is no demand for,
or acceptance

108
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,179
of the beneficial use of these products,

109
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:36,722
surface disposal of the generated solids

110
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:38,352
may be the only option.

111
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,680
"Surface disposal" refers to the stockpiling

112
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,795
of sludge, feces, or other materials
that cannot be used elsewhere.

113
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:50,066
Once the material has been taken
to such a disposal site,

114
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,675
it is not used later.

115
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:55,069
Storage refers to temporary stockpiling.

116
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:58,118
It can be done
when a future need is anticipated

117
00:05:58,118 --> 00:06:01,759
or when further
pathogen reduction or drying

118
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,302
is desired before application.

119
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:07,828
Surface disposal
is primarily used for sludge

120
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:12,548
although it is applicable
for any type of dry, unusable material.

121
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:17,718
Landfilling sludge along with municipal
solid waste is not advisable,

122
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:20,288
since it reduces the life of a landfill

123
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:22,018
which has been specifically designed

124
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:24,882
for the containment
of more noxious materials.

125
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:28,029
Surface disposal sites
should ideally be located

126
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:32,606
close to where the sludge is treated
to minimize transport distances.

127
00:06:33,182 --> 00:06:37,075
Attention must be paid
to groundwater contamination and leaching.

128
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,344
Sites for temporary storage of a product

129
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:43,804
should be covered to avoid
rewetting by rainwater.

130
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:48,656
"Biogas" is another quite different type
of product from sanitation systems.

131
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:53,312
It contains energy and can basically
be used like any fuel gas.

132
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,054
As you can see from these pictures here,

133
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:57,903
biogas can be easily used

134
00:06:57,903 --> 00:07:00,883
at household level
for cooking and for lighting.

135
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:05,596
but it is even possible to operate
refrigerators or vehicles with biogas.

136
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:10,820
Another use of biogas
is in engines to generate electricity,

137
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,866
like the small one shown here.

138
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:16,065
At household level, cooking
is the most suitable use,

139
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:21,317
because the calorific efficiency
of 55% is quite high for that application.

140
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:25,403
With only 3%, biogas lamps
are far less efficient.

141
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:27,988
We have seen
that properly treated effluent

142
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:31,621
can also be beneficially used
in agriculture or aquaculture.

143
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:34,668
Its constant availability
throughout the year

144
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:37,180
may reduce farmers' dependence
on fresh water

145
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,157
and the valuable nutrient contents

146
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:40,789
can help to improve crop yields.

147
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:44,413
If utilization is not possible or desired,

148
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:47,270
ways to safely dispose
of the generated effluent

149
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,385
or solid materials have to be found.

150
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:52,456
In order not to pollute the environment,

151
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:55,919
it is of particular importance
to identify appropriate sites

152
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,602
to dispose of those products.

153
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,086
Sanitation systems can be designed

154
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:02,780
not only to recover water and nutrients,

155
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,195
but also energy.

156
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:07,053
Biogas is a valuable
source of renewable energy

157
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,156
which can be easily generated and used.

158
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:14,108
The following module is about
innovative emerging technologies

159
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:17,036
and ongoing developments
in the sanitation sector.
