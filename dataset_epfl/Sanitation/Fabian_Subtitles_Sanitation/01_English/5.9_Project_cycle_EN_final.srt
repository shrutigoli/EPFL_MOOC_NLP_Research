00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,090
– Water and Sanitation Program
In this module we will look

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,880
at how some of the ideas

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,360
outlined earlier

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,510
can be applied in the context

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,180
of an urban sanitation project

9
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,750
or a broader urban
development project.

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,330
It must be stated at the outset

11
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,690
that no two projects follow
the same trajectory,

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,900
and there may be other

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,150
independently managed activities
and documents

14
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,530
that can be brought into
the project process,

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,220
as well as the project
team’s accumulated knowledge

16
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,790
and that of their
country counterparts.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,880
This also means
that not all the tools

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,410
will be needed in any given situation.

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,640
They should be seen
simply as resources

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,620
that may be useful
to decision-makers

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,870
and to those who prepare
and implement projects.

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,540
This slide shows the steps

23
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,430
in a typical project cycle,

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,600
starting with identification

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,410
and the development
of a project concept,

26
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,070
through planning
and design,

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,620
to implementation and,
finally, evaluation.

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,810
The lessons learned
from the evaluation

29
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,070
should then feed into the design

30
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,770
of a subsequent project.

31
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,420
Some of the details addressed

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,120
in these different phases
are shown on the slide.

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,420
Here is the table
of how the tools

34
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,780
discussed in previous

35
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,590
modules might be applied
in a generic project.

36
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,270
As you can see,

37
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,310
the various tools can be
used at different stages

38
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,820
of the project cycle.

39
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,990
In the case of a project
prepared in Lusaka,

40
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,880
for example,

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,200
the starting point
was the preparation

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,900
of a Sanitation
Master Plan for the city.

43
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,920
Such plans, however, often focus

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,470
on infrastructure development,

45
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,590
and normally propose the expansion

46
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,080
of sewerage at great
cost to the city.

47
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,810
Even though areas
that are earmarked

48
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,330
for on-site sanitation

49
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,580
may be identified
under a master plan,

50
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,850
little consideration

51
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,860
is usually given
to prioritizing

52
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,280
between them,

53
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,460
to identifying how on-site systems

54
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,150
will be designed
and constructed, etc.

55
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,870
Moreover, the issues
involved in creating

56
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,560
a fecal sludge
management service chain

57
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,950
are also usually not addressed.

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,720
At an early stage
in project development,

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,820
a fecal waste flow diagram,

60
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,530
or SFD, was prepared for Lusaka,

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,720
which highlighted that
the biggest sanitation issue

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,100
in the city is, in fact,

63
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,470
fecal sludge management or FSM.

64
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,250
This is very important information

65
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,920
to present to decision-makers

66
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,640
and service providers
in a city,

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,770
as they may be reluctant
to engage with FSM

68
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,540
if it is a service that they have
not formally provided before,

69
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,670
or if there are concerns about

70
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,420
how to implement FSM solutions,

71
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,910
how to cover its costs, etc.

72
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,490
There may also be prejudice
against pit latrines,

73
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,250
which are sometimes
seen as a dirty,

74
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,220
polluting or inappropriate
sanitation solution.

75
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,860
Latrines are often poorly

76
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,550
constructed in rapidly
urbanizing neighborhoods,

77
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,290
but the extent to which
they pollute the groundwater,

78
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,850
as compared to septic tanks

79
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,550
and sewers which exert

80
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,410
a much higher hydraulic
load of polluted water,

81
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,450
should be analyzed
in the city in question.

82
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,940
Groundwater
pollution from sanitation systems

83
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,910
can be an important
consideration in a city:

84
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,930
by way of example,

85
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,910
Lusaka draws almost
half of its water supply

86
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,620
from karstic aquifers
beneath the city,

87
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,280
and so a groundwater
vulnerability map

88
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,170
was prepared in order
to understand this issue better.

89
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,790
The preceding information
can then be combined

90
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,930
with the findings
of the Urban Sanitation

91
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,160
Status Index which,

92
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,930
in the case of Lusaka,

93
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,440
was based on a geographically
stratified survey

94
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,430
of about 1,500 households
across the city,

95
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,810
in order to prioritize
project interventions.

96
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,220
For Lusaka, the combined information

97
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,240
clearly shows that the largest
concentration of poor sanitation

98
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,730
is in unplanned
peri-urban settlements

99
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,290
which sit almost entirely over

100
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,470
the area of maximum
groundwater vulnerability.

101
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,800
This information provided a clear basis

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,590
for prioritizing non-networked
sanitation interventions.

103
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,570
The City Service
Delivery Assessment

104
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,450
and the Prognosis
for Change tools

105
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,570
can then be used to draw

106
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,650
out the key institutional constraints

107
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,260
and to develop
a politically feasible roadmap

108
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,530
for providing sustainable
sanitation service provision

109
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,730
under the project.

110
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,030
A City Service
Delivery Assessment

111
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,490
was prepared
in Balikpapan, Indonesia,

112
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,120
for example,

113
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,550
and highlighted a need
for better management

114
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,530
of the downstream end
of the FSM service chain,

115
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,300
and a more systematic approach

116
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,570
to the full service
delivery chain

117
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,050
by the local authority.

118
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,100
Although the service outcomes
were rated as quite good,

119
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,820
this was mainly due to services

120
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,370
provided autonomously by
the private sector.

121
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,790
As a result of this information,

122
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,430
the city moved to develop
sludge treatment capacity

123
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,780
and to oblige service
providers to use it,

124
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,160
as well as to
improve containment

125
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,980
and emptying in poor
unplanned neighborhoods.

126
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,910
In the Indonesian city case,

127
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,170
these were issues
which the SFD had identified

128
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,850
and the Service Delivery
Assessment further highlighted

129
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,680
as not being addressed
by the authorities.

130
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,870
The project design stage

131
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,550
takes the project components identified

132
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,000
and outlined in the initial
conceptual description

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,460
and translates them into plans
for infrastructure

134
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,040
and for developing
the enabling environment

135
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,710
and the institutions

136
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,310
which will provide and oversee
the sanitation services.

137
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,290
At this stage,

138
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,220
it is also useful
to identify early interventions

139
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,420
that can achieve
short term results,

140
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,530
as a means to further
consolidate support

141
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,480
from the key stakeholders

142
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,770
and to thus gain
further traction

143
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,770
for the project.

144
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,670
Insights into the political economy

145
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,050
and the potential for change
can be very useful to inform

146
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,490
which early interventions
should be prioritized.

147
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,250
The Service Delivery
Action Framework builds

148
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,620
on the results of the Service
Delivery Assessment

149
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,100
and the political
economy analysis.

150
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,250
It is designed to indicate
the next steps

151
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,890
in building up sustainable service
delivery arrangements,

152
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,440
starting from the
current situation.

153
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,250
These steps can then be translated

154
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,870
into technical assistance

155
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,260
and other supplementary
inputs to be provided

156
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,490
under the project.

157
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,480
In the cities of Maputo
and Beira in Mozambique,

158
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,170
for example,

159
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,860
technical assistance
was provided

160
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,840
for a revision
of the sanitation bylaws in order

161
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,520
to recognize and allow
for the regulation

162
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,120
of FSM services

163
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,670
provided by both the public
and private sectors;

164
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,020
in Balikpapan,

165
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,040
the authorities built
on the Service

166
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,870
Delivery Action Framework

167
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,260
to move towards
scheduled emptying.

168
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,710
The Intervention
Options Assessment process

169
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,240
is an engineering process
of comparing solutions,

170
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,710
and cannot be substituted
by the use of tools.

171
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,580
However, by adopting
a systematic approach

172
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,460
that takes into account
the whole sanitation service chain,

173
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,150
technology choices can be matched
to the specific challenges

174
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,260
previously identified,

175
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,650
drawing on technical expertise

176
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,800
and up-to-date
reference material,

177
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,310
and validated with
the responsible authorities,

178
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,810
service providers and users.

179
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,330
A key external resource
for this design stage

180
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,940
is the material produced
by EAWAG/SANDEC,

181
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,990
which clearly lays out in one place

182
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,220
much of the technical
knowledge around sanitation

183
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,030
and fecal sludge
management technologies.

184
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,250
As a result of having undertaken

185
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,350
such preparatory design work,

186
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,240
project interventions
are identified.

187
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,490
In the case of Lusaka,

188
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,710
these include interventions
to upgrade latrines

189
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,780
to make them easier to empty as shown
in the pictures on the right;

190
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,120
to develop small-scale
service providers

191
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,210
to empty latrines
in unplanned areas,

192
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,000
and to install transfer
and treatment facilities

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,560
to deal with the fecal
sludge collected.

194
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,720
The tools I have described
in this module

195
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,230
are focused on diagnostics
and project preparation and design,

196
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,250
and are not intended
to add substantially

197
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,850
to the implementation stage
of the project cycle.

198
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,390
However, impact monitoring
and the learning

199
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,240
of lessons at project

200
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,230
closure bring
the cycle full circle,

201
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,780
and the basic diagnostic tools ,SFD,

202
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,450
USSI and CSDA,

203
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,300
can then be re-run

204
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,700
to assess progress made
under the project,

205
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,570
how sustainable it is,

206
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,070
and what lessons
can be taken forward

207
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,780
for the design of subsequent projects.

208
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,520
In summary,

209
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,680
the material we covered
in this module looked

210
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,610
at the following aspects
of the project cycle

211
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,250
in its different stages:

212
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,130
Identifying problems
and risks,

213
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,310
identifying and prioritizing
interventions,

214
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,230
identifying management
and institutional issues,

215
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,870
designing institutional improvements,

216
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,840
designing the physical interventions,
monitoring outcomes,

217
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,300
and evaluating the lessons
learned to feed

218
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,650
into future project designs.
