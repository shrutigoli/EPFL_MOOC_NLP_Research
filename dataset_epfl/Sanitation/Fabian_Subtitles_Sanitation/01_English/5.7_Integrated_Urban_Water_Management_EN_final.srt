00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,160
Welcome to the Module
on Integrated

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,420
Urban Water Management:

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,150
Sustainably Managing
the Urban Water Cycle.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,060
My name is Lizmara Kirchner,
and I am a Senior Water

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,610
and Sanitation Specialist
with the World Bank Group,

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,320
based in Washington, DC.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,890
In this module,
we will introduce

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,010
some systematic ways to understand

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,960
and analyze complex water issues

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,420
in urban areas

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,650
through integrated
urban water management,

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,290
a holistic approach to managing
the urban water cycle,

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,390
which brings diverse actors,

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,480
services and sectors together

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,380
around common goals
for sustainable outcomes.

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,470
Integrated Urban Water Management

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,970
is an integral component

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,200
of sustainable cities
and metropolitan areas.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,070
In this module we
explore the challenges

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,650
in urban water management

21
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,090
and how Integrated
Urban Water Management

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,680
can contribute with
sustainable solutions.

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,910
We cover basic concepts,

24
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,460
key principles, common drivers,

25
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,930
and building blocks
that can be used to apply

26
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,520
an integrated urban water

27
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,430
management approach in a city.

28
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,150
The world is currently
facing an urban water crisis.

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,610
54% of the world’s population
resides in urban areas,

30
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,310
and by 2050 two thirds
of the population in the world

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,700
will be living in urban settings,

32
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,680
adding 2.5 billion people to cities,

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,140
90% of whom will be
in Asia and Africa.

34
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,870
Economic development
and rapid urbanization

35
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,870
dramatically increase the demand

36
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,450
for water
for municipal,

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,250
domestic, industrial,

38
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,170
agricultural,
energy, environment

39
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,920
& recreational uses.

40
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,530
Water pollution
is increasing

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,510
in developing country cities

42
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,420
due to rapid changes
in land-use patterns,

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,170
inadequate wastewater collection
and treatment,

44
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,150
poor solid waste
and storm water management

45
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,810
and aging infrastructure.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,800
Climate change imposes

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,600
additional stress
on urban water sources

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,470
due to increased variability

49
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,280
and uncertainty of both
floods and droughts.

50
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,380
Traditional approaches
to urban water

51
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,810
investments are often fragmented

52
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,660
and frequently unsustainable

53
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,390
since they generally
do not take into consideration

54
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,980
the multiple dimensions
and cross cutting issues

55
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,790
of urban water management.

56
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,860
Integrated
Urban Water Management,

57
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,590
or IUWM, is a flexible,

58
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,350
participatory
and iterative process,

59
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,670
which integrates the elements
of the urban water cycle,

60
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,730
such as water supply, sanitation,
storm water management,

61
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,350
and solid waste management,

62
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,570
within the context
of a city’s land use,

63
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,660
urban development and river
basin management,

64
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,720
in order to maximize economic,

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,640
social and environmental benefits.

66
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,560
IUWM offers a holistic way

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,880
of undertaking strategic planning

68
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,090
by considering the management

69
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,970
of competing water uses
at the level of the watershed,

70
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,230
while recognizing the needs of the city

71
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,680
as well as those upstream
and downstream users.

72
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,630
IUWM takes into account
the needs of all users

73
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,310
within the basin

74
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,970
while working across vertical

75
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,920
and horizontal administrative boundaries

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,320
in order to overcome

77
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,930
the traditional fragmentation
of the Urban Water

78
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,390
Cycle as well as to allow
the consideration

79
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,190
and integration
of interdependent sectors

80
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,670
both urban and related sectors,

81
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,120
shown in green,

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,190
and the different
water subsectors,

83
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,180
shown in blue.

84
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,960
International experience shows
that the transition

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,470
to an integrated urban
water management approach

86
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,040
is an incremental process
triggered by one

87
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,010
or several drivers
that could be:

88
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,600
social, such as population growth
and rapid urbanization;

89
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,770
economic, for instance

90
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,260
when there is an urgent need
for livable space;

91
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,930
or environmental,

92
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,650
such as water
quality issues,

93
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,610
water scarcity
or extreme climate events.

94
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,370
Cities in developed countries

95
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,740
have transitioned through
these phases,

96
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,280
motivated by socio-political drivers.

97
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,730
Fast-growing cities
in developing economies

98
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,440
could ‘leap-frog’ some

99
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,750
or all of these earlier phases

100
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,570
so that they can become
water-sensitive cities more quickly,

101
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,460
thus avoiding the mistakes

102
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,320
that developed cities made while
following this path.

103
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,870
We will now present
practical guidance on building blocks

104
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,510
and potential activities
that may be considered

105
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,750
when engaging with a city

106
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,460
under an Integrated Urban Water
Management approach.

107
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,270
The activities listed
are to be taken

108
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,600
as general guidance,

109
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,480
as their application in each case

110
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,190
will vary depending
on local conditions and drivers,

111
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,050
as well as on
the city’s experience

112
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,210
in applying an integrated approach,

113
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,820
the level of interest
of its key stakeholders,

114
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,830
and their capacity.

115
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,970
Assessments
undertaken using

116
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,410
an integrated urban water
management framework

117
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,210
should include the evaluation
of urban and water

118
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,700
investments over a longer-term period

119
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,710
of 20 to 50 years.

120
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,140
In line with this long-term
strategic planning,

121
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,000
specific investment projects

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,660
and programs can be
designed and implemented

123
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,960
that may deal
with a smaller

124
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,730
number of complementary urban

125
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,530
and water interventions.

126
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,970
The main objectives
of the engagement

127
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,230
phase are to determine whether:

128
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,460
an Integrated Urban Water
Management Approach

129
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,970
is appropriate to deal
with the city's challenges

130
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,350
and development goals,

131
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,450
and to determine whether there
are appropriate drivers

132
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,130
and a suitable
enabling environment

133
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,980
for embarking upon an Integrated
Urban Water Management

134
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,280
planning process.

135
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,670
Activities to be undertaken
in this phase can include:

136
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,890
Conducting a data review

137
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,640
of the urban and water sectors

138
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,170
in the city
covering

139
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,740
the aspects listed
on the screen in order

140
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,850
to gain a better understanding
of the city profile

141
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,720
and of the water
and urban issues it faces;

142
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,300
identifying and mapping stakeholder

143
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,630
and analyzing the related institutional

144
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,230
and regulatory framework

145
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,840
as well as the political
economy in the city

146
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,710
and whether these are favorable
to an IUWM approach;

147
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,660
making the case for integrated
urban water management

148
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,590
with the identified
stakeholders,

149
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,700
and undertaking a rapid field

150
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,220
assessment of the urban

151
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,520
and water challenges
in the city

152
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,480
in order to refine the desk review

153
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,080
analysis with the stakeholders

154
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,770
to gain a better understanding

155
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,120
of the water challenges
the city faces

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,380
and the processes and systems
in place to deal with them.

157
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,070
Based on the data gathered

158
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,570
and the stakeholder consultation

159
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,230
carried out
during the previous phase,

160
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,630
the main objectives
of the diagnostic phase

161
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,940
are to determine
which challenges urban

162
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,480
and water sectors are facing,

163
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,880
or will face;

164
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,900
analyze the links between
water use in the watershed

165
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,330
and other sectors,

166
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,010
including those listed here

167
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,820
; consider existing
integrated practices

168
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,410
or lack thereof;

169
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,290
assess the resilience
of the urban water sector

170
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,220
to future demographic change,

171
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,830
water resource constraints
and climate change impacts.

172
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,290
It is important
to look not only at data

173
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,060
but also at the modus operandi
of the involved institutions.

174
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,450
Technical studies
should be carried out next

175
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,840
with the objective of:

176
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,520
Determining whether the proposed

177
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,470
IUWM measures make economic
and financial sense;

178
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,820
assessing the financial feasibility
of solutions identified

179
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,290
as suitable
during the diagnostic phase;

180
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,000
identifying the resulting structural

181
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,020
and non-structural IUWM
measures to be implemented,

182
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,370
where structural measures are
the infrastructure interventions

183
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,220
and non-structural
measures cover

184
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,390
the regulations,
legal frameworks,

185
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,300
tariffs, and education
and capacity building.

186
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,210
A number of technical studies

187
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,560
will be required to inform

188
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,540
the next phase
of strategic planning,

189
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,880
including those listed
on the screen.

190
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,680
The objectives of the strategic
planning phase are to:

191
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
Validate with stakeholders

192
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,200
the proposed IUWM framework

193
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
and options considered;

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,260
clarify institutional responsibilities

195
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,980
for implementing
the proposed solutions;

196
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,190
put mechanisms in place to manage

197
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,510
and share data across sectors
and institutions;

198
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,740
develop and apply
an appropriate monitoring

199
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,370
and evaluation framework
for the strategic plan.

200
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,020
Once stakeholders have
decided to move forward

201
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,220
with an IUWM approach,

202
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,040
a vision can be developed
for the long-term integration

203
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,000
of urban water management in the city

204
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,120
to include
the following elements:

205
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,910
Agreement on a set of proposed
outcomes for the city,

206
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,550
on institutional responsibilities

207
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,860
and cost sharing
arrangements;

208
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,870
milestones and a monitoring
framework for the tracking

209
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,600
of the implementation of activities

210
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,520
to reach the proposed outcomes;

211
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,720
mechanisms for review, feedback,

212
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,970
knowledge management
and course correction.

213
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,690
To summarize, in this module
we have seen

214
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,500
that integrated urban water management

215
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,380
is about improving
the way water resources

216
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,630
and related services

217
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,290
are managed across
the urban water cycle by:

218
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,520
promoting resource diversification,

219
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,330
system efficiency
and conservation,

220
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,180
while taking into consideration

221
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,540
all water users
in the city

222
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,990
and in the wider catchment

223
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,690
through broad
stakeholder participation.

224
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,410
IUWM offers a holistic approach
to strategic planning

225
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,150
and implementation which
considers the management

226
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,640
of competing water uses

227
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,980
and urban service provision
in the city,

228
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,660
in the context of the watershed,

229
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,170
while recognizing the water
needs of the city

230
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,640
as well as those of upstream
and downstream users.

231
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,740
An approach to integrated
urban water management encompasses:

232
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,770
initial engagement
and mapping of stakeholders;

233
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
the undertaking of diagnoses

234
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,640
to analyze the city’s urban
and water challenges;

235
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,340
strategic planning
to identify objectives and outcomes,

236
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,930
priorities and costs,

237
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,790
institutional responsibilities,

238
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,840
monitoring
and evaluation frameworks,

239
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,610
and feedback mechanisms.
