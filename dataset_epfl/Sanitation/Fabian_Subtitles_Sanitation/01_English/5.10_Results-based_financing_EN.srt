Inga Afanasieva, World Bank –
Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,670
Welcome. This module
introduces the role

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,230
that results-based financing

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,600
approaches can play

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,760
in meeting growing infrastructure

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,330
and service challenges

9
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,220
in the provision
of urban sanitation.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,490
My name is Inga Afanasieva

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,450
and I am an Infrastructure Specialist
with the Global Partnership

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,690
for Output-Based Aid of the World Bank,

13
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,600
a partnership of donors working together

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,820
to support communities
to access basic services

15
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,840
using results-based financing

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,910
and output-based aid approaches.

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,480
In this module,
we will introduce the role

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,840
that results-based financing

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,560
and output-based aid
can have to improve

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,510
the delivery of urban
sanitation services

21
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,250
to the poor
and explain

22
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,610
how these innovative
financing approaches

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,430
can deliver
verified results.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,540
Results-based financing (RBF)

25
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,590
is a term for a range
of financing mechanisms

26
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,950
that provide payments

27
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,010
after verified results
have been delivered.

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,540
It is becoming
increasingly important,

29
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,200
as delivering public services

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,780
and basic services

31
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,700
requires policymakers
to consider innovative

32
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,030
financing methods

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,190
to improve service
delivery and outcomes

34
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,970
and increase cost
recovery levels.

35
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,430
Results-based financing
has emerged as an important,

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,220
innovative tool for
financing basic services

37
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,610
because it switches
the emphasis from inputs

38
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,640
- funding given in advance
for expected results

39
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,750
(such as planning
and buying construction materials)

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,920
- to outputs, such as
electricity connections,

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,270
or new or improved latrines.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,930
Payments from funders
or government

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,330
to service providers

44
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,680
happen only when the agreed results
have been achieved.

45
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,040
The service provider
takes the risk

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,370
that if the results
aren’t achieved,

47
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,370
they are not paid.

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,270
By moving the focus
from activities and plans,

49
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,590
to the monitoring of results,
governments and donors

50
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,870
can ensure money is spent
on the intended purpose.

51
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,230
They can also give service
providers the latitude

52
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,860
to focus on the activities and methods

53
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,230
that they think are best
to achieve the desired outcomes,

54
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,460
and can be used to leverage
private sector financing.

55
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,460
This approach thus enhances

56
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,850
the focus on learning
about what actually works,

57
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,760
and creates scope for
ownership and innovation.

58
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,450
Results-based financing
approaches can be applied

59
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,820
in various sectors and contexts

60
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,350
with a variety
of partners and purposes.

61
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,930
Different instruments
can be used to incentivize the demand

62
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,700
or the supply side
of the service.

63
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,770
On the demand-side,

64
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,660
instruments such as
conditional cash transfers offer rewards

65
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,720
for consuming a service
that can improve their health

66
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
or well-being and benefit society

67
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,030
as a whole.

68
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,400
For example,
families can receive

69
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,710
a cash transfer

70
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,350
as long as their
children attend school

71
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,980
or if they go to clinics regularly
for medical check-ups.

72
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,060
On the supply-side,
service providers

73
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,450
can be incentivized

74
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,190
to deliver the desired
services or results

75
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,040
by output-based aid,

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,220
where service providers are rewarded

77
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,260
for the improved performance

78
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,690
or for extending
quality services,

79
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,430
such as certified
sanitation facilities,

80
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,390
to target poor consumers.

81
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,420
Other results-based financing
instruments link disbursements

82
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,930
to the achievement of specific
government program results

83
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,060
or measurable progress
in a country.

84
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,570
Which type of approach,

85
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,220
or combination of approaches

86
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,140
to use in a given situation,

87
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,180
is highly dependent on context.

88
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,790
For the remainder of this module

89
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,830
we will focus on output-based
aid approaches,

90
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,780
which have been used
in every region of the world

91
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,270
and in numerous sectors.

92
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,320
For more information
about other types

93
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,070
of results-based financing,

94
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,110
please refer to the recommended
reading for this module.

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,030
Output-based aid is designed
to increase access

96
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,770
to basic services
for the poor.

97
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,900
It is used in situations
where poor people are excluded

98
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,790
from receiving basic services,

99
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,700
such as urban sanitation,

100
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,270
because they cannot afford
to pay the connection fee.

101
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,500
In the example
shown on the screen,

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,900
the cost of a connection
to a sewerage network

103
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,400
is $100.

104
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,670
However, the household can
only afford to pay $15.

105
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,390
A service provider
or third party financier,

106
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,800
like a commercial bank

107
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,920
may invest additional capital

108
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,270
into the connection
cost—in this example,

109
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,960
$25,

110
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,770
which can be recovered
though a user tariff

111
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,300
or a government subsidy.

112
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,940
That means that the gap
for the poor household

113
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,330
that prevents them from receiving
the service is $60.

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,510
The output-based aid subsidy
for the poor household

115
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,110
– which is paid only after

116
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,350
measurable results
have been verified

117
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,950
- fills the $60 gap

118
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,670
between the affordable level

119
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,560
that the households can pay
and the real cost

120
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,990
of extending the service
to these households.

121
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,490
By definition,

122
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,370
the output-based
aid subsidy is disbursed

123
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,430
after the connection is made,

124
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,000
so it is important
that the service provider

125
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,920
is able to pre-finance the cost

126
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,870
until the output-based
aid payment is received.

127
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,410
Results-based financing
and output-based

128
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,910
aid can be designed

129
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,270
to deliver innovative solutions

130
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,020
in different environments,

131
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,300
working with both public
and private operators.

132
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,290
They provide incentives
for innovation and efficiency

133
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,670
through competition
or benchmarking,

134
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,260
and by leaving the
technological solutions largely

135
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,850
to the service provider

136
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,180
who gets paid
the agreed amount

137
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,230
if the outputs meet
the quality standards.

138
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,000
In Nairobi, for example,

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,100
dense populations
in informal settlements

140
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,790
and water rationing posed a challenge

141
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,540
to the original project design

142
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,500
of household sewerage connections.

143
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,010
Under the output-based scheme,

144
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,620
the service provider
was given the flexibility

145
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,650
to implement multi-faceted

146
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,140
technical solution more appropriate
to the context.

147
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,440
This involved both
individual household water

148
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,070
connections for the flushing
of the toilets

149
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,750
and compound solutions,

150
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,750
with water storage tanks
for toilet flushing

151
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,110
which also included

152
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,410
an option to use greywater

153
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,970
from handwashing for flushing.

154
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,490
Another example
where output-based aid

155
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,190
is used is the greater

156
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,900
metropolitan Accra area in Ghana.

157
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,650
There are 4 million people
living in the area

158
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,420
and the population is expected

159
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,220
to reach 5 million by 2020.

160
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,810
Half of the households
reside in single rooms

161
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,290
of compound houses

162
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,990
and only 1 in 5 households say

163
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,580
that they used their
own household toilets.

164
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,940
Public funding in
the sanitation sector

165
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,450
cannot keep up
with the demand

166
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,800
and there is considerable room

167
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,280
for the private sector to play a role
in the provision of sanitation.

168
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,610
The poorest suffer the most

169
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,730
because of the high cost of
building their own facilities,

170
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,880
and the high cost
of borrowing to do so.

171
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,200
To address this challenge,

172
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,240
the Government of Ghana chose

173
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,550
output-based aid

174
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,170
with the following
project design:

175
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,640
Households finance 50%
of the cost of the facility

176
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,360
either though a microfinancing loan
or their own savings,

177
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,090
after that service providers

178
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,930
are contracted to build the toilets
to required standards.

179
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,800
Once the construction is complete,

180
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,740
the service provider receives

181
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,990
the remaining 50%

182
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,040
- the output-based aid subsidy
- in two installments:

183
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,060
2/3 upon verification
of the physical construction,

184
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,850
and 1/3 after 3 months
of successful use.

185
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,010
The project was designed
to target low-income communities

186
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,900
and to fund an awareness campaign

187
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,180
through the metropolitan assemblies

188
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,710
and the Environment
and Health Offices.

189
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,360
The project was
designed to develop

190
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,030
the full cycle
of sanitation services

191
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,550
by also subsidizing

192
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,590
the desludging of toilet facilities.

193
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,560
The purpose of the desludging subsidy

194
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,450
was to incentivize the service delivery

195
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,280
and to ensure that
households understand

196
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,670
how to properly dispose
of fecal matter.

197
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,460
The subsidy was designed
to cover half the cost

198
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,720
of the desludging service

199
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,170
and to be payable to the provider

200
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,680
upon verification
of successful service

201
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,150
delivery and proper

202
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,000
disposal of the fecal
sludge.

203
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,490
The total cost of the program
was $5million , which

204
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,000
was expected to incentivize

205
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,390
the construction of over

206
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,020
7,000 household facilities

207
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,440
and 200 desludging operations.

208
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,630
Results-based financing
plays an important role

209
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,840
in meeting the world’s
development challenges.

210
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,070
Output-based aid is a form
of results-based

211
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,080
financing that can provide
service providers the incentives

212
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,760
to extend inclusive
urban sanitation services

213
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,180
to poor and marginalized beneficiaries

214
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,040
that would otherwise
not be reached.

215
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,200
Output-based aid can
be effectively designed

216
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,180
into an urban sanitation
investment program

217
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,170
only after considering
multiple variables,

218
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,130
such as the need for the subsidy,

219
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,040
which needs to be assessed
on the basis of the demand,

220
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,680
the costs and the social benefits.
