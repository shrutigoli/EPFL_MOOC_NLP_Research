00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:06,459
Hello.
I'm Kate Medlicott,

2
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:08,785
technical officer
for sanitation and Wastewater

3
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:10,616
at the World Health Organization.

4
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:14,865
In this video I will give you an overview
of sanitation safety planning,

5
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:16,724
and we'll look at an example.

6
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:21,081
Sanitation safety planning,
or SSP for short,

7
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:24,745
is a risk-based management tool
for sanitation systems.

8
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:27,575
A safely managed sanitation system

9
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:30,921
prevents exposure
to disease-causing excreta,

10
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:35,743
at all steps of the sanitation chain
from containment through emptying,

11
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:39,309
transport, treatment,
and to disposal or reuse.

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,677
It can be used to get out
with excreta flow diagrams or SFDs,

13
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,601
shown in the previous module,

14
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:50,745
to make sure that excreta reaches
safe rather than unsafe endpoints.

15
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:56,612
SSP reduces health impacts
while increasing the benefits of reuse.

16
00:00:57,236 --> 00:01:00,587
SSP can be used
for all kinds of sanitation systems,

17
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:02,995
both in formal and in informal settings.

18
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:07,312
The approach is best used
for improving existing systems.

19
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:12,251
In communities with no sanitation,
demand creation should be prioritized.

20
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:15,588
So, how do SSPs work?

21
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,058
First, we need to understand
the system we plan to manage.

22
00:01:19,518 --> 00:01:22,053
This is referred to
as a system assessment phase,

23
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:26,880
where the sanitation chain and exposure
groups and pathways are identified

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,612
and expressed as hazards.

25
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:32,280
Risks are assessed,
and when they're unacceptable,

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,585
improvements are designed to reduce them.

27
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,966
This approach ensures action
is prioritized according to risk.

28
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:43,475
Monitoring and management
using multiple barriers along the chain

29
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:46,431
ensure that the whole system
is operating as intended.

30
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:51,429
SSP can be applied in many settings.

31
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,547
Today I'll be illustrating the approach
in an informal urban setting

32
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:57,967
typical of growing cities
in many countries.

33
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:03,014
We'll follow the chains showing
examples of exposure groups,

34
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:05,908
hazards, controls
and monitoring at each step

35
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:10,229
to build up a safely managed sanitation
system that protects public health.

36
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,211
Notice as we go that not all improvements
involve expensive capital investment.

37
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,906
Changes in management and behavior
can also significantly reduce risks.

38
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:25,758
Also notice that different stakeholders
bear responsibility for controls

39
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:27,543
and monitoring at each step.

40
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:30,705
Here is a simple pit latrine
with manual emptying.

41
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:34,151
Although excreta
are contained in the latrine,

42
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:37,266
this unimproved system poses
a number of health risks.

43
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:43,307
Exposure groups include the users,
the workers who empty the containers,

44
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:45,046
and the surrounding community.

45
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:48,109
Children and the elderly
are especially vulnerable

46
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:51,827
from contact with soiled surfaces
in an unhygienic latrine.

47
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:55,517
These groups may be exposed
by a direct excreta contact

48
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:57,172
through the feet and hands,

49
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,803
and when excreta is inadvertently
transferred to the mouth

50
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:01,890
via dirty hands or flies.

51
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,511
The risks here are medium to high,
depending on the exposure group.

52
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:11,843
While the goal is a more hygienic
improved sanitation technology,

53
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:13,719
we can still reduce risks.

54
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:17,792
For example, controls
such as wearing shoes,

55
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:22,039
better cleaning of the latrine,
personal protective equipment for workers,

56
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,395
and using an emptying system
that reduces direct contact

57
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:28,584
will all incrementally improve the system.

58
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:33,049
Visual monitoring of these measures
by a community health worker

59
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,708
is a simple way to check and respond
if these controls are not in place.

60
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:45,217
This latrine with septic tank
is an improved technology

61
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:48,521
that poses less risk to users
than the previous situation.

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,570
Let's look at the emptying process.

63
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,190
Motorized emptying and transport
is much safer than manual emptying,

64
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,299
but there are still risks
that need to be managed.

65
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:01,637
A key exposure group is the workers.

66
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:05,810
Hazardous events are mostly related
to blockages and malfunctions

67
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,100
of the equipment.

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,558
For example, the operators
may be sprayed with sludge

69
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:12,982
and also contaminate the surrounding area.

70
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:15,522
These risks are typically high.

71
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,377
Here are some controls to protect workers:

72
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:23,850
providing appropriate equipment, working
according to standard operating procedures

73
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,167
and ensuring workers wear
personal protective equipment.

74
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,380
The organization responsible
for overseeing collection and transport

75
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,871
can set minimum standards like these

76
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:36,449
and make spot checks
to monitor if they are followed.

77
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:42,470
In this example, all of the fecal sludge
is delivered to the treatment plant,

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,171
but in poorly managed systems,
some may be diverted to dumping sites.

79
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:50,368
This can have serious health
and environmental impacts.

80
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:55,072
SSP should also identify dumping
as a hazardous event

81
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:57,195
and include controls and monitoring

82
00:04:57,195 --> 00:05:00,373
to manage these risks
posed to the wider community.

83
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:04,885
At the treatment step it is vital
that the treatment process operates well

84
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:08,096
so that effluent and bio-solids
meet agreed standards.

85
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:12,419
If not, users on farms
and consumers of the farm produce

86
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,744
will be exposed to an unacceptable risk.

87
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:20,392
The hazardous events may include
overloading of the plant, breakdowns,

88
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:22,764
the processing temperature and time,

89
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:25,134
and the presence of flies or mosquitoes,

90
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:28,778
or seasonal factors such as high rainfall
that may affect performance.

91
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,612
The risks and consequences
of these are high.

92
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,485
Example controls include
proper design and construction,

93
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:40,880
trained operators,
and a preventive maintenance program.

94
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:45,070
Monitoring may include periodic testing of effluent

95
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,111
and checks on delivery volumes.

96
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:52,281
But even the best treatment processes
will occasionally not meet standards.

97
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:57,005
In some cases, lower levels of treatment
may be unavoidable

98
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:59,909
with the existing technology,
or desired by farmers

99
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,350
who wish to access nutrients for reuse.

100
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,655
That's why barriers at the next reuse step
are particularly important.

101
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,217
During reuse, there are risks
to farmers using the bio-solids,

102
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:13,888
especially where intestinal
worm infections are prevalent.

103
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:17,204
Risks will depend on the performance

104
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:19,653
of the treatment plant
in the previous step,

105
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:22,265
and the way the bio-solids
are applied in the farm.

106
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:25,492
For example, manual
or mechanical application.

107
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:29,597
When produce is sold
to the general population for consumption,

108
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,983
many people are potentially at risk.

109
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:35,464
Pathogens can be recycled
back to the community at large

110
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:37,278
and lead to a disease outbreak.

111
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,311
This is costly in terms of public health.

112
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:44,323
It can also ruin the reputation
and operation of businesses

113
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:46,368
that reuse wastewater and sludge.

114
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:50,449
The type of crop grown
and the application method

115
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:52,476
affects the risk for consumers.

116
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:56,361
For example, crops eaten raw
have a much higher risk

117
00:06:56,361 --> 00:07:00,511
compared with crops which are cooked 
or processed before eating.

118
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:03,286
These risks are potentially high.

119
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,267
Controls that can be used include:

120
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:09,327
selection of crops not eaten raw,

121
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:12,579
setting a time between
the last application and harvesting

122
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:15,311
to allow pathogens to die off naturally,

123
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:18,589
and washing of produce
in clean water before sale.

124
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,267
Monitoring may include
checking crop types,

125
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,172
application and harvesting practice,

126
00:07:24,172 --> 00:07:27,097
as well as hygiene
during the packing and sale.

127
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:33,239
We have just followed
the modules in the SSP manual.

128
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:36,612
First, describing the sanitation system,

129
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:39,579
identifying hazardous events
and exposure risks,

130
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:42,321
developing and implementing
improvement plans,

131
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:45,507
monitoring controls
and verifying performance.

132
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:50,231
Coordination amongst stakeholders
is needed to implement all controls

133
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:52,484
and monitoring in a safely managed system.

134
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:55,817
That's why establishing
a team at the outset

135
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:58,368
with members representing
each step of the chain

136
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,329
is vital to prepare for SSP.

137
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,834
Coordination can be challenging,

138
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,117
but evidence shows
that safely managed systems

139
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:09,498
lead to far higher health gains
than improved sanitation alone.

140
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:13,169
Further, using
the multiple barrier approach

141
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,191
reduces dependence on capital 
intensive treatment technologies

142
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:18,618
as the main barrier.

143
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:21,604
Controls can be included at any step

144
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:24,622
and incrementally improved over time
as resources permit.

145
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,415
In summary, SSP is a risk-based tool

146
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:32,399
for safely managing
existing sanitation systems.

147
00:08:33,161 --> 00:08:35,435
SSP coordinates improvements in monitoring

148
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:37,557
by actors along the sanitation chain.

149
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:40,792
SSP does not rely on treatment only.

150
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:45,454
It uses multiple barriers, including
behaviors, management and technology

151
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:46,950
to prevent exposure.

152
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:50,977
The SSP manual that includes
more guidance and tips

153
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:54,300
is available in several languages
on the WHO website

154
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,211
along with other resources
to help users get started

155
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,731
and implement SSP.
