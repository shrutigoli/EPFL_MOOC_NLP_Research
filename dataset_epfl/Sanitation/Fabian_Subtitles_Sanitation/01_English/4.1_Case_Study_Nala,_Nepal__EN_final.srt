1
00:00:03,517 --> 00:00:08,640
Welcome to week four of our course
on sanitation planning and implementation.

2
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:11,634
This week, we will be taking a look

3
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:14,196
at three case studies
from around the world

4
00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:19,472
that have successfully
or unsuccessfully implemented

5
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:22,423
different sanitation solutions
for urban areas,

6
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,107
and tried to improve
environmental conditions.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,207
In this first case study, we will analyze
an example of a small town in Nepal.

8
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:36,170
The Nala case from Nepal is an example
of the CLUES planning approach

9
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:41,961
and subsequent implementation
conducted between 2009 and 2012.

10
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:45,077
We'll look at the sequence
of planning steps,

11
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:49,944
the main outcomes, and the costs involved
in turning the plan into reality.

12
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:53,923
The Nala case study
highlights the great advantages

13
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:56,558
of involving communities
from the start,

14
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,986
and the cost savings that can be achieved
through community engagement.

15
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:04,741
The case study of Nala in Nepal

16
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:08,889
is a typical case study
for a small town in Asia.

17
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:10,845
Nala is a small town near Katmandu

18
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:14,225
with a population
of about 2,300 inhabitants,

19
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:19,061
390 households, with an average
household size of 5.8 persons.

20
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,478
Why was Nala chosen?

21
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:23,588
Because of the strong demand
from the community

22
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:28,306
to improve sanitation conditions
in the area, and secondly,

23
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:31,775
because of the high
settlement density in Nala

24
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:35,097
that allowed to test
urban service provision

25
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:39,001
that goes beyond
individual onsite solutions

26
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:44,235
and to test sewered, connected
sanitation solutions like this one here,

27
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:46,307
with a simplified sewer
under construction.

28
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:49,422
Some of the socioeconomic data about Nala:

29
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:55,297
Nala is not very poor, but there is
a considerable minority Dalit population

30
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:57,084
of about 10% of the population

31
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:02,146
that lives just under
or about at the poverty level.

32
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:06,108
Health and hygiene
is also partly very poor,

33
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:11,735
with 66 households within Nala
that did not have access to toilets,

34
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:16,376
and that relied on open defecation
on the outskirts of the small town.

35
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:21,290
The main economic activities
in Nala is agriculture.

36
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,599
A lot of potato seedlings
for the entire country are grown here,

37
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,898
and Nala is also positioned
well near Katmandu Valley

38
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:35,769
with less than one hour drive
to Katmandu, the nation's capital.

39
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:38,067
The infrastructure conditions
were quite poor.

40
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:42,956
The majority of population
had pour flush toilets

41
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:46,297
that were connected to cesspits,
but because of the poor condition,

42
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:49,156
needed frequent emptying.

43
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:54,091
The storm water and gray water
in town was also poor,

44
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:58,485
emptying into temporary drains
and frequent flooding events.

45
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:01,972
Water supply in Nala
came from public tap stands

46
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:04,293
like the one shown here on the left,

47
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:07,151
or from private taps within households.

48
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,665
Common to all public and private taps

49
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:13,814
is the high microbial contamination
of all sources

50
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:17,708
due to the poor sanitation
found in Nala.

51
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:21,205
Solid waste: you could find
traditional composting practices

52
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:25,837
which combined kitchen waste
and animal waste at household level.

53
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:30,545
We'll now look at the planning steps
that were undertaken,

54
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:35,263
in CLUES planning in Nala
and how the six planning steps

55
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:38,758
led to the implementation
that was then chosen.

56
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:42,999
It all started with step one,
process ignition and demand creation,

57
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:46,648
in April 2009.
A series of workshops,

58
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:49,508
people were brought together
from the community

59
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:54,783
to inform them about
the CLUES planning approach

60
00:03:54,783 --> 00:04:00,342
and the proposed project
to improve sanitation,

61
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:04,079
environmental sanitation services
for the Nala community.

62
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:08,978
Closely linked to the ignition
was user empowerment

63
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:13,766
and the holding of several
key promotional events

64
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:16,186
like the sanitation bazaar
shown here,

65
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:19,262
where people were informed
about solutions,

66
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:21,713
about different technologies,

67
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:27,304
and about how at the individual levels
households could also improve

68
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:32,550
their individual sanitation
and water supply systems.

69
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,856
The sanitation exhibition shown here
was held on one day in November, 2009,

70
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:40,847
and brought together NGOs
from all over Nepal

71
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,866
who showcased some of their solutions
that they had come up with

72
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:47,330
in other parts of the country.

73
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,719
Step two was the launch
of the planning process.

74
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:53,412
This included household mapping,
a socioeconomic survey,

75
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:57,844
and a stakeholder assessment
of all the key actors in Nala.

76
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:03,310
In step three, a detailed assessment
of the current situation was carried out.

77
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,419
This included expert workshop
and the assessment of user preferences

78
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:10,784
that was conducted
in focus group discussions.

79
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:14,026
Important was that the detailed assessment

80
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:18,527
and the information that was found
during the assessment period

81
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,598
was also shared with the community.

82
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:23,176
An example is shown to the right:

83
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:28,579
the water quality for the different
public taps found in Nala

84
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:32,306
that were shared
with the population at large.

85
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:36,502
In addition, exposure visits
were carried out by the Nala committee.

86
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,397
Here was all about learning from others,

87
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:43,674
how had others solved some
of their environmental sanitation problems

88
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:47,097
but also exposing
the users committee from Nala

89
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,694
to management options
and other technology choices

90
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:54,022
that were made
in similar settings in Nepal.

91
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:57,799
Step four included the prioritization
of the community problems,

92
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,329
and the validation.

93
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:03,038
The factors considered here
were technical feasibility of solutions

94
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:05,450
and the socio-cultural acceptance,

95
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,817
making sure that the solutions
to be proposed in step five

96
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:13,800
really meet people's
and users' expectations.

97
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:18,817
During step five, the identification
of service options was done.

98
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:24,943
This included drawing up an action plan
for offsite sewered sanitation,

99
00:06:24,943 --> 00:06:28,206
shown in brown on the map to the right,

100
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:32,269
or onsite sanitation for VIP latrines.

101
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:37,728
The two areas were selected
due to physical conditions.

102
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:41,063
The green areas are areas that cannot

103
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:44,263
be easily connected
to the sewered network.

104
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:47,590
The following, the three options
that were discussed,

105
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,236
both with experts and with the community,
are quickly shown.

106
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:56,745
The first option was a fully onsite,
double VIP latrine option,

107
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:59,187
which included pour flush toilets

108
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:02,458
that are connected
to a double pit solution

109
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:06,459
and further transport and treatment
that are offsite.

110
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:11,879
The second solution included
urine diverting dry toilets.

111
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,821
The UDD toilets
are quite well know in Nepal

112
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:18,130
and have been tested
in other locations,

113
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:25,982
and of course, include an onsite treatment
to separate urine from feces.

114
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:32,767
Both of them which could then be used
in agricultural areas outside of town.

115
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:37,230
The third option and most complex option
is the simplified sewerage

116
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:42,161
connected to a DEWATS, Decentralized
Waste Water Treatment System.

117
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:46,735
This actually was the option
that was chosen by the community,

118
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:53,049
connecting existing pour flush toilets
connected to a collection,

119
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,191
then to transport
through simplified sewers,

120
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:04,099
treatment through DEWATS, and then
final reuse or disposal of the influent

121
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:06,247
to natural water bodies.

122
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,509
All three of these options were discussed

123
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:12,209
in the Environmental Sanitation
Improvement Plan for Nala,

124
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,691
which is shown here,

125
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:20,640
and the action plan was drawn up
and written by a local NGO, CIUD,

126
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:26,700
which also prioritized black water
and health and hygiene promotions

127
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:30,695
as the first step for improvement
of the urban environment in Nala.

128
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,936
Let's look at some of the CLUES outcomes

129
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:35,799
that have been implemented since.

130
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,982
Nala has built a new
offsite infrastructure system.

131
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:43,575
It is the first sewered
small town in Nepal

132
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:48,607
that features a simplified 
sewerage network for the entire town,

133
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,423
except for the few households
we had mentioned before.

134
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,217
352 households
are connected to the system,

135
00:08:55,217 --> 00:09:01,996
and each household pays a user fee,
which amounts to $1,300

136
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:04,346
that are collected annually in fees.

137
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:07,691
Out of this money, a caretaker
has been employed,

138
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:12,918
and he ensures a daily maintenance
of the entire system plus treatment plant.

139
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:17,294
The cost sharing arrangements
for the capital expenditures

140
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:23,342
was met by the local authority,
the UN-Habitat, Water Aid, and Eawag.

141
00:09:23,342 --> 00:09:26,222
Most of the capital costs
were paid by external donors

142
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:28,965
such as UN-Habitat or Water Aid.

143
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:32,349
There was, however, a significant
contribution by the Nala community,

144
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:36,624
contributing an estimated 37%
of the overall CAPEX

145
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:38,919
for sewers and the DEWATS plant.

146
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,670
All households connected
to the sewer system

147
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,525
were expected to pay
a connection fee of USD$80

148
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:51,500
and could apply for a micro-finance loan
with 6% interest yearly.

149
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,876
By 2014, all of the loans
have been repaid.

150
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,455
Great attention was also paid
to operation and maintenance,

151
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,183
and during the construction period,

152
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:06,272
an O&M workshop was conducted with the
Nala Water and Sanitation Users Committee.

153
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,330
Since 2013, a full time caretaker
has been employed

154
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,879
who ensures smooth running
of the sanitation services

155
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,523
and can troubleshoot
any problems in daily operations

156
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:23,306
of both the simplified sewer
and the plant.

157
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:25,250
After over one year of operation,

158
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,701
the simplified sewers
have only been blocked once

159
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:32,849
due to construction activities
whilst connecting a new household.

160
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:35,640
The infrastructure
that was put in place in Nala

161
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,128
includes a state-of-the-art
DEWATS treatment plant,

162
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:42,831
including 36 cubic meter settling tanks,

163
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,900
two ABReactors
with 105 cubic meter volume,

164
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:49,677
and shown in the left in the background,

165
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:52,984
two horizontal subsurface flow
constructed wetlands

166
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:56,877
with a surface area of 210 square meters.

167
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:58,851
This is during construction phase.

168
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:03,431
That is why the constructed wetlands
have not yet been planted.

169
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:10,663
The entire spatial footprint
of the plant is 350 square meters.

170
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:17,820
The overall treatment capacity
is designed for 32 meter cube per day.

171
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,729
The management arrangements were also
a key to the success of the Nala planning.

172
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:25,616
It involved three key actors:

173
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:29,348
most importantly
the WatSan Users Committee,

174
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:32,938
which is legally registered entity
that acts as the local operator

175
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:36,807
and ensures the long term
O&M of the system.

176
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:39,700
The Users Committee also collects
the annual maintenance fee

177
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,558
from each household.

178
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:47,806
Second, the formal LA, local authority,
called Village Development Committee,

179
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:50,540
or VDC in Nepal.

180
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,218
They were instrumental in ensuring
the land acquisition for the DEWATS plant.

181
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:59,500
Lastly, the supporting NGO, CIUD

182
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,224
which provided expertise
and coordination on the ground,

183
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,635
ensuring smooth planning
and implementation.

184
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:10,055
Let's take a look
at the capital expenditure

185
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:14,077
and operational expenditure
of the Nala case.

186
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:20,741
On the CAPEX side, we have costs
for the planning, the DEWATS plant,

187
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:25,178
the simplified sewerage,
and quite a hefty cost,

188
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:28,879
the land acquisition, at USD$31,000.

189
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,898
Together, these costs add up
to a per capita capital expenditure

190
00:12:34,898 --> 00:12:42,189
of USD$75 per capita
for both sewers and DEWATS plant,

191
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:48,785
and that is quite a good price ratio
for a complete system for a small town.

192
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:52,118
Important to note is also
the high cost contribution by the users,

193
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:57,789
which adds up to an estimated 37%
of all the costs mentioned above.

194
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:02,423
This was brought by in-kind
contributions in cash,

195
00:13:02,423 --> 00:13:05,313
or through labor contributions.

196
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:10,820
The estimated operational costs
are given at around USD$1,000 per year,

197
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,041
although this number is only
after one year of operation.

198
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:20,409
The timeline, the planning took
14 months in 2009 and 2010,

199
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:25,912
and the implementation,
12 months between 2011 and 2012.

200
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:31,401
Some of the conclusions and lessons
learned from the CLUES case study in Nala.

201
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:35,358
It pays to have a strong,
community based leadership

202
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:40,102
that is well rooted in the community
and can drive forward the process.

203
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:44,249
Secondly, the labor and cash
contributions by the community

204
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:47,928
contributed considerably
to lowering the costs

205
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:53,303
of the overall infrastructure and services
that were put in place.

206
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:57,959
Thirdly, the incremental improvements
that were brought to the system,

207
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:04,070
starting out with the black water system
put into place for Nala,

208
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,823
combined together
with hygiene promotion efforts.

209
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:15,095
Then fourthly, the informed choice
by key stakeholders in Nala,

210
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:23,883
ensuring that empowerment and ownership
of the new services and infrastructures

211
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:26,282
are guaranteed in the long run.

212
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,948
This was the first case study
presented in week four

213
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:34,384
on different case studies of urban
sanitation planning and implementation,

214
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:40,403
and gave an overview of the CLUES approach
between 2009 and 2012

215
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:41,939
in Nala, Nepal.
