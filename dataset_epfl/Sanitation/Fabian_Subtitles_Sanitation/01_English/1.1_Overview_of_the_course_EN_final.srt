00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,762
Welcome to the first week 
of our online course entitled

2
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:11,722
Planning and Design 
of Sanitation Systems and Technologies.

3
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:14,138
My name is Christoph LÃ¼thi from Eawag.

4
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:15,736
In the next five weeks,

5
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:21,352
we will be exploring some of the issues 
and challenges in urban sanitation.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,415
What makes urban sanitation so different
and more complex than rural contexts?

7
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:30,975
Let's take a look at our learning goals.

8
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:34,932
Firstly, we'd like you to get familiar
with urban sanitation assessment

9
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:36,606
and planning tools.

10
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:41,007
Secondly, different options 
of sanitation systems and technologies.

11
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,996
And lastly, understand 
which systems and technologies

12
00:00:44,996 --> 00:00:47,533
are most appropriate 
to different contexts.

13
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:52,183
We'll be looking 
at different systems and technologies,

14
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:55,937
the institutions and stakeholders
that need to be involved,

15
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:59,477
and we'll be presenting best practice
from around the world

16
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:04,941
featuring innovative and robust solutions
to inclusive urban sanitation.

17
00:01:05,823 --> 00:01:10,003
And finally, we're also 
going to be taking a closer look

18
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,513
at different planning 
and assessment frameworks,

19
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:16,981
and the design 
of different sanitation systems.

20
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:24,567
<i>What makes urban sanitation so different
and more complex than rural contexts?

21
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:33,651
<i>Firstly, the different urban contexts
or domains that need to be considered:

22
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:36,720
<i>from the modern inner-city planned areas,

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,962
<i>to the dense and unplanned 
informal settlements or slums

24
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:45,542
<i>found in most cities of Africa, 
Asia, and Latin America.

25
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:48,023
<i>And finally, 
the fast-growing city periphery,

26
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:51,446
<i>also called</i> the peri-urban interface.

27
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:54,253
<i>These different contexts 
and urban realities

28
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:56,516
<i>call for specific solutions

29
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:02,197
<i>when seeking appropriate and sustainable 
urban sanitation services.

30
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:07,486
<i>Let's take a look at a typical 
low-income area in an African city.

31
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:10,159
<i>Some of the challenges 
found in these neighborhoods

32
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,931
<i>include unsanitary environments,

33
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:17,177
<i>lack of space for sanitation facilities,
like the pit latrine shown here,

34
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:23,244
<i>and informal, unhygienic toilet emptying
or open defecation, as shown here.

35
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,492
<i>So what can be done about this situation?

36
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:31,110
<i>In this course, we will focus 
on a key concept of urban sanitation,

37
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,664
the sanitation value chain.

38
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:37,297
<i>We will highlight the different components
and functional groups,

39
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,454
<i>as in the example shown here.

40
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:44,199
<i>First, the user interface,
or pour-flush toilet shown here in red,

41
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,891
<i>the safe storage of the human waste,

42
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:49,194
<i>followed by the mechanical emptying 
of the sludge 

43
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:51,902
<i>by the exhauster trucks in yellow.

44
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,794
<i>The safely-collected fecal sludge

45
00:02:56,794 --> 00:02:59,345
<i>is then brought 
to a treatment site in green,

46
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,695
<i>in this case, a sludge-drying bed,

47
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:06,193
<i>and finally, the safe reuse 
in urban agriculture, shown in blue.

48
00:03:07,014 --> 00:03:10,162
<i>The value chain allows 
for a realistic assessment

49
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:13,801
<i>of a range of sanitation 
options and solutions,

50
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:18,238
<i>and its technical 
and managerial implications.

51
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:19,548
<i>Our five-week course 

52
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:22,920
<i>will be examining the issues
around the planning, design, 

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,635
<i>and implementation of inclusive, 
city-wide sanitation systems 

54
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:28,389
<i>and technologies.

55
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:32,214
<i>The sanitation value chain 
will be our guiding concept.

56
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:37,344
<i>Let's take a closer look at the syllabus.

57
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:42,387
<i>In week one, we're going to give you 
an overview of city sanitation,

58
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:45,712
<i>planning and programming,
the political economy,

59
00:03:45,712 --> 00:03:48,678
<i>and provide you 
with some assessment frameworks

60
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:52,905
<i>on how to better understand
the urban sanitation framework.

61
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,262
<i>In week two, we're going to introduce you 
to different sanitation products,

62
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:03,792
<i>and the five functional groups
starting off with user interface,

63
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:06,184
<i>the collection and transport.

64
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:11,049
<i>And in week three, 
the sanitation systems and technologies,

65
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,998
<i>especially for treatment, 
and use or disposal.

66
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:19,660
<i>In week four, we're going 
to look at different case studies

67
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,989
<i>that feature best practice 
from Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

68
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,574
<i>And finally, in week five,
we're going to be taking a look

69
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:32,486
<i>at urban sanitation planning
and assessment tools

70
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:34,269
<i>featuring some 
of the state-of-the-art tools

71
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:37,420
<i>of the World Bank and WHO.

72
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:40,716
<i>And finally, the final exam,

73
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:43,426
<i>where you will be able to evaluate
what you have learned

74
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,378
<i>in the past five weeks.

75
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:49,948
<i>Here we list some 
of the recommended references

76
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:53,138
<i>that you may want to download 
from our course site.

77
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:55,964
<i>These documents were produced
by the institutions involved

78
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:57,511
<i>in putting together this course:

79
00:04:57,511 --> 00:05:00,754
<i>Eawag, the International 
Water Association,

80
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:03,986
<i>the World Bank, 
and the World Health Organization.

81
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:07,435
On behalf of my team and fellow lecturers,

82
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:09,931
I'm looking forward to working with you

83
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:13,466
and hearing your contributions 
on the Coursera Forum.

84
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:15,394
Let's start the course now,

85
00:05:15,394 --> 00:05:18,484
with the first input 
by Jonathan Parkinson,

86
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,501
on Sanitation Planning.

87
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:21,505
Enjoy.
