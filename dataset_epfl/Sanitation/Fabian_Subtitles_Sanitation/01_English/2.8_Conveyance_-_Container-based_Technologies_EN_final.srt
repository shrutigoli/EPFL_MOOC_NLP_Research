00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:08,018
Hello, and welcome to this module
on conveyance technologies.

2
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:11,897
My name is Philippe Raymond. 
I'm an environmental engineer

3
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:14,829
working at Eawag SANDEC 
on sanitation planning

4
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:17,304
in international 
development projects.

5
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,723
I will be presenting 
the different conveyance

6
00:00:19,723 --> 00:00:21,849
and treatment technologies.

7
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:26,421
In the last modules, Lukas Ulrich 
introduced you to the user interface

8
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:29,085
and collection and 
storage technologies.

9
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:33,485
Now the question is: what 
happens when the pit is full?

10
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:37,158
How do we transport waste water 
or sludge out of a neighborhood?

11
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:40,166
Well, there are two 
categories of conveyance,

12
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,749
or transport systems.

13
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:44,056
On the one side, 
the sewered systems,

14
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,953
relying on pipe networks,
and on the other side,

15
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:51,277
the non-sewered systems, 
relying on different kinds

16
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:54,473
of container-based solutions, 
upon which we are focused

17
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:55,837
in this module.

18
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:59,177
The different sewer systems will
be presented in the next module.

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,513
We have three learning goals 
for this module.

20
00:01:02,877 --> 00:01:05,588
First, to get to know the
different ways to transport

21
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:07,125
sanitation products.

22
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,012
Secondly, to get 
an integrated view

23
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:14,649
of manual and motorized emptying. 
And finally, to understand

24
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:17,500
the pros and cons of the
different technologies.

25
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:19,318
Let's start.

26
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,303
We will take a look 
at different ways

27
00:01:21,303 --> 00:01:25,182
to transport sanitation products, 
focusing first on manual ways,

28
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:27,628
and then on motorized ways.

29
00:01:27,717 --> 00:01:31,340
Many development projects focus 
only on drinking water supply

30
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:33,574
or the provision of latrines.

31
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:37,630
However, in both cases, 
building new infrastructure

32
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,799
also implies new sanitation products,

33
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:42,832
which need to be transported 
and properly treated.

34
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:47,695
These products, which we call here 
"output products," can be,

35
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:51,362
for example, blackwater 
and greywater, sludge,

36
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,386
urine, dried feces, 
or pit humus,

37
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:58,581
according to the technologies 
that are implemented.

38
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:00,579
We will focus now 
on the transport

39
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,058
of products from on-site 
sanitation systems,

40
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:06,287
and more specifically, 
the conveyance of sludge,

41
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:09,803
or, if you prefer, 
fecal sludge, or septage.

42
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:13,714
When a pit is full, people have
the choice between two options:

43
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:17,581
either they let the pit overflow,
which is both a nuisance

44
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:19,530
and a health hazard 
for the neighborhood,

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,991
or they call manual or motorized
service providers to empty their pit.

46
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:27,663
The most efficient
and hygienic way

47
00:02:27,663 --> 00:02:30,003
in such a case is the use
of pumping trucks.

48
00:02:30,548 --> 00:02:33,751
However, in low-income 
contexts, the use of trucks

49
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,449
is often not possible.

50
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:39,465
The main reasons are either
that there is no access for trucks,

51
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:42,637
that the sludge
is too thick to be pumped,

52
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:46,359
or that the household cannot 
afford the often costly service.

53
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,386
Thus, people often resort 
to manual emptyings.

54
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:55,668
Unfortunately, most of the time, 
manual emptying looks like this.

55
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:59,189
Hard work in very unhygienic conditions,

56
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:01,713
provoking hostility from neighbors.

57
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:04,462
Manual emptiers face
very harsh conditions

58
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:08,356
and, at the same time, lack 
recognition for their work.

59
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:11,904
The situation can be improved 
with proper equipment

60
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:13,775
and technologies.

61
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:16,896
Human-powered emptying 
of pits, vaults, and tanks

62
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:20,507
can be done in two ways: either
with buckets and shovels

63
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:24,334
or using a portable, 
manually operated pump

64
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,733
specially designed for sludge, 
such as the Gulper,

65
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,169
the Rummer, or the MAPET.

66
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:34,097
Manual sludge pumps 
are relatively new inventions

67
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:35,964
and are still being optimized.

68
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:39,677
Sludge hand pumps -- 
here, the Gulper --

69
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,461
work on the same concept 
as water hand pumps.

70
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:47,342
Here's the operator, who 
pushes and pulls the handle.

71
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:52,043
The sludge is pumped up and 
discharged through the spout.

72
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:57,334
It can then be collected 
in barrels, bags, or carts,

73
00:03:57,334 --> 00:04:00,098
and removed in a quiet, 
hygienic way.

74
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:04,256
Next to that, it is important
also to ensure

75
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:09,333
that workers are adequately 
protected with gloves, boots,

76
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:12,752
face mask, and overall.

77
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:16,265
It is important to mention
that proper equipment

78
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:19,233
and organization help 
the manual emptiers

79
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,880
to gain recognition 
and acceptance.

80
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:25,274
Sanitation programs should 
strive to legitimize

81
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:28,097
the work of the laborers 
and create the right

82
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:31,885
enabling environment by 
providing permits and licenses,

83
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:34,945
as well as helping 
to legalize the practice.

84
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:38,105
Let's now look at 
motorized emptying.

85
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:42,795
Motorized emptying refers 
to vehicles equipped

86
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:45,339
with a motorized pump 
and a storage tank.

87
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:48,764
Namely, pumping trucks, 
or vacuum trucks.

88
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:52,581
Generally, the storage capacity 
of a vacuum truck

89
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:55,468
is between 3
and 12 cubic meters.

90
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:58,678
Pumping trucks come 
in all size and shapes,

91
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:00,709
as shown here in
these four pictures.

92
00:05:01,246 --> 00:05:05,135
They can be locally manufactured,
which ensures that maintenance skills

93
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:07,386
and spare parts are available.

94
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:10,467
A drawback, however, 
may be limited efficiency.

95
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:14,352
Smaller vehicles have also been 
developed to access areas

96
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:17,926
with narrow pathways, where 
normal trucks cannot access.

97
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:20,339
Let's look now at
the pros and the cons

98
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:22,369
of motorized and manual emptying.

99
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:24,885
The main advantages 
of motorized emptying

100
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:29,263
are that it is fast and efficient,
and it minimizes health risks.

101
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:34,167
However, it has high capital costs, 
as well as operation

102
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,584
and maintenance costs.

103
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:38,930
These costs are often 
passed on to the customer,

104
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:40,977
who sometimes cannot 
afford them.

105
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,101
Besides, the trucks cannot 
pump thick sludge,

106
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:49,706
garbage in pits may block the hose, 
and the pumps really only suck

107
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:51,691
to a depth of 2 to 3 metres.

108
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:56,173
Trucks may also have difficulties 
with spatial access, and spare parts

109
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,194
may not always be available.

110
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:01,252
The main advantages 
of manual emptying

111
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:03,352
are low operation 
maintenance costs,

112
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:05,801
the possibility 
to access every pit,

113
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:08,261
and the availability 
of maintenance skills

114
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:09,501
and spare parts.

115
00:06:10,264 --> 00:06:12,619
However, it has 
a limited efficiency

116
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:14,813
and is a time-consuming activity.

117
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:18,119
And it implies health hazards 
when not done properly.

118
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:21,273
As said before, 
it is tough work.

119
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:26,726
Besides, it requires a disposal 
pump nearby, within 500 meters.

120
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:31,528
In both cases, proper disposal 
of the sludge is a challenge.

121
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:34,673
Distance has a cost, 
but not only.

122
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:39,603
Traffic jams, police checkpoints, 
bad state of the roads

123
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:42,815
may add to the costs
and turn into hindrances

124
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:45,020
for such conveyance 
to treatment plants.

125
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:49,027
Emptying service providers 
aim to reduce distance and time

126
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:52,889
for each trip, save fuel, 
protect their truck,

127
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,251
and minimize the problems
with the population.

128
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:58,579
All these aspects need to be 
taken into account

129
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,821
when selecting options
and designing

130
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,655
a fecal sludge management scheme.

131
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,915
Distance is a critical issue.

132
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:08,786
If the distance from the collection
points to the treatment plant

133
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:13,054
is too long, there is a possibility 
of building transfer stations.

134
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,524
Transfer stations can be 
underground holding tanks

135
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,823
where manual emptiers or small
scale motorized service providers

136
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,403
bring their sludge.

137
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,293
The sludge is then further 
conveyed by vacuum trucks.

138
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:28,229
Another option is a sewer 
discharge station,

139
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:32,577
where sludge is directly discharged 
into an existing main sewer line.

140
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:36,130
In that case, it is important
to manage discharges

141
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,896
with care in order not 
to overload an existing

142
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:40,155
waste water treatment plant.

143
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:43,025
Transfer stations can be 
a useful interface

144
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:46,843
between informal settlements
where vacuum trucks cannot access,

145
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:49,469
and formal settlements, 
where municipal

146
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,544
or private motorized service 
providers are active.

147
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:56,298
They have to be carefully 
located and well maintained

148
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:59,995
to minimize odors and problems 
to nearby residents.

149
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:03,618
To sum up, we saw that container 
based conveyance is much more

150
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:07,447
a management and institutional 
issue than a technical problem.

151
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:11,319
It needs to be addressed when 
building any type of latrines

152
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,168
and collection 
and storage system.

153
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:17,333
Most cities in low-income 
countries rely mainly

154
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,363
on on-site sanitation systems.

155
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:22,759
Container-based conveyance 
is not an exception.

156
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,374
It is rather a norm.

157
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,819
So far, it remains mainly 
a private sector business,

158
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:32,354
in which, unfortunately, 
most sludge ends up

159
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:34,449
untreated in the environment.

160
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:38,908
Proper management schemes
and sustainable financial arrangements

161
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:42,634
need to be put in place
for the sludge to be treated,

162
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:46,434
for the service providers
to be recognized and legalized,

163
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:48,343
and to reduce the health hazards

164
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,774
both for the workers and for
the neighboring population.

165
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:56,702
Above all, we have to 
remember that conveyance

166
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,287
to proper disposal 
points has a cost.

167
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:03,144
The critical aspect 
is to estimate this cost

168
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:05,790
and see how it can be shared
between the different

169
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,581
sanitation stakeholders.

170
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,767
To learn more about 
fecal sludge management,

171
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:12,368
about manual and 
motorized emptying,

172
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:15,922
and how to plan a sustainable 
fecal sludge management scheme,

173
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:18,539
we strongly recommend 
the recently published

174
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,468
Eawag Sandec FSM book that 
you can download for free

175
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:24,182
at the link shown below.

176
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:27,244
In the next section, 
I will be presenting

177
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:29,684
the sewer based 
conveyance technologies.

178
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:32,051
See you then.
