00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,452
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:07,895
Last week, we learned a lot
about urban sanitation

3
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:10,790
both at the city-wide
and at the community level.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,380
This week, we'll provide a
systematic overview

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,536
of the sanitation value chain
and the relevant technologies

6
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:19,986
that are applicable to urban settings.

7
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,462
At the start of our second week,
we would like to highlight

8
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:27,237
a useful document that we will be using
during the next weeks:

9
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:31,038
The Compendium of Sanitation
Systems and Technologies.

10
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:35,285
This book was first published in 2008
and has just now been republished

11
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,078
in an updated second version.

12
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:41,418
It has gained popularity among
engineers and planners

13
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:46,226
because it structures the whole range
of urban, peri-urban and rural

14
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:49,584
sanitation technologies in low and
middle income countries

15
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:51,545
in one single document.

16
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:54,371
The Compendium is available 
both as hard copy,

17
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:58,722
and in an interactive, online version
called the eCompendium.

18
00:00:58,722 --> 00:01:02,504
The Compendium has since been
translated into several languages

19
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:07,610
shown here and can also be downloaded
from the website given here.

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,876
The Compendium is divided into two parts,
and is color-coded for easy reference.

21
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:17,113
The first part provides an overview
of nine basic sanitation systems,

22
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:20,248
ranging from the most simple,
the single pit system,

23
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:23,270
to the complex, sewerage system
with urine diversion.

24
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,292
The second part,
shown here on the right,

25
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:29,314
consists of 57 technology
information sheets

26
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:33,013
which describe tried and tested
sanitation technologies.

27
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:36,559
Each of these fact sheets explains
how a technology functions

28
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:39,029
and for which system it can be used.

29
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,383
Now there is also an online version of
The Compendium of Sanitation Systems.

30
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:45,986
It's called the eCompendium.

31
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:50,890
Compared to the print version,
it offers the user easy navigation

32
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,160
within the Compendium. For example,
on the system templates,

33
00:01:56,404 --> 00:02:00,848
you can choose the different technologies
that you'd like to look at.

34
00:02:00,848 --> 00:02:04,172
Given here by a gas reactor,
you simply click on that

35
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:06,851
and it takes you directly
to the technology.

36
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:14,464
There is also a filter function,
which facilitates the combination

37
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:19,846
of suitable technologies and
links to the SSWM tool box.

38
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:25,429
The eCompendium also allows you to study
the different technologies in detail

39
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,948
and is linked to the SSWM tool box
with a lot of additional information,

40
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:36,685
case studies, further reading, 
training material and videos

41
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,547
on the different technologies presented.

42
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:45,201
And finally, the eCompendium also offers
a complete glossary

43
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,833
of environmental sanitation terminology
that provide a short and precise

44
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:54,414
definition of all terms
covered in the Compendium.
