1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,170
In this module
we continue examine ways

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,130
to ensure the sanitation infrastructure

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,560
investments are used
to deliver actual services

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,590
and are sustainable.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,060
In it we look at tools
for assessing the strengths

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,390
and weaknesses

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,490
in the institutional,
regulatory,

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,620
budget and monitoring
sanitation service situation

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,230
at the city level.

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,440
This information
can be used to identify

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,600
and prioritize what exists
and can be improved,

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,120
and what needs to be
newly developed.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,490
Political economy analysis can help
in this process

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,530
by explaining why the situation

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,770
is as it is,

16
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,640
what drives or impedes progress

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,670
and how to find
win-win solutions.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,770
To deliver quality
sanitation services city-wide,

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,640
finance is used to provide
sanitation services for people.

20
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,250
Along the whole
sanitation service chain

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,680
this will include:

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,120
first of all, the development

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,730
of an enabling environment
at the city level,

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,600
and this is need to develop
the sanitation services,

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,930
and to sustain
the services over time

26
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,530
and throughout the city.

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,090
Each of these three pillars
has a number of building blocks,

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,900
and these include policy,

29
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,960
planning and budgets
for the enabling environment;

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,400
expenditure monitoring,
ensuring equity,

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,350
and monitoring outputs
for the developing services pillar;

32
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,980
and maintenance,
expansion of services

33
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,500
and ensuring actual user
outcomes are needed

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,040
for sustaining the services.

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,730
These pillars apply
across each part

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,270
of the sanitation service chain.

37
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,020
A policy, institutional
and regulatory situation

38
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,570
assessment can be undertaken
in many different ways.

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,600
One way is to use
a City Service

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,210
Delivery Assessment tool.

41
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,080
This is a participatory tool

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,350
that enables multiple stakeholders

43
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,060
to work together to identify

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,590
and build consensus

45
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,530
on where the major institutional

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,430
constraints are
for improved urban sanitation.

47
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,670
By answering together

48
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,690
a number of preset key questions

49
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,590
about each of the building blocks

50
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,960
and based on solid evidence,

51
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,980
a traffic light score can be assigned

52
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,790
across the whole sanitation chain

53
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,240
and for all aspects
of sanitation service delivery.

54
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,360
Such a graphic provides
a useful focal point

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,890
for multi stakeholder discussion

56
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,080
and consensus building

57
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,870
and it immediately
shows up strengths and weakness,

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,050
which can be used to develop
a priority intervention plan

59
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,220
that can then be implemented
alongside the development

60
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,350
of the sanitation
infrastructure itself.

61
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,110
But such an assessment
does not explain

62
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,300
why the current situation exists

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,660
or how to change it.

64
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,270
For that, we will look
in a moment,

65
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,340
to political economy analysis.

66
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,960
But before we do that,

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,600
here is an example
of a City Sanitation

68
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,620
Delivery Assessment
from Balikpapan in Indonesia,

69
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,800
which was conducted in 2014.

70
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,150
In the diagram we can see

71
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,140
that there was
no effective planning

72
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,710
of sanitation services

73
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,050
and consequently no budgets
were allocated.

74
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,260
And the reason for this was because
no institution had responsibility

75
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,500
for the entire
sanitation service chain,

76
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,620
although there was responsibility
for a sludge treatment works.

77
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,950
There were no government
sludge emptying services;

78
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,100
there was no regulation
of the private sector

79
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,780
and there was no output monitoring
of what existed.

80
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,160
Three private sector
vacuum truck operators

81
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,330
provided a reasonable
emptying service to the households

82
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,000
they could reach and those
who could afford to pay.

83
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,350
Given the density of housing
in the poorer areas,

84
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,670
and the consequent
difficulty of access,

85
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,480
often the tankers could not reach
the poorest households.

86
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,810
The private operators often dumped
the sludge indiscriminately or,

87
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,000
in one case,
dispose of it

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,850
on the operator’s private land,

89
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,810
much to the annoyance
of his neighbors.

90
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,220
Some of the results achieved
appear to be quite good,

91
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,800
but this was attributed
partly to the rather low demand

92
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,310
for sludge emptying services

93
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,440
and to the private sector’s ability

94
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,040
to meet most of the low demand.

95
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,230
However, around 25%

96
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,370
of the latrines
in the city

97
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,270
were found to overflow
directly into drains

98
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,880
and waterways,

99
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,350
and the sludge that
was collected by the trucks

100
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,700
was rarely taken
to the sludge treatment plant.

101
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,850
The postscript to this is

102
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,030
that since the Service
Delivery Assessment

103
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,880
was carried out in 2014,

104
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,770
the sanitation institutional roles

105
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,130
have been clarified

106
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,630
and regulations
have been developed;

107
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,230
the treatment plant
is now used by

108
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,010
all three private sector
emptying services;

109
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,190
and the local government
is piloting

110
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,090
a scheduled emptying service,

111
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,270
and the quality of the city’s
onsite sanitation services

112
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,000
are in the process
of being improved.

113
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,960
Political Economy
Analysis enable us

114
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,920
to look at the key interests

115
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,060
that may provide support to,

116
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,700
or be obstacles for,

117
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,420
certain choices and developments

118
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,750
in sustainable
sanitation service delivery.

119
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,330
Political Economy Analysis or PEA

120
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,660
can be used to enable
a city’s stakeholders

121
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,380
to identify the obstacles

122
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,710
and opportunities to providing
improved sanitation services

123
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,900
and to develop ways to overcome
the identified hurdles

124
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,990
and leverage opportunities.
Political Economy

125
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,230
Analysis first maps out
the institutions involved,

126
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,330
not only the formal sector,

127
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,180
which is government
or the larger private sector,

128
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,500
but also the informal institutions

129
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,570
such as manual pit
emptiers and artisans.

130
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,820
Following the mapping,
the Political Economy

131
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,470
Analysis looks at
how these institutions

132
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,340
and systems provide incentives.

133
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,280
Such as, influence, political power,

134
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,100
connections,
networks, money,

135
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,240
personal or family opportunities

136
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,610
to the different
stakeholders.

137
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,590
Which are the identified
individuals,

138
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,280
groups and organizations

139
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,390
involved in sanitation
service provision.

140
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,490
In turn, these incentives
exert influence

141
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,480
throughout the sanitation service chain

142
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,440
in both formal
and informal ways.

143
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,380
Formally though government
action and behavior.

144
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,820
And informally through contacts,

145
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,230
personal networks
and vested interests.

146
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,040
This Political Economy
Analysis structure

147
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,800
enables us
to answer questions

148
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,050
related to the existing

149
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,530
sanitation service chain in a city.

150
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,630
Questions such as:

151
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,980
Who decides?

152
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,490
Who benefits?

153
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,540
Can things change?

154
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,470
And by understanding
these questions,

155
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,980
stakeholders can begin to look

156
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,590
for commonalities
between interests,

157
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,600
and how the involved groups
and individuals could be mobilized

158
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,020
around these commonalities to improve

159
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,240
the sanitation services delivery.

160
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,550
Often you, and many
of the city stakeholders

161
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,460
will know how the formal
and informal systems

162
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,120
and institutions work,

163
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,430
or at least they will know
a good part of them.

164
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,820
By carrying out
a political economy

165
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,420
analysis around the agreed
priority issues,

166
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,920
those are the issues identified
previously in the city service

167
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,190
delivery assessment

168
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,540
or another approach,

169
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,480
the important tacit
knowledge of many

170
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,610
of these different
local stakeholders

171
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,540
can be captured and put
into a systematic form.

172
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,300
For example it can surface
and answer questions

173
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,540
such as who is
really responsible

174
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,570
for which aspects
of sanitation?

175
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,640
What is actually happening along
the sanitation service chain?

176
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,640
Are there gaps and are there
overlapping responsibilities?

177
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,250
All of this will help form
the basis of a dialogue

178
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,980
between the different stakeholders

179
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,610
to identify win-win
solutions and scenarios.

180
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,660
For example,

181
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,690
the need to negotiate
much clearer formal roles

182
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,460
and responsibilities,

183
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,950
or the identification

184
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,180
of a role for manual pit emptiers

185
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,100
once more hygienic
emptying services are put in place.

186
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,570
But this discussion
will only happen

187
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,640
if the Political Economy

188
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,030
Analysis is carefully researched

189
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,710
and articulated in a frank,

190
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,020
but appropriately sensitive, way.

191
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,100
Invariably Political Economy

192
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,470
Analysis reveals vested interests

193
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,440
and informal power structures

194
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
which can raise
very sensitive issues.

195
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,780
The term Prognosis for Change

196
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,170
may be a term that is useful

197
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,090
and is less controversial.

198
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,080
So, the Political Economy

199
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,490
Analysis or Prognosis for Change

200
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,340
should be an iterative process

201
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,240
which allows participants
to return to the issue

202
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,510
and discuss more options.

203
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,490
And when win-win solutions
are found these can be used for advocacy

204
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,830
with the key stakeholders.

205
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,790
So, to sum up:

206
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,630
Effective policy,
institutional,

207
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,850
budget and monitoring systems

208
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,910
are needed for improved
urban sanitation services.

209
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,510
An initial assessment
can be undertaken

210
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,760
in many different ways,

211
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,130
but participatory
tools can enable

212
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,450
multiple stakeholders
to work together

213
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,790
and build consensus
on priority actions.

214
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,300
Political Economy
Analysis helps us understand

215
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,960
why the situation
is the way it is,

216
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,570
and what interests are driving

217
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,230
and impeding progress,

218
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,850
and how to work with stakeholders

219
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,270
in order to identify
win-win outcomes.

220
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,120
Finally a key takeaway
from this module

221
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,530
is that all stakeholders

222
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,720
need to be part of
building consensus

223
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,650
about the policy,
institutional,

224
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,490
and regulatory arrangements

225
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,710
for poor inclusive city
wide sanitation services.

226
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,860
Including both formal
and informal aspects.

227
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,370
These will be the basis
of the accountability structure,

228
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,100
which is needed to ensure
sustainable sanitation services.
