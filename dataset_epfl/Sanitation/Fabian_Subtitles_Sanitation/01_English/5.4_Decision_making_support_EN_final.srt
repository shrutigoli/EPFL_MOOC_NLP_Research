Peter Hawkins, World Bank – Water
and Sanitation Program

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,130
Sanitation is often low on
the agenda of mayors,

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,430
utilities and other
related urban managers.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,110
By gathering credible information

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,140
and presenting it
in an easy-to-understand format,

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,800
it’s often possible
to demonstrate

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,550
to decision-makers the importance
of improving sanitation,

10
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,860
and to guide them
in defining priorities.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,340
In this module,
we’ll look briefly

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,930
at some useful ways
of presenting information

13
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,500
and how they have been
successfully applied in practice.

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,090
The fecal waste flow diagram,

15
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,850
or SFD, is a way of visualizing
how well, or how badly,

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,700
the various sanitation service chains

17
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,870
in a city are working.

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,020
The width of the arrows
represents the population

19
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,140
contributing to each waste flow,

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,280
and is thus a proxy
for the potential hazard

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,570
to public health
and environmental quality.

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,780
The green arrows represent safe
excreta management,

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,530
whilst the dark arrows
represent unsafe flows.

24
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,510
This type of diagram
has proven very successful

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,390
in communicating sanitation problems

26
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,990
to decision-makers,

27
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,320
including those who don’t have
a technical background.

28
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,620
This one was used in the context
of a major multi-donor

29
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,200
funded project to improve
sanitation in Lusaka,

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,910
the capital city of Zambia.

31
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,740
The project is based on a recently
produced sanitation master plan,

32
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,390
focused mainly on sewerage.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,020
The SFD was used as a tool
in the dialogue

34
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,490
between the utility and the donors

35
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,500
to define the content
of the project.

36
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,760
It clearly shows that two thirds
of the unmanaged fecal

37
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,190
waste originates from unsafe
manual pit emptying.

38
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,280
On the basis of the diagram
it was agreed

39
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,870
that the project should address
the upgrading of the latrines

40
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,350
which make up the great majority

41
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,340
of sanitation facilities
in the city,

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,420
to make them easier
to empty hygienically;

43
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,200
and the development
of effective and affordable

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,100
emptying services
to substitute widely-used,

45
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,080
unhygienic manual emptying.

46
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,890
Another example
of using the SFD

47
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,270
comes from Balikpapan in Indonesia.

48
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,910
This one was used
in a city-level sanitation planning

49
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,300
exercise led by the municipal
planning bureau.

50
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,280
It was projected
onto the wall in a meeting

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,800
with all the relevant
municipal departments

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,760
and used as a point of reference
to identify issues,

53
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,700
define actions and attribute

54
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,510
responsibilities
for resolving them.

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,580
The SFD shows that almost
half of the city’s toilets

56
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,250
do not contain fecal
material effectively,

57
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,990
and so it ends up
in the environment,

58
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,400
particularly in groundwater
and surface water.

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,970
Of the remaining amount
of fecal waste

60
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,360
that IS collected,

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,740
less than half arrives
at the treatment plant,

62
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,650
where treatment is
seriously inadequate.

63
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,480
On this basis,
the planning team

64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,540
identified that the main priorities

65
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,050
were to upgrade
inadequate toilets,

66
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,780
to improve emptying services,

67
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,940
and to improve fecal
sludge treatment.

68
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,970
Aggregating the data
to city level

69
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,730
can hide important differences.

70
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,240
In this example from Lima, Peru,

71
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,410
the water and sanitation
utility, SEDAPAL,

72
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,270
has a political mandate

73
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,880
to service informal settlements

74
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,510
not served by the water
or sewerage networks.

75
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,940
The city-level SFD shows
the vast majority served by sewerage,

76
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,640
and the main problems
are a degraded network

77
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,790
and poorly functioning
sewage treatment,

78
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,420
which result in significant
environmental pollution.

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,700
However, if we look
only at the 8%

80
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,640
of the population who live
in informal settlements,

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,560
a completely different
picture emerges.

82
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,370
As Lima is a huge city,

83
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,470
this 8% comprises
about a million people,

84
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,040
nearly all from the poorest
strata of society.

85
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,920
In these areas we see the need
for a major improvement

86
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,490
in the quality of the latrines

87
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,590
and other on-site facilities
used by these populations,

88
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,130
and for the introduction
of emptying services

89
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,910
for these improved latrines.

90
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,410
SEDAPAL is now working out

91
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,360
how it will deal
with these issues,

92
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,570
which were previously left
entirely to the informal sector

93
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,230
and funded by the meager
incomes of slum dwellers.

94
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,010
This underlines
the importance

95
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,630
of making sure we understand
the specific problems

96
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,840
of the poor and other marginalized
urban residents.

97
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,070
Returning to Lusaka,
we can see how the collection

98
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,500
and analysis of data disaggregated
to neighborhood or ward

99
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,150
level can help in prioritizing
sanitation interventions.

100
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,840
This was done on the basis
of an Urban Sanitation Status Index.

101
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,330
In the case of Lusaka
it was calculated

102
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,240
that a survey
of 1,500 households,

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,230
stratified by neighborhood,

104
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,540
provides statistically
significant results

105
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,420
on a neighborhood
by neighborhood level.

106
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,200
The index rates
the performance of each step

107
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,900
in the sanitation service chain
in each neighborhood.

108
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,210
In addition it includes
complementary services

109
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,900
such as drainage
and solid waste management,

110
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,770
which are intimately linked
with sanitation outcomes.

111
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,740
These subsets are aggregated
using an algorithm

112
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,470
based on expert opinions
of the relative importance

113
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,630
of pairs of factors
or indicators,

114
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,760
to calculate an overall
sanitation status index

115
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,240
by neighborhood,

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,920
ranging from zero
for very poor sanitation,

117
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,170
to one for very
good sanitation.

118
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,160
In this case, an extra
layer of information

119
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,840
on groundwater vulnerability

120
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,390
was added, as about half
of the city’s water

121
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,170
is abstracted from aquifers
beneath the city.

122
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,510
The overall results clearly
illustrate the high priority

123
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,240
for improving sanitation

124
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,660
in the south-west
quadrant of the city,

125
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,630
where the sanitation
index is lowest

126
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,870
and the groundwater
vulnerability highest.

127
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,870
The index also indicates
slightly lower priority areas

128
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,530
for intervention in
the north-east of the city.

129
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,210
This Urban Sanitation Status Index
has been used in defining

130
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,560
and sequencing areas for sanitation
improvements under the project.

131
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,150
Economic factors are of course

132
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,030
critical in decision-making
on sanitation services.

133
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,090
This example is taken
from the municipality

134
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,100
of eThekwini in South Africa,

135
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,780
which is made up of Durban
and its surrounding area.

136
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,330
It has a rapidly
growing population

137
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,050
of about 3½ million people,

138
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,990
distributed fairly evenly
between high income

139
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,320
and low income urbanized areas,

140
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,120
and a large rural fringe.

141
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,760
The municipal utility
was obliged

142
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,330
to meet the challenge
of the constitutionally-defined

143
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,880
right to a free minimum
basic level of water

144
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,410
and sanitation services.

145
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,000
Sewerage is the most
cost-effective solution

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,040
in higher density areas,

147
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,720
and is provided where
there is formal land tenure,

148
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,620
and therefore
a stable urban layout.

149
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,540
This corresponds
to the “waterborne edge” in the map,

150
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,510
and covers the main
built-up area

151
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,260
and a few satellite settlements.

152
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,510
In dense, unplanned areas
with informal housing,

153
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,490
temporary facilities in the form
of communal toilet blocks,

154
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,840
maintained by the utility,

155
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,530
are provided until such time
as the areas are upgraded.

156
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,250
In low-income,
low density areas

157
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,010
without on-plot water supplies,

158
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,270
the utility provides
on-site facilities

159
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,730
which it empties every
five years free of charge.

160
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,980
Customers requiring
any extra emptying pay

161
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,520
for it at a commercial rate.

162
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,930
VIP latrines were initially
provided in these areas,

163
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,960
but due to high solid
waste inputs it

164
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,780
was found that manual emptying
was the only feasible method.

165
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,170
The utility has therefore
switched to using urine

166
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,900
diverting dry toilets,

167
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,700
which, although they are
more expensive to build,

168
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,090
produce almost pathogen-free compost,

169
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,640
which can be emptied
by the utility more cheaply

170
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,210
than the sludge from VIP latrines,
which has a higher volume

171
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,620
and always contains
fresh fecal material.

172
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
Political buy-in
from decision-makers

173
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,540
is critical for sanitation planning,

174
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,630
implementation and service provision,

175
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,580
and the preceding examples

176
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,720
show some of the ways
they can be influenced.

177
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,490
However, it is very
important to ensure

178
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,810
that there are proven
and scalable sanitation

179
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,860
intervention mechanisms in place,

180
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,770
to spend the funds
that are released

181
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,590
when sanitation is prioritized
by decision-makers.

182
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,840
If such mechanisms are lacking,

183
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,020
funds may be spent
on ineffective interventions,

184
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,580
results will be poor,

185
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,630
and it will become harder
to mobilize support

186
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,060
for improving sanitation.

187
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,010
This was an explicit consideration

188
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,430
in the sanitation sector
development program in Indonesia

189
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,640
led by mid-level officials
from the National Planning Bureau

190
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,710
and supported by WSP,

191
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,910
which we looked at earlier
in this course.

192
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,310
Initial work focused on
developing a data collection

193
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,110
and planning system
in selected cities

194
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,860
that was effectively aligned
with institutional mandates

195
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,240
and government budgeting
and planning procedures.

196
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,680
As a viable city-level planning

197
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,800
and implementation model emerged,
advocacy

198
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,170
with higher level
decision-makers was ramped up.

199
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,160
As a result, new funding
windows were created,

200
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,940
and the Public Works Ministry
realigned itself around

201
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,600
an inclusive city-level
sanitation agenda,

202
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,750
which the upstream work
had made feasible.

203
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,280
This has created
a virtuous cycle

204
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,930
whereby local and national government

205
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,690
investment in sanitation

206
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,420
has risen over a decade

207
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,480
from almost zero to the order
of billions of dollars.

208
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,940
To sum up then:
We need local data

209
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,240
and we have good tools available

210
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,300
to collect and present this;

211
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,680
we also need to look a bit
behind those tools

212
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,060
and to consider
the economic aspects;

213
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,110
and last but not least
we need to address

214
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,600
the needs of politicians
who make the decisions.
