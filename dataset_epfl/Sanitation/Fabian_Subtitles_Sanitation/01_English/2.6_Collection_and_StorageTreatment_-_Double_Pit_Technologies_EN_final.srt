1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:06,612
In the second module, 
Collection and Storage

2
00:00:06,612 --> 00:00:09,086
we will look at four
different technologies

3
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:11,522
which are based on 
double pits or double vaults.

4
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:13,778
I will explain why it can make sense

5
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:16,978
to install two pits
and use them alternatingly

6
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:19,593
and in which situations
those four technologies

7
00:00:19,593 --> 00:00:20,965
are most appropriate.

8
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:22,547
Like everything in life

9
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:25,803
these technologies also have
their advantages and disadvantages.

10
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:28,788
You will learn about them
in the next few minutes.

11
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:32,575
Let's start with something
that we are familiar with already:

12
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:36,056
the ventilated improved pit or VIP.

13
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:39,304
What you can see here
is basically the same

14
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:41,926
as the single VIP we already know,

15
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:44,548
just with the second pit
added next to it.

16
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:50,614
That's why we call this
technology the double VIP.

17
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:53,761
It's use is very similar
to the single VIP

18
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:57,384
but when one pit is full, 
it is not immediately emptied.

19
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,159
Rather, the full pit is closed

20
00:01:00,332 --> 00:01:03,746
and the superstructure
moved to the other one.

21
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,840
While the second pit fills

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,502
the content of the first one

23
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:13,012
is allowed to rest, drain
and naturally decompose

24
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:14,982
until both pits are full.

25
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:19,010
Only then, the first pit is
emptied and used again.

26
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:23,309
This cycle can go on indefinitely.

27
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:25,436
Each pit should be designed

28
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:28,467
to accommodate the excreta
of one to two years.

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,609
During that time, the material
in the resting pit

30
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:34,508
becomes partially sanitized
and humus like.

31
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:37,153
We therefore call it pit humus.

32
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,373
The humus is a solid product

33
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:41,115
which cannot be pumped

34
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:43,931
and needs to be excavated 
manually using a shovel.

35
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:47,068
The side walls of the pits

36
00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:49,893
can have openings
for better infiltration.

37
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,415
But the middle separating wall 
should be waterproofed

38
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,648
to avoid re-wetting
of the resting material.

39
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:03,387
Instead of being moved
from one pit to the other

40
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:06,659
the superstucture may also
extend over both pits

41
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:09,084
as the one shown in this photo.

42
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:11,700
In this example from Mauritania

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,910
the superstructure is relatively big

44
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,653
because there is also
a bathing place in the middle

45
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:20,119
which is connected to a separate
soak pit for the greywater.

46
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:24,787
The picture below shows two 
access covers for emptying.

47
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:27,495
An advantage of the double VIP

48
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:31,620
is that the pits are permanent
and designed for constant operation.

49
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:33,515
With proper maintenance

50
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:36,672
double pits can have
an indefinite service life.

51
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:40,166
Emptying is easier and safer
than fecal sludge

52
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,757
because the resulting pit humus is solid

53
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:44,096
much less offensive

54
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:47,782
and has a significantly
reduced pathogen content.

55
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:50,478
The product may even be used to improve

56
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:54,702
the water and nutrient retaining
properties of agricultural soils.

57
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,629
As in VIPs, the contamination
of groundwater resources

58
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:01,170
is still possible with this technology,

59
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,180
and double VIPS are not suitable

60
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,460
for rocky ground or areas
that are prone to flooding.

61
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:09,240
Because of the product being solid

62
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,347
manual emptying is required.

63
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,945
This can be done by the users themselves

64
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:15,952
which reduces the operating costs

65
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:19,667
and does not require accessibility
by vacuum trucks.

66
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:23,824
However, the upfront investment
costs for double pits

67
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,559
are obviously higher
than for single pits.

68
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,523
The so called Fossa Alterna
is very similar to the double VIP.

69
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:35,593
Compared to the double VIP, however,

70
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:37,138
which is basically just designed

71
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:40,648
to collect, store
and partially treat excreta

72
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:42,948
the Fossa Alterna is actually designed

73
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:45,954
to make higher quality earth-like product

74
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:49,094
that can be used as a
valuable soil conditioner.

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,462
This is achieved by adding
soil, ash, or leaves

76
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:56,273
as cover material after each defecation

77
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:58,689
which absorbs the liquids inside the pit

78
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:02,478
and increases the pore space
allowing for aerobic conditions.

79
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:05,775
The cover material also reduces smells

80
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:09,027
and introduces a variety 
of microoganisms

81
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,739
which help in the degradation process.

82
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:15,970
The pits are dug to a maximum
depth of 1.5 meters,

83
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:20,304
and therefore, often do not require
a lining on the entire side walls

84
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:24,363
allowing for soil organisms 
to enter and do their job.

85
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,128
Like in the double VIP,
the full pit degrades

86
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:31,128
while the second pit is filling

87
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:34,148
which ideally should take one year.

88
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:38,054
Because of the added carbon-rich
bulking material,

89
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,703
the degradation process is accelerated

90
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,597
and the content is ready for excavation
and use

91
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,858
much faster than in a double VIP.

92
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:48,763
Greywater should not be added

93
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:51,202
because it fills the pore spaces

94
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,846
and deprives the aerobic bacteria

95
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:57,281
of the oxygen that is required
for degradation.

96
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,943
The advantages and disadvantages
of the Fossa Alterna

97
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:05,303
are slightly different to
the ones of the double VIP.

98
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:08,696
Emptying is still done
manually using a shovel

99
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:11,847
but may be even easier
because of the cover material

100
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:15,870
which give the humus a less
compact, more aerated form.

101
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,872
Important to note
is that soil, ash or leaves

102
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,752
should be constantly available

103
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:26,705
to generate the desired
nutrient-rich, compost like product.

104
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,770
Separate solid waste
and greywater management

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,146
are crucial to enjoy
a high quality product.

106
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:37,287
Twin pits for pour flush, 
sometimes called double leach pits

107
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:40,051
are designed to receive
blackwater as input

108
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:42,062
and possibly also greywater.

109
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,062
As you can see on the drawing,

110
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:47,108
the pour flush toilet
is used as user interface

111
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:49,867
and connected to one
of the pits by a pipe.

112
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:53,315
The other pit is properly sealed

113
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:56,007
for example, using cement and bricks.

114
00:05:56,721 --> 00:06:01,081
Alternatively, it is also possible
to use a single straight pipe

115
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:04,702
fixed with light mortar
and covered with earth.

116
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:07,129
The blackwater is collected in the pit

117
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:11,122
and allowed to slowly
infiltrate into the surrounding soil.

118
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,395
As liquid leaches from the pit

119
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:16,664
and migrates through
the unsaturated soil matrix

120
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:20,471
pathogenic germs are absorbed
onto the soil surface.

121
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:25,680
In this way, pathogens can be removed
prior to contact with groundwater.

122
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,183
Like in the previous technologies,

123
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:30,821
when the pit becomes full, it is closed,

124
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:33,258
and allowed to rest before being emptied.

125
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:36,566
As this is a water-based wet technology

126
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:39,684
the full pits require
a longer retention time

127
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:42,859
of two years to degrade the material.

128
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:46,607
Over time, the content is sufficiently
dewatered

129
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,347
and can be safely excavated

130
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:50,040
in the form of pit humus,

131
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,214
again, manually, with a shovel.

132
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:55,381
It is recommended that 
the twin pits be constructed

133
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:57,472
one meter apart from each other

134
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,511
to minimize cross-contamination

135
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:02,551
between the material pit 
and the one in use.

136
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:06,242
Water within a pit 
can impact its stability.

137
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:11,296
Therefore, the full depth of the pit walls
should be lined to prevent collapse.

138
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,816
As you can see
in the drawining on the right

139
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:17,892
numerous openings in the pit lining
facilitate the leaching.

140
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,952
Twin pits also have a few specific
advantages and disadvantages.

141
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,022
Compared to the previous options

142
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:30,266
flies and odors are further reduced
due to the use of the pour flush latrine.

143
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:33,012
Because this is a water-based technology

144
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:36,602
the soil must have
a good infiltration capacity.

145
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:41,078
Clay, tightly packed, or 
rocky soils are not appropriate.

146
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:45,837
This technology is not suitable
for areas with a high groundwater table

147
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:48,381
or where there is frequent flooding.

148
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:50,934
There is a risk of groundwater pollution

149
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:55,417
when pits are located in areas 
with a high or variable water table.

150
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:59,207
As a rule of thumb, it can be recommended

151
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:01,291
to have a minimum horizontal distance

152
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,371
of 30 meters between
the pits and the water source

153
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:08,864
to limit exposing the water source
to microbial contamination.

154
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:13,541
Dehydration vaults are watertight 
alternating chambers

155
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,897
that are usually built above the ground

156
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:19,404
to collect, store and dry feces.

157
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:23,685
One chamber is in use while
the other one dehydrates.

158
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:28,735
When feces are not mixed with urine
and other liquids, they dry quickly.

159
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,787
In the absence of moisture

160
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:32,404
organisms cannot grow

161
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:34,477
pathogens are destroyed

162
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:36,563
and smells minimized.

163
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:42,272
This technology requires the use
of the UDDT as a user interface.

164
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:46,385
Urine is diverted,
flows through a hose or pipe,

165
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:48,909
and is collected in a storage tank.

166
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:53,496
What enters the dehydration
vaults is only feces

167
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:56,243
and possibly dry cleansing materials.

168
00:08:56,576 --> 00:09:00,562
To prevent flies, minimize odors
and encourage a drying

169
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:06,936
a small amount of ash, lime, dry soil 
or sawdust should be used

170
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:09,509
to cover feces after each use.

171
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:13,525
Ash and lime additionally raise the pH

172
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:16,056
which causes pathogens to die off.

173
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:21,818
A vent pipe is required to 
remove humidity from the walls

174
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:24,517
and control flies and odors.

175
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:27,740
The World Health Organization recommends

176
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,071
a minimum storage
time of six months

177
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:33,420
if ash or lime are used
as cover material.

178
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,999
Otherwise, the storage
should be one to two years

179
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:39,262
depending on the climate.

180
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:42,856
Each vault is therefore sized
to accommodate at least

181
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:45,283
six months of feces accumulation.

182
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,551
After the recommended storage time

183
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,557
the pathogens are significantly reduced

184
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,067
and it is easy and safe

185
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:57,107
to remove the dried material
from the chamber using a shovel.

186
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:01,359
The dehydrated feces
can then be used as soil conditioner

187
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:04,004
and the vault put back into service.

188
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,748
As long as no liquids entered the chambers

189
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:12,204
this technology should be
a confortable and odor-free solution.

190
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:16,679
It is therefore possible to build
dehydration vaults attached to the house

191
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:18,942
as it can be seen in this photo

192
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:20,937
or even integrated into the house

193
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:23,106
as shown in this drawing.

194
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:27,497
Dehydration vaults
are especially appropriate

195
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:29,927
for water scarce and rocky areas

196
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:32,700
or where the ground water table is high.

197
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,585
They are also suitable in areas
that are frequently flooded

198
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:39,240
because they are built to be watertight.

199
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:43,295
Dehydration vaults can be
a clean and easy to use technology.

200
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:47,322
It is crucial however,
that the users are well trained

201
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:51,716
to understand how the technology works
and appreciate its benefits.

202
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,672
In this module, we looked
at four technologies

203
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:58,481
which all have in common
that they use storage

204
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:01,989
and naturally occurring dewatering
and degradation processes

205
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:06,809
to produce a material that is safer
and more easy to handle than fecal sludge.

206
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:11,384
The products from these technologies
can even be used as soil conditioners.

207
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,779
Due to the material being solid

208
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:17,544
it is not possible to mechanically
empty it using a pump.

209
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:19,994
It needs to be dug out manually.

210
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:23,579
This may be seen as a disadvantage
but also as an advantage

211
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:27,141
especially in areas where 
mechanical emptying is expensive

212
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:30,176
or impossible due to difficult access.

213
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,796
All the double pit technologies shown

214
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:36,654
are permanent and can be
constantly used if well maintained.

215
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:41,525
Therefore, they are particularly suited 
to peri-urban or urban areas

216
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:45,139
where it is not possible to dig
a new pit when the old one is full.

217
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,500
On the other hand, the potential risk
to groundwater sources due to leaching

218
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:54,028
limits the applicability of these
double pit technologies in urban areas.

219
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,453
In the next module
we are going to look

220
00:11:56,453 --> 00:11:59,781
at anaerobic technologies
for collection and storage.
