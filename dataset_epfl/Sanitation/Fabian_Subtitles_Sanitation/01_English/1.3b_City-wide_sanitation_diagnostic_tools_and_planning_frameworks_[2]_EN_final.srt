1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,740
Welcome to the second of
the two modules

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,000
on Citywide Sanitation Services

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,190
and Introduction to Diagnostic
Tools and Frameworks.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,680
This module will
continue the introduction

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,130
to some systematic ways
to understand

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,470
and analyze
the complex urban environments we face

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,150
when planning improvements
in sanitation services.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,070
In this module, we'll look
at how tools such

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,310
as the Fecal Waste Flow Diagram

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,900
and the City Service
Delivery Assessment

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,500
can help us to analyze
and understand technical

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,240
and non-technical challenges

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,000
related to sanitation service delivery,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,290
and we will look
at urban sanitation

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,680
as a service

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,360
and the roles of government

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,680
and the private sector
in delivering it.

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,040
When looking at
the sanitation challenges

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,520
of a specific city,

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,920
the Fecal Waste Flow Diagram

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,930
or "SFD"

22
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,410
as it is commonly
referred to,

23
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,220
is an effective way to illustrate
the fecal flows in the city

24
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,660
and to highlight areas
of the sanitation service chain

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,660
which need attention.

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,310
You will be learning
more about the development

27
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,810
and use of SFDs in later modules.

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,590
Here is the SFD

29
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,360
for a typical
low-income city in Africa

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,790
and it highlights
the need to improve

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,950
the operational effectiveness
of the sewerage system,

32
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,360
to improve the fecal
sludge management services,

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,380
and provide household
sanitation options

34
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,470
for rental housing and marginal
challenging environments.

35
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,700
To achieve the SDGs,
sanitation services

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,230
need to include everyone.

37
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,680
Data disaggregated by wealth
quintiles shows that

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,650
it's the poorest households

39
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,540
which have the worst access
to sanitation services.

40
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,720
Global analysis has
identified four key

41
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,000
aspects of sanitation services

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,520
which need much more attention

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,510
if sanitation services
are to reach everyone.

44
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,910
One, making better
use of existing

45
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,440
and future investments in sewerage.

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,270
This includes ensuring connections
to existing sewers,

47
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,090
making sewerage accessible in difficult

48
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,720
to reach and poor communities,

49
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,870
and having approaches
for facilitating

50
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,690
the connection of poor
customers to sewers.

51
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,870
Two, fecal sludge management

52
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,330
to make on-site
sanitation hygienic

53
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,350
and viable.

54
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,640
Three, services
for rental housing

55
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,540
and informal settlements,

56
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,570
including the use of shared toilets

57
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,100
and the challenges of limited space

58
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,640
of multi-story residences

59
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,050
and of illegal or informal settlements

60
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,150
and the implications of situations

61
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,010
where households don't have tenure
on where they rent.

62
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,670
And four, marginal areas

63
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,470
and challenging environments.

64
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,210
Sanitation is further complicated

65
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,810
where communities are located

66
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,670
in difficult terrain

67
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,540
such as where there are swamps,
high groundwater,

68
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,690
housing over water bodies
such as rivers, lakes,

69
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,180
or the sea, rocky terrain,

70
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,400
steep hillsides,
cold climates, etc.

71
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,760
New tools are available

72
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,120
which enable a systematic assessment

73
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,840
of the non-technical
aspects required

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,480
in an urban sanitation
service chain.

75
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,590
The city service
delivery assessment

76
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,700
allows the visual presentation

77
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,740
to decision makers
of a scorecard

78
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,970
that encapsulates
the underlying policy,

79
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,600
planning,
and budget context,

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,100
how expenditure, equity,

81
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,030
and outputs are monitored,

82
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,860
and the quality of operation
and maintenance, etc.

83
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,580
This analysis enables
decision makers

84
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,980
to prioritize

85
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,340
which institutional
and service delivery issues

86
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,790
need immediate attention.

87
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,260
The prognosis for change tool

88
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,030
enables a more detailed

89
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,860
analysis of incentives

90
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,250
and influences

91
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,580
and enables decision makers

92
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,930
to seek win-win outcomes
on specific issues.

93
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,010
The tool seeks to assess three things:

94
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,600
How key formal and informal
institutions function,

95
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,970
what incentives those institutions
provide to stakeholders,

96
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,920
and the formal
or informal power

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,510
those stakeholders
have to exert influence.

98
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,010
It also considers
the implications

99
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,450
of the findings

100
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,320
for effective engagement
with the problem

101
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,540
by those wanting to improve
the situation

102
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,950
and aims to make interventions
more likely to succeed by

103
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,710
ensuring they are taking the underlying

104
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,030
political economy
of the city into account.

105
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,040
Here we list some examples

106
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,890
of the type of non-technical issues

107
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,850
that typically need
to be tackled in developing

108
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,230
an effective
inclusive sanitation program

109
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,390
at scale in a city.

110
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,980
Different services need to be

111
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,050
provided along
the sanitation chain

112
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,310
and these vary in nature and in scale,

113
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,700
from material supply
to small-scale construction

114
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,710
and operating public toilets

115
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,800
at the household end
of the spectrum

116
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,060
through desludging,

117
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,860
fecal waste transportation and sewage

118
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,620
and sludge treatment
and disposal to maintenance

119
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,370
and management of drainage

120
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,030
and solid waste services

121
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,770
at the other end of the spectrum.

122
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,190
These services can be
grouped as customer services,

123
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,130
directly interfacing
with households or customers,

124
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,440
public services,

125
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,440
and infrastructure development

126
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,350
which is a necessary,

127
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,660
but not a sufficient
enabling input

128
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,010
for the service providers

129
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,390
who operate and maintain
the infrastructure.

130
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,970
And these services
can be broadly seen

131
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,840
as being private goods

132
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
benefitting individual households

133
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,120
or groups of households,

134
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,610
although they mostly also
have a public benefit,

135
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,880
and public goods
which do not benefit

136
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,690
only a single household
or individual,

137
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,700
but rather benefit the public
or the city at large.

138
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,910
These distinctions
have important implications

139
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,040
for how financing, subsidies,

140
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,070
and regulation are
organized and practiced.

141
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,010
Users have traditionally
been left to pay

142
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,040
for private goods themselves,

143
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,590
but because of their
public good element it

144
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,400
may be appropriate
to provide partial

145
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,770
or in specific circumstances

146
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,650
even total public funding

147
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,300
for these services

148
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,070
where users are unable
to pay the full cost.

149
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,660
Similarly, public goods
may be provided

150
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,770
by the private sector
if costs can be recovered,

151
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,140
for example,

152
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,800
from land developers

153
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,090
or from the sale
of treated wastes

154
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,480
or under an agreement

155
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,560
with a public sector institution.

156
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,160
But in all cases, the full
sanitation services chain

157
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,580
needs to be regulated
by the public sector

158
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,320
so as to safeguard standards.

159
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,230
We will now consider the roles

160
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,370
for the public and private sector.

161
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,840
As we saw in the last slide,

162
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,760
there are three main categories

163
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,620
of goods and services:

164
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,670
Customer services,
public services,

165
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,590
and infrastructure developments.

166
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,830
Customer services
are often best provided

167
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,860
by the private sector

168
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,000
as this usually creates
stronger accountability

169
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,200
but may also be provided
by the public sector.

170
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,690
At the other end
of the spectrum,

171
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,910
finance for major public
sanitation infrastructure

172
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,030
will usually be cheaper
from public sector sources,

173
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,710
but the involvement
of private sector partners

174
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,690
is gaining popularity

175
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,920
as it may accelerate improvements

176
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,080
and promote cost effectiveness.

177
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,690
In between these
extremes, the provision

178
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,290
of public services
offers wide scope

179
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,980
for public-private partnerships
of various types.

180
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,370
For these services to provide
sustainable sanitation

181
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,030
for everyone, local government

182
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,220
typically plays a key role

183
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,520
in providing planning

184
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,700
and coordination,
local regulation

185
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,570
and bylaws, appropriate
tariff structures,

186
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,780
local standards,

187
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,720
enforcement of land use,

188
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,860
support to get
the local service providers up

189
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,040
and running which may not otherwise
happen by itself,

190
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,280
housing, tenure,
and land use policy,

191
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,470
and the promotion of services,

192
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,260
behavior change programs,
and monitoring.

193
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,200
The role of national government

194
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,000
is to provide a conducive

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,140
and supportive environment

196
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,330
which includes appropriate
policy frameworks with laws,

197
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,620
national standards and regulation

198
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,840
to support them, planning structures

199
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,560
and monitoring systems,

200
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,640
finance windows and mechanisms

201
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,790
for infrastructure developments,

202
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,470
and national capacity
building initiatives.

203
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,290
To summarize,

204
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,470
in this module
we have seen that tools

205
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,980
such as the Fecal
Waste Flow Diagram

206
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,580
and the City Service
Delivery Assessment

207
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,770
can help us analyze
the multiple complex technical

208
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,520
and non-technical factors

209
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,700
involved in urban sanitation

210
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,060
and how to prioritize them,

211
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,540
and urban sanitation
is about services

212
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,830
which are developed
and implemented by both public

213
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,800
and private sector entities.

214
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,410
Later in the course
we will return to look again

215
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,940
at aspects of the urban
sanitation service chain

216
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,570
from both the municipal

217
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,300
and the national perspective.
