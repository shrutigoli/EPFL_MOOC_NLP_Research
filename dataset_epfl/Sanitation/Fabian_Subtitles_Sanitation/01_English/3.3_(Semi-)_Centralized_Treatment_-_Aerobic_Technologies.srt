1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,236
Hello, and welcome
to the third module about treatment.

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,498
In the last module

3
00:00:09,498 --> 00:00:12,799
we looked at the different
anaerobic treatment technologies.

4
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:16,966
Now we will look
at the aerobic technologies,

5
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:19,489
which can be used
as stand-alone systems

6
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:22,570
or to polish the effluent
of anaerobic units.

7
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:27,578
Aerobic systems are biological systems
which rely on the action of bacteria

8
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:30,473
needing oxygen to live, like us.

9
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:35,234
Thus, in all of them
oxygen provision is a key aspect.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,473
Without sufficient oxygen,
the environment becomes anaerobic,

11
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,588
which leads to processes
such as described in the last module.

12
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:47,927
Some aerobic technologies
try to imitate nature,

13
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:51,665
such as the "waste stabilization ponds",
or the "constructed wetlands".

14
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:54,364
Some of these are more engineered,

15
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:58,351
such as the "trickling filter"
or the "activated sludge".

16
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:02,970
Let's start with the waste
deposition ponds, or lagoons.

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,270
It is a system that consists
in a succession of ponds

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,349
with different functions.

19
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:14,138
First one anaerobic pond,
then one or two facultative ponds,

20
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:16,952
and finally, one or two
maturation ponds.

21
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:20,141
Let's look in more detail
at the differences

22
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:21,924
between these three types of ponds.

23
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:27,076
The anaerobic pond is the deepest,
with a depth of two to five meters,

24
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:28,660
and also the smallest.

25
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,654
It is highly loaded
because it receives the rawest water.

26
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:36,755
The anaerobic pond has a hydraulic
retention time from one to three days,

27
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:39,518
and its main function is sedimentation

28
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:43,887
and anaerobic stabilization
of sludge, thus, settling.

29
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:47,666
The facultative pond or facultative ponds

30
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:50,671
if they are several, are shallower.

31
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,282
Usually, less than 1.5 meters,

32
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,569
but large.

33
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:58,687
The idea here is to maximize
the oxygen supply

34
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:02,334
either through algae,
wind, or artificial aeration.

35
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,077
The hydraulic retention time there

36
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:06,519
is longer: from ten to twenty days.

37
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:09,878
Here, the main function
is the aerobic degradation

38
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:12,612
of suspended and dissolved matter,

39
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,813
thus, degradation.

40
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:18,732
Finally, the maturation ponds
are even shallower,

41
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,697
usually less than one meter, but large.

42
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:25,550
The hydraulic retention time
is about ten days.

43
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:29,730
Here the main function is the
final sedimentation of suspended solids,

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,721
the bacterial mass,
and pathogens, thus polishing.

45
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:40,221
Waste stabilization ponds
can treat high strength wastewater

46
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:42,172
to a high quality effluent.

47
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:45,741
They are generally reliable
and good functioning

48
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:49,110
and inexpensive, compared
to either centralized options.

49
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:54,599
However, they require a lot of space
and may generate bad odors,

50
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,130
especially the anaerobic pond,
if poorly designed.

51
00:02:58,147 --> 00:03:01,369
It requires expert design and supervision,

52
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:03,971
especially to avoid short-circuiting,

53
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,885
in which case, the effluent

54
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,895
goes from the inlet to the outlet
without mixing properly,

55
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:13,207
that is, not staying through
the intended retention time.

56
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:17,314
Besides, if they work
at best in warm climates,

57
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:20,218
waste stabilization ponds
are not always appropriate

58
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:22,787
for colder climates.

59
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:26,236
This picture shows large
waste stabilization ponds

60
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:28,928
for the city of Cuenca, in Ecuador.

61
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,782
A way to increase the 
performance of waste stabilization ponds

62
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:35,443
is to provide artificial aeration,

63
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:37,428
which is done 
in Cuenca in the first pond,

64
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:39,252
upstream of this picture.

65
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,576
It is also a good way
to upgrade the ponds

66
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:43,552
when then reach design capacity,

67
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:46,338
especially extension,
is not always easy.

68
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:50,656
In aerated ponds,
mechanical aerators provide oxygen

69
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,163
and keep the aerobic organisms suspended

70
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:55,834
to achieve a high rate
of organic degradation.

71
00:03:56,602 --> 00:04:01,401
Increased mixing and aeration
means that the ponds can be deeper

72
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:04,581
and tolerate much higher organic loads
than the maturation pond.

73
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:08,008
The depth may be
from two to five meters

74
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:10,912
and a retention time
from three to twenty days.

75
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:14,879
In some cases,
it can even replace the anaerobic pond,

76
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,630
thus avoiding the bad odors
that anaerobic ponds may generate.

77
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,070
The downside of it is that aeration
implies a high energy consumption,

78
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,123
and thus costs, and requires
a constant source of electricity.

79
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,530
Interruption of electricity service
may cause the pond to turn anaerobic,

80
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,759
thus changing completely
the inner biological processes.

81
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:40,557
We will now have a look
at another family

82
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:43,496
of treatment technologies:
the "constructed wetlands".

83
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:48,121
"Constructed wetlands" aim to replicate
the naturally occurring processes

84
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,864
of a natural wetland, marsh or swamp.

85
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:53,781
We distinguish three types:

86
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:56,420
the "free water surface
constructed wetland",

87
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,289
the "horizontal subsurface flow
constructed wetland",

88
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:03,105
and the "vertical flow
constructed wetland".

89
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,583
Let's start with the "free water surface
constructed wetland".

90
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:11,555
In that case, the water
slowly flows through the wetland,

91
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:16,015
particles settle,
and pathogens are eliminated

92
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:20,772
through the combined action
of sun, settling, adsorption,

93
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:23,023
and predation from higher organisms.

94
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:26,618
The organisms and plants
utilize the nutrients.

95
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,672
This style of constructed wetland

96
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:31,384
is commonly used as a polishing step

97
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:34,517
after secondary
or tertiary treatment processes.

98
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,353
It is only appropriate
for low strength wastewater.

99
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:41,219
This is a really important fact.

100
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:47,406
The depth of the water 
is ten to 45 cm above ground level.

101
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:51,919
Wastewater needs to be
well distributed at the inlet.

102
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:55,917
Good operation and maintenance is needed

103
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:59,470
for it not to turn
into a mosquito breeding area,

104
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,735
and to avoid short-circuiting.

105
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:06,095
Let's look now at the "horizontal
subsurface flow constructed wetland".

106
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:09,688
Its performance
regarding reduction of BOD,

107
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:11,911
suspended solids, and pathogens

108
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:14,952
is higher than in the freewater
surface constructed wetlands,

109
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:17,320
and it does not have
the mosquito problem

110
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,682
as the water flows
only under the surface,

111
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,044
as its name indicates.

112
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:24,407
As in the previous technology,

113
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:29,025
the good distribution of the influent
at the inlet is very important.

114
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:33,898
The gravel bed is between
50 cm and one meter deep.

115
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:41,353
The water level is maintained
at 5 to 15 cm below the surface.

116
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,820
As wastewater flows
horizontally through the basin,

117
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,835
the filter material
filters out particles.

118
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:55,579
It acts both as a filter
and as a fixed surface

119
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:59,760
upon which bacteria can attach,
forming large biofilms.

120
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:02,711
The plant roots play an important role

121
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:06,199
in maintaining permeability in the filter.

122
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,988
It is very important to have
a good primary treatment

123
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,858
before the wetland.

124
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:15,608
Otherwise, the risk of clogging
will be very high.

125
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:19,736
Expert follow-up is necessary
to monitor the plants,

126
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:21,689
especially the startup periods.

127
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:26,623
As a final remark,
we have to mention

128
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:30,275
that the wetlands need a lot of space,

129
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:33,927
generally a surface of about five to ten
square meters per person equivalent.

130
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:38,114
This picture illustrates
the last type of constructed wetland,

131
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:40,920
the "vertical flow constructed wetland",

132
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,863
which is, of course, difficult
to differentiate from outside.

133
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:49,203
This is the most sophisticated
and performance type of wetland

134
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,626
By injecting the wastewater
from above the whole surface,

135
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:55,004
the distribution is greatly improved.

136
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,615
The water flows down
and is collected by a drainage system.

137
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:05,205
The important difference
between vertical and horizontal wetlands

138
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:08,253
is not simply the direction
of the flow path,

139
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,265
but rather, the aerobic conditions.

140
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:13,957
The wastewater
is applied intermittently,

141
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:16,717
four to ten times a day.

142
00:08:16,717 --> 00:08:22,539
Thus, the filter goes through stages
of being saturated and unsaturated,

143
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:27,322
and accordingly, different phases
of aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

144
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:30,286
With this regime,
there is less plugging risk

145
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:32,770
than in horizontal
subsurface flow wetland.

146
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,398
Other than that,

147
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:38,494
the treatment processes are the same
as in the horizontal flow wetland.

148
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:41,793
Because of the mechanical dosing system,

149
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:46,390
this technology is most appropriate
where trained maintenance staff,

150
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,551
constant power supply,
and spare parts are available.

151
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:54,354
Constructed wetlands
can reach a good performance

152
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:57,000
with processes close to nature.

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,616
However, one has to
be aware of the risk of clogging

154
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:02,460
and the management of the plants,

155
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,079
especially the startup and maintenance,

156
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:07,556
and beware high ammonia levels

157
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:10,322
which may prevent the plants
from growing properly.

158
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:14,940
In all cases, a good
primary treatment is crucial.

159
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,953
Before finishing this module,

160
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:20,845
we will look at two
higher end technologies

161
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:23,232
which we may call <i>Conventional</i>:

162
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:26,083
the "trickling filter",
and the "activated sludge".

163
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,350
These systems are really performant in developed countries,

164
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,488
but imply high capital costs,

165
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,186
operation and maintenance
by skilled personnel,

166
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:37,037
and a constant source of energy.

167
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:42,091
The "trickling filter"
is a fixed bed biological reactor

168
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:45,476
that operates mostly
under aerobic conditions.

169
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:50,502
After primary treatment,
wastewater is continuously trickled

170
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:55,837
or sprayed through the filter,
for example, through a rotating sprinkler.

171
00:09:57,117 --> 00:10:01,295
Organics are degraded by
the biofilm covering the filter material.

172
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,894
The filter is usually
from one to 2.5 meter high,

173
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:09,514
but some filters may reach
a height up to 12 meters.

174
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:13,592
Adequate airflow is important 
to ensure sufficient treatment performance

175
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,125
and prevent odors.

176
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,654
The air can circulate
vertically through the filter.

177
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:23,614
The advantage of a trickling filter
over the technologies presented before

178
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:25,976
is the small land requirement;

179
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:30,512
however, flies and odors
are often problematic.

180
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,005
The "activated sludge system"

181
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:37,104
is the best known and
most widespread in Western countries

182
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:41,128
under different forms,
such as sequencing batch reactor,

183
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:45,727
oxidation ditches, moving beds,
or membrane bioreactors.

184
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,785
It makes use of
highly concentrated micro-organisms

185
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:51,927
to degrade organics
and remove nutrients,

186
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:54,275
leading to a high quality effluent.

187
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,449
To maintain aerobic conditions

188
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,045
and to keep the activated
sludge suspended,

189
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:02,889
a continuous and well-timed
supply of oxygen is required.

190
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:07,874
Aeration and mixing can be provided
by pumping air or oxygen into the tank

191
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:09,761
or by surface aerators.

192
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:13,327
Agglomerations
of sludge particles called <i>flux

193
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:17,682
form in the aerated tank
and are removed in a settler

194
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:20,816
called in that case "<i>secondary clarifier"</i>.

195
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:24,250
We are now at the end of this module

196
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,219
on aerobic treatment technologies.

197
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:28,894
We saw very different technologies

198
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:30,688
that can all perform well,

199
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:32,226
but have different requirements.

200
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,930
To sum up, we can say
that the main decision factors are:

201
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:41,540
the availability of space,
financial resources,

202
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,460
skills, and electricity.

203
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,604
We now reviewed all the technologies
for wastewater treatments

204
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:49,685
present in the <i>Compendium</i>.

205
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:54,396
However, as you observed,
all these technologies produce sludge.

206
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,638
Besides, onsite systems
such as <i>pit septic tanks

207
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:00,668
also produce tons of sludge.

208
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,143
How to treat sludge?

209
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:04,941
That's what we'll see
in the next module.

210
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:06,717
See you then.
