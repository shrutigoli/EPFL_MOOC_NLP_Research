00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
City-wide sanitation diagnostic tools
and planning frameworks â€“ Part 1

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,990
Welcome to the first of two modules
on City-wide Sanitation Services:

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,620
an Introduction to Diagnostic
Tools and Frameworks.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,120
My name is Sanyu Lutalo,

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,860
and I'm a Senior Water
and Sanitation Specialist

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,710
with the World Bank Group
based in Washington D.C.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,310
In this module and the following module,

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,830
we will introduce some
systematic ways to understand

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,890
and analyze the complex
urban environments

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,100
we often face

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,780
when planning improvements
in sanitation services.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,980
These two modules will
introduce a number of issues

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,060
related to sanitation planning,

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,560
which we will explore more
deeply later in the course.

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,550
For sanitation services
to be appropriate,

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,650
affordable, and sustainable,

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,170
we need to consider more

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,980
than just the type
of technology to be selected.

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,050
In this module, we will explore
some of these aspects,

20
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,760
and we'll do so based
on the principles

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,290
of the sustainable
development goals,

22
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,060
or SDGs framework while
looking at two broad aspects:

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,720
urban sanitation services
and public health

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,270
and the need to consider
integrated urban services.

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,590
You may already be familiar

26
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,900
with the sanitation services chain

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,880
comprising waste containment,

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,810
emptying, conveyance, treatment,

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,920
and end-use or disposal.

30
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,510
In practice, there are two
major types of chain,

31
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,920
which we can refer
to as: networked,

32
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,390
basically comprising sewerage systems

33
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,860
with treatment plants,

34
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,880
and non-networked, comprising

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,800
on-site sanitation options

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,750
with fecal sludge management.

37
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,200
The millennium
development goals, or MDGs,

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,530
included targets to reduce
the proportion of people

39
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,590
without access
to an adequate toilet.

40
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,950
In other words, they focused
on the containment part

41
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,150
of the sanitation
service chain.

42
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,120
The sustainable
development goals,

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,160
or SDGs, however,

44
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,660
set targets for universal access

45
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,920
and monitor

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,980
the whole sanitation chain

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,360
including conveyance, treatment,

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,500
and reuse or disposal.

49
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,830
We will now look at how
the sanitation service chain,

50
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,060
when it is not working effectively,

51
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,730
can contaminate the household toilet

52
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,350
and the residential
and/or urban environment,

53
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,760
including local groundwater,

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,430
posing a range of public health hazards.

55
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,910
The sanitation chain

56
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,710
is represented
vertically on the left,

57
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,370
and the hazard pathways
can be summarized

58
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,710
as follows.

59
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,640
A dirty toilet is a threat
to its users.

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,070
A leaking tank,
or pit, or a drain,

61
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,600
or a sewer can pollute ground water.

62
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,720
Unsafe emptying of a tank or a pit

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,810
is a risk to the emptiers,

64
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,250
to the household,

65
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,380
and to the neighborhood.

66
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,060
Contaminated drainage structures

67
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,510
and leaking sewers

68
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,610
add to the hazard
of fecal contamination.

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,770
And non-existent
or poor treatment

70
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,930
and/or inappropriate end-use

71
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,110
and disposal of sewage, septage,

72
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,610
and sludge results
in a contaminated environment,

73
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,380
in contaminated produce,

74
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,770
and in contaminated water bodies.

75
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,330
In such a contaminated
environment,

76
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,990
hazard becomes risk

77
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,470
when people do not practice
good hygiene, for example,

78
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,590
by washing their hands with soap.

79
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,940
This is all exacerbated

80
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,400
by poor solid
waste management,

81
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,350
which allows garbage
to further interfere

82
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,370
with the proper functioning
of sanitation services,

83
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,470
and by uncontrolled land use,

84
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,790
which makes planning

85
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,270
and enforcement
of the sanitation service chain

86
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,600
even more challenging.

87
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,540
And finally, when it rains,

88
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,940
blocked drains, pits,

89
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,550
and sewers overflow,

90
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,560
and the wider environment
is fecally contaminated.

91
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,390
By analyzing
the contamination routes

92
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,920
in this way,

93
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,560
we see where

94
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,770
and why sanitation
interventions are needed.

95
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,670
For example,
continuous monitoring

96
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,140
and maintenance of the sewerage system,

97
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,250
behavior change communication,

98
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,780
and improved fecal sludge management

99
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,330
may all be essential elements

100
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,690
in a particular city.

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,180
In the last slide,
we saw the challenges

102
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,850
that need to be addressed,

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,630
whereas now we will
look at the services

104
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,630
which can address
these challenges.

105
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,600
There are five components
to urban sanitation services.

106
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,680
As you can see in the slide,
latrines, septic tanks,

107
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,950
and sewers are accompanied
by solid waste

108
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,970
and storm water management,

109
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,840
as the latter two services
are inseparable from the proper

110
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,520
functioning of the fecal waste chain

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,440
in a given town or city.

112
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,070
Both sides of this diagram,

113
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,680
the upstream services on the left,

114
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,810
which typically interface
with the households

115
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,760
and other customer groups,

116
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,800
and the downstream services,

117
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,670
including treatment, disposal,

118
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,440
and reuse on the right
are impacted by the quality

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,850
and enforcement of physical planning

120
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,660
and of land use control.

121
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,730
At the household level,
housing tenure,

122
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,570
and urban upgrading programs

123
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,980
can also play an important part

124
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,550
in advancing
urban sanitation services.

125
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,960
Likewise, treatment
and appropriate reuse

126
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,060
and disposal also contribute

127
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,790
to reducing
the public health risk

128
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,990
and to improving
the ecological environmental

129
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,470
endowment of a city

130
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,170
while increasing
quality of life

131
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,080
and city attractiveness
and competitiveness.

132
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,300
But poor management
of these interrelated

133
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,390
components often leads

134
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,910
to the creation of a highly contaminated

135
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,040
mixed waste stream
in the drainage system.

136
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,150
And when it rains,
it just gets worse

137
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,100
as flooding spreads
this contamination far

138
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,970
and wide across the city.

139
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,700
To summarize,
in this module,

140
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,600
we have seen that sanitation

141
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,640
is about a chain of services

142
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,230
which will protect public health

143
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,230
and the environment
from fecal contamination

144
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,240
and that there needs
to be integration

145
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,640
between the management
of solid waste, drainage,

146
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,440
onsite and network
sanitation services.

147
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,710
In the next module,

148
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,660
you will learn about tools
that can help us

149
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,960
analyze the multiple complex

150
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,920
technical and nontechnical factors

151
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,980
involved in urban sanitation

152
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,840
and how to prioritize them,

153
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,480
and how urban sanitation
is about services

154
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,910
which are developed
and implemented by both public

155
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,200
and private sector entities.
