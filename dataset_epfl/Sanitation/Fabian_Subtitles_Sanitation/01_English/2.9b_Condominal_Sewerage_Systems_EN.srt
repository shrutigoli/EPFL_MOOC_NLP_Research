00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,010
Welcome to this module
of the MOOC on condominial sewers

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,760
and the approach employed in their
design and implementation.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,250
My name is Klaus Neder.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,000
I am an engineer
at CAESB,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,960
the Water and Sanitation Utility

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,490
of the Federal District
in Brasília, Brazil,

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,180
where I have led CAESB’s efforts

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,910
to roll out condominial sewers

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,190
and appropriate wastewater treatment

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,100
to the whole of
the Federal District

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,690
region over the past
twenty years.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,550
Nowadays serving
about 1.5 million people,

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,430
the metropolitan area of Brasilia

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,830
is one of the most
extensive examples

17
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,730
of the use of the condominial sewers
in the world.

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,000
In this module,
you will learn,

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,810
what are condominial sewers

20
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,060
and how do they differ
from conventional sewer systems.

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,810
What are the advantages
of condominial sewers

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,550
over conventional sewers

23
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,190
and in which circumstances

24
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,470
are they particularly beneficial.

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,940
What are the implications
of condominial sewers

26
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,490
for a utility company?

27
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,230
Prior to adopting the condominal
sewerage approach in Brasilia,

28
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,610
CAESB found that conventional sewers

29
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,150
were being built but,

30
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,090
households would not
connect to them.

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,350
It was quite common that less

32
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,110
than 50 percent of the neighborhood

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,150
was effectively connecting
to the new sewer systems.

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,460
Consequently,
the large amounts of funds

35
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,120
invested in the trunk
sewer infrastructure

36
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,420
and in the wastewater
treatment plants

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,560
would not realize
their expected public health

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,610
and environmental benefits.

39
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,070
Some of the major factors
for this failure were,

40
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,360
a lack of dialogue
between the utility

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,290
and the households regarding
the sewerage solutions

42
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,840
to be designed
and installed.

43
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,900
The high capital costs
of conventional sewers

44
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,300
that utilities,

45
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,540
and by extension
their customers,

46
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,590
had to cover.

47
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,330
We found that the major reason

48
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,100
that caused users not to connect
to sewers included,

49
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,480
a lack of funds
in the household to allow them

50
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,920
to make the piped
connection to the sewers.

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,110
No adequate
internal toilet/plumbing

52
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,450
installations in the household.

53
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,250
The local topography,
including situations

54
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,630
where internal installations

55
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,050
are located lower
than the sewer lines.

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,270
An existing solution,
such as septic tanks,

57
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,640
already in use.

58
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,050
Where connecting would require

59
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,260
the breaking of floors and walls

60
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,730
or where the wastewater
was already connected

61
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,250
to some kind of drainage
requiring its separation.

62
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,340
Soon we realized
that conventional approaches

63
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,360
to implement sewers
are generally rigid

64
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,660
and not flexible
or adaptable enough

65
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,810
to take into account
the specific requirements

66
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,630
of the target population

67
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,510
and of the local situation,

68
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,940
such as those mentioned.

69
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,170
As a result, it is often difficult

70
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,100
to roll out
conventional sewerage systems

71
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,970
to which households
actually connect,

72
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,940
especially in informal,

73
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,840
densely populated,
unplanned settlements.

74
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,010
When CAESB first introduced
condominial sewers in Brasilia,

75
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,440
we adopted an approach

76
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,550
in which we did not
expect the client

77
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,860
to come after the sewerage project

78
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,320
but, instead,

79
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,050
through which we would
actively pursue the client.

80
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,560
In fact, following
the condominial philosophy,

81
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,650
we start our work
and our analysis

82
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,600
from the upstream source of the sewage,

83
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,490
this means at the household,

84
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,550
with a focus on each
individual household connection,

85
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,440
and then follow a downstream path
through the trunk sewers

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,080
to the wastewater treatment plant.

87
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,370
Such an approach is
in the marked contrast

88
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,530
to conventional
sewerage projects

89
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,370
in which the household connection

90
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,170
is the last concern
or sometimes

91
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,690
is not a concern at all.

92
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,960
Providing adequate, effective,

93
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,700
and affordable connection
to the sewer network

94
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,980
is thus a main objective
of condominial sewer.

95
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,770
The following slide will show
the key characteristics

96
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,620
of the condominial model,
which has been developed

97
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,210
and refined in Brazil, generally,

98
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,660
and in Brasília with CAESB,
in particular,

99
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,920
over a number of decades.

100
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,970
The Condominial approach features
several key characteristics

101
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,700
that distinguishes it
from the implementation

102
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,050
of conventional sewerage interventions.

103
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,880
One key difference
is the participatory approach adopted

104
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,740
during the design and implementation

105
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,610
of condominial sewers
and, sometimes,

106
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,060
during their operation
and maintenance as well.

107
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,320
Households are mobilized

108
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,780
even before engineering designs

109
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,150
are commenced

110
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,120
and are fully encouraged
to engage in the design

111
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,890
and the works phases

112
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,230
of the implementation
of the local sewers.

113
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,710
The community is a major decision

114
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,540
maker regarding the design

115
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,840
and implementation
of the sewer system,

116
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,360
and becomes the owner
of the ‘condominial branch’,

117
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,790
which will be described
more fully later.

118
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,950
An important factor
of condominial sewers

119
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,510
is the reduction in capital costs

120
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,880
that can be achieved
when compared to conventional sewers

121
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,010
through the optimization
of the condominal network

122
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,020
in regards to branch routing,

123
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,120
pipe extension,
pipe depths, pipe diameter,

124
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,220
and the optimized use
of inspection boxes.

125
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,090
One outcome of this optimization

126
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,570
is that condominial sewerage

127
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,090
networks can typically be

128
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,560
50 percent of the length
of conventional ones.

129
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,600
The condominial approach
to implementing sewers provides us

130
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,890
with the tools to depart
from conventional thinking

131
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,160
on the design
principles of sewers.

132
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,860
It thus allows us
to design sewer system

133
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,440
that can be successfully
implemented in densely

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,850
populated, unplanned,

135
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,980
informal areas, such as in slums.

136
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,880
One of the guiding principles
of the condominial approach

137
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,570
is to achieve 100 percent
connection rate of households,

138
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,610
whether they are located
in rapidly expanding poor

139
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,080
informal settlements
or in middle class

140
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,580
or rich areas of the city.

141
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,090
Technical details
for the implementation

142
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,860
and maintenance agreement
of the condominial branch

143
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,430
are the result of a discussion

144
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,490
and a joint decision
of the utility

145
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,970
and the targeted community,

146
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,730
and result after consideration

147
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,840
of all viable solutions.

148
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,860
Households are not forced
into certain solutions,

149
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,990
but the technical
and other alternatives

150
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,210
are discussed with them

151
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,140
so that an agreed
optimal position is reached.

152
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,770
In many cases, however,
the local topography

153
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,760
and the elevation of existing household

154
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,580
sanitary installations

155
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,200
are the determining factors

156
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,810
for locating the household

157
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,910
connection and for routing
the condominial branch.

158
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,490
The sequence of development

159
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,670
and execution of condominial works

160
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,740
is different from that
of the traditional sewerage system.

161
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,450
After the utility
has concluded a survey,

162
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,200
a preliminary sewer design is used
to define the ‘condominiums’.

163
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,660
These are the units of service

164
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,370
which will be each having a single,

165
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,290
shared condominial branch sewer.

166
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,060
Both the social
and the technical teams

167
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,410
of the utility will work

168
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,220
with the Condominium members
to define the type

169
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,460
and routing of the condominial branch

170
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,050
that will serve them
as well as the terms

171
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,040
that will be applied
to the construction

172
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,990
and subsequent operation
of the sewer branch.

173
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,850
An essential part
of the implementation

174
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,950
of a condominial program
is the dialogue

175
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,450
and collaboration of the utility
with the Condominium members.

176
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,630
A close relationship
between the two parties

177
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,840
is required

178
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,420
to successfully design,

179
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,320
construct and operate
the condominial sewerage system.

180
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,750
Since such participatory
approaches are relatively new

181
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,500
to traditional sanitation,

182
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,400
CAESB deploys “social teams”

183
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,380
together with their “technical teams”

184
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,930
to facilitate the approach

185
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,940
and to thus help
successfully arrive

186
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,790
at the necessary joint agreements

187
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,840
between the utility
and the community.

188
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,140
The final engineering design
related to the collector networks

189
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,250
are only undertaken
after agreement has first been reached

190
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,490
between the utility
and the condominiums

191
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,610
on the lay out
of the condominial branch.

192
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,540
This process of finalizing

193
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,860
the design of the collector networks

194
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,110
is carried out during the execution
of the corresponding sewer

195
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,190
civil works themselves,

196
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,760
we call it in the field
"final design".

197
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,130
Let us take a closer
look at the possible

198
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,740
layout of a condominial sewerage network

199
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,180
and the different elements
made up by it.

200
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,370
As we just heard,
a condominium

201
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,130
is a newly formed service unit

202
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,680
with a single,
collective connection point.

203
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,420
All households
in one condomium

204
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,430
will connect to
a shared branch

205
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,710
that discharges into a
secondary sewer network.

206
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Instead of service laterals

207
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,800
directly connecting households

208
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,820
to a sewer main
under the street,

209
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,350
the condominial system
uses one single pipe

210
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,610
that connects to each household
in the block.

211
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,270
This is called
the “condominial branch”.

212
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,350
There are different
types of branches,

213
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,350
depending on their location.

214
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,520
However, irrespectively
of whether the branches

215
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,860
are internal
or are at the sidewalk,

216
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,950
they are considered
the responsibility

217
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,210
of the household,

218
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,890
as a sewer connection would be

219
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,450
under traditional sewerage projects.

220
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,720
The illustration shows
how the extension of the pipe network

221
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,320
can be reduced through
optimized routing

222
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,730
of the condominial branch.

223
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,000
Together with the shallower
depth of the branches,

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,540
smaller pipe diameters,

225
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,000
and the use of simple inspection boxes
instead of manholes,

226
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,500
capital costs
can be consequently

227
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
reduced.

228
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,220
Besides the optimized
network layout introduced

229
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,080
when using the
condominial approach,

230
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,010
there are other design
aspects of condominial sewerage

231
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,420
that help optimize
the costs of installation.

232
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,640
Pipe diameters in condominial branches
are generally minimized.

233
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,690
Hydraulic conditions permit
a diameter of 100 milimeters.

234
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,630
Shallower depths of pipes can be used

235
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,540
when sewers are laid in front or
in the backyard or under the sidewalks,

236
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,840
thus avoiding traffic-bearing sites

237
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,330
so to get as little as 60 cm,

238
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,120
reducing the amount
of excavation required.

239
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,550
In condominial sewerage system,

240
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,530
the number of costly
manholes is reduced

241
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,850
and they are replaced
by simplified forms

242
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,570
called inspection chambers.

243
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,380
These factors not only reduce
the cost of the sewers,

244
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,200
but can also prove beneficial
during maintenance and repairs.

245
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,650
When condominial branches
are located in household yards

246
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,070
and in sidewalks,
access for repair

247
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,590
and maintenance is possible

248
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,150
without the need for the utility

249
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,780
to break up roads
and interrupt traffic.

250
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,710
The condominium members
jointly agree on the location

251
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,070
of the condominial branch.

252
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,390
If the utility is
to maintain the branch,

253
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,010
the sidewalk is
the preferred branch location.

254
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,440
However, in informal, densely populated,

255
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,810
unplanned settlements,

256
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,330
or in other circumstances

257
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,640
such as where the sanitary
facilities are located

258
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,300
at the back
of the house,

259
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,560
the back-of-the-lot branch

260
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,810
is sometimes
the only feasible option.

261
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,820
It is in these circumstances

262
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,200
where the condominial approach
is especially beneficial,

263
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,480
as it can provide
solutions in situations

264
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,130
where conventional sewers
would not be feasible.

265
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,630
Costs savings
of condominial sewerage systems

266
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,100
usually range between 30

267
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,950
and 40 percent of those
of conventional systems.

268
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,160
Furthermore, given that
construction costs

269
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,960
of the condominial branches,

270
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,310
which are considered the private part
of the sewerage network

271
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,710
and are generally
covered by the household,

272
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,800
this arrangement represents
a significant reduction

273
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,040
in the financial burden
assumed by the utility.

274
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,740
Even though the households
are responsible

275
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,740
for the cost of construction
of the condominial branch,

276
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,800
in most cases it is executed
by the utility.

277
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,470
These construction
costs are covered

278
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,440
by the condominium members
in the form of a connection fee,

279
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,870
and are in accordance
with the agreement

280
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,440
signed by each household
and the utility.

281
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,010
A service fee for operation
of the condominial sewer

282
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,390
is usually based on the household’s
monthly water consumption.

283
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,890
In situations where users
opt to maintain

284
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,830
their branch themselves,

285
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,420
they qualify for
a reduced service fee.

286
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,360
The condominial approach involves

287
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,950
the targeted households

288
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,310
and their community
as a fundamental part

289
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,120
of the sewerage solution

290
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,690
and thus creates
ownership among the users,

291
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,150
which is an important factor

292
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,420
in the sustainable
operation of the sewers.

293
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,860
The condominial approach
is based upon the full participation

294
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,790
of the community
in the engineering design

295
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,580
and construction
of the local sewerage system.

296
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,390
This requires
that the utility

297
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,420
employs social outreach specialists

298
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,500
as well as technical/engineering
specialists to work in conjunction

299
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,980
on the design
and implementation phases.

300
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,330
This participation throughout
the project cycle leads

301
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,820
to high levels of
connection by households

302
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,390
to the sewer network,

303
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,700
often reaching 100 percent.

304
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,270
Given the optimization
of the local sewer layout,

305
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,440
the smaller sewer diameters,

306
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,770
the shallower depths
and the greater distances

307
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,850
between the inspection chambers,

308
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,220
the costs of the condominial sewer

309
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,800
civil works can be reduced
by some 30 to 40 percent of the costs

310
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,110
of a corresponding
conventional sewerage solution.

311
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,690
The adaptability
of the condominial approach

312
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,410
to local conditions
enables the provision

313
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,170
of sewerage service

314
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,030
where conventional solutions
would not be possible,

315
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,080
for example
in informal,

316
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,760
densely populated, unplanned,
peri-urban settlements.

317
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,570
However, the condominial approach

318
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,860
can be equally applied

319
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,210
to formally urbanized areas.

320
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,310
In the district of Brazil
where CAESB works,

321
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,310
condominial sewers have been
successfully implemented

322
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,720
in all types
of urban settings,

323
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,030
poor and rich alike.
