00:00:04,164 --> 00:00:07,265
Welcome to the final module
on sanitation technologies.

2
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:09,777
It is about emerging technologies

3
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,165
and new ongoing developments
in the sector.

4
00:00:12,777 --> 00:00:15,751
In the last few lectures
we tried to give you an overview

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,838
of the entire spectrum
of sanitation technologies.

6
00:00:19,342 --> 00:00:21,986
We could not present
all technologies that exist,

7
00:00:21,986 --> 00:00:24,782
but our focus was on those
that are fully developed

8
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:28,235
and that have been proven
and tested in field applications.

9
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:32,094
However, in addition
to those established technologies,

10
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:36,207
there are several innovations
that have moved beyond laboratory phase

11
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:38,065
and are currently being implemented

12
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:40,733
in the context of low
and middle income countries

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,592
at a scale that shows
great promise for the future.

14
00:00:44,974 --> 00:00:48,958
In recent years many organizations
around the world

15
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:52,288
started to work on technology
and business model innovations

16
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:55,759
in the entire chain
between user interface designs

17
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,327
and end use technologies.

18
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:00,785
Other research focuses
on further developing

19
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:03,742
the already well-known
and widespread technologies

20
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:05,676
to improve their performance.

21
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:09,664
There are so many exciting
and promising initiatives and projects

22
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,704
that there is no way for me
to list them all here,

23
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,117
I just want you to be aware
that the list of technologies

24
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,844
that we presented in this course

25
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,258
is not the end of the story.

26
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:21,050
It may just be the beginning.

27
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,102
If you are interested to learn more

28
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:25,573
about what's going on
in this dynamic sector,

29
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:28,560
I can highly recommend you
to check out the online forum

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,322
of the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance,
SuSanA,

31
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,385
and in particular the section
on innovative sanitation science

32
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:36,747
and technology.

33
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:39,626
The SuSanA is a great platform
for learning and sharing,

34
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,801
and by signing up on the forum

35
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,285
you can continue the discussion
beyond this course

36
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:46,645
and exchange your
knowledge and experience

37
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:49,553
with more than 4,000
sanitation enthusiasts

38
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:50,943
from all over the world.

39
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,959
Some further reading
on the emerging sanitation technologies

40
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,953
is provided on pages
166 to 169 of the compendium

41
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,900
and in the chapter <i>The Way Forward

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,122
of the FSM book.

43
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:05,892
As described also in that book chapter,

44
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:09,010
a lot of research and development work
still needs to be done

45
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,789
in order to achieve
adequate sanitation for all,

46
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:15,639
and it will take time to overcome
the bottlenecks that still exist.

47
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:20,696
One major challenge is that innovation
and transformation processes

48
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:22,611
in this sector are quite slow,

49
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:24,248
because, among other reasons,

50
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:27,701
centralized network infrastructure
typically stays in the ground

51
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,589
for several decades,

52
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:32,004
and alternatives are still
too little known.

53
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:35,456
This prevents innovative
sanitation technologies

54
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,374
from being taken up at scale.

55
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,925
I am convinced that through
our joint collaborative efforts

56
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:43,875
we can overcome the knowledge gap

57
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,484
and bring sanitation innovations
a step further.

58
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:50,679
In the following modules
Elizabeth Tilly will show you

59
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:53,346
how the technologies
of different functional groups

60
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:55,575
can be combined into logical systems.
