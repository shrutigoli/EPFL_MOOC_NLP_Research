1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,040
You're in charge

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,870
of improving the sanitation
 situation in your city,

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,050
with low income neighbohoods,
 such as this one in Nairobi.

4
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:15,237
And you ask yourself 
"Where do I even start?"

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,031
You're not the only one.

6
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,779
Urban sanitation is complex.

7
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:34,589
Different urban contexts 
mean different sanitation challenges.

8
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:37,688
These challenges 
often need to be addressed

9
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:41,108
with different sanitation systems
 or management skills.

10
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:43,759
How do we tackle this complexity

11
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,759
and enable city-wide 
inclusive sanitation solutions?

12
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,280
This is what this MOOC is all about.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,350
This course is produced in collaboration

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,880
with the World Bank 
and the World Health Organization.

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,550
Cities are not homogenous,

16
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,080
especially in low
and middle-income countries.

17
00:01:07,523 --> 00:01:10,593
We can differentiate 
between three different contexts:

18
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:12,713
the middle and high-income settlements,

19
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:14,611
the informal settlements,

20
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,501
and the peri-urban interface.

21
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:20,829
How to provide sanitation services
to each of these contexts?

22
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,310
In this course, you will learn

23
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,920
about state of the art sanitation
planning approaches,

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,530
like Sanitation 21.

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,400
Dealing with city-wide planning.

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,680
Clues.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,930
Focusing on informal settlements
and communities.

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,720
And the World Bank City Service
Delivery Assessment tools,

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,670
and WHO's Sanitation Safety Plans.

30
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,870
Plus, we will also feature 
some best-practice case studies

31
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,860
from Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

32
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:51,181
Stakeholders 
and institutions

33
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,051
are key to urban sanitation.

34
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:58,354
You will learn how to bring them
 on board in a participatory process,

35
00:01:58,354 --> 00:02:02,074
in order to achieve 
city-wide inclusive sanitation.

36
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,143
But how do we actually choose
proper sanitation systems?

37
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:11,423
Building on the Compendium 
of Sanitation Systems and Technologies,

38
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,853
we'll get an overview 
of the different technologies

39
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:15,643
adapted to these contexts

40
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:19,533
and how to systematically combine them
into a proper sanitation system.

41
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:23,994
We will cover the entire sanitation chain,
from the user interface;

42
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:26,914
for example, using this squat plate; 

43
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:32,284
Collection and storage, conveyance,
transport, treatment,

44
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:35,077
and finally, disposal and use.

45
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:39,603
For example, 
using this urine-based fertilizer.

46
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:44,969
Or, this dried sludge pellets  
made out of faecal sludge.

47
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,880
Interested in learning

48
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,650
all about urban sanitation
theory and practice?

49
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,924
Then this course is for you.

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,030
