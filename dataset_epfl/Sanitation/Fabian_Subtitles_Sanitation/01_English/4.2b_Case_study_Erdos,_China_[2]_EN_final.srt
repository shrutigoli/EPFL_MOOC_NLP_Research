1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,222
Welcome back to our second module

2
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:08,230
on the Erdos, China case study.

3
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:11,888
In the last module we presented the case

4
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:14,719
of the Erdos eco-san pilot project

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,230
and highlighted
some of its unique features:

6
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:23,095
the first multi-story source-separating
dry toilet project in China,

7
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:25,824
and the closed loop
nutrient recovery processes

8
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:27,351
that were implemented.

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,603
In this module, we are going
to analyze some of the problems

10
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:33,312
and challenges that cropped up very early

11
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:35,075
after the residents had moved in,

12
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:38,524
and eventually led
to the low levels of user satisfaction

13
00:00:38,524 --> 00:00:40,384
shown in the graph here,

14
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:45,662
and finally led to the total dismantling
of the dry sanitation system in 2010.

15
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:50,283
This graph highlights the four
main grievances and issues at play

16
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,480
that explain the high rate
of dissatisfaction.

17
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:57,345
The institutional, financial,
and socio-cultural aspects.

18
00:00:57,848 --> 00:01:02,430
By far, the most important
are the technical aspects.

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:06,365
The main issue here
was new toilet technology

20
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:08,648
that was not yet robust and mature enough

21
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:11,064
to stand the wear and tear
of everyday use.

22
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,713
This was due to mechanical parts
that malfunctioned,

23
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:19,266
and the incorrectly installed
ventilation system

24
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:21,460
that was compounded by broken fans.

25
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:25,926
This led to major odor problems
and huge complaints by the residents.

26
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:29,420
Also, the fans were perceived
as being too loud

27
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,125
when they were in operation.

28
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:35,480
A further problem common
to urine separating dry toilets

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,936
was the crystallization of urine
in the odor locks.

30
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:41,957
Some of these failures can be explained

31
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:44,462
by the installation
of a totally new system

32
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:47,193
and the lack of experience
by the local builders

33
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:48,536
in installing them.

34
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:52,179
Secondly, the socio-cultural aspects.

35
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:55,829
The Erdos apartments
were bought by aspiring,

36
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,622
upwardly mobile apartment owners

37
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:00,804
who never really accepted the toilets

38
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:03,668
and perceived them
as being inferior technology.

39
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:06,998
This non-acceptance
led to the incorrect use,

40
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:10,478
for example, using water to flush

41
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,576
as shown here,

42
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:17,325
or throwing solid waste
into the toilet bowl.

43
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,457
These problems were highlighted

44
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:21,847
by an evaluation conducted by SEI.

45
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:25,681
The two graphs on the bottom left

46
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,421
show that a majority
of interviewed households

47
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:31,087
were ashamed of using their toilets,

48
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:33,486
and thought they lowered
the value of their apartment.

49
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:37,784
Thirdly, the financial aspects
certainly also played a role.

50
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,831
The entire capital and maintenance costs

51
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,782
proved to be more than twice as high

52
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:45,937
as a conventional
water-flushed sanitation system,

53
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:48,712
and especially the maintenance cost
with mechanical emptying

54
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:51,575
of waste bins and urine
were seen as costly.

55
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:55,533
The ecological benefits
like the water savings

56
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,736
were not perceived as a great benefit
by the homeowners.

57
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:03,172
And finally, the institutional aspects

58
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:05,116
that led to some
of the abovementioned problems.

59
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:08,212
During the project implementation,

60
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:10,608
there was not a clearly
developed understanding

61
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,618
of the responsibilities and duties

62
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:15,388
between local government
and the main developer.

63
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:19,467
The diverse interests
of the three main stakeholders

64
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:22,675
were also a major issue.

65
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:25,277
The Stokholm Environmental Institute

66
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:29,421
was mainly interested
in promoting ecological sanitation

67
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:30,714
in a multi-story building.

68
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:33,262
The Dongxeng District government

69
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:38,126
was interested in having
a solution for water shortages

70
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:40,770
and also promoting an image
as a modern city.

71
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:45,966
And lastly, the Doxing Estate
development company

72
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:48,510
was of course,
interested in making a profit.

73
00:03:49,214 --> 00:03:53,202
In hindsight, the incorporation
of a single management entity

74
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:55,906
would probably have led
to less building mistakes

75
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:57,401
and less technical failures

76
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:01,135
when implementing something totally new.

77
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:03,269
In the end, three and a half years
after moving in,

78
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,917
and despite attempts at installing
a newer generation of dry toilet

79
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,208
called the Separette,

80
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,906
and improving and widening
the ventilation pipes

81
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:12,579
and replacing the fans,

82
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:18,381
the homeowners collectively decided
to replace the entire dry toilet system

83
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:22,177
and replace them with low flush,
water-based cistern toilets.

84
00:04:23,057 --> 00:04:26,145
The only remaining part
of the project today

85
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:28,113
is the onsite treatment plant

86
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:31,539
which acts as a decentralized
wastewater treatment plant.

87
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,555
This module provided only a short insight

88
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,817
into some of the challenges of trying,

89
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,795
ultimately without success,

90
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:42,554
to introduce novel closed-loop
sanitation systems

91
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:44,130
in a multi-story context.

92
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:48,834
It does not mean that dry sanitation
systems cannot work <i>per se</i>,

93
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:51,509
but that mature and robust
technology solutions

94
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:55,462
need to be aligned with user
expectations and aspirations.

95
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,916
If you want to learn more
about this interesting project

96
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:02,060
and details about how
the whole story played out,

97
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,956
you can order this book
from Practical Action Publishers,

98
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:09,219
which we've included
in this week's list of further reading.

99
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:12,303
In our last and final case study

100
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:13,773
we will move to Indonesia

101
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,912
and present
one of the great success stories

102
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:17,994
of bringing urban sanitation to scale.

103
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,677
This module will be presented
by Isabel Blackett

104
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:24,848
from the Water and Sanitation
program in Jakarta.

105
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:27,167
Thanks, and see you next week.
