00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,470
Hello! Welcome to the module
on institutional

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,710
and financial options
for sanitation service delivery.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,640
My name is Sophie Trémolet

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,270
and I am a Senior Economist

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,560
in the World
Bank Global Water Practice.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,600
In this module, we will discuss

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,320
how sanitation services are provided

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,140
and how they can
be financed.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,800
There is no “one-size”
fits all in this area.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,000
Understanding who is in charge,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,790
where they get funding from

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,410
and how they could mobilize
additional financing

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,100
is essential
to start

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,410
identifying solutions
for improving services.

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,290
The public sector
is usually responsible

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,300
for ensuring that sanitation
services are provided.

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,510
With this comes related
responsibilities

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,290
for making policy:

19
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,620
to define what services
need to be delivered,

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,140
and for regulation:

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,150
to ensure that those services

22
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,880
which need to be delivered,

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,590
do indeed get delivered,

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,790
and are delivered
at a fair price.

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,100
Policy functions entail
preparing policy documents,

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,910
norms and standards

27
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,900
and establishing service
delivery targets,

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,000
which reflect how much funding
is going to be allocated

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,600
to sanitation services overall,

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,950
and by the public sector
in particular.

31
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,480
For example,
policies need to state

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,390
where funding for sanitation
is going to come from

33
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,720
and what service levels
need to be provided.

34
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,830
Economic regulation
entails ensuring

35
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,650
that tariffs are set at a level

36
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,760
that allows service providers

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,460
to be financially viable,

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,290
whilst incentivizing them
to deliver better services

39
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,850
at a fair cost,

40
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,150
including to the poor.

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,900
Environmental and public
health regulation

42
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,060
is also needed to ensure
compliance with standards.

43
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,470
The public sector
may also be in charge

44
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,550
of providing the services themselves,

45
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,670
but this will vary
depending on the nature

46
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,560
of the urban sanitation services

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,070
along the sanitation value chain

48
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,810
and on whether the public sector

49
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,310
has the capacity
to deliver such services.

50
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,430
A common recommendation
is to keep policy

51
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,890
and regulatory
functions separate,

52
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,110
so as to maintain
“checks and balances”

53
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,190
in the system and avoid
conflicts of interest.

54
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,220
For example,
if a municipal utility

55
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,430
is providing sanitation services,

56
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,060
it would be preferable
for this utility

57
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,790
to be corporatized

58
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,080
and to operate under
a clear service

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,360
delivery contract
with the municipality,

60
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,080
so that it is not
the same department

61
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,850
that sets service
delivery objectives

62
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,010
that is also in charge of delivering

63
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,620
on these objectives

64
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,890
and/or in charge
of verifying

65
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,600
that these objectives
have been met.

66
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,370
Sanitation services
can be provided

67
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,170
either by public
or private service providers.

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,380
In developing countries

69
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,470
where sewerage coverage is limited,

70
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,150
which is the case in most
of Sub-Saharan Africa

71
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,480
and in much of Asia,

72
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,070
the private sector has stepped
in to provide services.

73
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,590
This private sector includes

74
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,060
small artisans building latrines

75
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,480
or small latrine
emptying operators,

76
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,040
who either provide manual services

77
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,260
or operate one or two emptying trucks.

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,570
Many of these private
service providers

79
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,110
operate in a regulatory
vacuum, however.

80
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,580
To maximize the efficiency

81
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,800
from private sector participation

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,550
and ensure that services
are delivered in line

83
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,930
with public policies,

84
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,070
structuring these markets
will call for more regulation.

85
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,720
This could entail
issuing them with licenses

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
for example
to ensure that

87
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,250
emptying trucks conform with standards

88
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,670
or do not apply
extortionate charges,

89
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,540
or entering into public-private
partnership contractual arrangements,

90
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,500
also referred to as PPPs.

91
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,860
The latter are
particularly applicable

92
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,140
when the private operator

93
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,930
is requested to manage
a public sector asset,

94
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,960
as this would be the case

95
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,010
for utilities managing
a sewerage network

96
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,740
or a wastewater treatment plant,

97
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,200
or even for a small operator

98
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,780
in charge of managing
public toilets, for example.

99
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,930
For such cases,

100
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,070
different PPP contracts
can be applied,

101
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,310
ranging from a service contract

102
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,730
which only entails minimum
delegation of responsibilities

103
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,620
to the private operator
to a concession contract,

104
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,980
where the private operator

105
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,680
is in charge of investing
in new assets,

106
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,800
as well as operating
and maintaining them

107
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,740
during a contractual
period of time,

108
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,940
before transferring them back
to the public sector.

109
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,140
Sanitation services,
as is the case

110
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,670
for water supply services,

111
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,480
generate a number of costs
that need to be recovered.

112
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,810
These include:

113
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,260
the costs of operating

114
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,810
and maintaining the services,

115
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,180
what we refer to
as O&M costs;

116
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,200
the costs of capital maintenance,

117
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,400
for large repairs
and for asset rehabilitation;

118
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,530
the costs of investing
in new assets;

119
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,930
the financial costs
associated with borrowing

120
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,150
for such investments,

121
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,670
and any taxes associated

122
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,710
with the provision
of such services.

123
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,780
To cover these costs,

124
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,250
funding for sanitation

125
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,150
can only ultimately come
from three main sources,

126
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,860
which are commonly referred
to as “the 3 Ts”.

127
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,330
These are: tariffs:

128
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,240
that’s a short-hand
for referring to funds

129
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,600
that are directly
generated by households.

130
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,170
This could take
the form of payments

131
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,610
to a service provider
for a service rendered,

132
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,150
for example a sewerage tariff,

133
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,760
or direct payments
by households themselves,

134
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,930
for example to build
an on-site sanitation facility

135
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,170
on their premises;

136
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,000
taxes is a short-hand
to refer to the funds

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,180
provided by tax-payers
via the government system.

138
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,640
These can include capital
investment subsidies,

139
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,970
the provision of free-land
to site, an asset,

140
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,850
or grants used
for demand-creation,

141
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,850
as we will discuss
in more detail later.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,110
Transfers is a short-hand

143
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,140
to refer to voluntary contributions

144
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,480
and grants,

145
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,340
which may come
from foreign governments

146
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,800
in the form of Official
Development Assistance or ODA,

147
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,910
or local and international NGOs

148
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,180
and philanthropic foundations,

149
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,570
or even from migrant workers
via remittances.

150
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,430
These are three sources
of what we call

151
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,160
“funding for the sector”,

152
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,180
meaning the money that is allocated

153
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,600
to cover the costs
of service provision.

154
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,730
But sanitation sector
investments are very lumpy;

155
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,130
that means,
quite significant in size.

156
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,340
For example, when
a household builds a latrine,

157
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,500
the cost of this investment
can be equivalent

158
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,900
to their annual income,

159
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,150
or even double that.

160
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,170
Most utilities
in developing countries

161
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,580
would not generate
enough cash surplus

162
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,890
to pay for investments
in sewerage networks up-front.

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,740
As a result, borrowing
for sanitation, i.e.

164
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,540
mobilizing what we call
repayable finance,

165
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,220
is essential to
enable these lumpy

166
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,830
investments to take place.

167
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,230
Such repayable financing can come
from product suppliers,

168
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,320
microfinance institutions,
commercial banks

169
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,930
that lend at market rates,

170
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,830
or the so-called
development banks

171
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,730
that lend on
concessional terms, i.e.

172
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,850
conditions that are
more advantageous

173
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,190
than market conditions
for the borrowers.

174
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,480
How these sources of funding

175
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,320
and financing are combined to pay

176
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,710
for sanitation depends
on government policy

177
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,840
and on the ability
of regulatory institutions

178
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,620
to enforce those policies,

179
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,290
by setting fair tariffs,
for example.

180
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,070
Some investments generate
public good benefits:

181
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,310
this is commonly cited
as a reason

182
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,790
to use public funding

183
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,540
for sewerage networks
and wastewater treatment.

184
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,350
By contrast,
most countries consider

185
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,350
investments in on-site
sanitation systems

186
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,920
to be private investments,

187
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,630
which should be made by those
who directly benefit,

188
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,530
the households themselves.

189
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,570
Such commonly encountered policy

190
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,800
principles can lead
to misallocations, however.

191
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,170
In Dar es Salaam,
back in 2012,

192
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,400
it was found that 99%

193
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,630
of public sector financing

194
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,170
was used to pay
for sewerage systems

195
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,310
and associated wastewater
treatment which,

196
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,410
at the time, served only 10%
of the city’s population.

197
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,590
The remaining 90%
of the population,

198
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,350
including of course the poorest,

199
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,930
had to rely on
their own resources

200
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,670
to build latrines,

201
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,310
at a cost that vastly
exceeded the charge

202
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,010
for getting a sewerage connection.

203
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,540
However, sewerage connections

204
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,090
were only accessible
for richer people

205
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,330
living in areas

206
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,510
already covered
by the sewerage network.

207
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,360
The Sustainable
Development Goals aim

208
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,670
to achieve access to adequate

209
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,310
and equitable sanitation and hygiene

210
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,330
for all and end open defecation,

211
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,690
paying special attention

212
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,770
to the needs of women and girls

213
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,160
and those in vulnerable situations.

214
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,790
As network-based solutions
are expensive,

215
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,240
many cities will need
to deploy alternative

216
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,070
technical solutions
to sewerage,

217
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,910
such as on-site
sanitation systems

218
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,150
with provisions
for the adequate management

219
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,970
of the entire sanitation chain,

220
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,090
as discussed in more detail

221
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,890
in other modules
of this course.

222
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,430
Given these challenges,
public funds, taxes and transfers,

223
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,520
will need to be used
in a smarter

224
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,940
and more catalytic
manner going forward.

225
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,680
There are lots of reasons
why using public funds

226
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,940
to support sanitation adoption

227
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,440
can be fully justified.

228
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,770
The overarching reason

229
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,360
is that there are
significant public benefits

230
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,870
in universal
sanitation coverage.

231
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,690
If a household builds
and uses a latrine,

232
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,770
it won’t stand to benefit
fully from its investment

233
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,800
unless everybody else around
that household also uses one.

234
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,560
So how can public funds

235
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,210
be used better
for urban sanitation?

236
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,160
They can be used:
to create demand for the service

237
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,100
by investing
in demand-creation activities

238
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,870
and behavior
change campaigns;

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,690
to provide partial subsidies

240
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,240
towards the costs of investment,

241
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,050
such as for household investments

242
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,450
in on-site sanitation,

243
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,370
to support the connection
of poor households

244
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,220
to existing sewers,

245
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,320
and/or for investments
in the downstream systems

246
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,020
that are needed to collect

247
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,810
and treat the faecal sludge
or the wastewater.

248
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,680
To be more efficient
and better targeted,

249
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,180
these subsidies would
ideally be provided

250
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,710
based on verified
actual results.

251
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,530
Public funds can also be
used to facilitate access

252
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,480
to finance for households,

253
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,840
small businesses
or even utilities

254
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,640
that need to borrow
in order to invest

255
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,940
but are unable to do
so for a variety of reasons.

256
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,230
For example,
grants can be provided

257
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,720
to help educate lenders and borrowers

258
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,030
on what it means
to borrow for sanitation.

259
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,320
Concessional financing can be blended

260
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,680
with commercial financing,
to extend tenures

261
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,480
(the length of time
one borrows for),

262
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,310
or to provide credit enhancement

263
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,000
in the form of guarantees.

264
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,950
If one wants to improve
how financing for sanitation

265
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,700
is allocated,

266
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,720
it is essential to start
by understanding

267
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,900
how much is spent
on sanitation services,

268
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,960
and by whom.

269
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,260
This is not straightforward, however,

270
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,810
as funding and financing
for sanitation

271
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,910
are channeled in many
different ways to the sector.

272
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,510
In most cases,

273
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,580
there is not
a single budget line

274
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,250
dedicated to sanitation.

275
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,490
Building a graphical
representation of the sector

276
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,410
such as this example
can help with visualizing

277
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,390
not only who is
in charge of what,

278
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,370
but also how funding flows

279
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,110
between these different actors.

280
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,860
This can then provide a basis
for estimating the volumes

281
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,920
of funding that are currently
going into sanitation

282
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,630
and identifying ways to mobilize
funding for the sector.

283
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,560
In this module,
we have talked about

284
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,960
how sanitation services are organized

285
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,270
and how they
can be financed.

286
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,600
Key take-away messages
are as follows:

287
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,250
One size does not fit all;

288
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,160
there are many different ways

289
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,760
to organize the delivery
of sanitation services.

290
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,130
A key principle
would be to maintain

291
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,140
a separation
between policy,

292
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,340
regulation and service
provision functions,

293
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,110
so as to ensure
checks and balances.

294
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,840
Sanitation services
can be provided

295
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,480
by public or private
service providers.

296
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,940
Bringing in the private sector requires

297
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,630
clear regulatory arrangements,

298
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,070
via licenses or contracts
for service provision.

299
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,750
Sanitation services
can be funded

300
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,600
from a variety of sources.

301
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,080
However, public funds

302
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,230
need to be spent
in a smarter

303
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,900
and more catalytic manner,

304
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,120
to ensure that
the Sustainable

305
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,320
Development Goal
of universal access

306
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,330
to sanitation becomes a reality.
