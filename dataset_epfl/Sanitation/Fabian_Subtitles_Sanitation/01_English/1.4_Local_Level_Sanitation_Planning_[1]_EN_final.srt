00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:05,579
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,908 --> 00:00:08,750
In the last presentation
by Jonathan Parkinson,

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,552
we explored some of the issues involved
in city-wide sanitation planning

4
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:15,494
and planning for
urban sanitation at scale.

5
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:20,186
In this module, we are going to dig
a bit deeper and explore the local level.

6
00:00:20,226 --> 00:00:24,886
With local level, we mean the thousands 
of urban neighborhoods and communities

7
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:30,024
in Africa, Asia and Latin America that are
currently unserved or underserved

8
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:33,269
with environmental sanitation services.

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,372
We are specifically going
to look at the household domain,

10
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:43,245
and the community domain, the areas
and settings where most people

11
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:46,576
lead their daily lives in the urban areas 
of the developing world.

12
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:52,948
The local level means areas
like this here, in Kibera, Nairobi,

13
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,262
one of the most notorious
informal settlements in Africa,

14
00:00:57,262 --> 00:01:01,576
with high densities of over
1000 inhabitants per hectare.

15
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:05,800
On the image here, shown in the middle,

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,552
a first attempt at providing
public sanitation services,

17
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:13,259
a public toilet built together
with the Wassa Program

18
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,106
water and sanitation for the urban poor.

19
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,435
What are the learning goals of this module?

20
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:23,083
We want you to get to know
the CLUES planning approach

21
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:26,541
for environmental sanitation
in urban low-income areas

22
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:29,524
and we will also explore some
of the linkages between city-wide

23
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:33,547
and community level interventions.

24
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:38,772
The most difficult spacial contexts
to deal with are undoubtedly

25
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:42,415
the rapidly expanding para-urban areas
surrounding most cities

26
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:46,905
and the informal settlements found in much
of Africa, Asia and Latin America.

27
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:52,001
These unplanned areas not only have 
poor access to developed services,

28
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,970
they also exhibit 
dysfunctional institutions

29
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,560
where government services hardly reach.

30
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,100
Each spatial setting requires
its planning approach.

31
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,821
For rural areas, widely known today
is the CLTS approach,

32
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:12,593
Community Led Total Sanitation.

33
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:16,885
For urban areas,
we will be presenting CLUES,

34
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:20,947
the Community Led Urban Environmental
Sanitation planning approach,

35
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:26,469
and finally, at city-wide level,
the Sanitation 21 approach

36
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:31,991
which Doctor Parkinson has explained
in the modules before

37
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:36,053
covering the entire urban sphere.

38
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:41,546
Some few words about the Community Led
Total Sanitation for rural sanitation.

39
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,026
CLTS helps rural communities
to collectively find solutions

40
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:52,332
to their inadequate sanitation situation.
In most cases, this means overcoming

41
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:56,554
open defecation in the villages.

42
00:02:56,754 --> 00:03:00,535
Its focus is on igniting a change
in sanitation behavior

43
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,536
rather than constructing toilets.

44
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:07,709
The approach is very much 
a community-driven one.

45
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:14,757
It doesn't only focus on individual behaviors
and the first significant step of CLTS

46
00:03:14,757 --> 00:03:20,106
is to put an end to open defecation.
It starts by enabling people to do

47
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:24,046
their own sanitation profile through
appraisal, the observation,

48
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:28,031
and the analysis of their practices
of open defecation

49
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:31,616
and the effects that these
have on their lives.

50
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:36,071
There are many existing planning frameworks,
but we're highlighting only two

51
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:40,150
state-of-the-art planning frameworks
that are specific for urban settings.

52
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,039
Sanitation 21, which was just presented
by Jonathan Parkinson,

53
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,010
and the CLUES approach
which I will now present.

54
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:52,772
CLUES has some common characteristics 
with CLTS, especially during

55
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:57,385
the initial stages of the process.
Both approaches seek to initiate

56
00:03:57,385 --> 00:04:00,533
stakeholder involvement 
by triggering collective action

57
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:05,022
at the community level.
However, the post-triggering process

58
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:09,302
is quite different for both.
For CLTS, it's all about sustaining

59
00:04:09,302 --> 00:04:12,512
behavior change
and ending open defecation.

60
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:16,054
For CLUES, this entails
a structured planning approach

61
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:20,076
that addresses
the entire sanitation chain.

62
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:23,980
Why is CLTS not the answer
to urban sanitation?

63
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:31,404
Firstly, urban complexity. 
There is often not the community cohesion

64
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,854
found in rural settings.

65
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:39,768
Secondly open defecation and toilet access
is often not the main issue.

66
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:42,796
Rather, it's a safe handling
of human wastes.

67
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:47,564
Thirdly, land tenure is a major issue
in the urban sphere.

68
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:52,283
Tenants cannot just build
their own toilets where they like.

69
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:57,463
Fourthly, unlike rural investments,
urban environment sanitation

70
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,107
is hugely expensive
and must take an integrated approach,

71
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:04,522
including issues like
storm water drainage, greywater,

72
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:07,947
or solid waste management to be effective.

73
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:12,137
And lastly, neighborhood solutions 
need to be synchronized

74
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:16,557
with the city-wide efforts
and cannot be planned in isolation.

75
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:21,045
Also, urban poverty
has specific characteristics.

76
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:26,408
First of all the level of commoditization.
The poor living in urban slums

77
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:30,273
have to pay rent.
They must pay for basic services,

78
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:35,088
for transportation getting into town
to their place of work and for their food.

79
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,598
Secondly, the environmental hazards.

80
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:42,021
Most dense settlements suffer
from inadequate water supply,

81
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:48,738
environmental sanitation deficiencies,
and high levels of environmental pollution.

82
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:53,862
And lastly, the deprivation 
of urban poverty marked

83
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:59,041
by urban and domestic violence,
often accompanied by drug and alcohol abuse

84
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:04,779
and insecure employment.
These three levels of urban poverty

85
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:09,527
make for quite a different set
compared to rural contexts.

86
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:15,505
Also, urban sanitation is a bit 
more complex than rural sanitation.

87
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:19,470
We need to think about 
wastewater treatment,

88
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,075
solid waste management,
fecal sludge disposal,

89
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:27,282
what happens with the greywater,
what about the water supply

90
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:33,557
in these dense urban areas,
storm water drainage and the decision

91
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:39,570
between on-site or off-site sanitation.
These make for higher level of complexity

92
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,485
of urban sanitation when compared
to rural sanitation.

93
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:50,030
In this slide, I present
the four key CLUES principles.

94
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,047
Firstly, CLUES places the neighborhood 
and community at the core

95
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:58,131
of the planning process
and, with this, it complements

96
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:03,154
city-wide strategic planning.
Secondly, it employs both expert

97
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:07,082
and community knowledge.
Thirdly, it encourages

98
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:11,850
resource conservation
and reuse, recycling, when and if possible.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,083
And fourthly, it is based on the concept
of domains and tries to solve problems

100
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:23,086
within the domain nearest 
to where the problems arise.

101
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:28,030
To sum up, it is people centered,

102
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,016
it involves a multi-stakeholder approach,

103
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:47,892
it tries to come up
with local solutions wherever possible,

104
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:56,123
and lastly, it tries to promote
environmental, sustainable solutions.
