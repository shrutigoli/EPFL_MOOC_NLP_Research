1
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:05,901
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:07,678
My name is Petra Kohler,

3
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:10,828
I'm a social anthropologist
working at Sandec.

4
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:15,959
My focus is on the persons
using certain technologies.

5
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:20,328
This module's topic is 
<i>Sanitation from a Gender Perspective</i>.

6
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:25,707
A gender approach will address the needs
of greater spectrum of users,

7
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:27,247
not just women,

8
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:31,357
and make interventions more acceptable
to the community as a whole.

9
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:34,887
I will introduce you 
to the lines of thinking,

10
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:38,387
the arguments 
for gender considerate sanitation

11
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:42,887
and shortly present 
an ongoing research project on WASH

12
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:45,728
in hospitals in India and Uganda

13
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:47,817
with a strong gender focus.

14
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,009
Now please read the definition of gender.

15
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:01,679
But what does that mean?

16
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:07,238
It is about the different roles, tasks
and responsibilities of men and women

17
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:10,068
in a given context, in a given society.

18
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,749
Gender is something that we do,

19
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:16,200
but gender is something 
that is also dumped to us.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,385
What this means in practice

21
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:21,400
for sanitation planning 
and implementation

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,647
will be addressed in the following slides.

23
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:30,565
Sanitation from a gender perspective
is pervaded by many interrelating aspects.

24
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:35,247
In this gender flower, 
you can see the <i>Seven Key Aspects</i>,

25
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:38,716
like policy, rights and justice,

26
00:01:39,206 --> 00:01:42,676
education, health and safety aspects,

27
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:48,026
culture, technology and economic aspects.

28
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:51,515
We will have a closer look 
on some of them.

29
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:57,517
Some of the gender-related challenges
are illustrated in this picture.

30
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,136
Inequalities in access,

31
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:03,277
especially in public spaces.

32
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:08,907
Particular groups, such as women,
elderly, children and handicapped people

33
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:12,818
are more strongly affected
by the absence of adequate sanitation.

34
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:15,917
Health and safety aspects,

35
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:20,187
especially women and girls
can encounter various problems

36
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,797
in connection 
with non-appropriate sanitation,

37
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:27,548
like violence, occuring as a result
of walking to a public toilet,

38
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:31,308
or infections 
from waiting too long to urinate.

39
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:35,787
Girls' school performance 
is influenced by sanitation.

40
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:42,689
Many girls do not attend school
because of lack of proper sanitation,

41
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:48,070
especially in secondary education
where menstrual hygiene becomes a matter.

42
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:53,953
School absenteeism and dropout of girls
lead to gaps in education

43
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:55,761
between girls and boys.

44
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:01,542
The most sophisticated technology
does not solve any problem

45
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:04,102
if it is not adopted by the users,

46
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:07,252
one of the lessons 
sometimes painfully learned

47
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:08,752
in the past decades.

48
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:12,373
Focusing on biological aspects,

49
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:16,904
it is obvious that men and women
follow different practices,

50
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:19,283
encounter various challenges,

51
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:23,423
and have different needs and priorities
when it comes to sanitation.

52
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:25,554
As an example,

53
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:28,163
men urinate in a different way
than women.

54
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:33,161
Women spend around 
six years menstruating in their lives.

55
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:40,462
On average, each woman 
will dispose off 125 to 150 kilograms

56
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:43,418
of sanitary material in her lifetime.

57
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:45,898
In the developing world

58
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:51,767
many end up in waterways, open dumps
or are littering communities.

59
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:56,917
We all want to have toilets
which are clean,

60
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:58,917
safe and healthy to use,

61
00:03:59,387 --> 00:04:03,477
accessible, comfortable 
and assure for privacy.

62
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:08,977
In order to plan for appropriate
gender-friendly sanitation facilities,

63
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:12,849
or to improve conditions 
of existing toilets

64
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:17,448
which are far away from acceptable
like shown in those pictures,

65
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:20,768
the following aspects 
must also be understood.

66
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:25,038
Intimate needs, personal hygiene -

67
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:27,478
like are you a <i>washer</i> or a <i>wiper -

68
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,217
the social construction of dignity,

69
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:35,412
like the perceptions of purity
and impureness.

70
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:40,629
Now, I will present you a case study
which takes into account

71
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:43,579
all the mentioned before
on gender and sanitation.

72
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:49,052
It is a interdisciplinary
two-year research project called WASH

73
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:52,773
in the context of maternal health
and menstrual hygiene,

74
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:57,507
how Indian and Ugandan health centrum
managed the sanitation needs

75
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:59,327
of special user groups.

76
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:04,123
It is combining social anthropology
and gender studies

77
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:06,295
with sanitary engineering.

78
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:12,474
It is researching the different users needs
of outpatients, inpatients,

79
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:15,252
attendants, staff members,

80
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:18,285
and wash infrastructure
in health care facilities,

81
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:21,056
particularly on how they deal

82
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:24,425
with the special needs of women
during menstruation,

83
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:27,176
child birth and the childbed.

84
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:32,666
The full range of dimensions
like health, safety issues,

85
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:38,292
accessibility, etc. was covered 
applying different assessment tools.

86
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:43,055
First, an infrastructure assessment 
was undertaken

87
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:46,387
which discovered the following 
lacking topics.

88
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:51,349
A place to take a bath after giving birth;

89
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:55,707
washing and drying place
for usable menstrual hygiene products

90
00:05:55,707 --> 00:06:00,018
and a disposal bin for used 
for menstrual hygiene products.

91
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:05,028
Secondly, semi-structured interviews

92
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:08,097
where gender-specific question guides
were applied;

93
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:13,000
and a gender-sensitive 
focus group discussion tool

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,081
which will be explained in more detail
in the next slide.

95
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:22,782
The Gender Action Learning System, GALS,

96
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:27,721
is a technique from the Participatory 
Rural Appraisal repertoire.

97
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,240
GALS is basically 
a focus group discussion tool

98
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,512
and has been adapted and tested 
to the context of gender and sanitation.

99
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:42,271
The ideal group size of a GALS 
is around 30 to 40 participants,

100
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:47,002
with 50% males and 50% females.

101
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:52,012
Reality sometimes shows a bit
a different picture,

102
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:54,241
like experienced in India.

103
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:59,482
Instead of the planned 20 women
and 20 men from different villages,

104
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:03,542
80 women appeared and only 15 men.

105
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:09,792
This means also that the facilitators
need to be very flexible

106
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:14,213
and act and adapt 
on the existing situation.

107
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:20,073
GALS spaces upon sex separated 
group discussions,

108
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:23,033
complemented by writing or drawing,

109
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:27,150
and sex mixed presentations,
and plenary discussions.

110
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,290
The two core elements from GALS are
the <i>Gender Diamond.

111
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,229
The purpose of this first step
of the exercise,

112
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,368
is to identify the challenges faced 
by the participants

113
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:44,529
in connection with their experiences
on a certain given topic,

114
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:48,280
like sanitation issues
in the presented case.

115
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:53,429
The second element is called
<i>Action Trees</i>.

116
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:57,138
The goal of this exercise
with the action trees

117
00:07:57,138 --> 00:08:00,598
is to identify the causes 
of the named problems

118
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:02,487
from the <i>Gender Diamond</i>,

119
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:06,208
and to find possible solutions
to address and solve them.

120
00:08:07,077 --> 00:08:09,948
The process is similar to the one before.

121
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,558
Now, some explanations.

122
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,678
The roots of the trees 
are the "causes" of the challenges,

123
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:21,207
stemming from the <i>Gender Diamond</i>.

124
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:26,038
The branches are the possible solutions

125
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,179
to address the problems identified before.

126
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:35,045
And potential personal commitments
to solving the problems,

127
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:36,696
those are the fruits.

128
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:39,108
GALS has a lot of strength.

129
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:44,359
It is a striking method when it comes 
to the identification of topics

130
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:47,929
which are unusual, sensitive or taboo,

131
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:53,430
and it fosters the inclusions of positions
of women and men alike.

132
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:58,290
The overall data stemming 
from the three assessment tools

133
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,858
provides evidence for interventions
that are not only gender considerate

134
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:07,752
but also neat spaced, 
technically appropriate,

135
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:09,931
and socially acceptable.

136
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:14,811
After this excursion 
into a concrete example

137
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:18,752
of a gender-sensitive plan
and executed project,

138
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:21,642
I would like to come to the summary
of this module.

139
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,472
You heard about the main 
sanitation challenges,

140
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:29,963
learned by including a gender perspective
into sanitation planning

141
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:32,092
is of essential importance

142
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:35,513
and how it could be done 
from an example in the field.

143
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:38,706
Maybe you want to include 
a gender perspective

144
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:40,643
into your upcoming project?

145
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:44,882
Then ensure for following good practices.

146
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:52,233
First, integrate gender systematically
to your project from the very beginning

147
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:55,273
and try also to involve gender experts.

148
00:09:55,933 --> 00:10:00,714
Collect sex-disaggregated data
of the beneficiary population

149
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:03,533
and send mixed teams to the fields.

150
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:11,353
Ensure for participation of men and women
in the needs analysis, planning

151
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:13,426
and in decision-making.

152
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,862
Thank you for watching and goodbye.
