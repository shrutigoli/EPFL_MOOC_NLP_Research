00:00:04,268 --> 00:00:07,326
Welcome back to this final section
on sanitation systems.

2
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:09,420
The next few templates
that we'll discuss

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,481
are all based on transporting
blackwater off site,

4
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:14,631
so away from the point
where it's generated

5
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:16,775
to a more centralized point
where it can be treated

6
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:20,028
along with the blackwater
generated by other households.

7
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:23,968
This system of blackwater treatment
with effluent transport

8
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:27,388
is a little more complicated than
a traditional sewer-based system

9
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:29,940
that would exist in a large
European city

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,469
because only the effluent
from the storage technology

11
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:33,574
is transported.

12
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:37,888
Each toilet or group of toilets
is connected to some type

13
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,240
of collection and storage technology.

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,103
This produces sludge
which must be periodically removed

15
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:46,491
and treated
as in the previous systems.

16
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:49,966
But now, the solids-free effluent
can be transported easily

17
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:55,266
through small diameter sewers
without the risk of clogging.

18
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,328
The effluent can then be treated
in a centralized treatment technology

19
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:02,009
like a constructed wetland.

20
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:06,373
The previous systems that we looked at
that relied on infiltration

21
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:09,923
were not appropriate for dense areas
because of the holding capacity

22
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:11,039
of the soil.

23
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,643
That is not the problem for this system
because the effluent is transported

24
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:17,200
in impermeable pipes away
from the community.

25
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:22,413
Here you can see the construction
of a community scale ABR

26
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,697
and the solids-free sewer
that connects the houses to it.

27
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:29,709
This system would be suitable
for a very dense urban context

28
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:32,731
irrespective of the groundwater
or soil conditions.

29
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:38,060
The solids-free sewers are being laid
underneath these paving stones.

30
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,983
This system, "blackwater transport
to semi-centralized treatment"

31
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:46,388
is the typical system for most European
and North American cities.

32
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:49,580
A flush toilet generates blackwater

33
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,353
which is transported through a sewer
to some sort of treatment.

34
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:58,853
Notice here also that the blackwater
will require some sort of pre-treatment

35
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:03,798
to prevent the solids from clogging
some of the more treatment systems.

36
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:07,533
Even robust systems like those
based on activated sludge

37
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,749
should still include some sort
of pre-treatment

38
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:12,897
just to ensure that no rubbish
enters the treatment technology.

39
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:16,697
Effluent that is destined for discharge
into the environment

40
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:19,650
could require some sort of post treatment.

41
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,589
This would ensure that the levels
of pathogens, nutrients

42
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:26,492
or other constituents do not exceed
environmental limits for the discharge.

43
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:30,718
The final slide is basically
the water-based version

44
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,829
of the urine diversion system
that we saw in the beginning.

45
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:37,525
Certainly, it's not a very common
or popular system yet

46
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,820
but it's becoming more commonplace
and it is the system that operates

47
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,031
in the Eawag building in Zurich.

48
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,924
Here you can see what the urine storage
tanks in our buildings look like.

49
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:50,067
But before we can harvest the urine
we need to start at the beginning

50
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:51,694
with the user interface.

51
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:55,093
The system requires
a urine-diverting flush toilet.

52
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:58,973
This allows for the separation
of urine and brown water

53
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:02,324
which, you remember, is the combination
of feces and flush water.

54
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:06,430
The brown water is then transported
through an existing sewer network

55
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,832
to a centralized treatment facility.

56
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:12,725
Urine does not provide a lot of volume
to the overall waste water mix

57
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,253
but without it the nutrient quality
in the brown water is much lower

58
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:19,522
and may require less treatment
to meet discharge standards.

59
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:24,709
The sludge must be treated,
as in the previous systems,

60
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,659
but because there is less liquid
remember that there will also be

61
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,441
less flush water
if urine is not flushed,

62
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:33,082
the sludge may be thicker
and easier to dry.

63
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:37,893
The urine, of course, can be used directly
after a sufficient storage period.

64
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:41,909
However, because this system is best
suited to dense areas or buildings

65
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:44,962
the large volume of urine may be
difficult to use locally

66
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:47,948
or alternatively, transported
to where it's needed.

67
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,098
We covered a lot of material
in this module on sanitation systems.

68
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,853
But the key points are simple:

69
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:57,766
We can use system templates to help
design complete, logical systems

70
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:00,521
that do not skip
any products or processing.

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,138
A system template is essentially
a matrix of products and functional groups

72
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:07,753
with specific technologies
at the intersection point.

73
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,211
There are nine different system templates
that can be used to generate

74
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,065
hundreds of possible systems,

75
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,835
and realistically, there could be
other system templates

76
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:18,471
but these are the ones
that we work with at Sandec.

77
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:22,725
Although the system templates can
help in the initial phases,

78
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:25,689
they must be used in conjunction
with good engineering

79
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,580
and local understanding.

80
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:32,054
In Module 4 you will see and examine
some different case studies

81
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:36,160
in which sanitation systems either
worked out fairly well

82
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,727
or, sometimes...not so well.

83
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:41,136
Looking forward to seeing you then.
