1
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:06,518
In the last module
we looked at the different

2
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:10,227
user interface technologies
and how they function.

3
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:12,995
Now we will move on
to the second functional group,

4
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:16,184
and see how the output products
of a user interface

5
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:20,942
can be collected, stored,
and/or treated on-site.

6
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:24,406
The functional group
Collection and Storage/Treatment

7
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:28,511
describes the ways of collecting,
storing, and sometimes treating

8
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:31,455
the products generated
at the user interface.

9
00:00:32,307 --> 00:00:34,820
The treatment provided
by these technologies

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,309
is often the function of storage,
and is usually passive,

11
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,414
without requiring energy input.

12
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:44,018
Products that emanate
from these technologies

13
00:00:44,018 --> 00:00:48,288
often require subsequent treatment
before use or disposal.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,731
There's quite a wide range of technologies
which belong to this functional group.

15
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:57,606
In order to present them
in manageable packages,

16
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:00,177
I split them up into three modules.

17
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:05,051
In this module I will talk
about technologies in which

18
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:06,602
a single pit is used.

19
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:13,336
Then I will present the options which rely
on two alternating pits to function,

20
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:16,896
and third, we will look
at anaerobic technologies

21
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,770
which are not based on pits.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,657
So let's start with the first module.

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,958
I will first present the difference
between a single pit

24
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,230
and a single Ventilated Improved Pit.

25
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:31,341
Then I am going to explain
how the ventilation functions

26
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,843
and why it can be an advantage to install
a ventilation pipe with the pit.

27
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:39,796
In the end, I will show
some key considerations

28
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:41,453
for a good pit design.

29
00:01:42,407 --> 00:01:46,864
The single pit is one of the most widely
used sanitation technologies.

30
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:49,335
It consists of a hole in the ground

31
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:52,055
which is usually
three or more meters deep.

32
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:56,681
It normally has a lining
to stabilize the walls of the pit.

33
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,561
At least the top 20 to 40 centimeters
should be lined

34
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:04,648
with a support ring
made of bricks or blocks.

35
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:09,121
The user interface
can then be placed on top of it.

36
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:13,051
I will give you some more details
about pit lining a little bit later.

37
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:19,512
The single pit is a simple technology
which is most suited to rural areas

38
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:21,911
and can be at very low cost,

39
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:25,393
depending on the materials used
and the depth of excavation;

40
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:29,225
however, emptying costs may be quite high

41
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:31,537
and the sludge
needs to be further treated.

42
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:34,739
This has to be considered
when choosing this option.

43
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:37,944
A major disadvantage of single pits

44
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:41,445
is that the emptied sludge
is still very pathogenic

45
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:44,339
and leakage can contaminate
groundwater resources.

46
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,900
Also, odors are normally noticeable

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,814
and flies hatching in the pit
can be a vector for disease transmission.

48
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,837
As we have seen for the user interface,

49
00:02:56,837 --> 00:03:00,860
the different technologies have
different input and output products.

50
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,277
This also applies to each technology
from the other functional groups

51
00:03:05,277 --> 00:03:07,133
including collection and storage.

52
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,401
If we take the example of the single pit,

53
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:15,010
the input products can be
excreta, blackwater, or feces,

54
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,871
usually mixed either
with anal cleansing water

55
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,609
or dry cleansing materials.

56
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,623
Remember that those
are the output products

57
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:24,689
of the different user interface options.

58
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:27,991
Obviously, several
user interface technologies

59
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:30,449
are compatible
with this technology here,

60
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:33,639
because several different input products
are possible here.

61
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:37,344
On the output side we have fecal sludge,

62
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,235
which needs to be transported
for further treatment.

63
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:44,941
For the following technologies,
I won't give such a detailed presentation

64
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:48,846
of the inputs and outputs anymore,
because the principle remains the same,

65
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:53,279
but if you are interested
about possible inputs or outputs

66
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:55,840
of a specific technology,
you may look it up

67
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,201
on the corresponding page
in the Compendium.

68
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:02,674
When designing a sanitation system,
it can be very helpful to look

69
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:05,354
at the input and output products
of a technology

70
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:08,107
to see which options
can be linked to it

71
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:09,900
before or after.

72
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:15,916
Single pits can be improved
by installing a ventilation pipe

73
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:19,162
with a diameter
of at least 11 centimeters.

74
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:24,481
They are then called
Ventilated Improved Pits, or VIP.

75
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:28,188
But why is the ventilation
an improvement?

76
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:33,825
Of course it can eliminate odors,
but it also has another important function.

77
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:36,751
But let's first look
at how the ventilation works.

78
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,498
The main driver that helps
to ventilate the pit is actually the wind.

79
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:44,675
Wind passing over the top
of our ventilation pipe

80
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:47,146
creates a suction pressure
within the pipe

81
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:49,216
and induces an air circulation.

82
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:55,092
If the vent pipe is well fitted
and the edges of the pit are airtight,

83
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:58,796
the air is drawn through
the user interface into the pit,

84
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:03,361
moves up inside the vent pipe,
and escapes into the atmosphere.

85
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:08,677
For an effective ventilation,
the top of the pipe should extend

86
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:12,450
at least 30 centimeters
over the roof of the superstructure.

87
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:15,784
The vent works best in windy areas

88
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:19,962
but where there is little wind,
it's effectiveness can be improved

89
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:23,730
by painting the pipe black
and exposing it to the sun.

90
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:28,032
The heat difference between
the cool pit and the warm vent

91
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:32,951
creates an updraft that pulls the air
up and out of the pit.

92
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:37,167
Besides removing odors,
another beneficial effect

93
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,387
is that flies that hatch in the pit

94
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:42,747
are attracted to the light
at the top of the ventilation pipe.

95
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:48,910
With a semi-dark superstructure,
flies fly toward the light in the pipe.

96
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:52,398
A fly screen or mesh
at the top of the pipe

97
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:55,473
traps them and prevents them
from escaping.

98
00:05:56,148 --> 00:06:00,069
The attraction for flies from the outside
is also minimized,

99
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,575
because odors are allowed to escape.

100
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:06,890
Good ventilation
effectively prevents odors

101
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,447
and is able to reduce the fly problem

102
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,581
and the spread of diseases they may carry.

103
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:15,360
The ventilation is not that easy
to construct properly;

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,196
however, a design like the one here
is probably a bit exaggerated.

105
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:23,939
Something like the one over here

106
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,377
with a good fly screen
is normally sufficient.

107
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,301
The VIP is a low cost option,

108
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:33,019
although slightly more expensive
than a simple pit.

109
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,589
Other advantages and disadvantages
are the same as for the simple pit.

110
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,709
Now, let's look at some general design
considerations for single pits.

111
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,487
Pits may be circular
or rectangular in plan,

112
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:47,999
as shown in this image.

113
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,481
Round pits are more suitable

114
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:53,584
because the earth pressure
is evenly distributed,

115
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,685
creating a natural arching effect.

116
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:59,092
Rectangular pits
have a tendency to collapse.

117
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,300
Typically, a pit is at least
three meters deep

118
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,937
and one meter in diameter.

119
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:09,706
Especially if the pit is to be reused,
its walls should be lined.

120
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,333
This prevents the pit from collapsing
during emptying.

121
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:20,023
Pit lining materials can include brick,
rot-resistant timber, concrete, or stones.

122
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:24,959
The lining of the upper edge of the pit
can be built in the so-called

123
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,749
"corbelled brickwork" technique
as shown here.

124
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,160
This design allows us to use
a smaller diameter slab

125
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,780
and can save some costs.

126
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,836
The bottom of the pit
should remain unlined

127
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,961
to allow for the infiltration
of liquids out of the pit.

128
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:43,537
Permeable side walls
can accelerate the leeching.

129
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:45,813
To protect the groundwater,

130
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:49,022
sometimes watertight
or sealed pits are built,

131
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:50,850
but this can be very expensive.

132
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:55,563
To prevent groundwater contamination,
the bottom of the pit should be at least

133
00:07:55,563 --> 00:07:57,624
two meters above the groundwater level.

134
00:07:58,204 --> 00:07:59,926
A minimum horizontal distance

135
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,641
of 30 meters between the pit
and the water source

136
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:08,125
is normally recommended to limit
exposure to microbial contamination,

137
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:13,116
but these values depend on the soil type,
moisture, and other environmental factors.

138
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:17,653
The pit volume should be designed
based on the number of users,

139
00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:22,719
the design life or desired filling time,
and the local sludge accumulation rate.

140
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:26,527
The sludge accumulation rate
depends on several factors

141
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:29,430
including the infiltration
capacity of the soil,

142
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,403
the biodegradability
of dry cleansing materials,

143
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:33,859
and the water use.

144
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:39,100
It is typically in the order of magnitude
of 40 to 90 liters per capita per year.

145
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:43,994
SIngle pits are a simple technology
which can be very appropriate,

146
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:47,865
particularly in rural areas
with a low risk of groundwater pollution.

147
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,329
Single pits should not be used
where the groundwater table is high,

148
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:55,871
or in areas that are frequently flooded
or have rocky soils.

149
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:59,147
They are not suitable
for dense urban areas,

150
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:03,492
particularly because emptying can pose
serious problems and health risks.

151
00:09:04,355 --> 00:09:09,543
The use of a vent pipe in a VIP
adds comfort and reduces flies,

152
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:12,676
but needs to be carefully designed
to function properly.

153
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,997
In the next module we are going to look
at the technologies that use two pits.
