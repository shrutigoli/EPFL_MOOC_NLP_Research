00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:09,495
<i>Welcome to the 
Lusaka Sanitation Case Study.

2
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:14,005
<i>Today, we will travel to Lusaka,
the capital of Zambia in Southern Africa,

3
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,575
<i>where we will have a closer look

4
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:18,946
<i>at a sanitation service 
delivery model for urban areas.

5
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:22,536
<i>We chose this case study 
because it shows how service,

6
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,736
<i>adapted to the local conditions,
can deliver sanitation services,

7
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:31,006
<i>and to illustrate how many different 
details other than the technical system

8
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:34,256
<i>contribute to the success
of a service delivery model.

9
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:37,858
<i>Please pay special attention
to the delegated management

10
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:39,888
<i>used to deliver the service,

11
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:43,048
<i>the financial revenue model, 
and the sanitation technologies,

12
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:46,278
and give special focus
to the faecal sludge management.

13
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:48,415
<i>Furthermore, we want you to understand

14
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:51,576
<i>how a formerly illegal business 
was formalized.

15
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:55,648
<i>In this video, people often talk about
"peri-urban areas",

16
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,619
<i>which in Zambia is used ambiguously

17
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:00,409
<i>for the settlements outside 
the city center.

18
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,569
<i>This case study is presented to you
in partnership with

19
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,060
<i>Water and Sanitation 
for the Urban Poor (WSUP).

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,608
<i>We would like to thank WSUP,

21
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,004
<i>The Lusaka Water and Sewage Company,

22
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:13,065
<i>The Kanyama Water Trust,

23
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:14,514
<i>and the people of Kanyama

24
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:18,476
<i>for allowing us to give this insight
into their work and daily life.

25
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:26,866
Lusaka is the capital city of Zambia,

26
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:31,407
and it has a population of 
about 2.3 million people.

27
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,936
And out of that 2.3 million people,

28
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:42,376
<i>you have about 60-70% of that population
living in the peri-urban areas of Lusaka.

29
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:45,416
<i>And out of that 70% I've referred to,

30
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:50,756
<i>we have about 90% of them
using on-site sanitation.

31
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:53,817
<i>The high-income areas are well-planned.

32
00:01:54,097 --> 00:02:00,238
<i>And so, those that could be only on-site 
sanitation using their septic tanks,

33
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:04,938
<i>we easily acquire services of 
their tank operators.

34
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:08,596
And their costs, of course, 
they can be able to afford

35
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,287
the cost of having 
such a level of service.

36
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:15,139
<i>But if you go to a low-income area
where there's no planning,

37
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,230
<i>the access to the properties 
is quite a challenge.

38
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,640
<i>It becomes difficult for the tanker
or service operators

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,300
<i>to provide this level of service.

40
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:30,487
<i>But also, the fact that you are talking
about the high cost of this service,

41
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:32,748
<i>as the affordability capacity,

42
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:35,278
on the part of people
in the low-income areas,

43
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:40,278
it can't allow them to be able to
pay for such a high-level of service.

44
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,190
<i>Kanyama settlement, or peri-urban,
is one of the most-populated,

45
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,940
<i>in fact, it's the most-populated
settlement in Lusaka.

46
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:09,529
<i>You are talking over a population 
of not less than 250,000 people.

47
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:12,895
<i>And if you look at 
the challenges of sanitation

48
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:16,685
<i>in Kanyama itself, it's huge.

49
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:20,804
The water pit is,
we dig a shallow, a shallow pit,

50
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:22,293
and it gets full quickly,

51
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:26,524
and in the past we would cover it up
and dig another one,

52
00:03:26,783 --> 00:03:28,939
it would get full really quickly, 
and that would be the trend.

53
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:35,466
Another problem that we face 
is when the rainy season comes,

54
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:38,346
the pits easily fill up 
and that are flowing,

55
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:39,716
and flows to the street,

56
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:43,303
and that increases the chances 
of disease such as cholera.

57
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:04,213
<i>Lusaka Water and Sewage Company
was formed in 1988.

58
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:07,854
One of the departments which is 
of interest to everyone

59
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:09,758
is the peri-urban department.

60
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:13,189
It is the department which is 
in charge of coordinating

61
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,288
water and sanitation service provision

62
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,047
in all the peri-urban areas in Lusaka.

63
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:22,831
The Kanyama Water Trust is a 
community-based service provider,

64
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:29,301
which provides services 
on behalf of the mandated organization,

65
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,002
which is Lusaka Water and Sewage Company.

66
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:37,022
<i>We are actively involved in the services 
of supplying water to the community.

67
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:40,241
<i>Secondly, we are also 
involved in sanitation.

68
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:59,848
<i>The Faecal Sludge 
Management Service,

69
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:03,168
<i>of course, was an initiative of 
Lusaka Water and Sewage,

70
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:06,212
<i>in partnership with Water and Sanitation 
for the Urban Poor

71
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:09,978
<i>and the community, 
who are represented by Water Trust.

72
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,459
One thing to note is that 
we are still grappling with the challenge

73
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,559
of dealing with faecal sludge 
in all these peri-urban areas.

74
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,160
<i>We designed the business model
of the Faecal Sludge Management Service.

75
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,519
<i>We looked at a number of factors.

76
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,320
<i>And as much as this was a service
that we would provide,

77
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:46,839
<i>we also wanted to look at it
from the business side.

78
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,679
<i>So we looked to see how much revenue
we would generate

79
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,981
<i>from the provision of this service.

80
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:56,790
<i>And also we looked at the operation's 
cost to be made,

81
00:05:56,931 --> 00:06:00,757
<i>'cause we wanted this to be sustainable
for it to generate its own funds,

82
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,557
<i>and also be able to continue.

83
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:05,021
The way the Faecal
Sludge Management System

84
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:09,791
works is that the customer
would request for the service.

85
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:13,381
So, they will try to find out
how the service...

86
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,101
they can access the service.

87
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:18,601
So what happens is that once
a customer expresses interest,

88
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:23,072
<i>The Water Trust sends the pit diggers
to go and make an assessment.

89
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:27,102
<i>So once they assess, 
then they advise the householder

90
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:30,781
<i>of what level of service 
they can pay for.

91
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:34,132
<i>Because we have three 
levels of service that are designed.

92
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:38,422
<i>So we looked at for 12 barrels, 
for the smallest toilets.

93
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:40,911
<i>This would cost 250.

94
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,361
<i>Then for 24 barrels,

95
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,302
<i>the customer would be required 
to pay 380.

96
00:06:46,452 --> 00:06:47,702
<i>And for 32 barrels,

97
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:51,902
<i>the customer would be required
to pay 450 kwacha.

98
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,472
<i>And this is how the entire structure is.

99
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:59,902
<i>So, it's up to the customer to tell us
which amount they can afford,

100
00:07:00,092 --> 00:07:03,163
and also looking at 
the size of their toilets.

101
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,044
I came to know about the
pit emptying service

102
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:08,510
through door-to-door marketing services.

103
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:11,703
Since the first time we 
registered for this service,

104
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:12,713
up until now,

105
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:15,847
we are the only people who are 
using it to empty our pit.

106
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:36,175
<i>This is a service where
pits are emptied,

107
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:40,004
<i>and the sludge from the pits
is safely transported

108
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:41,935
<i>to the treatment facilities,

109
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:46,195
<i>where again it is treated
and safely disposed of

110
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:50,174
<i>or resold as, either as bio-fertilizer

111
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:54,621
<i>or gas that is used for energy purposes.

112
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:14,645
We started the first of its kind
in terms of service provisioners

113
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,525
of faecal sludge management.

114
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:20,035
<i>We started this service 
in February of 2013,

115
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:25,946
<i>and from February 2013,
for the three years of operation,

116
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:28,957
<i>900 pits were emptied,

117
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:34,516
<i>benefiting close to 25,000 people 
in the low-income area of Kanyama.

118
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:40,226
<i>So you can see how this 
model of service delivery

119
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:43,317
<i>is responding to the sanitation needs

120
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:46,530
<i>of people in the low-income 
areas of Zambia,

121
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:49,136
<i>and in particular, in Kanyama.

122
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:54,307
There's a big difference between
when I was emptying illegally

123
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:55,958
and now that I'm with the company.

124
00:08:55,987 --> 00:09:00,377
Because when I was emptying illegally, 
I never had tools to use,

125
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:07,248
and now with the company, 
I'm able to empty using the right tools.

126
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,849
With our methods, it's far different.

127
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,127
It's professional.

128
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,006
There's care.

129
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:16,499
Because when we go there, 
to empty toilets,

130
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,289
we open up, 
we service it off,

131
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:22,030
<i>and we are able to empty it 
up to the bottom.

132
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,950
<i>Thereafter, we make sure that actually
the site is disinfected,

133
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,030
<i>as we leave the site.

134
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:33,280
<i>So it's more professional, 
it's really covering good hygiene

135
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,438
<i>in our communities.

136
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:39,840
I was very happy with the service 
because my pit was emptied

137
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,620
to a considerable amount,

138
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,736
and the service is worth the money
that we pay for it.

139
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,531
If I want a load of sludge 
to be removed from anything,

140
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:50,971
I'll pay more.

141
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,311
And if I want less, 
I will pay less.

142
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:11,112
We know that things, for instance,

143
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:16,142
that are making the model to be
not fully financially viable.

144
00:10:16,472 --> 00:10:19,541
So, our priorities as of now, as WSUP,

145
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:25,993
is to see how this current model 
can be improved so that it can become

146
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:27,672
more financially viable.

147
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:30,773
Because when it does so, 
then we can be able to,

148
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:33,593
together with Lusaka Water,

149
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:38,742
be able to recommend it for a scale-up
to other low-income communities.

150
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:41,283
This has really made our lives easy,

151
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:44,633
because we had a really big problem
and now, with the pit empty,

152
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,303
we have the services which are available.

<i>This module provided 
some insight into the daily life

154
00:11:01,414 --> 00:11:05,874
<i>of sanitation service delivery
in peri-urban areas in Lusaka, Zambia.

155
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:09,024
<i>There are a number of key takeaways 
from this case study.

156
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:12,925
<i>Firstly, delegated management can help
to bring adapted services,

157
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:15,695
<i>even to unplanned peri-urban areas.

158
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:19,985
<i>Secondly, an underlying business model 
to assure financial sustainability

159
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:23,402
<i>is key for any successful 
sanitation system.

160
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:28,766
<i>Revenue streams can come from customers,
taxes, or other forms of subsidies.

161
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:32,775
<i>And service has to be adapted 
to the local conditions to be successful.

162
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:36,726
<i>Thirdly, the complete sanitation chain 
has to be considered,

163
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,270
<i>from improving the toilets 
for easier emptying,

164
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,670
<i>to transport, treatment, 
and safe reuse and disposal.

165
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,710
<i>There are many elements to this case study

166
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,031
<i>that could not be portrayed 
in full length due to time constraints.

167
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,888
<i>If you would like to learn more,

168
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:53,501
<i>we recommend that you go 
to the WSUP homepage,

169
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,470
<i>where you'll find many resources
about this project.

170
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,480
<i>Thanks for your attention.
