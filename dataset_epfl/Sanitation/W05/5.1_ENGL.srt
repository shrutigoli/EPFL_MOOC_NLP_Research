00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:05,588
Welcome to our last week

2
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:08,671
of the Planning and Design
for Sanitation course.

3
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:10,210
Congratulations!

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,615
You've made it to the end
of an intensive five weeks

5
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:16,359
and have hopefully learned
a lot about the challenges

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,668
and some possible solutions
to urban sanitation.

7
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:23,092
Let's do a quick review
of the past few weeks.

8
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:26,845
In Week 1, we started off with an overview

9
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:29,999
of the multi-level challenges
of urban sanitation

10
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,489
and presented two planning approaches.

11
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:37,139
In Week 2, we introduced
some fundamental concepts

12
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:41,668
of environmental sanitation,
the different waste and resource products,

13
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:44,055
the sanitation value chain,

14
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:47,637
the five functional groups
that make up the sanitation system,

15
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:50,668
and we explained
the sanitation technologies

16
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:54,627
for the user interface, collection,
and storage and transport.

17
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:59,443
In Week 3, we introduced
different sanitation systems

18
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:02,478
from the simple single pit system

19
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:05,181
to the centralized treatment systems.

20
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,272
We also learned about
the more sophisticated

21
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:09,869
treatment technologies,

22
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,431
as well as possibilities
for the use of end products.

23
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,496
After these two weeks,

24
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,879
you should have gained
a better understanding

25
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,776
of the different systems
and technologies that are available

26
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:21,911
and feasable in urban settings.

27
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:26,313
Week 4 brought you
three different case studies

28
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:29,900
at different scales,
from the small town Nepali example

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,215
to the urban neighborhood example
from Erdos, China.

30
00:01:33,222 --> 00:01:37,171
And finally, the successful sanitation
sector development program

31
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:41,932
in Indonesia that has managed
to scale up to a nationally anchored

32
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:45,563
and funded program,
using realistic and funded

33
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,625
city sanitation plans.

34
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,951
We've highlighted
the different urban contexts

35
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:53,865
from the planned city areas
to the peri-urban interface

36
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:56,296
and presented two planning frameworks,

37
00:01:56,296 --> 00:02:00,085
which seek to structure
and guide sanitation planning

38
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,642
and programming at city-wide level.

39
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:07,702
Firstly, Sanitation 21,
dealing with the entire city

40
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:11,458
and at the neighborhood
and community level through CLUES.

41
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:15,727
We highlighted the importance
of creating or working

42
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:18,046
towards an enabling environment

43
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:21,782
regarding institutions, finance,
and legal issues.

44
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:25,464
Our focus has been on affordable
and context specific solutions

45
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:27,474
within the sanitation value chain.

46
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:29,647
Firstly, the user interface.

47
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:33,115
The most visible and direct part
of a sanitation facility

48
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:35,720
that has a lot to do
with the functionality,

49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,463
attractiveness, and easiness to clean,

50
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:43,292
be it a dry, a source separating,
pour flush, or system flush toilet.

51
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,622
This is an area that is seeing
a lot of renewed interest

52
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:50,981
in people-centered design,
new materials, and toilet designs,

53
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:55,812
like the mobile pedestal toilet
using small container based solution,

54
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:58,361
shown on the bottom left
from Ghana.

55
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,008
Second, the storage
and containment of human waste,

56
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:05,721
from single and double pit technologies

57
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:08,595
to water-based anaerobic technologies,

58
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:12,802
like the septic tank,
or the biogas reactor.

59
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,887
Issues to be considered
are treatment efficiency,

60
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:17,658
space needed,

61
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:21,499
and the reliance on the fragmented
Mason based supply chain,

62
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:26,634
which is still the expensive main mode
of construction of onsite solutions.

63
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:31,374
Third, the conveyance
and transport of wastes.

64
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:34,584
The card game shown here,
shows some of the great variety

65
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:36,979
of motorized emptying vehicles out there

66
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:41,165
that safely collect and transport
fecal sludge to a treatment station

67
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:42,667
for further processing.

68
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:46,257
For many, if not most,
low-income country cities

69
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:48,645
this will continue to be
the modus operandi

70
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,566
in the decades to come.

71
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:52,652
Fourth, the treatment technologies,

72
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:56,499
which feature a mosaic of options

73
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,934
ranging from anaerobic, aerobic,

74
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:03,351
for liquid solid separation,
for the removal of grit and grease,

75
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:07,802
for the stabilization of sludge,
the polishing effluent, etcetera.

76
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:12,566
This is certainly the biggest gap
in the sanitation supply chain,

77
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:15,790
as most waste water
and sludge worldwide

78
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,568
still ends up untreated
in the environment.

79
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:21,154
There's a need to create more capacities

80
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:25,599
to plan, build, and run treatment plants
in a sustainable manner.

81
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,659
And lastly, the use or disposal
of treated waste.

82
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:35,160
An area of urban sanitation
that is gaining traction

83
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,541
in the recent past.

84
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,214
We have highlighted some of the examples

85
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:41,127
for the safe disposal of wastes

86
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:45,088
without harm for the environment
and value added safe use

87
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:49,729
of process sanitation products
for irrigation, fertilizer,

88
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:53,226
soil conditioner, or energy generation.

89
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,661
And finally, we have introduced
the universal theme

90
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:59,279
and guiding concept
of the enabling environments.

91
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:03,041
Governments need to create
an enabling environment

92
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,135
for everyone to have access
to improve sanitation.

93
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:10,387
The enabling environment includes
government support,

94
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:12,727
the legal framework,

95
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:14,869
institutional arrangements,

96
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:16,775
skills and capacities,

97
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:18,962
financial arrangements,

98
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:23,639
and, last but not least,
the socio-cultural acceptance.

99
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:28,285
We have also highlighted
that the absence of skills, capacities,

100
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,402
and the appropriate institutions

101
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:34,783
can severely hamper the proper
planning and implementation,

102
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:38,560
particularly in low-income,
urban settings.

103
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,252
At the end of this course,
I would like to thank

104
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:45,188
our guest lecturers,
Jonathan Parkinson and Isabel Blackett.

105
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:48,212
And our colleagues at Eawag Sandec

106
00:05:48,212 --> 00:05:50,347
who've been constantly working
behind the scene

107
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:52,225
to make this course run smoothly.

108
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:56,680
Thanks to Fabian Suter, Lea Zaretti,
and Daniel Kroiss.

109
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,577
Our thanks also goes to the
EPFL MOOC team,

110
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:05,354
Gwenael Bocquet, Patrick Jermann,
Nicolas Peslerbe, and Jeremy Riedar

111
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:08,580
of the Center for Digital Education,

112
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,986
who've provided tremendous support
in putting this course together.

113
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:15,752
The next course,
in our WASH series in 2015

114
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:19,257
will be on solid waste management
in developing countries

115
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:22,954
and this will be directed
by my colleague, Dr. Christian Zurbruegg.

116
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:24,204
Thanks a lot.

117
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:25,659
I hope you enjoyed our course

118
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:28,416
and I look forward
to hearing from you again.

119
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,455
Bye bye.
