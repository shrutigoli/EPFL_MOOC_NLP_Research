1
00:00:04,156 --> 00:00:08,061
In this first week of the course,
we've learned about some main challenges

2
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:11,341
in urban sanitation, 
and provided an introduction

3
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:14,384
to two distinct, but similar, 
planning frameworks.

4
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,652
Both approaches recognize 
the complex institutional realities

5
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,020
of urban areas,
bringing together

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,333
the different stakeholders
at different levels.

7
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:27,489
At the household domain,
the importance

8
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:33,730
of households, individual households,
for the choice of sanitation technology.

9
00:00:34,832 --> 00:00:36,690
At the neighborhood level,

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,794
the importance 
of the different actors

11
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:42,665
involved in providing 
affordable sanitation services.

12
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:49,302
At the municipal or citywide domain,
the different actors

13
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:52,418
providing citywide services.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,617
And, finally, at the regional,
or watershed domain,

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,053
the actors involved in dealing with
issues that impact

16
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:04,769
environments beyond the city level.

17
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:09,971
In this week, we've talked about 
two urban sanitation planning frameworks:

18
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:13,307
Sanitation 21, introduced 
by Jonathan Parkinson,

19
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:17,609
and the CLUES community-led
urban environmental sanitation

20
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:23,287
planning approach, developed 
by [Eawag] with UN-HABITAT and WSCC.

21
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:27,581
Sanitation 21 provides 
five planning stages.

22
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:33,362
First, defining the institutional 
commitment for service delivery.

23
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:37,802
Second, understanding 
the existing context and capacities.

24
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:41,316
The third stage assesses 
different strategies

25
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:44,342
for the system improvement
and the costs that these imply.

26
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:49,147
The fourth stage then formulates
the management arrangements

27
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:51,137
and cost recovery mechanisms.

28
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:56,802
Lastly, how to prepare for implementation,
including institutional agreements

29
00:01:57,112 --> 00:01:58,867
and planned dissemination.

30
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:03,015
We've pointed out the importance
of financial comparison

31
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:05,204
of options in Sanitation 21,

32
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:09,999
and the financial data that needs 
to be brought together

33
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:14,215
in terms of capital investment,
operation and routine maintenance,

34
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:18,708
and capital maintenance
to conduct a proper financial analysis

35
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:23,797
and life cycle assessment
for the selection of affordable solutions.

36
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:27,776
CLUES, at the local level,
has seven planning steps,

37
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:31,601
beginning with process ignition,
and triggering of the community,

38
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:35,111
and ending with step seven,
implementation of improved services.

39
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:39,836
We've also pointed out the importance
of stakeholder participation

40
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:42,344
in the CLUES approach,

41
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,631
bringing together 
the different stakeholders

42
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:49,172
during the different steps 
of a planning process.

43
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:53,586
We've shown the importance 
of enabling environments.

44
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:58,039
The government support needed,
the existing legal

45
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,959
and regulatory frameworks,
the institutional arrangements

46
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,392
between different actors
at different levels,

47
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:09,782
the skills and capacities needed,
the financial arrangements,

48
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:14,466
including issues like 
microfinance tools and vehicles,

49
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:21,120
and, finally, the socio-cultural 
acceptance of different solutions sought.

50
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:25,510
We will now ask you to wrap
your heads around a first exercise

51
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,954
on contextualizing urban sanitation.

52
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:33,713
We'll provide you with a typical image
of a poor, [informal settlement]

53
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,624
in West Africa and ask you 
to answer three questions.

54
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:38,969
Good luck.
