00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:08,397
In this module, and the next one,
I will present the main elements

2
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:10,807
and structure of the CLUES approach.

3
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:15,261
The CLUES guidelines shown here
were published in 2011,

4
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,837
together with the Collaborative 
Council in Geneva

5
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,608
and UN-HABITAT in Nairobi.

6
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:22,752
They are available for download
from different sites.

7
00:00:23,172 --> 00:00:26,713
Check out the resource section 
of our course [area] site.

8
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:31,981
At its core, CLUES is a pretty 
straightforward planning process

9
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:36,436
that involves seven distinct steps 
and three cross-cutting issues.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,278
Let's take a look first 
at the seven planning steps.

11
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:45,348
In the following, I will shortly go 
through the six planning steps of CLUES.

12
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:48,765
Step one begins with process ignition
and demand creation.

13
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:53,937
This is where the community is mobilized
and demand is created

14
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:56,499
through a set of different tools.

15
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,896
Step two is the official launch
of the planning process,

16
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:03,161
usually in a bigger workshop.

17
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:07,981
Step three entails the detailed assessment
of the current situation,

18
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:12,007
usually put together in a report.

19
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:16,647
Step four, the prioritization
of the community problems

20
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,201
and validation.

21
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,953
This can be done 
in either focus group discussions

22
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:24,360
or in a series of workshops,

23
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:30,795
followed then by step five,
the identification of service options.

24
00:01:31,495 --> 00:01:38,735
This includes issues like costs,
cost recovery, but also technical options

25
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:43,506
and socio-economic 
and sociocultural issues.

26
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:47,464
This can be done in usually 
one or two workshops

27
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:51,792
that pulls together both experts
and community representatives.

28
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:56,223
Step six includes the development
of an action plan,

29
00:01:56,863 --> 00:02:00,873
the action plan also put together
in a report format.

30
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:06,575
And then, finally, step seven, 
which follows after the six planning steps:

31
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:09,679
the implementation of the action plan.

32
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,672
This can be kicked off, for example,
with a final workshop.

33
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:17,840
There are also three cross-cutting tasks.

34
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,933
The first one, and important one,
exposure and communication.

35
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:27,625
This is the constant exposure
of the community

36
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:32,708
and its representatives
to examples of good practice,

37
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:36,761
to other facilities and pilots
that have been built.

38
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:42,001
Capacity development.
The training and development

39
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:46,582
of skills at all levels,
not only at a community level,

40
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,509
but also a local authority level.

41
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:53,546
And then, lastly, the monitoring
and evaluation of the plan

42
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:56,747
and the assessment of the progress 
of the planning approach.

43
00:02:57,605 --> 00:03:01,716
This is separate 
from the monitoring evaluation

44
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:05,296
of the implementation, which needs
its own monitoring plan.

45
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,299
A key concern of CLUES
is about clarifying the roles

46
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:13,192
and responsibilities
of the different stakeholders involved.

47
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:18,656
In most countries, this means 
a mix of civic, or .org,

48
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:26,043
public, .gov, and private, .com--
stakeholders that all have a role to play

49
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:30,482
and need for better arrangements
for effective service delivery.

50
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:33,498
In the case shown here, this could be

51
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:38,556
NGO, or CBOs involved,

52
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:45,264
.gov, a utility working at citywide scale,

53
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:50,004
and lastly, .com, the private sector,

54
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:54,206
which also has an important role to play
in service delivery.

55
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,600
CLUES is not a theoretical approach.

56
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,857
It's been successfully tested
in quite a number of countries,

57
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:06,150
and claim to be the only
generic planning framework

58
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,386
that has delivered in urban 
and peri-urban communities.

59
00:04:10,423 --> 00:04:13,116
In the next presentation, 
we are going to explain

60
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:16,189
the seven planning steps,
and provide some examples

61
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,077
in how it's been done in Asia and Africa.
