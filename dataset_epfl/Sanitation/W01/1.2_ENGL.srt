00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:07,178
Hi, my name is Jonathan Parkinson

2
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:09,313
I'm a civil and environmental engineer

3
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:12,239
with 20 years of consulting
and research experience

4
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:14,875
working on international
development projects

5
00:00:15,594 --> 00:00:17,575
focusing on urban sanitation.

6
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:22,292
This module focuses
on city sanitation planning,

7
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:24,908
which is a key part
to the development process

8
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,591
for city authorities
to make strategic decisions

9
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:30,826
about where their priorities lie,

10
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:34,017
what approaches are most appropriate
for that context,

11
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:37,169
and how best to ensure
that limited resources

12
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:39,381
are most efficiently utilized.

13
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:43,131
This module provides an instruction
to urban sanitation planning,

14
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:46,000
which firstly aims to promote
an understanding

15
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:50,523
of the existing sanitation situation
in cities in the developing world,

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,726
and secondly, to gain an appreciation
of the limitations

17
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:57,684
of conventional approaches
towards the design of projects

18
00:00:57,885 --> 00:00:59,762
to improve urban sanitation.

19
00:01:01,023 --> 00:01:01,723
First of all,

20
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:05,026
I'd like to draw our attention
to the existing reality in cities

21
00:01:05,026 --> 00:01:05,976
in the developing world.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,808
As a result of this,

23
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:11,001
city sanitation planning
is not an easy task.

24
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:14,365
As I'm sure many of you well know 
from your own experience,

25
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:18,138
cities in the developing world are both 
complex and chaotic.

26
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:21,543
A lot of this is due to the fact that 
growth of cities

27
00:01:21,824 --> 00:01:23,273
is unplanned in the first place.

28
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,085
How is it possible 
to plan for improvement

29
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,536
for one specific municipal service
such as sanitation,

30
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:33,724
when the city as a whole is growing 
in such an unpredictable manner?

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,043
And in addition,

32
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:39,281
there are frequently high levels 
of poverty and social inequality,

33
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:42,236
which means that 
there are many competing demands

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,624
for investments and improvements.

35
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:48,315
These competing demands 
combined with a lack of resources

36
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:52,784
means that sanitation frequently is not
a high political priority,

37
00:01:53,106 --> 00:01:56,370
even though we know that 
to improve sanitation

38
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,191
can result in improvements
to public health

39
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:03,254
promoting social development, 
enhancing the attractiveness of cities,

40
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:07,028
and all this combined together 
to strengthen the economy.

41
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,556
In this slide, 
and the following two slides,

42
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:14,320
we can see the scale of urbanization.

43
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:20,633
Here we can see 
the urban population distribution in 1970.

44
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,265
Over the past half a decade,

45
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:26,821
as a result of 
unplanned and uncontrolled growth,

46
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:32,269
many cities have been characterized 
by a large proportion of population

47
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:35,836
living in informal settlements,
some of which, are illegal.

48
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:41,851
Here we see the projection 
for the urban population in 2025.

49
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:45,089
Municipal authorities 
struggle to deal with

50
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:47,824
the infrastructure and service
delivery needs,

51
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:52,763
and the level of growth 
makes it very difficult to retrofit,

52
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:55,272
and urban planning for settlements,

53
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:58,446
which are already established 
and developed in such a chaotic manner,

54
00:02:58,446 --> 00:02:59,650
is very challenging.

55
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,458
Official statistics 
show steady improvements

56
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:07,016
in sanitation coverage
over the past 25 years.

57
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:11,623
In this slide, 
we can see the urban sanitation coverage

58
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:14,290
in the different regions in the world,

59
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,339
focusing particularly 
on developing countries.

60
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:22,396
According to the statistics 
from UNICEF and WHO in 2011,

61
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:29,451
the average access to improve sanitation 
throughout developing countries is 74%.

62
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:35,036
In Latin America, 
the statistics are as high as 87%,

63
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:38,450
and South-East Asia, 81%.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,372
In Southern Asia, 
the value is a lot lower, 64%,

65
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:48,674
and in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 42%.

66
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:53,623
But we need to consider that 
the overall population in Southern Asia

67
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:56,222
is much higher, and therefore,
in absolute terms,

68
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:59,302
the number of people 
without access to improved sanitation

69
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:01,482
in Southern Asia is greatest.

70
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:07,622
We can also see the level of sharing 
of sanitation facilities,

71
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,768
which has great implications on 
the quality of sanitation in these cities.

72
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:18,968
So in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
30% of people are using shared toilets,

73
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:25,006
compared with the average of 17 
throughout the developing world.

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,422
But these statistics don't necessarily 
provide an adequate reflection

75
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:34,396
of the reality in many cities,
because they only focus on coverage.

76
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:39,442
The poor quality of sanitation facilities 
combined with the lack of servicing

77
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,698
means that a significant proportion 
of the population

78
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:45,873
are likely not to have achieved
the status of improved,

79
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:49,289
even though these statistics 
may indicate that they do.

80
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:54,106
When the lack of these systems has 
major environmental health implications,

81
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:58,711
affecting public health, productivity, 
and socio-economic development.

82
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:05,438
These statistics that we see previously, 
say very little about the arrangements

83
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,685
for waste water 
and fecal sludge management,

84
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:13,066
and many investments 
tend to focus more on construction

85
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:15,967
and rehabilitation of sewerage
and waste water treatment,

86
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,569
which overlooks the actual problem.

87
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,350
In this slide, 
showing the fecal waste flows

88
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,650
from Maputo in Mozambique,

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
we can see that,

90
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:35,241
in fact, only 24% of the waste is related 
to toilets discharging into sewerage,

91
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:41,072
whereas, a much greater proportion
is in fact related

92
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:44,797
to onsite sanitation facilities.

93
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:48,952
And here, we're talking about 
pit latrines and septic tanks.

94
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:54,882
Only recently has the extent 
of the problem started to be recognized,

95
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:57,677
and projects been designed 
to respond to this situation.

96
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:02,066
In the next few slides, 
we see examples of urban sanitation

97
00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:04,828
that are common in cities 
in the developing world.

98
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:08,480
In this photograph, 
we see a basic pit latrine

99
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:13,158
where hygienic conditions are compromised
by poor quality design and construction,

100
00:06:14,214 --> 00:06:18,630
overuse by too much sharing, 
and a lack of handwashing facilities.

101
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:23,871
Although this latrine provides 
a better sanitation than open defecation,

102
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:28,239
facilities like this are not considered 
to provide adequate sanitation.

103
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:32,255
Thinking more widely in the public domain,

104
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,525
flows of untreated black water 
from pits and tanks

105
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:38,018
flow into open channels or drains,

106
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:41,521
and this is often mixed with 
solid waste and urban runoff.

107
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:46,106
This cocktail of waste results 
in heightened disease transmission

108
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,358
in low income communities.

109
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:51,232
And then looking more widely in the city,

110
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:55,249
although more affluent households 
are likely to be able to afford

111
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:59,109
to pay for a system or service 
to collect waste water or fecal sludge,

112
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:02,829
and they can pay a private company 
to take this waste away,

113
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:06,784
this waste is often discharged, 
untreated into the environment,

114
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:08,555
due to lack of facilities.

115
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:13,826
In the previous slides, 
we saw that status of urban sanitation,

116
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:17,645
and there have been responses 
to deal with this problem,

117
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:22,301
but often that we see too much focus 
on construction of sewerage

118
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:28,587
and waste water treatment systems, 
whereas the needs and requirements

119
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:31,243
of people living in low-income communities 
are overlooked.

120
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:37,018
Conventional responses to the problem 
also tend to overlook the important role

121
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:38,912
played by the informal sector,

122
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,487
who are involved with various forms 
of sanitation service delivery,

123
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:47,838
and also, the importance of operation 
and maintenance.

124
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:51,037
The imbalance of supply and demand 
for improved services

125
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:54,233
combined with the inability 
of urban authorities

126
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:58,666
to provide sanitation services 
has resulted in a sanitation crisis

127
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,889
in many towns and cities,

128
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,614
particularly unplanned, informal, 
and low-income settlements.

129
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:06,192
In the next part of this module,

130
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,848
I will be talking about common elements 
for good sanitation planning,

131
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:13,544
focusing on delivery 
of sanitation services.

132
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,625
In the previous part of the presentation,

133
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,740
we saw how traditional responses 
to urban sanitation challenges

134
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,035
have tended to focus more upon 
solving urban sanitation problems

135
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:25,980
by the insulation of large-scale,

136
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,346
downstream infrastructure 
and sewerage systems,

137
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:33,762
and the need for more focus 
on onsite sanitation.

138
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:39,138
More recently, a new generation 
of sanitation planning has emerged,

139
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:43,464
with examples from Indonesia, 
India, and Brazil,

140
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:49,430
where three national sanitation programs 
have been initiated,

141
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,617
to develop city sanitation plans 
linked to funding and investment,

142
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:57,421
standardized planning processes,
and capacity building,

143
00:08:58,011 --> 00:08:59,209
and technical support.

144
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:01,044
Based upon these experiences,

145
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:04,989
a set of common elements 
for good sanitation planning have emerged,

146
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,738
one of these being 
responding to expectations

147
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:13,967
for sanitation service improvement,
otherwise known as demand.

148
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,049
Another one being, planning for inclusion 
and equitable sanitation services,

149
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:24,744
focusing on the needs 
of vulnerable groups and the urban poor.

150
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:31,756
A third one being, ensuring that services 
are affordable and financially viable.

151
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:36,864
There's no point making investments 
in urban infrastructure

152
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:39,797
if these systems cannot be 
maintained financially.

153
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:43,815
The fourth common element 
for good sanitation planning

154
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:46,333
is focusing on behavioral change.

155
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,027
This includes behavior at all levels,

156
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:54,211
from the household 
up to the city authorities,

157
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:58,697
change management 
down to hygiene behavior,

158
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:01,383
are all key elements 
of good sanitation planning.

159
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:06,200
And the final one, a key one, 
is engaging with stakeholders.

160
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:10,081
It's clear, therefore, 
that technology is only a means

161
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:12,403
to deliver services, 
and meet customer needs.

162
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:15,245
It's about people, and not pipes.

163
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,569
In the urban sanitation planning process,

164
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,239
there is a need to take 
onboard the interests

165
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,011
from a range of different stakeholders.

166
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:27,900
From the household domain,

167
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:35,083
to the community, and their interests,

168
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,552
up to the local authority 
or municipality,

169
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:40,764
with their interests at city level.

170
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:44,487
And above that, there will be ministries,

171
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:46,412
perhaps the ministry of the environment,

172
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:49,961
with their main interest 
on protecting and preserving

173
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:51,561
the quality of the environment.

174
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,362
What's clear is the need to focus on 
delivering sanitation services

175
00:10:55,522 --> 00:11:00,562
to customers that is acceptable, 
appropriate, and affordable.

176
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,295
Technology is a means to an end.

177
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:07,318
But it is not the way in which 
customers judge services.

178
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,127
What the technology does 
is more important.

179
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:16,830
For sustainability, service delivery 
must be customer orientated,

180
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,958
and services developed in line

181
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:21,329
with customer affordability 
and willingness to pay.

182
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:28,901
City sanitation plans must focus on 
supply meeting demand, i.e., the market.

183
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:33,154
Both suppliers and customers 
may need access to credit

184
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:36,563
to be able to make investments 
for improved sanitation.

185
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:42,757
Urban sanitation plans provide 
a set of service delivery models

186
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,061
for different parts of the city,

187
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:48,092
including elements of 
infrastructure development,

188
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,133
finance and cost recovery, 
management and regulation.

189
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:54,205
In the next presentation,

190
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:57,039
we will see how a systematic approach 
towards planning

191
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:00,628
can support the development 
of a comprehensive and equitable

192
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,157
city sanitation plan.
