00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,210
Hi. Welcome back to the second part of
the lecture in Sanitation Planning Module,

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,181
focusing on the development of strategies
for city-wide sanitation improvement.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,603
This follows on from the previous model,
which provided an introduction

4
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:23,282
to issues related to the development
of sustainable sanitation services

5
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:26,923
and the influences that these have on
urban sanitation planning.

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,401
We focus here on a more detailed
understanding of some of

7
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:34,403
the key principles of good planning,
and introduce some tools to support

8
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:38,445
the development of city-wide
sanitation plans

9
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:41,530
linking local level 
with city level initiatives.

10
00:00:42,106 --> 00:00:46,630
Sanitation21 is a document produced by 
the International Water Association

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,424
in partnership with Eawag and Giz.

12
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,023
Sanitation21 presents a framework
for city sanitation planning

13
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:56,614
based on international best practice, 
where planning has been key

14
00:00:56,614 --> 00:00:59,387
to achieving improvements in
urban sanitation.

15
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:04,937
It sets out key principles and process
guidelines to help city sanitation

16
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:07,870
stakeholders develop appropriate 
and affordable solutions to

17
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,306
sanitation problems, taking into account
technology issues,

18
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:17,781
management arrangements, institutional
challenges, and demand for improvement

19
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:19,744
from different stakeholders.

20
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:24,266
The Sanitation21 planning process 
is presented around the following

21
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:29,521
five stages: firstly, building 
institutional commitment

22
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:31,150
and partnership for planning.

23
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:37,590
Secondly, understanding the existing 
context and defining priorities.

24
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:44,954
Stage 3 involves developing strategies
for sanitation system improvement,

25
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:48,858
this focusing very much on 
the technological side.

26
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:54,464
Stage 4 involves developing models 
for service delivery, management

27
00:01:54,464 --> 00:02:00,023
arrangements, financing mechanisms.
And stage 5 involves preparing

28
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:01,080
for implementation.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,190
One of the inherent challenges
with sanitation planning and subsequent

30
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,392
implementation of city plans is that they
require a range of institutions

31
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:14,029
and organizations to work together.

32
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:19,059
Consequently, the success of sanitation
planning activity will be strongly

33
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:24,741
influenced by the extent of collaboration
between the local authorities, utilities

34
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:28,184
and other stakeholders involved 
in the provision or regulation

35
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:30,003
of sanitation services.

36
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,968
Planning is essentially about responding
to real needs and making informed

37
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:39,905
decisions about investments for sanitation
improvements, involving the prudent use

38
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:42,525
of resources to meet
recognized priorities.

39
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:49,628
Successful sanitation planning activities 
need to be based on a sound understanding

40
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:54,540
of the existing situation, and respond 
to demands for an improved sanitation

41
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,533
service at different levels.

42
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:59,922
Understanding the existing
context is critical.

43
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:02,858
In relation to technical considerations,

44
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:06,984
the following tools are recommended 
as ways to support the sanitation

45
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:08,349
planning process.

46
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,146
One of the most essential ones,
and perhaps the most basic one,

47
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:17,704
is a process of sanitation system mapping,
which simply means mapping the existing

48
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:23,428
sanitation coverage and location 
of facilities for collection and treatment

49
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:24,162
of waste.

50
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:29,724
Another tool, building on this, 
involves supply-demand analysis.

51
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:34,964
So this looks in more detail at those 
systems and assessing their capacity

52
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:38,190
in relation to the amount of waste 
that is produced.

53
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:44,014
This provides a basis for identifying
what parts of the system are overloaded

54
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,314
and what parts of the system have capacity.

55
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:53,755
Another tool is the environmental health 
risk assessment methodology.

56
00:03:54,706 --> 00:04:01,143
This looks at sanitation interventions 
and uses risk assessment to assess

57
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:08,311
which communities are most prone
to sanitation related risks, and this

58
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:11,183
can help to target investments
for these areas.

59
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:16,120
Additional tools can be used for financial
and economic analysis.

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,022
Sanitation market assessment 
is increasingly used to look at

61
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:27,979
sanitation service providers and their
services in relation to demand

62
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:32,341
from different customers, dividing 
customers into a range of different

63
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:37,920
segments and looking at how different
service providers meet their needs.

64
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:45,946
A key part of this is financial analysis,
looking at different options in relation

65
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:51,580
to the existing sanitation services, 
the cost of them, and the affordability

66
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,641
of services.

67
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:58,596
In this diagram we see the varied nature
of settlements and cities, highlighting

68
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:01,732
that there is a need for a range 
of sanitation service models

69
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:05,827
appropriate for different physical 
and socio-economic contexts.

70
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:10,841
The characteristics of low income 
settlements in informal and peri-urban

71
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:16,255
areas means that they are intrinsically
more difficult to serve, and as a result

72
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:19,907
conventional service delivery models
are often not viable.

73
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:25,939
This may be due to physical constraints,
such as low-lying ground, steep slopes,

74
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:32,024
or densely packed housing with very poor 
access via narrow and irregular pathways.

75
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:38,489
In addition, there are frequently social
issues compounded by poverty, which means

76
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:41,582
that working in these areas requires a 
different approach from other parts

77
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:42,577
of the city.

78
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:47,542
These areas are frequently left out of the
mainstream planning process and are likely

79
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:51,279
to be areas where there is a specific need
to work more closely with local

80
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,192
communities to develop sanitation 
solutions appropriate and affordable

81
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:57,173
to their needs.

82
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:01,436
We will focus more closely on the 
community-led urban environmental

83
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:05,253
sanitation approach in the next module
which is designed specifically

84
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:06,223
for this purpose.

85
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:12,976
In cities throughout the developing world,
due to the unplanned growth,

86
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:15,662
space is often at a premium.

87
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:20,378
Existing sites for waste disposal 
are already heavily overloaded

88
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:25,388
and traffic congestion means that sites
for sludge disposal may be only available

89
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:26,308
at night.

90
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:32,757
Therefore the availability of space may be
a key determining factor on how

91
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:36,835
the sanitation system can be designed 
for a particular city.

92
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:41,699
And indeed, no one type of technology
will be appropriate for all areas of the

93
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,989
city, and the outcome from the 
application of the Sanitation21

94
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:50,734
planning approach is likely to lead toward
recommendations that on-site sanitation

95
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:55,906
is appropriate for some areas, whereas
decentralized, semi-centralized,

96
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:59,871
or centralized sewage 
will be appropriate for other areas.

97
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:06,829
A financial comparison of different 
technologies is a very important part

98
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:08,280
of the planning process.

99
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:12,977
If we consider different types of 
sanitation system, each one will have

100
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:18,001
different capital investment requirements,
different cost for operation and routine

101
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:25,489
maintenance, and other costs associated 
with capital maintenance which is involved

102
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:28,920
with larger scale refurbishment costs.

103
00:07:29,671 --> 00:07:34,910
If we feed in this information to a 
financial analysis on a life cycle

104
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:40,453
assessment we can compare these
different options and this as well as

105
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:45,016
some of the other aspects such as 
availability of land may be the key

106
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:49,593
factors which determine what sanitation
system is most appropriate in different

107
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:50,622
situations.

108
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:57,348
The financial comparison can identify the 
most cost effective solution and we can

109
00:07:57,348 --> 00:08:02,889
use this analysis to identify affordable
solutions for different communities.

110
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:07,062
And also, it may highlight a need 
for subsidy.

111
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:12,798
Sources of funding for capital investments
can come from many sides.

112
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,993
National and provincial funding is one 
source, often supported by

113
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:21,690
international finance, development banks,
development agencies, and international

114
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,005
NGOs.

115
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,077
This funding can also be used to support 
municipal development budgets.

116
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:34,724
In addition to this, for the local level 
service provision and for household

117
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:40,226
facilities we also need to take into
consideration the funding from private

118
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:43,845
sector and from households and 
communities themselves.

119
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:48,660
Each of these different service 
arrangements can utilize a different

120
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,399
management option.

121
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:57,055
At the household level small-scale service
providers may be the most appropriate

122
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,586
option for de-sludging pits and taking
waste away.

123
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:07,982
But at the neighborhood level, private 
companies, CBOs and NGOs may be involved

124
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:12,310
in different ways in providing services 
and also collecting money

125
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,966
and regulating the service providers; 
whereas at the city level utility,

126
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:20,287
public or private or a delegated 
management arrangement

127
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:24,189
to a private company may be considered
to be the best option.

128
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:29,565
In all of these levels often
the interrelationships between

129
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:35,545
these service providers is what's critical
for maintaining and sustaining

130
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:37,935
adequate level of sanitation.

131
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:41,573
There is usually only one way in which
a system and its associated management

132
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:45,242
arrangement will work, but unfortunately
there are many ways in which it

133
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:46,551
may go wrong.

134
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:49,751
Therefore, in the planning process
we need to consider

135
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:54,239
some of the broader social, political
and economic processes.

136
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:58,079
Here we see a diagram of the enabling
environment which shows

137
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,630
the various facets that determine the nature
of sanitation investment and sanitation

138
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,341
service provision.

139
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,182
The city sanitation planning process is 
very much influenced by national policy

140
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:14,805
and strategy, but it also has a strong
interface as we've seen with local level

141
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,328
planning activities.

142
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:20,112
Some of the city
sanitation planning will result in

143
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:25,243
proposals for municipal infrastructure 
which can go directly towards proposals

144
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:30,782
for design and construction,
implementation of larger scale systems.

145
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:36,090
But clearly we see a need for local level
planning, where there is a need to engage

146
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,800
with communities and design systems which 
are most appropriate for their needs.

147
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:45,982
In the next module my colleague 
[Christoff Luty] will focus closely

148
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:49,973
on the local level planning part of the
sanitation planning process.

149
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:52,611
I thank you very much for your attention.
