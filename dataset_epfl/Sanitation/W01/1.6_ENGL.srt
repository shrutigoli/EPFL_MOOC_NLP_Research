1
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:08,392
This last module on local level planning
will introduce you to the basic

2
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:11,322
planning steps to the CLUES approach.

3
00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:14,432
The seven steps are fairly straightforward
planning steps

4
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:17,803
that reflect common sense in planning
for the unplanned areas,

5
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:20,880
taking into account
multi-stakeholder setups

6
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:23,749
and weak institutional settings.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,261
At the same time,
the generic planning steps

8
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:30,728
are flexible, and allow adaptation
and alteration

9
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:34,494
according to the individual settings.

10
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:38,436
The seven planning steps
are accompanied by 30 tools.

11
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:44,245
The 30 tools help the individuals
planning for the seven steps

12
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:49,611
and allow adaptation
to individual contexts.

13
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:52,405
Let's look at the seven steps in detail.

14
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:57,143
Step One begins with process ignition
and demand creation.

15
00:00:57,144 --> 00:01:00,879
This is all about igniting
the community planning process,

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,018
sensitizing the community
about environmental sanitation

17
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:11,074
and hygiene issues, creating good momentum
and a basis for community participation,

18
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:18,742
conducting a first community meeting
and reaching an agreement on joint action

19
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:22,413
and then finally creating
a community task force

20
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:27,182
which can carry forward the planning
process and act as an interface

21
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:30,046
between the community
and other stakeholders.

22
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:34,523
A nice example is shown here,
from Nala in Nepal,

23
00:01:34,524 --> 00:01:37,987
where the entire community
was brought together during

24
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:41,706
a one day sanitation exhibition,
or sanitation bazaar,

25
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:46,947
carried out here in 2009.
Also involved: national NGOs,

26
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:50,237
local initiatives,
community based organizations

27
00:01:50,238 --> 00:01:55,187
working in the areas
of wash, water, sanitation and hygiene.

28
00:01:55,987 --> 00:02:00,034
Step Two is about launching
the planning process.

29
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:03,861
This is the initial planning
and consultative workshop

30
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:09,538
where a common understanding about
the complexity of environmental sanitation

31
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,646
in the intervention area is developed.
This is usually done by conducting

32
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:19,829
a launching workshop that
is inclusive, well-structured

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,953
and creates public attention.
The outcomes of this workshop

34
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:28,224
are usually a protocol agreement,
agreement on which areas should

35
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:32,941
be planned for, and an agreement on
the overall planning methodology

36
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:34,909
and process.

37
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,668
Again, an example from Nala, Nepal,
where the entire community was invited

38
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:42,542
for the launch of the planning.

39
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:46,472
Step Three is then about
a detailed assessment

40
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:49,773
of the current status.
The assessment is done

41
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:53,008
in a participatory way
and includes both external

42
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:59,491
as well as internal community knowledge.
Here, understanding is developed

43
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:03,829
about the physical and social economic
environment of the intervention area.

44
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,975
Step Three involves community
and other key stakeholders

45
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:12,541
to gather and assess information.
The main output could include

46
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:18,411
stakeholder mapping, baseline data
from an interview, or thorough assessment

47
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:22,661
of the enabling environment
and current levels of service provision.

48
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:26,740
The outcomes of Step Three
are then gathered and summarized

49
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:32,359
in an assessment report.
A number of tools can be used,

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,977
from spatial maps, GIS maps, interviews,
to focus group discussions.

51
00:03:39,747 --> 00:03:44,064
Prioritization and validation
is the Fourth Step.

52
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:50,600
This is all about reporting the outcomes
from Step Three of the assessment report

53
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:55,712
to the community and revising
the findings of the assessment.

54
00:03:55,713 --> 00:04:01,977
And secondly, it's also about deciding
which services should be given priority.

55
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:07,019
This is usually done in a community
workshop to validate the priorities.

56
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,098
In some areas, this may be
storm water drainage

57
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,893
in others, the bad state
of environmental sanitation

58
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:20,100
and fecal sludge management
and in a third it may be the bad

59
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:23,532
or deficient water provision in an area.

60
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:28,382
Priority workshops don't necessarily need
to be carried out at a central location

61
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:35,094
they can be done in a subward
or street location like the one shown here

62
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:39,336
where people from a given area
of the neighborhood

63
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:42,517
come together to discuss the priorities.

64
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:47,347
Step Five is then building
on Steps Three and Four

65
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:51,035
and identifying the service options.

66
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:54,673
This is about identifying
environmental sanitation options

67
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:57,689
that are feasible
for the intervention area

68
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,566
and based on an informed
choice approach.

69
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:05,097
This includes issues
like technical feasibility,

70
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:09,396
and institutional, financial
and social implications.

71
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:14,960
The main outcome: an agreement on one
or two environmental sanitation systems

72
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:18,287
that should be studied in greater detail.

73
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:22,939
The agreement is reached by the community
together with local authority or utility.

74
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,555
Step Five is usually done
in a set of workshops.

75
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:29,691
This can be an expert workshop,

76
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:33,927
for example, the one shown here
on the right, from Vientiane in Laos,

77
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:39,453
where different feasible
sanitation solutions are being discussed.

78
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:44,290
Or it can also be done together
with communities at a larger scale.

79
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:48,030
This of course needs a bit more
time and preparation.

80
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:51,737
The compendium of sanitation systems
and technologies on the left

81
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:56,709
is a guiding document
that helps structure this planning step.

82
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,877
Important is the issue of affordability
of the options, especially

83
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:06,211
the capital expenditure or CAPEX.
On the table here,

84
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:10,720
we see the affordability
of different toilets in East Africa.

85
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:15,809
Four different income segments,
starting with the cheapest option,

86
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,830
the improvement of existing pit latrines
for example, the adding of a new door

87
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:26,611
that can be locked or the addition
of a concrete or plastic slab.

88
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:31,057
This usually costs around $90 to $100.

89
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:36,111
Next up the cost ladder
is a shared VIP latrine

90
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:39,339
with a stone superstructure
and a concrete slab shared

91
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:46,371
by two households, anything between $200
and $250 depending on country and location

92
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:52,195
And then, further up the ladder,
the private VIP latrine,

93
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:57,157
privately owned by one household
with stone superstructure and lined pit.

94
00:06:57,158 --> 00:07:03,044
This will cost anywhere between $400
and $500 for the East African region.

95
00:07:03,045 --> 00:07:07,218
And then, the last
and most expensive option,

96
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:12,297
the household pour flush toilet that
is connected to a simplified sewer network

97
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:16,471
starting at around $500 upwards.

98
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:21,092
These kind of prices and costs
should be compared

99
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:26,212
and also discussed with experts
as well as with the community.

100
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:30,933
Finally, Step Six is the development
of an action plan.

101
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:36,049
Here, a realistic and implementable
action plan is produced.

102
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,467
The main output is an action plan
that is costed and funded,

103
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:47,002
timed, and allows output based targets.
Very important, every action plan

104
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:52,768
for a given area must include operation
and maintenance management plan

105
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:56,504
to ensure the correct functioning
and sustainability

106
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:59,904
of the sanitation system and services.

107
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:04,991
Here the example of the plan
for Nala from 2011.

108
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:10,176
And then finally the implementation
of the action plan.

109
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:17,491
This includes incremental implementation
steps for different given situations.

110
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:21,662
On the left, the example
from Curridabat in Costa Rica

111
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:26,306
shows storm water drainage being put into
a low-income community in Curridabat.

112
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:30,950
In the middle, the connection
of pour flush toilets

113
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:35,470
to a communal septic tank,
and on the right the construction

114
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:41,611
of school toilets for primary school
in a low income area of Dodoma, Tanzania.

115
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:48,619
A key output of Step Seven
can be the production of catalogs

116
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,919
that offer choice and options
for different price ranges

117
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,060
and are combined with micro credit
or revolving funds for sanitation.

118
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:01,923
These have been shown to work well
in a number of countries around the world

119
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:07,012
and come up with doable
and implementable solutions.

120
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:12,858
So far CLUES has been tested and validated
or is being validated,

121
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:17,854
in a number of countries around the world,
in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

122
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:22,760
Summing up the main
CLUES advantages:

123
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:27,052
CLUES offers flexibility
and steps and tools

124
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:32,122
that can be tailored to a particular
local culture and capacity level.

125
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:36,155
It is a demand-led approach
that underlines the importance

126
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:40,387
of community demand for the project.
But, the community priorities

127
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:44,454
are established and responded to
during the process itself.

128
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:48,795
And third, CLUES takes
community participation seriously

129
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,593
and the community is significantly
involved in decision making and has

130
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:57,206
a high degree of control over
project outcomes and design decisions.

131
00:09:57,282 --> 00:10:02,394
Technology choice. CLUES provides
guidance in decision making

132
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:05,860
regarding waste water management
and sanitation facilities.

133
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:12,445
O & M implications are also important.
It incorporates operation and maintenance

134
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:19,346
considerations and the long-term costs
for operating new facilities and services.

135
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:24,935
And then finally, communication,
the importance of culturally appropriate

136
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:29,638
forms of communication between
community process leaders,

137
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,727
local government, and ensuring the
transparency of the process.

138
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:39,795
This module gave you an in-depth view
of the CLUES planning steps.

139
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:44,796
We will be featuring an applied case study
from Nepal in Week Four of this course

140
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:48,860
to show you how CLUES was used
in a small town context.

141
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:53,120
Thanks for listening and we look forward
to hearing from you next week.
