00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:07,391
Welcome to the first week of our 
new course on planning and design of

2
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:09,730
sanitation systems and technologies.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,957
My name is Christophe LÃ¼thi.
I am an Urban Infrastructure Planner

4
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:15,311
and I have been teaching and
and carrying out research for the

5
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:18,970
Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic
Science and Technology, in Switzerland

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,402
for the last 10 years.
In the next five weeks, we will be

7
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:26,732
exploring some of the issues and
challenges in urban sanitation.

8
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,609
What makes urban sanitation
so different from rural contexts?

9
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:36,609
Urban settings feature a number
of distinct characteristics

10
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,667
that need to be considered.

11
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:43,115
Firstly, different urban contexts 
or domains - from modern, inner-city or

12
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:47,547
planned areas, to the dense, informal
settlements and slum neighborhoods

13
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:51,423
found in most cities of 
Africa, Asia and Latin America.

14
00:00:51,423 --> 00:00:54,509
And finally, the fast
growing city periphery

15
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:57,605
also called the peri-urban interface.

16
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:03,488
These different contexts and settings
call for specific solutions when seeking

17
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,267
appropriate and sustainable services.

18
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:10,166
In this course, we will exploring urban

19
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:15,727
sanitation systems and services, and
why urban sanitation requires different

20
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:21,703
approaches, funding mechanisms
and distinct technology solutions.

21
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:26,889
Let's take a look at a typical
low-income area in an African city.

22
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:31,383
Some of the challenges found
in neighborhoods like these are

23
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,245
unsanitary environments

24
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:39,775
lack of space for sanitation facilities, 
like the toilet shown here

25
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:47,415
and informal often unhygienic toilet 
emptying, or urban open defecation.

26
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,471
So, what can be done about this situation?

27
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:56,971
In this course, we will focus on a
key concept of urban sanitation

28
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:03,104
the Sanitation Value Chain. We will
highlight the different components

29
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:06,786
and functional groups, as in 
the example shown here.

30
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:09,546
First, the user interface
or pit latrine, in red

31
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:14,705
the safe storage of human waste
in the septic tank, in orange

32
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:20,500
followed by the collection and
mechanical emptying of the sludge

33
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,833
through the yellow exhauster trucks.

34
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:33,227
The safely collected sludge is
then brought to proper treatment

35
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:36,802
in a sludge-drying bed,
shown here in green;

36
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:43,558
and finally the reuse of hygienized sludge
in urban agriculture, shown in blue.

37
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:51,829
The Value Chain allows for a realistic
assessment of a range of sanitation

38
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:57,609
options and solutions, and its
technical and managerial implications.

39
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:02,811
Our five-week course will be examining
the issues around the planning and design

40
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:05,772
of appropriate sanitation
systems and technologies

41
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,958
proper management arrangements and the
and the financial implications involved.

42
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:17,461
The Sanitation Value Chain shown
here will be our guiding concept.

43
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,667
Let's take a look at the learning goals.

44
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,991
Firstly, we'd like you to get familiar
with urban sanitation planning tools

45
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:27,671
and approaches, and be able
to analyze case studies

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,960
and discuss advantages and disadvantages.

47
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:35,708
Secondly, we'd like you to know the
existing options of sanitation systems

48
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:41,108
and technologies, and be able to design a
technical project and analyze proposals.

49
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:46,178
And lastly, we'd like you to understand
which systems and technologies

50
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:49,570
are most appropriate
in different contexts.

51
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:57,120
We'll be looking at different systems
and technologies, the institutions,

52
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,989
and stakeholders that need to be involved.

53
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:03,859
We'll also be presenting
different projects and case studies

54
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:08,429
which exemplify different
approaches of urban sanitation.

55
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:12,936
And, we'll also be looking at
planning frameworks

56
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:17,816
and approaches, and the design of 
sanitation systems in different contexts.

57
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,490
This gives you an
overview of the course contents.

58
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:25,352
In Week One, we will be 
dealing with city sanitation

59
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:28,414
and looking at a number of
planning frameworks

60
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:33,722
for example: Sanitation 21, by the
International Water Association.

61
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:38,419
In Week Two, we'll be dealing
with different sanitation products

62
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,389
the five functional groups
of the sanitation chain

63
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:44,935
and give you an introduction 
to different technologies.

64
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:51,513
In Week Three, we'll be dealing with
sanitation systems, the second part of

65
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:56,813
technologies, especially those dealing
with treatment and use or disposal.

66
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:04,777
In Week Four, we have three case studies
prepared from China, Indonesia and Nepal.

67
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:11,318
In Week Five, the last week, we will
prepare a talk show with a Q&A session

68
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:16,895
answering some of the questions that come
up during the course of these five weeks.

69
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:22,023
And then finally, wrap up and the
final exam, where you'll be able to

70
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:26,246
evaluate what what you've 
learned in the past five weeks.

71
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:29,221
Here we list the required
reading for this course.

72
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:32,717
Firstly, the "Compendium of
Sanitation Systems and Technologies"

73
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:36,887
this is available in English,
in French and in Spanish.

74
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:42,441
Secondly, "Sanitation 21 - An Integrated
Planning Approach for City Sanitation"

75
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:45,681
available only in English; and lastly,

76
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:49,800
"CLUES - Community-led Urban Environmental 
Sanitation Planning Framework"

77
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,495
available in English and Spanish.

78
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:57,912
All three documents are available
for download from this website.

79
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:01,581
On behalf of my team, I'm looking
forward to the course, and to hearing

80
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:03,903
your contributions in the forum.

81
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:08,110
Let's start the course now, with the first
module, about City Sanitation Planning

82
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,250
by Jonathan Parkinson.

83
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,680
Enjoy.
