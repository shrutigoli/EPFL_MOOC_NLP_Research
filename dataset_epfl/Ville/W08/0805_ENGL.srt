00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,544
In this very short video,
we will see an important aspect

2
00:00:07,544 --> 00:00:09,800
of housing development.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,544
It's the balance between
real estate and land

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,210
in free-market economies.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,924
As we said, there is a balance

6
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:19,678
between the cost of land
and real estate investment.

7
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:22,082
What is the cost of land?

8
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:26,008
It's first and foremost
the price of the plot.

9
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:31,660
Plus the land development,

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,082
land clearing,

11
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:40,952
making a plan,

12
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:46,321
network costs,

13
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:51,105
and finally equipment costs

14
00:00:51,105 --> 00:00:53,275
if they are assigned to the cost of land,

15
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:54,670
which is not always the case,

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,570
sometimes, the equipment is not included.

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,830
Next come real estate investments.

18
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,080
What are they?

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,340
They are any buildings on the land.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,062
If we take the geometry of the plot,
or of the right to use,

21
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:18,823
it gives the building volume,

22
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:23,460
which determines the possible
real estate investments.

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,400
If I start from the cost of land,
I get an economical interest in building.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,194
We can play with the different factors,

25
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,668
for example, a high cost of land

26
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:41,232
will spur to create density
in order to report the high cost

27
00:01:41,232 --> 00:01:43,910
on as many houses as possible.

28
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,909
On the other hand, if we want
to decrease the cost of land

29
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,685
we can, for example,
lower the network cost,

30
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:53,938
therefore the service provided
with the networks,

31
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:57,470
or modify the geometry of the plots.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,604
If the building volumes are too small,

33
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:04,968
we will try to increase them,

34
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:08,332
it's a well-know speculation:

35
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:10,533
plots are being bought

36
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,366
with low building rights,

37
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,970
then we put pressure on the government

38
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,511
to try and increase the rights

39
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:20,570
in order to have the best profitability.

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,244
These examples happen obviously

41
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,630
in a free market economy

42
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,110
where land and real estate
balance each other out.

43
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,520
In a non-market economy system,
the role of the government

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,746
is utterly important
as it may fluctuate the land prices.

45
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:40,748
Although, it cannot change
the cost of the infrastructures,

46
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:43,310
it may still be able
to vary the cost of land.

47
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,092
So the government in some countries

48
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:49,590
that have a lot of plots
may flood the market

49
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,385
in order to lower land prices
in the free market economy

50
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:58,809
or put pressure on this market
to increase land prices.

51
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:02,350
So the government leeway
on the cost of land

52
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,846
is utterly important.

53
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:11,310
This is roughly the balance issues
between land and real estate.
