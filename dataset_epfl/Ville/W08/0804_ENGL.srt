1
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:08,090
In this video we'll follow the creation,
step-by-step, of a development.

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,556
Many stages, the first of which 
is choosing a site.

3
00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:15,322
As a matter of fact, for 
the same program within a city

4
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:17,692
several possible sites will,
in general, be possible

5
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:20,128
It is thus a question of evaluating them,

6
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:23,130
to choose the best site for our program.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,253
To this end we'll have a grid of questions

8
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:29,479
which will help us, as we'll see,

9
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:32,072
to decide which site is best

10
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:34,520
for the program we are implementing.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,390
Here is our questionnaire 
and the space for its responses.

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,020
It will be easy to quickly 
eliminate certain sites.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,002
And in addition to these responses

14
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,410
is the question of building costs, 
which we'll address at the end.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,485
But it is possible to do 
a very quick evaluation

16
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:51,320
of the different costs involved 
to know what is, finally,

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,196
the most cost-effective and viable site.

18
00:00:55,576 --> 00:01:00,418
Another thing is we are speaking here
of technical choices, rational choices,

19
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:03,678
from the point of view 
of the city's manager.

20
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:06,816
We are not talking about 
political or economic questions,

21
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:08,550
which also have their importance,

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,025
and which are often even 
more important in site choice,

23
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:13,150
whether to build or not.

24
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,646
The first question: building 
according to the SDAU.

25
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:20,338
Does the master development plan
say that the land is viable for building?

26
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:22,650
We'll imagine that the answer is yes, 
otherwise we'd stop here.

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,388
A development zone: 
is it zoned for residential

28
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,848
or zoned for industrial use?

29
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:33,870
Now, let's also imagine that 
it's zoned for development,

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,473
for residential development.

31
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:37,245
Now we are in a case study.

32
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:38,710
There are cities which 
do not have a SDAU.

33
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,360
There are cities which have an SDAU, 
but don't respect it.

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,056
There are cities which do not have POS.

35
00:01:43,056 --> 00:01:46,399
There are cities which have POS, 
of land-use plans,

36
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:48,088
but which don't respect them.

37
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:54,615
So really what we have here for 
the first two responses, are case studies.

38
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:56,245
Availability of the land?

39
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:59,615
Again, we'll assume it is, otherwise 
the questionnaire would end there.

40
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:02,700
If the site is not available for building,

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,190
there is no point in asking 
further questions.

42
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,820
A slope of less than 8%? Why?

43
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,002
Because when it exceeds 8%, or 9 or 10%,

44
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,082
building on the slope becomes difficult,

45
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:17,184
and the additional costs for construction 
on a slope are such that

46
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:23,227
it no longer makes sense, except for
a very high-end development.

47
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:28,398
Otherwise level land is preferable 
from a cost standpoint,

48
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,940
it is also because technically 
it's easier to manage.

49
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,428
Solid ground?

50
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:37,346
Yes, we need solid ground which 
will allow for construction.

51
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:41,080
Is the distance to the water table 
greater than three meters?

52
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,688
Yes, because if it is close 
to the water table,

53
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:47,358
there is a risk of a rising water table, 
and thus of flooding.

54
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:51,070
Now we'll go to the column of the "no's" 
with its major nuisances.

55
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,882
Let's assume there are 
no major nuisances in this zone.

56
00:02:54,882 --> 00:03:00,261
Let's also assume that there is 
no pollution risk in the zone, no risk,

57
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:03,558
that the zone is not polluted, 
and so we can build on it.

58
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:06,551
And then the question we'll also 
ask ourselves is that of presence,

59
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:08,334
once the development is complete,

60
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:13,467
will it pose a pollution risk 
to the immediate environment?

61
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:16,440
It is there where we'll need a "no,"

62
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,998
otherwise we'd have to 
start making choices.

63
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,550
Does it make sense to build there?

64
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,180
Is the land serviced by access roads?

65
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,303
Yes, or no. 
There are two possible responses.

66
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:32,004
Sufficiently serviced by roads?
Yes or no.

67
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,531
We can have both answers at the same time,

68
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:38,225
because we pass from linear meter 
to linear kilometer

69
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:40,149
to determine the length of the roadway.

70
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,664
Ultimately, to create roadways
is not too difficult.

71
00:03:42,794 --> 00:03:47,560
The question is one of the cost involved 
in servicing sufficiently this need.

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,430
Near public transportation?

73
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,244
Yes, but this, once again, is a case study

74
00:03:52,244 --> 00:03:55,830
because in most cities 
there is no public transport

75
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,582
with predetermined routes, 
but instead it is the transport

76
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:02,726
which goes to areas where there are 
many people who need it.

77
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:05,854
Now, if your development is very dense, 
and has a large population,

78
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:09,743
it is extremely likely that there will be 
public transport available,

79
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:13,250
whether by minibus, taxi, 
or motorcycle-taxi.

80
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,150
Water service?
Same thing.

81
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,280
The question? Yes or no.

82
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,899
Can the water be serviced by gravity?

83
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:22,950
Yes or no.

84
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,798
Now there are different methods, 
but by gravity is the best,

85
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,414
because it is, financially speaking, 
the most reasonable.

86
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:33,005
And if there is not, we are once again 
looking at linear meter.

87
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:34,795
Electric service?

88
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,725
Same thing, yes or no.

89
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:38,921
Is the power sufficient?

90
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,240
Yes or no.
If not it will have to be built,

91
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,000
and what is the length of the line 
that must be installed?

92
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,668
Is there a low-tension transformer?

93
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:50,590
Yes or no, same thing.

94
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,150
So these are questions 
of public equipment.

95
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,670
For the development will we need 
construction equipment?

96
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,900
Yes or no.

97
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,209
Perhaps we're building a health-care 
center, an elementary school,

98
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:05,075
a market, a sports center, 
and then an administration.

99
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:09,270
And if not, what is the distance 
in linear meters

100
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,055
to the nearest hospital?

101
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:15,020
How far is the nearest high-school, 
or middle school?

102
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,635
These are very important elements,

103
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:19,239
because often undeveloped land is used,

104
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:24,488
so undeveloped that there is no school, 
no market, it has nothing available,

105
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,947
and so we put people in a situation 
which becomes extreme,

106
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:33,030
because they need access 
to education or to health-care.

107
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,677
Second step in the creation 
of our development,

108
00:05:37,677 --> 00:05:40,437
is the question of site allocation.

109
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:44,289
We have, for example ... let's imagine

110
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:48,791
a river here.

111
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:53,354
We put a bit of water, 
color it in blue, here.

112
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:57,108
The question now becomes,

113
00:05:57,298 --> 00:05:59,852
which land is conducive to development?

114
00:06:00,602 --> 00:06:05,080
We have here a very steep slope.

115
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,885
We have here a flood zone.

116
00:06:11,295 --> 00:06:16,200
Here we have a forest, and we realize

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,982
that all of this zone here is not 
a good place for development.

118
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:26,041
and finally we are left without a doubt,

119
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,697
here, this zone,

120
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:33,183
to create our development.

121
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:36,680
Now to back up a bit,

122
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,430
a quick review of the different things 
we've already discussed.

123
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,774
Sloping terrains, if the land 
is too steeply sloped,

124
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,414
it becomes difficult to build on it.

125
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:52,572
If the land is uneven, 
if the land is completely wavy,

126
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:55,458
and it looks like this, for example,

127
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:59,364
there is no point building on it,
It's too difficult, too costly.

128
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,443
Mountains, hillsides, 
by their very nature are sloping,

129
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:08,031
and these are the lands sought out, 
generally, by the wealthy.

130
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,174
And in most cities, 
the shantytowns pop up here,

131
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:16,336
because it is in forests, 
or on steep slopes,

132
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,817
where no one wants to settle.

133
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,730
Quarries, sandy areas, humid zones,

134
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,465
areas that are environmentally fragile.

135
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:30,825
These may be conservation zones 
which are environmentally protected,

136
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:35,070
or where there are species 
of flora and fauna found only there,

137
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,930
And no building should be done there, 
to safeguard them.

138
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,699
Flood zones and archeological sites, 
or cultural heritage sites,

139
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,600
zones like these, natural or built.

140
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,044
There are lands which simply 
should not be built on.

141
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:55,276
Now, from the plan we've developed,

142
00:07:55,506 --> 00:08:00,020
we'll subtract all those zones 
where building is not advised.

143
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,370
There too we are with a case study, 
for in most cities

144
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,071
you'll find construction in sandy zones, 
humid zones, flood zones,

145
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:12,489
but in planning a development we must 
take these things into account,

146
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:16,684
and in principal remove 
all zones such as these,

147
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:18,799
subtract them from any plan.

148
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:24,344
And, finally, all those lands 
not in the zones described above,

149
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:26,643
become then, buildable lands.

150
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,400
Next we'll perform 
a diagnosis of the zone.

151
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,840
A sort of state of the land, 
once the land is chosen.

152
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,638
Once we've seen
its different characteristics,

153
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:44,570
have chosen the first perimeter 
of our land development,

154
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,724
we can then begin to prepare 
a diagnosis of the zone.

155
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,441
Now the diagnosis is made up 
of questions which might be...

156
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:55,592
questions of climate,

157
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:59,923
the sun, here we have rain falling.

158
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:04,175
This is the data to take into account, 
the climate, the microclimate.

159
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:10,477
Another important piece of data 
is the nature of the land.

160
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:16,358
We have geological strata marked here, 
what type of land we have,

161
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:20,863
what type of drainage one might have 
here on the surface.

162
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:24,890
Naturally the water will flow 
in the direction of the slope,

163
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,050
and then we have nature, 
the flora and fauna.

164
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,920
So this is important to know, 
are there species to be protected?

165
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,150
Now, the second part.

166
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,274
Here we are not in cutaway, 
but on the plan.

167
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:44,457
It is what exists. Is there already 
an infrastructure of roadways

168
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:48,870
which leads here, if I consider as 
my development zone this one?

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,580
OK, and then are there water and 
electrical networks that can reach here?

170
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,200
We also ask ourselves the question, 
to know what are these lands,

171
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,270
the nature of the land adjacent to it.

172
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,210
Next phase, the topographical 
survey of the zone.

173
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:13,518
We'll use a scale of 1/1000 to 2/1000,

174
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:17,513
and will imagine a scale of 1/500,

175
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:19,130
which is far more precise,

176
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,495
with far more details,

177
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:24,535
but far more time-consuming to survey,

178
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:27,136
and we'll ask ourselves if it's 
reasonable or not

179
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:30,280
to spend so much time in preparing a plan

180
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,610
at a scale of 1/500 when often 
1/1000 or 1/2000 would be sufficient.

181
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,270
Now, let's assume we've chosen 
this zone here,

182
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,070
and let's review its different points.

183
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,370
perhaps the group of buildings 
doesn't serve us at all,

184
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,320
in this case, while blocks would allow us

185
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,120
to use, as a start, the roads 
which already exist.

186
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,335
We'll also highlight the forested limits,

187
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:10,983
We'll look at water.

188
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:16,421
We'll highlight everything 
that's on the site,

189
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:21,102
and then we'll make level curves

190
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:24,693
at 1 meter, 1.5 meters, 2 meters,

191
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:27,401
in relation to the nature of the land.

192
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:34,600
We'll also of course highlight 
any large trees we find.

193
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,913
The large baobabs, for example, 
which must be preserved,

194
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:44,581
and any element worthy of protection, 
which is cultural or non-cultural,

195
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:49,820
which is part of the cultural heritage, 
we'll highlight very carefully.

196
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,900
After this, we'll determine the size 
and shape of the parcels.

197
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,654
The size and form are influenced 
by social conditions, societal,

198
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:08,520
by the nature of the land, 
by the building conditions,

199
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,705
we'll review all of these 
different aspects

200
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:14,408
one after another, 
beginning with...

201
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:17,353
Lifestyle.
Why lifestyle?

202
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:23,720
Because we can clearly see that we have

203
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,518
very, very dense parcels, like this,

204
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:30,970
and we won't have the same
relationships between neighbors

205
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,445
as those where the parcels 
are very loose,

206
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:38,710
with large streets dividing them.

207
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:46,306
So here we won't see the same 
lifestyles as we would here.

208
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:48,202
Why lifestyle too?

209
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:53,540
Because if I want to design 
a shared parcel,

210
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:59,041
shared equipment and facilities, 
surely I will need to put

211
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,144
all my islets, and we're speaking,
of course, of islets,

212
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:07,364
around, because it is very, very clear

213
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:10,414
that they are directly connected to here.

214
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:15,504
It's not the same thing under another 
plan where I have my parcel here,

215
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:22,500
and the islets I'll develop only there.

216
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,190
So we have a social structure which

217
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,535
influences the size of the parcel,

218
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:31,928
for we are not building 
for the same family,

219
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:35,950
if it's made up of seven or eight 
people per household,

220
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,027
or of four, as in South Africa. 
We were in Senegal, before.

221
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:44,785
So this can determine
the size chosen for the parcel

222
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,420
in regard to the social structure 
of the family.

223
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,450
The building techniques 
are not at all the same.

224
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,050
We can easily see that in the case of 
this neighborhood here

225
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,180
or this type of habitat,

226
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,690
the construction techniques, 
the status or the building norms

227
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,643
also define the middle-sized parcel

228
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:15,120
if we want this type of building 
or this type of habitat,

229
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,994
we'll of course have, here,
parcels which are bigger than

230
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:22,425
these small, individual parcels over here.

231
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:25,982
The nature of the parcels.

232
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:30,005
We're speaking of the residential,

233
00:14:31,185 --> 00:14:34,965
which is the case we'll find here.

234
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:39,622
These are the blocks, as you see,
different residential blocks,

235
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:43,220
and then we see that their sizes 
are not at all the same

236
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,230
when it is on an industrial scale 
or even if all this is,

237
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,308
at some point or another, subdivided.

238
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:57,177
We don't have the limits we might want 
for land development,

239
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:59,932
but we see these small blocks here,

240
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:04,277
and the large blocks,
which are parcels for industry.

241
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,062
Then we have geometric rules.

242
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:15,022
We can imagine that we have one size, 
here, which is the minimal.

243
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:18,752
Beyond that, it becomes really 
too dense, really too closed in,

244
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,677
the people are on top of one another,

245
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:23,771
at the maximum size, 
which we'll mark here,

246
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:29,160
beyond which the cost 
of development is such that

247
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,820
it's no longer possible to make 
a cost-effective development.

248
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,485
So the form of the parcel, 
as we saw earlier,

249
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:46,754
the closer to the street, 
the less linear infrastructure,

250
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:51,730
the larger, the more needed, 
but the size of a parcel like this,

251
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,620
which is very slim, we can easily see 
how difficult it would be

252
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,263
to build a house or a shack 
on a parcel such as this,

253
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:06,680
and, finally, the best size 
is the double square here,

254
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,806
a rectangle based on a double square,

255
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:12,842
which allows us, we recall, as we've seen,

256
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:18,190
to return to the plan 
at the end of the islet.

257
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,680
Next, is of course not to use the square,

258
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,820
which is the least rational form 
we've seen thus far,

259
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,470
and then the last shape of parcel,

260
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,390
which is the potatoid, or potato-shaped,

261
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,578
which in principle is not liked,

262
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,074
because it has too many restrictions,

263
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:41,706
but we can imagine, 
no reason not to imagine,

264
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:44,786
that in the case of the restructurization 
of precarious zones,

265
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:48,577
we end up with land titles assigned to
potato-shaped parcels.

266
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,870
Then, as to size, we can issue 
rules which give

267
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,046
alignments or zones 
which prohibit construction,

268
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:03,380
which help to avoid building 
over-dense areas,

269
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,454
and we can do this, 
with public spaces,

270
00:17:06,454 --> 00:17:10,006
and we can do exactly the same thing 
between two parcels,

271
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:15,702
saying that it is not permitted 
to build at less than 3 meters,

272
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:19,650
less than 2, less than 1 meter, 
or 50 centimeters.

273
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,848
It's a choice, but one of 
the methods of urban planning

274
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:28,519
that opens up a number of views,

275
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:32,885
opens up proximity or overcrowding,

276
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,385
and these are the instruments,

277
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:37,516
the alignment plans which 
will be used relatively often.

278
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:42,188
The same with sectioning, 
we can imagine

279
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:48,040
that the relation between public space, 
here, and construction

280
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,284
is a maximum height, or a minimum height,

281
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:56,081
and that if we section here, 
between neighbors,

282
00:17:56,081 --> 00:18:03,192
which will have a maximum height 
of x meters or of x floors,

283
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:08,380
which keeps us from building a 50-story 
building next to a very small house.

284
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,497
Finally, and certainly of great importance,

285
00:18:11,497 --> 00:18:14,880
the economic conditions of the population 
who will inhabit the development.

286
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,535
Whether low-income or high-income,

287
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:19,314
we must take into account the revenues

288
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:23,784
and the possibilities that families 
or households have to purchase a parcel.

289
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,930
So the size of the parcel will depend on 
the revenue of the household.

290
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,080
Same with the nature of the site.

291
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,841
It is also very important 
with sloping land,

292
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:36,329
in regards to the morphology of the site,

293
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:39,543
that parcels are designed so that 
they are not exactly the same,

294
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:46,670
whether rectangular or potato-shaped, 
as a function of what one has.

295
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,336
Finally, we must determine 
the types of zones of the development,

296
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:55,945
the most classic being that of habitat,

297
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:59,285
but also zones for small business,

298
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:03,201
retail zones, socio-educational zones,

299
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:08,970
and public domain, green zones, 
as we'll see in detail next.

300
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,093
Here is an example of a development

301
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:21,646
where we can clearly see a market,

302
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:25,420
so we have a first zone,
which is a market area.

303
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,974
Here we have green spaces, perhaps 
either flood zones or unbuildable,

304
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:33,135
which is our second zone.

305
00:19:33,135 --> 00:19:39,530
Then we have all the unallocated zones,

306
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,770
which will clearly be habitat zones,

307
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:50,028
a transformer, electric, perhaps,

308
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:55,416
and then between these habitat zones, 
what remains is public domain.

309
00:19:55,416 --> 00:20:00,890
So we see only by chance, here also 
most likely a small business unit.

310
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,390
In a simple development we already see

311
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,267
this group of zones, as described.

312
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:13,312
Now, perhaps we lack a school, 
a clinic, or athletic fields,

313
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:18,630
but we see that any development 
will incorporate these zones.

314
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,170
To finish with these different zones, 
we have the question of percentage.

315
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:31,070
In principal, residential zones 
should be at least 50%.

316
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,375
You'll find in certain developments 
a much higher percentage,

317
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,735
because we count the surrounding roadways

318
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,315
as 20% of the orders of magnitude.

319
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:50,675
Here we have 70% roadways plus habitat,

320
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:56,786
with 30% spanning these different zones,

321
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:03,312
which might be commercial, social, 
recreational, or green spaces.

322
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:09,070
It is very important to maintain this 30%, 
but often what we see is that

323
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:14,174
this 30% drops to 10%, 
because of equipment,

324
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:19,220
and what makes our 50% becomes 70%.

325
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,645
Inevitably, the more residential zones,

326
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:25,705
the more assignable zones, 
and the more land to sell.

327
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:27,421
And if I'm no longer in business,

328
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:31,340
this lowers the parcel price 
of my development.

329
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,200
But let's try today to say that it's 50%,

330
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,060
neither more nor less, 
which is residential,

331
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,920
the rest in roadways, green spaces, 
shared spaces.

332
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,386
So we must establish 
a development program.

333
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:52,450
To do this we ask the question of

334
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:02,110
how many people will live in it?

335
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,772
It's A.

336
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:06,950
B.

337
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:18,928
The number of people per household.

338
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:23,327
And then, the number of parcels needed.

339
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:29,220
It's simple. A divided by B.

340
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,785
And once I get the number of parcels,

341
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:34,929
which I then multiply

342
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:40,925
by the average surface area

343
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:44,781
of my parcel.

344
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:51,688
We end up with a total of x,

345
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:56,980
and, finally, since I have 50% 
of residential parcels,

346
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:04,932
Two times x is equal to the total 
surface area of my development.

347
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:14,808
To this we'll add next the question 
of the equipment program,

348
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:20,227
and we must define what importance 
we want to give each type of equipment,

349
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:24,465
and which situation we want 
to give to our development.

350
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,720
So again, for the equipment

351
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,720
we have a population,

352
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,986
and we have a norm,

353
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:50,082
the number of inhabitants per equipment.

354
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:55,650
And this will give us 
the number to create.

355
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,169
So we have a surface for equipment,

356
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:10,160
and we know the surface necessary.

357
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:19,938
Next we'll try to adapt our development 
to the topography.

358
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:23,430
If I position myself like this, 
with my roadways,

359
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,469
we'll very quickly have problems,

360
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,808
because the speed of the flow 
perpendicular to the slope will be huge,

361
00:24:32,018 --> 00:24:35,258
and we'll have problems 
of soil cutaway here,

362
00:24:35,678 --> 00:24:38,146
and of flooding of the housing.

363
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:42,052
To remediate this,
there are many techniques.

364
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:44,380
We can erase and begin again.

365
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:53,744
First, instead of making wide streets 
like those we've just made,

366
00:24:54,524 --> 00:24:57,623
we'll make them staggered,

367
00:24:57,993 --> 00:25:01,660
which allows us in this way to achieve

368
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,265
flow speed which is notably less.

369
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,905
So the water cannot flow directly

370
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:19,170
as we had before, but is, 
at each point, broken,

371
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:26,490
and as a result, this slows down 
the water speed,

372
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,736
as well as the risk of land cutaway.

373
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:35,960
Another way might be instead of 
perpendicular, like this,

374
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:42,660
which is to say at a slight slant 
in relation to the slope.

375
00:25:44,538 --> 00:25:49,138
There too we can imagine that the water

376
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,988
will flow at a much slower speed,

377
00:25:53,738 --> 00:25:58,090
gently descending, while before 
it went directly, straight.

378
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,012
And if we couple these 
last things we've done,

379
00:26:02,412 --> 00:26:05,477
which is to say that in 
breaking up of the slope,

380
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:11,858
we find ourselves in situations where 
the development becomes

381
00:26:13,268 --> 00:26:15,897
something which might be like this,

382
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,876
and the question we must then ask

383
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:26,535
is if it is pertinent or not 
to have these angles here,

384
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:28,832
instead of right angles.

385
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:32,200
So we must at the same time choose between

386
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,162
a perpendicularity in 
the creation of the road,

387
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:39,887
and, ultimately, the design 
of the roadways

388
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:42,760
which allow the water to flow gently.

389
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,100
The choice must be made, 
and is, without doubt,

390
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,360
an intermediate situation 
where we'll end up.

391
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,848
Next, nuisances.

392
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:56,772
Nuisances might be noise,

393
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,906
are often related to noise, right?

394
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:05,480
We'll avoid spending too much 
time on nuisances.

395
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,862
Another one might be the wind.

396
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:16,320
If my residential areas are here, 
the dominant wind like this,

397
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,605
I'll avoid putting 
my industrial zone here

398
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:23,020
because the pollution will land there,

399
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:29,146
so instead I'll put it here, so the wind 
blows across the residential area

400
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:33,116
and then over my industrial zone, 
without bothering anyone.

401
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,930
The same for the sun.

402
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,434
If we have a slope, and residential areas.

403
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,878
The question is, depending 
on the latitude,

404
00:27:45,108 --> 00:27:47,507
to protect it from the sun or, 
on the contrary,

405
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,166
to seek exposure to it.

406
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,276
The eleventh stage of our step-by-step 
is the question of service.

407
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:58,189
Now of course, when speaking 
of African cities, in most cities,

408
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:01,588
the rate of car ownership is very low.

409
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:07,190
We have, for example, 17, 20, 25 
or 30 vehicles per 1000 inhabitants,

410
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,384
while in those countries, 
let's call them industrialized,

411
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:14,380
we might have up to 500 cars 
per 1000 inhabitants.

412
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,538
So the question of purpose 
is certainly important.

413
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:22,570
But we must keep these 
numbers in our heads,

414
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:28,750
there is a very small elite who are able 
to get around by car.

415
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,692
But even in a situation such as this,

416
00:28:31,692 --> 00:28:33,765
we have the same thing 
in the poorest neighborhoods.

417
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:37,849
So we cannot economize 
in service by cars.

418
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:43,300
We must imagine that cars are 
exclusively in public spaces.

419
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,440
That there are no parking spaces,

420
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,189
or very few, on private space, 
on one's own parcel.

421
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:52,140
So the public space must 
at the same time manage

422
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,214
the circulation as well as 
the parking of vehicles.

423
00:28:57,624 --> 00:29:00,854
And then, as we can see in this image,

424
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:08,822
we can easily see that we must also 
plan ahead, in our templates,

425
00:29:09,752 --> 00:29:15,230
for these types of situations where 
the street ends up so torn up,

426
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:21,016
in such a sorry state, that it 
cannot support this narrow a roadway.

427
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:22,928
A much wider one is necessary,

428
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,490
so that cars can easily circulate.

429
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,634
So the template of service is not only

430
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,797
tied to the number of 
vehicles which will circulate,

431
00:29:33,797 --> 00:29:36,943
but equally to the conditions of the road

432
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,090
and the climatic conditions of the city.

433
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,605
Let's consider, finally, 
other infrastructures.

434
00:29:44,855 --> 00:29:46,590
Which plan to adopt?

435
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,330
A linear plan, a mesh plan?

436
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,386
A mesh plan will be more expensive, 
will demand more pipelines,

437
00:29:56,596 --> 00:30:01,555
but when there is an outage 
here or there,

438
00:30:01,745 --> 00:30:06,284
the system continues to supply 
water to everyone,

439
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,095
while with the other plan, 
if we cut it here or there,

440
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:13,860
an entire sector of the population 
will no longer have access to water.

441
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,860
The next step is to estimate 
the costs of development.

442
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:26,392
Quickly, of course the point, the land,

443
00:30:29,342 --> 00:30:30,494
its purchase.

444
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:37,346
Second point, the work in situ, 
which is, of course,

445
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:39,551
the preparation of the land, the roadways,

446
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,704
drinking-water supply, electricity.

447
00:30:41,704 --> 00:30:51,382
Third, the off-site, so each time 
we are here, B, here, C.

448
00:30:51,612 --> 00:30:54,020
The fourth point, equipment.

449
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:03,590
Fifth, the studies and supervision.

450
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:12,680
And sixth the diverse and unexpected.

451
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:25,178
Finally, the price of the development, 
the cost of its development.

452
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:29,940
Now we're on points A through F.

453
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,305
Once we have this cost, we have 
the cost of development,

454
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:37,420
as we've just seen.

455
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,853
Next we have a surface, 
of the development.

456
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,976
To keep in mind.

457
00:31:50,686 --> 00:31:54,782
Then the assignable surface,

458
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:58,200
or that which can be sold, the habitat,

459
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:04,920
and this, as we've seen, is around 50%

460
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,040
of the surface of the development,

461
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,344
and which gives us

462
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:17,088
a cost per square meter of land,

463
00:32:18,088 --> 00:32:22,334
which, if we want parcels 
of 150 square meters,

464
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:27,004
will give us the unit-price 
of the parcel.

465
00:32:28,273 --> 00:32:33,860
Let's not forget to say that 
the cost of development varies

466
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,240
as a function of the standards 
or the norms applied to it.

467
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,700
If it is affordable or luxury,

468
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:44,450
if we want the road paved throughout 
or just stabilized earth,

469
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,970
if we want strong equipment 
coverage or not,

470
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,054
if we want electrification,

471
00:32:51,364 --> 00:32:54,149
if we want individual 
water distribution or not,

472
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:59,406
so all these things enter in and form 
the costs of development,

473
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:02,900
directly linked to the choice of building 
class, low or high-end.

474
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,583
The surface of the development, 
as we saw earlier,

475
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:10,176
and then the assignable surface, 
which should be 50%,

476
00:33:10,396 --> 00:33:14,030
and then you can without hesitation

477
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:20,560
give a per-parcel cost for 150, 200, 
300, 400, 600 square meters.

478
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,074
There are parcels much larger 
still, as we've seen.

479
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:28,534
Remember, in terms of cost, 
we must also take into account,

480
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:32,082
when there is an international investor, 
the exchange rates.

481
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:37,828
We must also take into account 
inflation, cost increases,

482
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:45,006
because from Day A, when you submit 
your development sketches,

483
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:48,619
to Day Z, when you've finished your work,

484
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:53,140
you'll realize that 
many years have passed.

485
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,923
And given the inflation in certain 
countries, it's important

486
00:33:57,923 --> 00:34:04,000
to be cognizant of this inflation 
in the costs of your development.
