00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,810
Here in this last video of this week, 
we will talk about some examples that

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,060
are going to take us to Luanda, Dakar 
Dakar or Kigali and we will see that in

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,446
these cities, depending on the standard or
the standing of the chosen subdivision,

4
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:18,647
there are large, indeed, very, 
very large disparities

5
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:22,834
between the surface areas 
of the subdivisions.

6
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:25,690
First example, the city of Luanda.

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,370
A neighborhood chosen at random, 
we see that the subdivision

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,630
is very regular, we see, the double block,

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,388
let's show it differently, so each time,

10
00:00:42,328 --> 00:00:46,534
we come to determine a plot,

11
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:50,958
and we realize that the plots are

12
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:54,660
more or less 13 meters by 14, 
so we have seen it,

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,684
it's not the best, we are almost dealing
with a square,

14
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:01,038
it's not the best of the solutions, 
but we have plots

15
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:05,450
which are relatively small, we will see those 
ones later, that are 182 square meters.

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,156
Road allowances, primaries at 18 meters, 
11 meters for the secondary

17
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,752
and the tertiary at eight meters.

18
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:20,176
Another example in Luanda, we see that 
we change the standing, here we have

19
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:27,966
696 meters once again between 24 and 29, 
we almost have a square.

20
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:30,444
What is interesting to see here is that

21
00:01:30,444 --> 00:01:34,535
the roads are however much smaller 
than in the other subdivision.

22
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:38,545
It's normal with plots of 696 square meters,

23
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,340
we really have far less residents

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,240
so a very different road need.

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,075
Another example, Kigali, we recognize 
the city easily

26
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:50,970
by its hills, let's take a 
first neighborhood.

27
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,245
We see the blocks here, which are subdivided

28
00:01:57,245 --> 00:02:03,090
in plots, it's easier to see, 
here we have three plots,

29
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,620
so the first neighborhood we have 
very small plots, 9 by 12, 108

30
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,450
and then primary roads at 12 meters
and secondaries at 10 meters.

31
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,490
We have a very very high density.

32
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,530
We change aspect, we change 
neighborhood, we have a neighborhood

33
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,336
which starts on the hillside, we see it
by its curves which follow more or less

34
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:30,080
the natural curves and there we find 
ourselves with surface areas

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,900
of 425 square meters,

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,218
so they are enormous plots, even though 
we are dealing with

37
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:40,650
equivalent routes for primary 
and secondary

38
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,210
and a tertiary which is practically 
for the pedestrian.

39
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,566
Another example, still in Kigali, 
we see here that

40
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:54,049
the size of the plots, it's very easily 
detectable and here we are looking at

41
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,151
surface areas of 600 square meters which 
are surface areas that one must admit,

42
00:02:59,151 --> 00:03:04,240
are huge compared to 
the needs of a family.

43
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,040
Now to Dakar.

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,488
We travel very quickly, we were in Luanda,
we go on to Kigali, we arrive in Dakar,

45
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:17,413
with a first neighborhood, here also 
easy to see the different blocks,

46
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:26,541
we can then subdivide them and 
we have 12 by 16, 192 square meters

47
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:30,206
of plot once again 12, 7 and 5 meters.

48
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:34,776
All this to give you a palette of 
what is possible and what exists,

49
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:37,692
we see now North Pikine,

50
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,890
so we see density but it's because

51
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,158
we're not using the same scale, the primary 
is very big and the secondary

52
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:45,974
and tertiary are very small and the plots
on the other hand,

53
00:03:45,974 --> 00:03:48,892
which are plots of 300 square meters.

54
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:52,570
Finally Keur Massar, 
on the outskirts of Dakar,

55
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,752
really, previously outskirts 
since the city

56
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:59,695
is catching up rapidly, 
we also have

57
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:02,920
a certain number of plots 
of 300 square meters.

58
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,897
There you have, some examples, 
very quickly examined, we have seen

59
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:12,450
we are at 700 square meters in a subdivision,

60
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,067
while in others we are at 108 or sometimes
a plot of 100 square meters.

61
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:24,608
A summary neighborhood, we added
Bangui et Bamako, we see that

62
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:31,126
we are at 108, without a doubt, at 
the smallest, searching, to the biggest,

63
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:37,970
which is 748 square meters, so we have 
differences which are huge

64
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,884
depending on, not only the standing that
we want to create in the neighborhood,

65
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:45,410
but also the construction practices.

66
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:51,813
The 192, which is a module 
of 12 by 16 in Dakar,

67
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:55,548
is without a doubt the one which 
we find the most in the whole city,

68
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,945
we find it in a second neighborhood,

69
00:04:57,945 --> 00:05:02,300
while the 300 square meter plots 
in Dakar are relatively rare.

70
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,222
On the other hand, we see that 
we are much more large,

71
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:10,850
much bigger in Luanda, 
and we are not talking about

72
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,970
Bamako where the three neighborhoods 
chosen at random

73
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,814
show the huge plots relative to 
the needs of a family.

74
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:22,510
There it is, there is no value judgment 
behind these different subdivisions,

75
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,200
but simply to show that the contrasts are 
enormous and that if we are dealing with

76
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,550
a subdivision of 108 or 192 square meters 
and a subdivision of 748,

77
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,728
inevitably the profitability of the pot 
will not be the same.

78
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:43,110
There you have it, 
that's how our video ends.
