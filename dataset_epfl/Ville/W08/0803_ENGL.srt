1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,036
We are going to talk about two things.

2
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:08,241
First of all the issues of density

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,806
and which are the phenomena 
that influence this density.

4
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:16,266
And secondly how to make 
our networks profitable

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,460
when we draw up the subdivision.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,182
The first element which influences density
is the issue of

7
00:00:24,182 --> 00:00:26,220
the size of the lots or 
of the right to build.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,476
We can also increase the rights to build
and this will increase

9
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:33,219
the density and we can also change 
the size of the lot.

10
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:37,980
The more the plot grows, 
the more density will decrease.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,181
The issue of public facilities.

12
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:43,510
It's necessary, the more people we have,

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,254
the more it becomes profitable to have 
public facilities.

14
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:49,593
This seems very logical.

15
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:53,349
There is the issue of temporality

16
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:56,192
which clearly influences 
the question of density.

17
00:00:56,192 --> 00:00:58,940
We can find ourselves in less densely 
populated neighborhoods

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,740
that decades later begin to densify,

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,319
becoming very densely populated
working class neighborhoods.

20
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,674
The issue also of public transportation

21
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:10,014
has an influence in two ways.

22
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:14,185
We need many people for transportation
to be profitable and conversely,

23
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:19,010
the more transportation I have, the more 
people I can have in my neighborhoods.

24
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,530
And finally the question of public space.

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,098
In fact, the more dense I am, 
the more I densify,

26
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:29,710
the more I have a significant number 
of people, the less large lots I have,

27
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,857
and so the more I need 
generous public spaces

28
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:38,323
which allow people to have a little 
breathing room in the city.

29
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:43,568
The symbol of this public space is 
Central Park where New York is

30
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:49,418
of an incredible density and finally 
we have this green lung in the middle.

31
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:51,638
It's a symptomatic example.

32
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:53,951
There are many others in the cities.

33
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:56,968
This doesn't necessarily have 
to be parks, these can be plazas,

34
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,510
these can be large boulevards,

35
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,406
but we need, at some point,
to have space so that the people

36
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:08,009
who live in this density are able to
enjoy themselves in the open air.

37
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,334
How to increase density?

38
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:13,685
We have begun to see this.

39
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:19,130
We have two solutions, either we decrease

40
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,421
the size of the lots and the length of the facade.

41
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,240
We will see in a little while 
how to do this.

42
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,900
We might increase the building rights.

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,510
We might decrease the areas which 
are not assigned to housing.

44
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,954
Rather than make parks and plazas,

45
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:38,814
you are making housing and this 
will allow you to increase density.

46
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:41,950
We quickly see that it is not an option

47
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,850
and then we refer back to the question 
of the increase in building rights.

48
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,314
Since there are rarely controls

49
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:53,627
on these building rights, we need to have
a policing of constructions

50
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:59,391
which would be vigilant to say if, 
yes or no, this was done to code.

51
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:05,241
And well, we'll also realize that it's 
a rare possibility and so

52
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:08,350
the only way is to decrease the size

53
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,410
and the length on the street 
to increase the density.

54
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:18,336
Profitability of plots 
or rather of networks.

55
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:22,990
The influence of the size plays 
an important role on public spending.

56
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,980
I take my plot, let's say my four plots,

57
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,259
versus here six plots, right?

58
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:37,870
If I have 100 linear meters this means

59
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,170
that there will be a pipe here, 
each one with connections.

60
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,552
On 100 meters, I will be able to, 
in the first example with my facade

61
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:53,030
on the street of 25 meters connect 
four households while here,

62
00:03:53,030 --> 00:04:00,150
I would have six households 
with a plot of 6.67.

63
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:04,601
And it's clear that the more 
the plot decreases,

64
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,456
the more the distance
on the street decreases,

65
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:09,265
the more I can increase 
my density, but the more

66
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:12,760
I can reduce my public spending per unit.

67
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:17,709
Profitability of networks
and transferable areas.

68
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,560
What is a transferable area?

69
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,317
So let me show a quick diagram.

70
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:29,381
Here we have a large plot with two blocks

71
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:33,585
and then we are going to quickly draw, 
we have plots here,

72
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:38,905
we have some here also with a large plot
in this spot here.

73
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:42,764
So, once again, to advance quickly, 
we can imagine

74
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:48,390
that this whole area here 
is devoted to housing.

75
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,279
That's what we call transferable area.

76
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,169
It's to put housing and then we would have

77
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,669
this plot here which would be facilities

78
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:01,961
and then eventually the rest of the plots,

79
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:05,230
here would be what we call 
the public domain.

80
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,654
So the idea is to say, here we have 
transferable areas.

81
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:15,445
It has to be at 50%.

82
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:19,500
You will often find it at 
a much larger proportion.

83
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,622
Here, public domain, we have between

84
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:28,550
20% and 25% and then the facilities,

85
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,334
large infrastructures also 
between 20% and 25%.

86
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:43,038
So of course, if we are at 20% of roads, 
we have to give 30% to facilities,

87
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:49,100
but let's say that we're at 20%-25% also 
in this place here with the facilities.

88
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,626
We can reduce the transferable area, 
we can increase it.

89
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:55,192
Many increase it to have more to sell

90
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:59,230
and of course to make better 
economic transactions.

91
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,126
But don't forget that it's very important 
to have places where

92
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:08,532
the people, the denser it is, 
the more need there is for places

93
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:12,150
where people can go and meet 
and that's why

94
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:19,100
the facilities area plus the public domain
should also be at 50%.

95
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:22,856
Making the networks profitable.

96
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:24,930
So we have several possibilities.

97
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,666
We have already partially seen how we can 
increase the number of constructions

98
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:35,312
by plot, we can decrease the facade
on the street, we can decrease

99
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:42,331
the overall size of the plot or consolidate
the plots in a cul-de-sac as we will see

100
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:44,324
in a little bit with the diagrams

101
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:49,310
that we will draw in a few moments.

102
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:52,050
Let's go back to our drawings.

103
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,072
Making the networks profitable at 
a constant size means that if we want

104
00:06:57,072 --> 00:07:03,751
the size to remain the same, of the plot, 
we have to decrease the street facade.

105
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:09,302
This means we have a diagram that is 
roughly like this because each time

106
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:15,768
that I decrease the size of my plot, 
I have to increase the depth

107
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:24,287
so if I have here 15 out of 30, 
I'll have 12, sorry, 12 out of 37.5,

108
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:28,548
I will have 10 out of 45 etc., etc.,

109
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,965
But we must be very careful about 
what is left in a proportion.

110
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:40,457
If I have a building here, 
often we go to at least 12 meters.

111
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:44,194
This means 12 x 37 since the plots

112
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:49,780
that would be like this are just 
unconstructible and thus uninhabitable.

113
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,535
If I take the constant proportion 
this time.

114
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:57,674
So it's no longer necessarily 
the size of the plot

115
00:07:57,674 --> 00:08:01,725
but that I want to keep the proportion 
so that it is a rectangle,

116
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:08,368
so I still have this type of proportion 
and not the one we drew earlier.

117
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:14,016
Well, we find ourselves in a situation 
where, here, we draw the plot,

118
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:18,328
the proportion is here and 
I want to increase,

119
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm going to increase each time here 
in my plot in the proportions.

120
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,905
So if I go to 7.5, I will have 10, 
12.5, 15 etc., etc.,

121
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:36,789
So there it is, this is 
a graphical geometric trick,

122
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:41,370
to increase, in constant proportion, 
the size of the plots.

123
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,953
The proportion of the plots.

124
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:45,264
Here also it's very important.

125
00:08:45,264 --> 00:08:47,073
We have just seen it.

126
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:51,007
A plot like this would be 
almost unconstructible.

127
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:57,194
So, roughly, we have plots that would be 
rectangles which are, in fact, based on

128
00:08:57,194 --> 00:09:02,786
a double square and we are going to find
plots that are 12 x 14 or even

129
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:09,137
plots that are 30 x 15, 9 x 18.

130
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:11,646
Why the double square?

131
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:16,670
It's that we can then, 
when we draw the subdivision,

132
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:22,010
we can then easily return the plot,

133
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:28,237
since we have here 9 and 9 
so we have the necessary 18.

134
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:29,570
There it is.

135
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,725
So if I'm dealing with the double square
I can draw my plot geometrically,

136
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:37,110
very easily and return it 
in the end to the block.

137
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,140
Making the networks profitable also means 
regrouping the plots.

138
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,270
So, once again, let's quickly draw

139
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,652
four plots, let's draw four other plots.

140
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:59,564
Here, I'm drawing my houses, which are
little individual houses in the center,

141
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:05,180
and I'm drawing a version 
where the houses are regrouped.

142
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,729
In the first version of my drawing,

143
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:13,430
I have a conduit and each time 
individual conduits.

144
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,967
In the second, we can imagine, like this,
to save the number,

145
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:24,161
the linear meter of conduit, which makes
it so that it's profitable,

146
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:28,997
as we go along the networks since 
I'm regrouping the plots.

147
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:33,365
Yet another possibility, 
which is very seldom used

148
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:38,146
but which exists is that here, 
I have my main road,

149
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:43,915
here I have my plots, I'm going to draw,
each time, my four plots,

150
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:48,969
and then I can draw my buildings here,
there it is.

151
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:57,970
The idea here is to have a sort of 
technical gain, like in a building,

152
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,700
except that it's in the subdivision, where
we have a gain that happens here.

153
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,237
So we maybe have here a meter available
and then we have,

154
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:13,775
each time, the networks which, 
are then distributed in this manner.

155
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:18,381
So it's of course very, it's of course possible,

156
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,980
this diagram here is still possible

157
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,660
but is very seldom used and then,

158
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,990
unfortunately, it's finally these diagrams 
that we find

159
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,560
most often since they're done

160
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,097
one after the other and 
since there is no need,

161
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:36,832
like this to have to coordinate 
with the neighbor,

162
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:39,260
to create, to make 
the networks profitable.

163
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:45,557
So then, once we have made 
the networks profitable, we must still

164
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:50,210
find the balance between 
land and real estate.

165
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,566
As such, there are several elements that 
will be taken into account,

166
00:11:54,566 --> 00:12:00,800
the first element is land cost, 
the second, the real estate investment.

167
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,576
Then we have a balance mechanism 
which has to happen between the two.

168
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:08,742
There are geometry questions and

169
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:10,880
right of use which is taken into account.

170
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,659
And land cost determines 
economic interest,

171
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:18,360
it's what we are going to see 
as we continue.

172
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,620
So land cost is at the same time

173
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,264
the price of land acquisition plus

174
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:32,794
the state of this land, plus the provision,

175
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:37,510
the networks, plus, in certain cases,
not always, the facilities.

176
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,098
There it is.

177
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:40,990
All of this represents my land cost.

178
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,820
Managing the future: 
how to manage the future?

179
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,326
In the first example here, we have

180
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:51,916
a plot which seems to us much too slack,

181
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:56,314
the public domain areas 
are much too big and then

182
00:12:56,614 --> 00:13:00,728
finally the plot will not be, 
without a doubt, profitable.

183
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:04,736
On the other hand, if I have 
an extremely dense situation,

184
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:10,380
it will no longer be possible, mid stream,
to add other new facilities.

185
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,040
So we will try to find a balance
between these two situations.

186
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,005
The other thing also, is if I have only

187
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:21,689
small plots available for the facilities,
this will not work either,

188
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,853
since at some point there 
will be facilities,

189
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:27,610
of much larger scale, in place.

190
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,741
So the idea is to have both

191
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:33,720
large facilities plots as well as

192
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,570
small plots, both enough space here,

193
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,400
there it's too little and not 
too much either, there.

194
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,340
So it's a mix of these two and 
it's really important to take into account

195
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,565
the plot in the long term, to understand

196
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:51,629
how it's going to evolve and the needs 
that it will have in the future.

197
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:55,140
So, do not go on something 
too large because

198
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,678
finally if the plot is much too big, 
there is a risk of it not filling up,

199
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:03,278
but it's important to be pragmatic,
and to give enough

200
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:09,000
available space so as to then be able 
to continue to densify

201
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,200
the plot as it should.

202
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,379
Then, once we have tried to make 
the networks profitable,

203
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,565
once we have discussed the land cost,

204
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:24,340
once we have imagined
how to draw our plot,

205
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,626
we still have to discuss the level of 
facilities that will be put in place.

206
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:35,810
The level of equipment is the quality of 
the service infrastructure we want.

207
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,182
I this can be very high level, high-end,

208
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,718
where I want water, electricity, 
fiber optics,

209
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:51,170
or, on the contrary, I can have situations 
where I want a provision,

210
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,790
the simplest possible, meaning 
some standposts,

211
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,564
a relatively flat and directly 
constructible area,

212
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,946
and highways which are in fact

213
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:03,960
only right-of-way openings 
and that's all.

214
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,997
So between the high-end 
and a very low-end development,

215
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:10,212
we see that the costs are very different

216
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:12,245
since the quantity of networks,

217
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,883
the quantity of services to put in place
is very different.

218
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:21,583
When we talk of network issues,

219
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:26,440
of levels of facilities, we are of course
talking about sanitation first.

220
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,374
Am I going to put in place 
a collective sanitation system

221
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,930
or an individual sanitation system?

222
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,038
The drinking water supply: 
what kind of supply?

223
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:41,974
By standpost or directly on the plot?

224
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:47,214
The other networks: telephone networks, 
electricity networks.

225
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:50,168
Are all the parcels connected 
to the electrical grid,

226
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:53,964
or do I produce only public lighting?

227
00:15:55,704 --> 00:16:00,358
Finally, the facilities: markets, schools.

228
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:03,524
Am I going to put all of 
the necessary facilities

229
00:16:03,524 --> 00:16:06,530
on my plot or, as in the main principles

230
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,510
that we mentioned in another video, 
is that I'm going to outsource

231
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:15,770
these facilities and consolidate them
elsewhere than in my plot?

232
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,540
Finally public spaces: ensuring that they
are sufficient,

233
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,670
ensuring they are in the right place 
so that people can use them fully.

234
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,376
There you have it, 
the profitability of networks.

235
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,147
Facilities issues hold no more secrets.

236
00:16:33,147 --> 00:16:34,437
We have gone very quickly over

237
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:36,700
the issues of facilities 
and infrastructures.

238
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,950
We don't have the time to look at this

239
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,343
in more detail and depth but this

240
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:46,750
gives us a sort of general view of

241
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,630
what we need to do when 
we are planning a plot.

242
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,594
Don't forget that it is really

243
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,761
by the geometric tool, 
the reduction of the facade

244
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:59,299
or increased building rights, 
but we have seen that

245
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:01,250
there are very few cases where this works,

246
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,420
so it's really the geometric tool 
which allows,

247
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,540
when you create a plot, to render

248
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,036
your plots more or less profitable.

249
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:17,485
Don't forget that a plot must register 
in the duration and that moment zero

250
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:21,839
is not the same as at 10 years, 
15 years, 20 years or 50 years.

251
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,023
And this duration, it's what is 
most difficult

252
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:27,271
to take into account but it's what makes
the issue of the plot.

253
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:31,902
And good plots, it's when we are able to 
take into account the notion of time

254
00:17:31,902 --> 00:17:35,195
and the notion of duration in planning

255
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:37,200
which we are putting in place.
