1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,111
The week begins with Doula,

2
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:12,600
We wish to welcome the participants
from Doula.

3
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:21,610
Today the African city grows mainly
by its subdivisions.

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,090
Even though the authorities focus on

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,402
the resorption of precarious housing,
the large majority of city dwellers,

6
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:30,665
the future residents of African cities,

7
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:33,522
are going to arrive in subdivisions 
these next few years.

8
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:37,366
However, the issues of subdivisions, 
the quality of living conditions

9
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:39,262
which we are putting in place

10
00:00:39,262 --> 00:00:42,450
in the outskirts of the city is 
absolutely never discussed.

11
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,650
We are going to see these issues 
this week,

12
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:48,380
not the main issues of the debate,

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:55,099
but the question of knowing how to build,
step by step, a quality subdivision.

14
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:59,693
The challenge of planning a 
subdivision is not only technical

15
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:03,612
but it's about understanding a 
social and environmental object

16
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:06,166
as well as understanding the networks

17
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,670
the geometrical aspects or even
economic profitability.

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,033
So we will lay the groundwork this week 
of a reflection on how

19
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:14,930
to produce a quality subdivision,

20
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,890
where people live, work 
and have leisure activities.

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,941
We will see for example the impact of 
the layout, the drawing, the design,

22
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:25,559
on the costs, but also the correlation 
that there is

23
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:28,102
between the level of service 
and cost of the plot.

24
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:33,196
We will show some standards, 
by paying attention to explain

25
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:38,060
and to say that the standards change with 
time and places.

26
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,423
The construction norms in 1950 in Dakar 
weren't the same

27
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:47,562
as in Raahein as in Abidjan, and Abidjan 
in 1960 certainly didn't have

28
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:49,948
the same norms as today, 
I'm intentionally mentioning

29
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:51,889
Abidjan as an element of demonstration

30
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:55,567
because it' a a textbook case for urban 
planning and construction standards.

31
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:58,170
President Bouani had high-tech building

32
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,450
in his political program.

33
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,046
If standards change, 
building techniques as well.

34
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:08,262
Let's imagine the telephone, for example, 
first of all, without telephones

35
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:11,392
in certain subdivisons, 
in the subdivisions

36
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:13,568
no doubt the richest and oldest,

37
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:18,070
we have begun to put a telephone network, 
installing electricity wires

38
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,506
so as to eventually not at all,

39
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,210
with the advent of mobile phones,
have need of

40
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,516
these wired telephones and 
we are little by little

41
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:29,286
not even imagine that we could

42
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:31,650
put telephones in the subdivisions.

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,134
Finally, whether the subdivision 
be public or private, the two exist,

44
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:39,533
it's necessary to carry out all of 
the reflections

45
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,390
that we are going to carry out now.

46
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,054
We will talk about the issue of needs.

47
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:47,655
For whom, for how many people 
are we going to make a subdivision?

48
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:51,413
We will talk about the issue of potentialities,

49
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,450
what are the potentialities of the site?

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,854
We will look at the issue of program,

51
00:02:57,854 --> 00:03:01,981
each subdivision has a program 
that must be defined beforehand,

52
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,510
and then we will the issue

53
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,370
of the layout or of 
the indicative planning.

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,150
So this week we will have, after this video,

55
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,252
this short introductory video,

56
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:18,348
a first video on the issues of 
defining the subdivision,

57
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:19,918
the block, the plot,

58
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:22,876
then on the basic principles,

59
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:25,980
principles that must generate spatiality

60
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,000
of the subdivision, a second video on how

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,580
to make the networks profitable, 
how to make a subdivision profitable,

62
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:41,142
then we will see a step by step video,
meaning that step after step,

63
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:45,250
stage after stage, we are going to see 
how to build a subdivision,

64
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,114
and finally we will have some examples 
taken from here and there in African cities

65
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:51,770
to see the differences that we can have

66
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,653
between Khiali, Dakar or Ouanda.

67
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:57,536
There you have it, 
this week's program.

68
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,504
You decide!
