1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,807
Hello.

2
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:06,820
In this video, we are going to talk 
about two things.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,550
First, the basic vocabulary.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,034
What is a plot?

5
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:12,253
What is an islet?

6
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:13,843
What is a housing development?

7
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:14,445
And so on.

8
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:16,335
The second thing we are going 
to talk about, is

9
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:18,549
the big principles that generate the drawing

10
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:21,160
of the housing development, 
and that allow most of

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,930
the time to make profitable 
the housing development's networks.

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,397
So we are going to talk, 
point by point, about what is

13
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:35,840
a plot, what is an islet, and what is

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,440
a housing development.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,710
So the base unit of the housing 
development is the plot.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,510
In this context, a plot is a legal 
or physical delimitation of a land.

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,930
This delimitation includes the notion of
property or appropriation for use.

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,788
Or both of them.

19
00:00:56,788 --> 00:01:01,350
The collectivity governs 
the delimitation and/or the use.

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,800
So the definition of the plot can
change depending on the time and the place.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,390
A set of plots is an islet.

22
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,580
And a set of islets is a piecemeal.

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,530
Therefore, the housing development is an 
operation in order to create a piecemeal.

24
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,522
The housing development can 
therefore be defined as an operation

25
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:30,654
of housing development and the result 
of that same operation.

26
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:34,626
On the other hand, we have the reparcelling
which is the contrary of a

27
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:39,290
housing development, as it is about 
gathering several plots in one.

28
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,010
So for instance, to resume our

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,349
definition of the housing development, 
the housing development is an

30
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:47,423
volunteer operation, as we can see

31
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:50,824
on the picture, of creation 
of a piecemeal fabric.

32
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:54,646
So we see three types, one here,
a second one

33
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:59,360
there and a third type of piecemeal
on the bottom of the picture.

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,254
It consists of dividing a land into

35
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:07,430
several plots, doomed to 
construction in theory.

36
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,380
By extension, the piecemeal and the housing 
development totally confuse themselves.

37
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,152
The picture is interesting here, because

38
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:19,072
it shows us diverse types of standing.

39
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:23,966
I resume my three types of
housing development with a pretty high

40
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:29,806
standing, a medium one here 
and the lowest standing,

41
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:34,063
that only consists in making 
a certain amount of plots viable,

42
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:39,430
in putting electricity poles and then in 
clearing the land and that's it.

43
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,218
The first principle, for the housing 
development, is the principle of reinforcement.

44
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:49,107
The idea behing that, is to not think about
the different elements in

45
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:52,971
an autonomous way, but to articulate them
with each other.

46
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:58,150
For example, if I have a bus station here,
an other taxi station, we

47
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,190
would rather try to put the elements

48
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,890
together, so that, at the end,

49
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,039
my taxi station and my bus station,
and also my pedestrian movement,

50
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,318
for example, could be together 
and react together

51
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:17,905
and articulate one another.

52
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:20,945
This is really the principle 
of reinforcement.

53
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:25,360
We use the elements
to reinforce all of them.

54
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,300
The second principle 
is the principle of continuity.

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,593
Continuity of the movements, continuity of

56
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:35,938
the built space, continuity of green spaces.

57
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:39,007
We try to create like this, corridors with

58
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:42,057
trees for the fauna and the flora, 
espacially the small fauna,

59
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:46,070
or for movements, 
to avoid movements to be cut up

60
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,732
and to allow them to floz 
in the city in a fluid way.

61
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,760
This is the principle of continuity.

62
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,810
The third principle is the basic principle.

63
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,730
The principle of outsourcing.

64
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,836
What does that mean?

65
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:07,061
It means that we do not have 
to find equipments specifically in the

66
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:12,463
housing development, we can imagine
a certain amount of big equipments.

67
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:17,708
Like a big hospital, that can be
outside the housing development.

68
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,235
So, the housing development doesn't need,

69
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:23,346
for its equipments, 
to be totally autonomous, but

70
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:28,380
we can go look for a certain amount of
services outside the housing development.

71
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,395
Earlier we had the principle 
of continuity as a basic principle,

72
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:35,992
we are now going to recommend 
the exact opposite,

73
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,554
as it is about the principle of
discontinuity,

74
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:41,506
actually, it is about, in the fluidity,

75
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:44,098
in the continuity, 
creating a certain amount

76
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:47,412
of exceptions, to avoid too much monotony

77
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,690
in the city and in the housing developments.

78
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,656
The fifth and last basic principle for

79
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:55,865
the housing development, 
is the principle of concentration.

80
00:04:55,865 --> 00:05:01,117
We will actually try to concentrate 
the equipments, those that

81
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:06,572
require an important accessibility,
on the crossroads

82
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:11,260
more than in places hard to access.

83
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,851
So we will use the crossroads that have a lot

84
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:18,820
of people to specifically concentrate a 
certain amount of things.

85
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,020
This is the principle of concentration.

86
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,300
An other example of 
the principle of concentration.

87
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,570
It is the concentration of a population
all around an equipment.

88
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,162
The more people we are 
in a 300 meter perimeter

89
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:37,696
of walking all around my equipment, 
or a 500 meter,depending on

90
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:41,143
the equipments, it doesn't matter, 
the more people you have in this perimeter,

91
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:47,500
the more profitable it will be 
to have an equipment in the center.

92
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,900
On the other hand, if I enlarge my plots,

93
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,100
I will for sure, in the same perimeter of

94
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:01,040
300 or 500 meters, I will have less 
people who will be able to use my equipment.

95
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,160
It is also a way to show 
the principle of concentration.

96
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,302
Here we are, we went through 
the five basic principles.

97
00:06:11,302 --> 00:06:14,082
As a reminder: reinforcement,

98
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:19,468
continuity, outsourcing,
discontinuity and concentration,

99
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:23,912
In the next videos 
we are going to talk about how

100
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:28,960
we can implement those big principles.
