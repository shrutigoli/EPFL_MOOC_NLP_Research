00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:05,535
Hello.

2
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:08,303
A synopsis, a few conclusions.

3
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:12,028
It's nearly the end of our course,
our second-to-last video,

4
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:16,321
and we'll very briefly review 
the material we've covered,

5
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:18,483
not all of its elements, of course,

6
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:23,139
since it took us these last 
12 weeks to cover them,

7
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:27,723
but I would like to focus today 
on a few important points.

8
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,665
The first is that we must keep in mind 
that urbanization,

9
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:36,382
this phenomenon that African cities 
are part of on such a broad scale,

10
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:38,491
is a global phenomenon.

11
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:43,016
Africa is relatively behind when it comes 
to the processes of urbanization

12
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,462
in other continents.

13
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:48,689
So there is enormous growth potential,

14
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,851
and thus it is in Africa where 
we have the highest urbanization rates.

15
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:58,271
We must also keep in mind 
the various contexts.

16
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:04,070
We indeed speak of African cities, 
not of <i>the</i> African city, why?

17
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,750
Because, as we see in these few images,

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,617
the realities are extremely 
different if we are in the Sahel

19
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:15,070
if we are in southern Africa,

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,720
if we are in English-speaking areas 
or French-speaking ones,

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,103
in North Africa or the sub-Sahara.

22
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:24,334
So we have contexts and realities
which are extremely different.

23
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,107
Meanwhile there are a certain 
number of commonalities,

24
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:30,802
which enable us to reflect 
on African cities.

25
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:35,218
A few figures, always 
a few figures to start out.

26
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,717
As we see, the percentages 
of urban population,

27
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:43,936
which in Africa is less than 40%,

28
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,707
so there is significant room for growth,

29
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,336
and this is why one of the challenges

30
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,565
for the African continent 
over the next few years

31
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:55,505
will surely be the issues 
of urbanization.

32
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,713
Perhaps one of the most important charts

33
00:01:58,713 --> 00:02:02,153
for an understanding of the African city,

34
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:06,554
shows that 57% in 2010, here,

35
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:10,293
57% of the African 
population live in cities

36
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:12,012
of fewer than 500,000 inhabitants.

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,222
And finally that cities of 
at least 5,000,000 inhabitants

38
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:21,032
represent only 7% of the entire 
urban population of Africa.

39
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,892
So if we wish to study
the African city,

40
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:26,689
it is the middle-sized city 
which should be studied,

41
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:31,680
and it is a city that has between 
one and five-million inhabitants,

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,464
a city which is usually 
the capital of the country.

43
00:02:35,684 --> 00:02:37,982
So we find there is a very large 
percentage of people

44
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:41,471
who live in cities of between 
one and five-million inhabitants.

45
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:46,810
This urban phenomenon surfaces 
along with the huge changes

46
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,914
which have occurred 
over the last few decades.

47
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:52,326
The first is that the city is no longer 
a closed and discrete system,

48
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:56,425
but instead a sprawling one 
which extends beyond its borders.

49
00:02:57,036 --> 00:03:00,460
The second change of this urban 
phenomenon is that of lifestyle,

50
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,151
or rather consumption patterns,
where there we tend to find

51
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,766
certain types of lifestyles, 
particularly among the elite,

52
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:13,220
on every continent, 
in every country or African city,

53
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,674
we have the same lifestyles,

54
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:19,198
or perhaps lifestyles 
which tend to be similar.

55
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:22,154
And then we have the emergence 
of new centralities.

56
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:26,870
Old cities fade away, certainly,
to leave room for cities

57
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,152
which are much newer and more dynamic, 
in economic or demographic terms.

58
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:33,542
So there is a reshuffling of the cards,

59
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:36,431
on a global level but also 
on a continental one,

60
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:39,069
with the emergence of new centralities.

61
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,588
We've also seen in this course that 
there are different forms of urbanization,

62
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,467
five of them,

63
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,536
which vary from shantytowns 
to large business areas,

64
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:53,714
passing by residential enclaves, 
gentrified neighborhoods,

65
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,795
and large residential suburbs.

66
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:57,832
So these are the forms of urbanization;

67
00:03:57,832 --> 00:04:00,774
these allow us to understand 
where people live.

68
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:07,995
Likewise, we have noted some of 
the challenges which have emerged,

69
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:12,098
particularly that of an urbanization 
implemented without economic development.

70
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:16,222
Urbanization, in the books on 
the development of cities,

71
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:21,256
is normally tied to economic development.

72
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:22,803
There, this is not the case.

73
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,196
We have urbanization which breaks away 
from this economic development.

74
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,023
A new factor is climate change,

75
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:35,559
which is not unique to Africa,
but affects all countries in the world,

76
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,433
but it is this new factor which
requires different planning

77
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:42,428
in relation to this climate change.

78
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:45,251
An important challenge: the periphery,

79
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,897
the pressure which will be placed 
on the suburbs.

80
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,127
Here we are in the suburbs of Accra.

81
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:55,775
And the major challenge 
of urbanization in Africa

82
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:59,601
over the next few decades 
will be the existing urban periphery

83
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:04,310
of cities not yet subject to urbanization.
That's where the challenge is.

84
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:05,950
The challenge lies not in 
the center of the city,

85
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,245
not in the densification of
existing suburbs,

86
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:13,534
it is in the periphery to come.

87
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:17,730
There is an important challenge 
because we are speaking of surfaces

88
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,905
which are basically 
a natural environment,

89
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:25,410
and the main challenge is 
to propose a form of urbanization

90
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,414
which takes into account at once 
the issue of nature

91
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:31,530
with that of building.

92
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,811
All this is done against 
a backdrop of general mobility,

93
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:38,388
in which people are 
more and more mobile,

94
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:41,812
they move more and more 
with all that that entails,

95
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:47,495
which is to say that infrastructure 
is needed to allow for this mobility.

96
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:51,529
We've seen four major challenges
when it comes to the city of tomorrow--

97
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:55,936
the right of every person to live
and move about in the city;

98
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:59,045
the challenge of climate, as discussed;

99
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,527
the decrease in mobility.

100
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,530
We know that mobility options 
are ever expanding,

101
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,396
but we must reduce 
and regulate these mobilities.

102
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:10,753
And, finally, to redefine 
democratic forms.

103
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:14,142
When it comes to cities, 
decision-making and urban management

104
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:20,707
will not take place without a
redefinition of democratic forms.

105
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:26,271
We've just discussed 
the paradoxes of planning,

106
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:29,055
particularly in relation 
to climate change,

107
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:34,196
with on the one hand its mitigation 
which leads to compact forms,

108
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:38,888
and the adaptation of changes 
which perhaps favors urban sprawl.

109
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:43,819
We've discussed energy issues, density,

110
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:51,179
and here the annual fuel consumption 
in relation to density per capita.

111
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:57,006
The denser the city, 
the less fuel it consumes,

112
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:00,803
the more fuel consumed, the least dense.

113
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:06,328
There too we debated 
modal shares of transport,

114
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:08,786
in relation to the GDP,

115
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:12,814
where we saw different models,
the American, the European,

116
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:17,785
and cities in development where the GDP
is still relatively weak,

117
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:22,161
and then the role of travel patterns 
also presents a challenge,

118
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:27,928
to know whether to go in the direction 
of a model which may be targeted,

119
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:31,512
with reduced energy use 
when it comes to travel,

120
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:36,723
or if one adopts the American model,
which is highly consumptive.

121
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:43,327
We reviewed the different 
types of planning,

122
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,947
which range from the strategic 
to the programmatic,

123
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:50,717
and which are based on 
the issues of land-use,

124
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:54,126
its definition, to more territorial issues

125
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:56,632
in view of the planning,

126
00:07:56,632 --> 00:08:00,116
which passed from this part to that part 
over the last few years.

127
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,084
But there still remains one framework,
which is precisely that which we see,

128
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:14,461
the framework that remains 
exactly the same in this table or that,

129
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,599
with the same types of planning.

130
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:19,695
So there has been no paradigm shift,

131
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:22,609
the universe won't change 
if we go from here to there.

132
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:25,196
On the contrary, 
we do basically the same things,

133
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:29,028
leaning towards those things that are 
more strategic and more territorial.

134
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,116
This is one of the conclusions midway,

135
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:35,122
that the paradigm shift occurred 
between the first urban plans

136
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:38,774
which were subdivision plans,
where one had spaced out the streets

137
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:46,477
with the subsequent plans which were 
more strategic and programmatic

138
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:50,705
but in which spatiality 
no longer had a role.

139
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:56,926
We won't review all these things now,
we've already discussed them,

140
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:59,050
but there are good reasons to plan,

141
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:00,881
one does not plan simply
for the sake of planning.

142
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:03,144
One plans because it is useful.

143
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:07,202
We've seen how cities were identical,

144
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,875
that they had the same 
segregative modes,

145
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:15,222
here, the example of Abidjan,
the example of Dakkar.

146
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:19,976
We've seen how the poor have 
the same strategies in their cities,

147
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:22,817
we've seen how developers 
are the same everywhere,

148
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:25,213
as are their financial backers.

149
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:28,895
There is, therefore, 
a great proximity in African cities,

150
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:34,335
the same people who work,
with the same basic materials.

151
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:39,229
And this even though the contexts 
are extremely different.

152
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,487
We have identical problems, 
one of which is land tenure.

153
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,679
We can see in an image such as this one

154
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,543
how difficult it is to regulate 
land-tenure issues.

155
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:51,321
But we also have 
the same environmental problems

156
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:54,269
of circulation, poverty, segregation.

157
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:57,628
But there are limits to this planning.

158
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,852
We've seen in current plans,

159
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:03,746
the costs of urbanization 
are not taken into account,

160
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:07,577
we see this also in current plans,

161
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,933
there is no mention of poverty,

162
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:12,803
it's as if the city had no poor people.

163
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:15,261
We also see that in current plans,

164
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:18,846
it's as if there existed 
some sort of average man,

165
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:20,437
the invention of the <i>Average Joe</i>.

166
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,654
who is an inhabitant of the city 
but who is unaccounted for,

167
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:31,400
and thus we see the disconnect 
between management and planning.

168
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,493
So normally what one plans 
is what will be subsequently managed.

169
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:39,440
And if the link is not very clear, 
this will quickly present us with problems.

170
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:43,900
So we've advocated for a type of planning

171
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:50,564
that would put lifestyle, people 
and their social activities,

172
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:55,131
at the center of the discussion 
for a subsequent reworking of the plan

173
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:57,042
in favor of one which begins with people,

174
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,657
which focuses on the individual,

175
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:04,075
and which comes not from the exterior, 
as is the case today.

176
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:07,101
Now, having said and seen all that,

177
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:10,500
we have of course imagined,

178
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,844
that we had, as always, our city,

179
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,630
as it exists today, of course,

180
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:25,721
but the city we're planning here,

181
00:11:26,014 --> 00:11:28,826
which means that we have a time frame,

182
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,033
and within this city we have
different systems which function,

183
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:37,931
now it's hard to show,
but we have a spatial system,

184
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:43,212
an economic system,
a system of actors,

185
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:45,659
so these are the three things 
which should be taken into account.

186
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:51,095
We are not speaking of issues 
of programming and spatial planning,

187
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:53,689
but there is a very important 
economic fact,

188
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:57,820
and above all a fact of governance 
or of the system of actors,

189
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,350
which is very, very important.

190
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,153
These cities present a certain number 
of challenges, as we've seen,

191
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:07,590
the right to the city, as we've seen,
the decrease in mobility,

192
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:13,045
we'll indicate the challenges 
with our little green marks here,

193
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:16,854
of course it's throughout the city
that we find challenges,

194
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:23,253
and then we have an equal number 
of constraints, challenges,

195
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:25,947
which put pressure on us, here,

196
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:30,696
major issues, of course,
we know them well,

197
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:35,112
the issues of durability,

198
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,776
the issues of environment,

199
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:41,916
the issues of poverty,

200
00:12:42,702 --> 00:12:44,070
or that of the climate.

201
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,627
There is a multitude of 
very important, very diverse issues,

202
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:50,481
and these will affect our cities.

203
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:54,333
There you have it, 
a brief summary of our city,

204
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,353
with the need for negotiation 
between elements,

205
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:04,184
between different systems, 
different stakes, different challenges,

206
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:08,043
between the questions we must pose,
the choice of societies,

207
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:10,400
we must negotiate these-- Why?

208
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,956
Because, to begin with, we must 
link together these different elements

209
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:19,800
so that they can coexist, 
yet we'll quickly realize that

210
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,703
there are a certain number 
of roadblocks which are impassable.

211
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:25,430
that cannot be linked,

212
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,630
and at this point we must negotiate 
between the two.

213
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:34,930
Will I choose to adapt to climate change, 
or instead to mitigate it?

214
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:38,038
This is a negotiation, these are 
the choices one must make.

215
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:43,526
And planning is simply 
a series of choices.

216
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:49,754
It's nothing other than a series 
of links and negotiations.

217
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:50,983
If we were to summarize it,

218
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:55,383
this is how we would summarize 
this type of urban planning.

219
00:13:55,775 --> 00:14:01,615
But we must always keep in mind 
that we deal with what already exists,

220
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:04,686
but when we embark on any future planning,

221
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:07,738
we become part of a system of actors,
whether the inhabitants,

222
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:10,036
the politics, the NGOs, private entities,

223
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:12,814
we form part of a group of actors
whom we must consider,

224
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:16,909
we are part of an economic system,
who will pay for the city?

225
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,787
We are also in a spatial system

226
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:22,665
where we must make 
a certain number of decisions.

227
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,777
There you have it.
We've summarized in a few minutes

228
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:29,068
our 12 weeks of class.

229
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,098
I won't revisit the impact 
these plans have,

230
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:35,294
since we spoke of that 
in the previous video,

231
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,631
but would like to quickly 
refresh your memory

232
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,484
and show you two things of importance,

233
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:46,257
the linking of domains,

234
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,667
one no more important than the next,

235
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:54,552
and negotiation, which are 
the social choices we will make.

236
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:57,663
We must be pragmatic 
when it comes to planning,

237
00:14:57,994 --> 00:14:59,783
basing ourselves on what exists,

238
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,808
we only do things 
which can be implemented,

239
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:08,677
utopias are interesting, 
but the urgency of planning in Africa

240
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:12,799
reserves the utopia for a future agenda.

241
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,538
The utopia is the final objective,

242
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:21,646
but we must be pragmatic today,
quick, but also reflective.

243
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:27,283
We should not rush things,
but reflect quickly,

244
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:30,710
respond rapidly,
and put in place these systems

245
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,370
which are sustainable and which 
we don't need to alter every six months

246
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,803
because we've made mistakes.

247
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:39,948
So the main objective is 
the sustainability of the system.
