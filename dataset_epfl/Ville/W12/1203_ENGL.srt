1
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:04,966
Hello.

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,460
Today is about measuring impact

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,630
Why measure impact?

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,495
Because while planning,

5
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:16,092
we still don't know if our plan,
if our forecast,

6
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:18,195
has a positive impact,

7
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,781
whether we're going
in the right direction,

8
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:21,174
towards set goals.

9
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:23,775
Due to this, we need to measure.

10
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:26,295
In order to measure,
we need a number of key indicators.

11
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:29,307
This is what we'll discuss
in today's video.

12
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:30,976
The basics of monitoring,

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,497
when we want to understand,

14
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:36,202
we want to see how things
are going in cities,

15
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,158
we need a starting point,
we need a benchmark.

16
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:41,290
We need to know

17
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,732
what the starting data value was

18
00:00:43,732 --> 00:00:46,584
and from there we can monitor
its development.

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,560
However, we need to have a starting point.

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,984
Clearly we need important data.

21
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:53,905
When it comes to measuring impact,

22
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:56,435
having two or three elements
of data won't suffice.

23
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:59,266
An array of data is needed,

24
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,347
and that data needs to be updated.

25
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:05,250
Again, there is no point
in having benchmark data

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,086
if we are unable,

27
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,922
if we don't have the resources,
we don't have the means

28
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:11,299
to update the data daily.

29
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,195
Monitoring, assessment,

30
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:18,731
is carried out to evaluate
our set objectives.

31
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,389
We're not looking to have
knowledge for its own sake,

32
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:24,037
we want to know whether or not

33
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:28,025
the goals we set have been reached.

34
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:33,186
Then, once we've looked at our objectives,

35
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,577
assessed whether our goals
were reached or not,

36
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:39,870
monitoring should then
assist the decision making.

37
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,086
It is therefore a cycle, like so,
where we will gradually understand

38
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:45,761
what is happening, see whether
we've met our objectives

39
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:47,926
and close the feedback loop

40
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:50,936
in order to redefine future objectives.

41
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:53,383
So this also helps in our decision making.

42
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:55,423
Measuring the impact of our plan

43
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:57,453
should help with the future decisions

44
00:01:57,453 --> 00:02:00,003
of that same plan.

45
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,023
As we have already seen,

46
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:03,937
in order to measure impact,

47
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,161
to be able to <i>measure</i>,

48
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,546
to find that measurement,
we need an indicator.

49
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:13,037
An indicator could be
a figure, a percentage,

50
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:18,443
but it is an element of knowledge,
of a theme.

51
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:20,300
What is an indicator?

52
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,581
An indicator can be a measure,

53
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:27,012
a measure which links
information about a theme

54
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:30,790
or which can highlight specific issues.

55
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:35,391
But an indicator can also be a variable,

56
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,884
as information simplification.

57
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:41,855
And in this way we can also highlight

58
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:44,176
a certain number of trends.

59
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:48,378
An indicator can also be a model.

60
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:53,478
A model is a simplification
of a specific subject,

61
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:54,990
usually a complex one.

62
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,540
Therefore we're trying to model,
or in other words,

63
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,550
we're trying to render
relatively complex processes

64
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,940
understandable to the average person.

65
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,700
The role of these indicators,

66
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,690
is to enable assessment.

67
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:15,444
So it's at the same time, 
from a diagnostics perspective,

68
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:19,422
it allows us to capture
the current situation of a city

69
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:22,375
and it also allows us

70
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,078
to assess impact.

71
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,712
Therefore, they're used both as

72
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:28,038
diagnostic tools and measures of impact,

73
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,634
two different things.

74
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:33,242
If we look at crime rates,
they are a measure of impact.

75
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:38,086
If I look at the square footage
of industrial areas,

76
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:40,832
it's not an impact, it's diagnostics.

77
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,016
There are two types of measurements,

78
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,342
two types of indicators,

79
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:47,122
some used more diagnostically,
and others as a measure of impact,

80
00:03:47,122 --> 00:03:50,292
with an overlap area
in the middle, of course,

81
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:53,766
and some which belong
to both categories.

82
00:03:54,387 --> 00:03:58,194
With time, indicators went from being

83
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:00,572
exclusively economic data.

84
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:03,190
It was the first type
of data we had regarding cities,

85
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,980
to more social and environmental data.

86
00:04:06,282 --> 00:04:10,498
We've also moved away 
from quantitative data

87
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:14,164
to more qualitative data.

88
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,124
Therefore, indicators can come in
many shapes or forms.

89
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,935
They can be in the form of raw data:

90
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:25,942
the price of bread,
the price of electricity, ratios,

91
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:32,089
the link between the number 
of linear feet of roads

92
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,786
and the population of a city,

93
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:39,494
which gives us an idea
of the rate of development.

94
00:04:39,604 --> 00:04:40,862
The rate of road growth and networks,

95
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:44,400
the recovery of roads
by the city's road administration,

96
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,220
based on the population, of course.

97
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,035
We can also look at percentages,

98
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:53,390
we've mentioned crime rates,

99
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,826
it may be the one used most often.

100
00:04:56,826 --> 00:05:00,700
Percentages show the rate

101
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,444
of urban development.

102
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:04,117
There are other types of indicators,

103
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:06,390
however, we won't look at them all today,

104
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,721
but just keep them in mind:

105
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:12,422
ratios, percentages or raw data.

106
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:15,877
Examples of urban indicators:

107
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:17,948
infrastructures, linear footage,

108
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:22,630
the development of infrastructure
housing, the amount of housing built,

109
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,554
as well as parks and gardens,

110
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:28,463
which is a bit of an extreme case
for our African cities,

111
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:32,011
but could we imagine an indicator

112
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:34,449
of the same size as parks
or garden in cities.

113
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:37,958
As for measures of impact,

114
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,909
we look at percentages of course,

115
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:44,683
crime rates, everything that
has to do with the population's health

116
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:46,566
in its very structure,

117
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:52,429
as well as questions like air quality.

118
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:53,933
There you go.

119
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:57,655
Here, too, there are hundreds,
hundreds and hundreds,

120
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,953
there is a considerable amount
of indicators.

121
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:02,171
The point, however, was simply

122
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:06,350
to give you 2 or 3 indicators
to help to explain the difference

123
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,930
between indicators used for planning

124
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,140
and ones used as measures of impact.

125
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,810
Concerning impacts,
we can have various themes,

126
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:21,680
we are especially looking at
social and environmental issues,

127
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,216
as, indeed, we need to understand

128
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:27,602
what is being measured.

129
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:31,050
We can measure the extent
of public policy, for example;

130
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,191
it's one of the measurement
possibilities that we have.

131
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,082
We need a clear objective
in order to measure an impact,

132
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:41,934
which allows us to see whether or not
we've reached said objective,

133
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:45,544
as well as a report
on the current situation.

134
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:48,703
Trying to measure objectives is useless

135
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:51,025
if you don't know the current situation.

136
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,743
So, if I want to look at a theme, 
we could look at transportation,

137
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:59,453
more specifically, we can look at

138
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:04,021
the number of subway stations

139
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,990
within a 500-meters radius,

140
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,863
and then, we know that
the objective would be

141
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:14,686
for 50% of the population to live

142
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:19,710
in a perimeter which is less than 
500 meters from a subway station.

143
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,357
Currently, we're maybe at 12%,

144
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:27,764
therefore, we see there is a huge gap.

145
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:30,949
We're at 12%, and we need 
to get to our goal of 50.

146
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:35,048
From here, we can therefore
gradually measure

147
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:36,144
where we stand,

148
00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:37,825
year after year,

149
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:41,506
at year 1, year 2, year 3

150
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:44,718
at first we'll be at 12,

151
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:47,748
then maybe 16%, then maybe 20,

152
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:51,548
and then we may decide
that this goal of reaching 50%

153
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:55,528
is maybe too high, therefore,
we will re-evaluate,

154
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:59,226
and lower this objective to 45%.

155
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,012
We'll then go through the same process.

156
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:05,318
We'll re-evaluate the objective

157
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,654
and we'll make a loop, in this way,

158
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,921
to see whether or not
the objective we set is attainable.

159
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,276
An example of a theme: urbanization.

160
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:20,032
This may involve relatively simple
and obvious issues such as

161
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:25,056
square footage per capita,
size of land per capita , acreage used,

162
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:30,176
but we could say we want,
as large a ratio as possible

163
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,386
of water distribution per capita.

164
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,985
So, we know, for example,
that 10% of the population

165
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:40,278
has direct access to a water tap
and one of the objectives

166
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:44,698
would be to reach, within 10 years,
20% instead of 10.

167
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:49,612
So, these are simple things
which are relatively easy to set up.

168
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:54,628
It still requires us to know
the benchmark data, the 10% benchmark,

169
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:55,638
the current situation,

170
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:57,448
with the assumption that

171
00:08:57,448 --> 00:09:01,423
we will continue to measure,
year after year or every 2 to 3 years,

172
00:09:01,423 --> 00:09:05,753
to see the situation as it is, in order 
to compare with that first figure.

173
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,663
Therefore, it is useless
to have the benchmark situation

174
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:11,315
if afterwards we don't monitor the project,

175
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:15,195
and if data isn't gradually collected,
we won't know how far we've come.

176
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,765
And during a plan's assessment,

177
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,593
if I haven't looked retrospectively
at the benchmark data

178
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:24,464
used to draw up the plan,

179
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,785
then it serves me no purpose.

180
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:29,848
We can say if it's good or bad,
if it works on not,

181
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:33,038
but we won't know whether or not
the objectives were set.

182
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:36,353
And in African cities a lot of work
remains to be done.

183
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:39,973
Not only do we have issues about
implementing urbanization plans,

184
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:44,332
but we are unable, today, to measure
the impact of what we're planning.

185
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:47,745
And this remains 
an open field since, to date,

186
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:51,905
no one has truly taken it seriously.

187
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:55,817
Of course, we have lots of departments,

188
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:58,870
lots of ministries where these things

189
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,131
are being or will be taken care of,
but the true impact

190
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:05,086
of the urbanization plan is that
we're still having difficulties

191
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:07,556
finding a satisfying example.

192
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,246
Who uses what?

193
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:12,167
We have a list of different parties here,

194
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:16,328
a list of indicators, and certain parties

195
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:19,402
need a certain number of indicators,

196
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,461
others don't need any.

197
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:24,635
Let's look at two examples.
If I'm an urban planner,

198
00:10:25,485 --> 00:10:26,497
a city's population

199
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:30,017
is a relevant indicator for me,
as I need to plan out the city.

200
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:33,867
The rate of urbanization
is also an important figure to me.

201
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,438
If I am in the private sector,

202
00:10:38,568 --> 00:10:43,121
with independent concerns
regarding populaion

203
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:46,505
then maybe it wouldn't be
the indicator I would need.

204
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:51,374
If I'm a NGO, if I am
an international agency,

205
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:56,124
if I'm the mayor of a city or
a minister of urban development,

206
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:59,290
then my objectives aren't the same.

207
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,580
Therefore, for each different objective,
we'll have different indicators.

208
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,019
And so, for each party, there will be
different indicators.

209
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:11,649
So, once you have your indicators,
it's important to know

210
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:12,872
whom they'll serve,

211
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,915
in which conditions and which contexts.

212
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:18,539
How to select indicators?

213
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:20,769
How should an indicator be?

214
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:22,947
It should be broad.

215
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,792
It should provide a general overview.

216
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,387
It's not partial, it has to be descriptive
about the city as a whole.

217
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,897
An indicator should also be measurable.

218
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:38,824
It's important as we need to know
where we came from and where we're going

219
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:42,177
An indicator should be understandable.

220
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:45,297
If it is understood only by

221
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:48,721
a small number
of specialists, it's useless;

222
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:51,048
it should be understood by everyone.

223
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:53,802
An indicator needs to
take into consideration the poor,

224
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,840
clearly, as they make up 
the majority in cities.

225
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:58,852
If all your indicators combined

226
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,283
don't establish a clear picture
of the situation

227
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:04,403
and don't include the poor,

228
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:08,643
then your indicators
were not chosen appropriately.

229
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:11,713
Indicators should also be independent.

230
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:15,443
They should not reflect bias,

231
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,865
They shouldn't serve a specific ideology,

232
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,909
but be fully independent,

233
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:25,495
And finally, they should be
available, obviously,

234
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:28,375
since an indicator which is not available

235
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,766
to everyone, to the parties who need it,

236
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:34,025
serves absolutely no purpose.

237
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:37,958
There you go, a few words.

238
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,657
Don't forget that if you want 
to measure, you need indicators.

239
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:46,097
In order to use indicators,
you need a starting position

240
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:48,787
and an ending position,

241
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:50,999
which allows an in-between measure,

242
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:53,590
and for this data is needed.

243
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,811
This data is costly in human resources,
it is financially costly,

244
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,321
and that's usually where
the problem arises,

245
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,766
as we don't necessarily have the means
to carry out urban monitoring,

246
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:08,594
which allows us to know if our plan
was well implemented or not.

247
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:12,994
Therefore, we should start
on relatively simple systems at first

248
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:16,654
with fewer indicators, wait it out,
see if it works,

249
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:20,626
see if they're useful
when it comes to decision making,

250
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:25,276
if we're able to objectively measure
what we've set up,

251
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:28,260
and if it is so we can then
make it more complex.

252
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,106
But never start out
with something too complex

253
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:37,358
as you won't be able
to update your indicators.

254
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:41,011
That's it, we'll stop here.

255
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:44,685
We have now seen 
how to design a plan,

256
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,982
how to measure our results--
We're ready!
