1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
Hello, we are going to discuss 
density, urban form,

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,507
and compact cities of present day.

3
00:00:09,507 --> 00:00:12,840
We are going to discuss what 
the English call "pattern".

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,038
And we are going to see what are the choices

5
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:21,660
that must be made when we want to design
or plan the city.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,872
There are three possibilities to fit 
into an existing urban structure.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:32,026
Here is a city I'm drawing very quickly.

8
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:34,154
Here it is with a center.

9
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:39,730
Regardless, the first possibility is
to actually intensify

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,772
the fringes, okay, to open, of course 
some new areas.

11
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,700
But we will try to build to the max
the city within the city.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,230
Second possibility, let me go back
quickly to my drawing.

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,687
The second opportunity to implement, 
the city center is further intensified

14
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:06,988
by building the city within the city 
​​but on the outskirts

15
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:11,890
new areas are developed for 
the new future populations.

16
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,354
It can be just about anywhere but it is
no longer desirable to have density

17
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:21,170
but rather a spread and then we continue 
to build the city like that.

18
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,650
Know that this is the drawing being used
the majority of the time.

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,230
Finally, the third possibility 
is the creation

20
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,990
satellites, new and future 
centers

21
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,649
which then become, without doubt, 
the new centers of the future

22
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,099
that will maybe have to be intensified.

23
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,074
So there they are, the three ways

24
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:52,740
to arrive at being inserted into 
the existing urban structure.

25
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,942
Regardless of being by an intensification 
of the existing city,

26
00:01:57,942 --> 00:02:03,895
or by an implementation in the outskirts 
of new plots of land,

27
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:09,322
or by multiplying the satellites, 
the city satellites.

28
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:13,249
The first solution is without a doubt 
the best one,

29
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:19,170
the one which we use 99% of the time 
is the second solution.

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,945
What is density?

31
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:22,223
Two possibilities.

32
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:25,710
It is the development density or
population density.

33
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,930
Development density is not 
of great interest to us.

34
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,386
This is more of a day to day.

35
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:30,906
Why?

36
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:32,518
Because we realize that there are

37
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:34,760
changes in the social structures.

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,430
Already residents of cities today in 
African cities, the drawing where

39
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,520
three generations lived under one roof 
tends to gradually disappear.

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,304
Which means that there is a need 
for more housing

41
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:53,383
since each small entity, 
each generation,

42
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:55,350
needs its own housing.

43
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,175
Also the number of square meters 
attributed to

44
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:05,350
one housing unit per person tends 
to increase in the last decades.

45
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,111
We realize that with any number of

46
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:12,759
difficulties, economic crises that 
this notion can vary

47
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,297
relatively quickly but globally 
the number of square meters

48
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,989
available of housing per person 
is increasing.

49
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,923
Which means that for the same population

50
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:25,916
the number of households is increased

51
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,471
and the number of square meters per person
is increased

52
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:31,740
which creates an explosion 
in built area.

53
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,225
This is the first densification, 
the development density.

54
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,805
But this is of no interest at all to us.

55
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:40,550
What interests in the case of an idea of a

56
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,380
a sustainable city which would be 
a compact city, a dense city,

57
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,530
is the population density which is 
expressed by number of people,

58
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,400
by thousands of people by hectare 
or square kilometer.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,690
Some examples.

60
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:01,200
We see that density is expressed by 
resident per hectare

61
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,465
with Dhaka to Bangladesh 
555 people per hectare

62
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:12,120
and then 64 per hectare in Paris.

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,730
So we see that between Los Angeles, 
extremely sparse,

64
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,601
Casablanca which has a very heavy density 
and Dhaka or Hon Kong which

65
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:27,992
have hyper densities, this is a way of 
urbanizing, a way of implementing

66
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:33,060
which is extremely different depending 
on the cities we come across.

67
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,360
Here is an example of low density.

68
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,762
We see that in fact to go from 
this plot of land

69
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:49,367
to these plots, we have a whole route 
so if we go back to the infrastructure,

70
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:55,280
the linear meter, the distance from the road 
compared to the number of inhabitants,

71
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,990
we see that it is very expensive 
to have low density.

72
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:06,100
On the other hand, high density like this
has a number of advantages.

73
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,980
We are going to take a look at them, 
it's the compact city but also has,

74
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,820
but also has a number of disadvantages.

75
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,135
It's a great cost also, a concentration

76
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:19,317
of pollution, we have already 
discussed this.

77
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:23,580
And then we see in a drawing like this 
that the public space

78
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,070
is clearly absent and the quality of life
therefore suffers.

79
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,293
So we see that between a low density
and a high density,

80
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,744
there are advantages and drawbacks.

81
00:05:32,744 --> 00:05:35,046
We will talk about the compact city, 
there is a current popular belief

82
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:38,242
which leans more in the direction 
of density.

83
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:44,296
It's important to know and I will draw 
the small diagram for you in the corner,

84
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:49,789
it's that we have both a hyper density 
which costs in energy

85
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:55,310
and a very low density which is 
equally very expensive in energy.

86
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,732
So between the two we have here an optimum
which remains to be defined.

87
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:06,585
And the optimum of the first city 
is without doubt not the optimum

88
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:12,773
of city number two, and this optimum
depends clearly on the morphology

89
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:19,402
of the city, the meteorological context, 
climate context particularly where

90
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:21,058
we will not have the same optimum

91
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:24,340
in the Sahelien cities as we do 
in the tropical cities.

92
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,468
So the advantages of the compact city

93
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:30,470
is an accessibility, facilitated of course.

94
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,180
These are relatively low 
infrastructure costs.

95
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,205
It is the possibility of preserving 
the natural resources since

96
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:43,708
we are going to arrange it in a dense way 
and then free other lands.

97
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:48,714
This facilitates social integration 
and to finish

98
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:54,198
a facilitation in the financial 
transactions since the people

99
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:59,055
are in co-presence, it's very easy 
to negotiate, to buy

100
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:02,882
to make a number of transactions 
from hand to hand.

101
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:05,180
The last point is the but.

102
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,288
But of course there is always an but

103
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:11,930
and this compact city we have 
already said it

104
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,844
with high densities, there are 
a number of

105
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:20,660
water waste management problems,
of pollution management.

106
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,885
Let's keep in mind that we have to have

107
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:27,590
an arbitration between the nebulous city
and the compact city.

108
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:33,050
And we have to take into account
all the evaluation criteria.

109
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,410
In regards to the accessibility issues, 
it's of course the compact city.

110
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,717
In regards to climate change issues, 
it's not necessarily

111
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:45,910
the compact city which best resists 
to the climate change effects.

112
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,334
Another congruent element with density, 
with the urban form,

113
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:53,800
is the issue of mixing and 
that of diversity.

114
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,640
Mixing, it can be social, 
it can be functional.

115
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,487
Urban history indicates to us that
social mixing often comes from

116
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:10,598
a sociologist fantasy since 
there are only very few

117
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:15,421
moments in the global urban history 
where populations

118
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:20,660
have not been clearly separate and where 
there has been total mixing.

119
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,845
So the mixing is more or less great.

120
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:28,260
The extreme cases being apartheid

121
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,253
but w realize that the implementations 
of the richest

122
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:35,249
with those of the poorest 
don't take place

123
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:38,210
in the cities and this social mixing

124
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,809
which is an empty promise is 
extremely difficult

125
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,695
to put in place and the examples of

126
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:45,878
urban history are there more so 
to show us

127
00:08:45,878 --> 00:08:48,650
that it is not possible to put in place.

128
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,280
On the other hand, functional mixing, 
this is very easy to put in place.

129
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,950
What is it?

130
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,874
It's that we don't have 
a neighborhood

131
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:59,110
that's only residential, a neighborhood 
that's only business,

132
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,050
but that we have a big neighborhood

133
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,270
that is both business and residential.

134
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,041
And that is what we advocate.

135
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:13,360
The African cities are by definition,
mixed cities, they have

136
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,100
a functional mixing, this is what we need
to try and maintain and keep at all costs.

137
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,455
When we have created the urban form, 
when we have chosen low density

138
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:25,176
or high density, when we have begun

139
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:29,530
to draw, future needs 
must be anticipated.

140
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,842
We are not going to draw 
the final form today.

141
00:09:33,842 --> 00:09:38,784
We must imagine that what we are drawing
today is only a step and that

142
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:44,080
we will know the final form in 10, 20, 50 
or 100 years or never but that

143
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,606
what we do today is but a first step

144
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:51,802
and as a result,

145
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:55,620
we must absolutely anticipate 
what we will need tomorrow

146
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,239
so that the urban form may be able to 
continue allowing

147
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:03,240
the implementation of needs in 
services or infrastructures.

148
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,570
But it's of no use to just provide 
a parcel for future installation.

149
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,252
The plot must still be secured.

150
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:14,516
In how many cities have we seen 
subdivisions which have been built

151
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:20,140
on plots that were for the construction 
of a hospital or a school.

152
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,464
So we must be able to then 
secure the parcels

153
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:27,740
that have been identified 
for future needs.

154
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,206
And finally when we discuss urban forms, 
we are referring to drawings

155
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:37,430
of urban forms and we are discussing 
the need for drawing public space.

156
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,300
Public space has become the poor parent 
of the city and it's exactly

157
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,650
through public space that the city 
must recreate and redraw itself.

158
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,559
So let's turn our attention to 
the drawing itself, to the form

159
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,910
of public space, to the spatiality that 
we are going to give it.

160
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,711
If we look at the big cities, 
the big urban models,

161
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:01,954
the cities which win throughout 
the world, the cities which are

162
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:06,891
taken as examples, you can see from 
London to New York, from Singapore

163
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:11,541
to Zurich, you can all that all 
these cities have made an effort.

164
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:15,340
The case of Barcelona is very 
interesting for this.

165
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,504
All of these cities have made an effort 
for public space.

166
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:23,030
And it's through this public space, 
an space open to all,

167
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,724
that we will be able to recreate 
the city of tomorrow.

168
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:29,282
So there it is for the issues 
regarding pattern.

169
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:32,450
We are between the planning 
and the design.

170
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,470
The English divide urban planning 
and urban design.

171
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,530
We have a tendency in 
the francophone world

172
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,953
to not separate them and to use 
the same ways to react.

173
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:46,000
I think that it's necessary to see if
we are discussing

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,911
at a territorial and strategic level 
or if we are discussing

175
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,835
a large scale project, about city design

176
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:58,420
and this video today was about this, 
about the choice of patterns.
