1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,440
Planning infrastructure.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,306
Infrastructure is actually
what defines how well a city is doing

3
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:14,523
what shapes a city,
determines planning.

4
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:19,209
It also conditions the city pattern,
so it is extremely important.

5
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:24,368
Infrastructure is central to urban planning.

6
00:00:24,828 --> 00:00:28,486
We have transportation infrastructure,
drinking water infrastructure,

7
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:32,124
several types of infrastructure,
as we have previously noted.

8
00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:35,460
What we'll do today
is to think about factoring

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,900
infrastructure in urban planning.

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,041
First of all, let's consider

11
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,812
that there are great discrepancies
between cities.

12
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:43,875
Why is it so?

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,462
Because there are discrepancies
between countries.

14
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:49,728
Some countries, some regions
are wealthier that others.

15
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:52,760
There are discrepancies between 
urban areas and rural areas,

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,360
between capital cities and other cities.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,194
Sometimes even within one district
there may be discrepancies.

18
00:00:58,194 --> 00:01:00,626
Which means the approach we'll take

19
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:03,760
and the way to set up a facility

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,738
will vary according to the city,

21
00:01:06,738 --> 00:01:10,300
and there are just as many situations
as there are districts.

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,550
To give a definition,

23
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,152
since we like to define
the words we use:

24
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:21,214
infrastructure refers
to all the facilities

25
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,500
that are useful to keep the city running.

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,530
Infrastructure and facilities,
broadly speaking,

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,678
are considered together,
as parts of the same thing,

28
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:34,752
which means we're talking
about roads as well as schools.

29
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,794
Infrastructure and facilities 
are often considered separately,

30
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:41,681
but when it comes to operating a city,

31
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:45,200
the very definition shows that
it's exactly the same use.

32
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:49,564
When planning, we need to know
the needs in terms of infrastructure,

33
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:53,202
both in terms of quantity
and of quality.

34
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:56,200
Quantity is usually expressed

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,600
in square meters 
when talking about inhabitants,

36
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:05,950
or in kilowatts per capita,
when talking about energy or water.

37
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,040
Quality refers to costs,

38
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,403
to the quality of the service provided,

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,761
to management, and to the quality 
of the product provided.

40
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,710
Let's take water as an example once again:

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,384
the quantity and the quality 
of the water matter,

42
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:31,018
but also the quality of the service provided,

43
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,970
meaning is there a 24-hour supply?

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,120
There may be good quality water 
in large supply but only in the morning.

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,258
On the opposite side,
there may be a 24-hour large supply

46
00:02:43,258 --> 00:02:44,830
of a very mediocre quality water.

47
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:48,590
These parameters need to be assessed.

48
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,500
They are what we call the needs.

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,400
What are the needs we are faced with
when planning?

50
00:02:56,026 --> 00:03:00,520
We tend to consider
different levels of service.

51
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:08,080
We have the type of need,
what is needed

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,431
and then level 1, level 2, etc.

53
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:16,061
These are the response to the need.

54
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:18,680
When it comes to water,

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,899
there is a need of 30 liters
per day and per head,

56
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:25,818
which is the basic need,

57
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:30,048
a very small amount, 
but let's take it as our base.

58
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,271
Then we define level 1 
as providing 30 liters,

59
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,880
a service a bit better 
would be providing 60 liters,

60
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,360
and then 90 liters.

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,438
The same goes for all other facilities.

62
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,354
Every time, there is the basic need

63
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:55,130
and how I respond to it
is the level of service I implement.

64
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,700
Then there are the standards
applying to facilities.

65
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,306
So, on one hand, we look at the needs

66
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:05,912
to determine a certain number 
of levels of services,

67
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,201
and at the same time 
there are standards for facilities,

68
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:12,250
with, for example 
if we take primary schools

69
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,470
the maximum distance should be 1.5 km,

70
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,431
20 minutes walk,

71
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:21,248
and one school 
for every 8000 inhabitants.

72
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:24,424
I gathered these standards here and there

73
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:26,280
and they do not apply everywhere.

74
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,380
The problem is that we give 
too much importance to standards

75
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,896
whereas in fact we never managed
to apply these figures.

76
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:35,750
But you should know that they exist,

77
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,500
even though they're not 
the best approach to planning.

78
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,880
However, you must bear in mind

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,132
that there must be hydrants,
sports ground,

80
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:50,290
and maximum distances to comply with.

81
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,010
When talking about infrastructure,
the customers, the inhabitants,

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,700
must have access to it
without paying a price that is too high

83
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,960
relatively to their income.

84
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,470
But suppliers must also make a living,

85
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,480
which means that investing in it 
should be profitable.

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,490
Another phenomenon 
is the impact on land prices.

87
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,181
The more infrastructure on a land,
with the limited nuisance it means,

88
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:21,965
the higher the prices of the land.

89
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:25,488
This eventually leads to social exclusion,

90
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:30,080
the poor not having access anymore
to the perimeter of the infrastructure.

91
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,016
The most striking example of this, 
and it's an example among many,

92
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:36,758
we find this in New York, in Lausanne,

93
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:39,896
but in the case of the school of Rabat

94
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:42,342
where the people who are willing 
to use the tramway

95
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,906
are a special category:

96
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:46,772
the higher classes will not,
for a question of prestige,

97
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:49,440
the poor will not,
for lack of financial means,

98
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,841
so it is the middle class who has 
the means to use the tramway.

99
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:56,008
However, the tramway is 
in the city center,

100
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:58,709
and the middle class
cannot live near it anymore,

101
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:02,092
because it pushed 
land prices and rents up.

102
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:04,918
So those taking the tramway 
cannot afford

103
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:07,544
to live in the areas
where the tramway goes,

104
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:10,610
all of it pushing the poor further 
outside the city.

105
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,080
As a result, Morocco 
and the city of Rabat

106
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,768
tried to adapt the fares
to offset this sort of things.

107
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:20,651
Let's remember this:

108
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:23,942
infrastructure can lead 
to the social exclusion

109
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:26,480
of a large segment of society.

110
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,386
A brief overview.

111
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:32,120
We won't go into the details
of every type of infrastructure.

112
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:39,281
Keep in mind that there is a link
with the price of land, which matters.

113
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:43,378
The second thing
is that one must determine

114
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:47,490
a certain number of needs,
even though, unfortunately,

115
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,080
we're not always able
to meet those needs.
