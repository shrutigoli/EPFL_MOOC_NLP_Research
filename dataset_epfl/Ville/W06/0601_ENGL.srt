00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:10,172
Hello. In today's video we'll do a 
critical reading on issues of planning,

2
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:15,312
of the planning as practiced 
today in African cities.

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,084
This planning, as practiced, is described,

4
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:24,924
this critical analysis is described, 
in the work you see here,

5
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:28,364
"The West African City," which is available

6
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:30,873
in both a French and English version.

7
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:36,928
A small reminder of the different types 
of planning, the different tools.

8
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:46,404
We'll see this as a table, with a cursor 
which can go from land use to territory,

9
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:51,851
and from the questions of 
programming to strategy.

10
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:59,737
If we have a clear land-use plan, 
we'll be here,

11
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:03,656
and the master plan will come 
from this side.

12
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:08,237
The old types of plans 
were more programmatic.

13
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:11,936
We are here and are heading towards 
the strategies of today.

14
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,737
So if I want a classic planning it 
would be somewhere over here,

15
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:24,619
and a strategic urban planning, 
such as that interpreted today

16
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:29,286
by large agencies and the World Bank, 
would put us perhaps over here.

17
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:32,502
So there is a programmatic progression

18
00:01:32,502 --> 00:01:36,153
from land use to the questions 
of territory and strategy.

19
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:39,944
There you have it, a small reminder of 
what we've already seen.

20
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:45,070
All of this is to say that we must pay 
attention to the extremes, as always,

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,903
if we find ourselves there, or 
if we find ourselves here,

22
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:52,704
we can easily realize 
that we are inevitably

23
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:56,949
on the strategic and territorial, 
but are, without a doubt,

24
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:59,403
moving too far away from 
the programmatic questions.

25
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:03,553
And these tools should be, 
at the same time,

26
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:08,119
useful as a road-map 
for day-to-day planning,

27
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,519
for urban day-to-day management.

28
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:15,768
This is not just a strategic document, 
disconnected from its context of land use

29
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:19,553
and those projects either 
in progress or upcoming.

30
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:23,553
This is truly a tool which 
should be pragmatic,

31
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:25,913
which we can use on a day-to-day basis.

32
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,083
So beyond a zone such as this one here,

33
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:37,455
it suddenly becomes 
dangerous to go further,

34
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:43,666
and we obtain documents which are useless 
for day-to-day management.

35
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:48,719
Now, as a reminder, for what purpose 
does planning serve? Why plan?

36
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:54,495
To plan allows us to implement 
the principles of sustainable development.

37
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:56,649
This is critical today.

38
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,161
To plan also allows us to have a vision, 
for both the medium and long-term.

39
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:04,012
As for the very short-term, we are 
instead dealing with questions

40
00:03:04,012 --> 00:03:05,783
of management rather than planning.

41
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:10,399
It is the medium and long term which are 
the effective time-frame for planning.

42
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,333
To plan allows for the rational 
organization of resources.

43
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:21,729
It also allows for the communication 
between a growing demand,

44
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:27,324
an increasing number of inhabitants, 
and the protection of the patrimony,

45
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:30,903
the protection of greenfield lands, 
the protection of nature.

46
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:34,068
So these are very classic issues,

47
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:37,202
which we've already addressed 
many times in this course,

48
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:41,785
but planning should serve as 
the basis of an economic activity.

49
00:03:41,785 --> 00:03:45,311
It should allow for the development 
of economic activity.

50
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:50,613
We'll deal, from this point on, 
solely with the last chapter of the book,

51
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:58,600
with just a brief overview 
of African cities,

52
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,418
which have a certain number 
of similarities.

53
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:03,183
We'll adopt the plural form of the word,

54
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:06,043
these are African <i>cities</i>, 
for they are numerous.

55
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:10,856
However, when we analyze 
a large number of cities,

56
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,715
we find a certain number 
of characteristics.

57
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:18,104
The first, within the colonial 
foundation of the cities,

58
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:20,195
is the question of segregation.

59
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:23,019
Let's use as an example that of Abidjan.

60
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:26,834
We can see that the urban 
mesh of the Le Plateau

61
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:34,502
and the urban mesh of the other side 
of the lagoon, are clearly very different.

62
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:38,951
We have a meshing which 
is not at all on the same scale.

63
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:45,302
The same in Dakar, where we have between 
this zone here and that zone there,

64
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:54,099
much denser, a zone here which was 
a buffer zone with notably large avenues.

65
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,484
The colonial city was formed 
on the same principle,

66
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:02,384
which is the principle 
of population segregation.

67
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:06,802
The native population vs. the European,

68
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:11,566
the administrative vs. the workers,

69
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:15,590
the rich vs. the poor.

70
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,984
We find ourselves in this model 
and it is interesting to see,

71
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:22,918
in a city such as Nouakchott, 
which is a new city,

72
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,643
its foundation begun in 1958, so recent,

73
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,253
to see how two years before independence,

74
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:31,901
the same model was used as a base,

75
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,404
which is a model of segregation.

76
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:38,289
So the African city is one 
of apartheid by definition.

77
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,685
Depending on the times, 
depending on the country,

78
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:46,364
this separation between populations 
has been more or less significant,

79
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:49,504
more or less strong or loose, it depends.

80
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,549
There are extremely different contexts,

81
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:56,700
but in principle we had indigenous 
populations, and European populations,

82
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,708
or the elites and the poorest 
of the populations.

83
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,599
Next, the second similarity.

84
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,570
The poor have the same 
strategies for implantation.

85
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,502
There are two strategies.

86
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,404
We see that the poorest, the shantytowns,

87
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:17,102
once developed, are normally 
near employment areas.

88
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,122
The first strategy of implantation.

89
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:23,507
Or perhaps they are on vacant lots, 
in nooks and crannies, on slopes,

90
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,905
in all areas that the city produces 
as unbuildable land,

91
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:32,550
which in fact belong to no one.

92
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,815
And it is within these gaps where 
the poorest populations insert themselves.

93
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:42,468
It is because of this, in the event of 
a problem, in the event of landslides,

94
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,328
these very same populations, 
the most vulnerable, the poorest,

95
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,580
are inevitably the ones most affected,

96
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,129
because they are often living on land 
unsuitable for building.

97
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,571
We also have another similarity: 
the same developers.

98
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:03,650
It is the same firms, the same 
thinkers, the same people

99
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,951
who develop urban plans 
from Nouakchott to Djibouti,

100
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:09,886
from Dakar to Djibouti, let's say,

101
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:14,547
from Ouagadougou to Harare,

102
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:17,214
these are large companies 
who are in charge of this,

103
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:20,595
and we ultimately find 
the same developers,

104
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:24,008
the same city-builders, 
more or less everywhere.

105
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,996
We're not making value judgements here.

106
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:29,546
We're simply pointing out how this explains

107
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:33,196
why one also finds tools 
which are extremely similar,

108
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:35,500
in the totality of African cities.

109
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:40,220
And this is reinforced, clearly, 
by the fact that we have

110
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,297
the same financial backers more or less 
everywhere, a few important investors

111
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,902
who play an important role in the manner
in which one makes a city,

112
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,912
and on the tools one puts 
in place to plan this city.

113
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:54,943
So even if in general the investor

114
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:59,339
makes as though he remains 
in the background,

115
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:02,463
we realize on a daily basis, 
as we go about our work,

116
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:07,179
that the investor is extremely present, 
likewise, on all technical questions.

117
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:10,579
There are plans, models, which 
the financial backer applies,

118
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:15,412
and it is also because of this that 
we find a certain number of similarities

119
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,212
in the whole of African cities.

120
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,413
We have cities which are practically 
identical, with identical problems.

121
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:28,155
And the greatest problem today, 
the largest problem,

122
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:32,059
and the one most often written about, 
is the question of land use.

123
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,142
Land issues are different in 
each one of these countries,

124
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:39,663
in each one of these cities.

125
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:46,201
In some countries there is the problem of
too important land sales by the state

126
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,881
of a certain number of parcels.

127
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:51,514
Too many land parcels 
are put on the market,

128
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:55,682
which leads to speculation 
and appropriation by a small group

129
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:56,931
of a certain number of parcels.

130
00:08:56,931 --> 00:09:01,538
In other cities, we'll cite the case 
of the school of Douala,

131
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:07,511
where there are issues between 
the actual inhabitants and the owners,

132
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:11,598
the state being, in fact, the owner 
of the majority of the land.

133
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:15,732
There is a game between the state 
and the inhabitants, in certain cities.

134
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:18,565
But in all the cities that we cross,

135
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:21,849
in all the urban plans 
which will be developed,

136
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:26,382
there will still remain one main problem, 
which is that of land use.

137
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:30,764
We can see here this question of 
unregulated land use,

138
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:32,548
for we are in a shantytown.

139
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:34,482
We see how the implantation of people,

140
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:39,414
of those who have occupied it, 
as squatters on the land,

141
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:46,158
and how they've made a network of roads
in the interior of this field of shacks.

142
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:50,982
So this is the primary element,
that of land use.

143
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:54,065
The second element is that 
of the environment.

144
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:58,066
We have an example here with waste.

145
00:09:57,644 --> 00:10:03,134
At the bottom of the screen we see 
some young people dealing with fish,

146
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:08,349
preparing it, cutting it, cutting off 
the heads for their clients,

147
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:12,350
and doing all this on top of 
a pile of garbage,

148
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,483
which brings us to environmental issues

149
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:18,483
of extreme relevance in certain cities.

150
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,083
This is but one example among others,

151
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,701
the environmental question 
is also that of ecosystems,

152
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:27,216
is also that of the pollution 
of air, of land, of water.

153
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:29,350
We can extend this to other domains,

154
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,017
but we see that in all these cases 
the weakest link,

155
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:36,000
in Africa, is the environment,

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,350
and it is there where perhaps the most
work should be done in the years ahead,

157
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,127
to ensure a radical change 
of this situation.

158
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:47,128
Another problem, that of circulation.

159
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:52,116
Difficult circulation, difficult mobility 
in the majority of African cities.

160
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:55,733
Here we have a taxi station in Abidjan,

161
00:10:55,733 --> 00:11:00,483
not too dense, we see that things 
are moving along relatively smoothly.

162
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:03,916
That's when all is going well, 
but there are other moments

163
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:09,665
with traffic jams which last 
for hours and hours,

164
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:11,032
in the center of the city.

165
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,466
So the difficulty of movement,

166
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,914
the difficulty of circulation, 
is extremely important today.

167
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:23,973
Now to the last problem, which is not 
a problem in itself,

168
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:26,111
but which without a doubt 
creates difficulties for people,

169
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:30,349
but which should not be placed on 
the same level as a too-dense circulation,

170
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:31,642
which is the question of poverty.

171
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:35,950
It's important to have
a positive vision of this poverty,

172
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,085
otherwise one will 
never build another thing.

173
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:42,993
But it is something to keep 
in mind as one plans.

174
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:46,117
One must know for whom one plans.

175
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:51,913
And poverty is a major issue for 
a large number of those in African cities.

176
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,199
We might now even say for the majority.

177
00:11:55,199 --> 00:12:00,232
So it is something extremely present 
in the day-to-day, for families.

178
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:03,891
And it is something which must 
be looked at globally

179
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,966
as one embarks on urban planning.

180
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:11,540
Here we see the living conditions 
in a poor neighborhood.

181
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,720
We've reached a common point, 
the last of our series, on African cities.

182
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,453
What are the current limits on this plans?

183
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:30,592
The first is that one continues to work 
by extension and by segregation.

184
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:38,113
From the moment the foundation 
is laid in these cities,

185
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:41,791
in these large African capitals, the same 
plan of segregation continues.

186
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:47,366
And one continues, in the same 
manner, to build this city,

187
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:52,350
to produce subsequent extensions, 
by subsequent parcels.

188
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,381
Thus the planning never reaches a moment

189
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:57,450
when it reflects on 
the question of segregation,

190
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,817
which continues, decade after decade, 
to be precisely the same,

191
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:05,983
just as the moment never arrives 
to address the question of expansion,

192
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:09,117
which continues, lot by lot.

193
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,589
The second important limit, 
by no means the least,

194
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:13,889
is that urbanization has no cost.

195
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:18,882
If we look at these plans as a whole, 
at the master plans of today,

196
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:25,537
we realize that the question of the cost 
of urbanization is simply not addressed.

197
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,682
This is one of the greatest 
limitations of the system,

198
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,450
for if costs are not applied to 
the actions one takes,

199
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,030
one never knows if one has or has not 
the means to carry them out.

200
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:42,845
So it is truly critical to provide 
numbers, to give a cost

201
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:46,265
to these different types of urbanizations 
which one is about to put in place.

202
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,216
Another limits, one we just spoke of,

203
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:52,117
and a common point between cities, 
is that of poverty.

204
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:57,534
We realize that the documents 
of urban planning never mention poverty.

205
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:59,899
They make it as though 
poverty doesn't exist,

206
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,063
that it is neither a specific element 
of the city, nor of its planning.

207
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:09,317
When poverty is mentioned, it is in 
the diagnostic part of planning,

208
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:13,368
forgetting later the fact that 
these cities are composed,

209
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:18,208
by a huge majority, of the extremely poor.

210
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:21,249
Another element which 
limits the scope of plans,

211
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:25,647
is that in order to plan, one has invented 
what I call the "average man."

212
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:30,267
The average man is one who works, 
who has a family, a vehicle,

213
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:33,783
who has a small house 
somewhere in the suburbs.

214
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:37,017
It is the American style 
of family, without doubt,

215
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:39,949
yet this average man, if we look at 
the statistics of Africa,

216
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:41,958
simply does not exist.

217
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:46,271
Car ownership rates clearly show us that 
the classic man does not own one,

218
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,216
that the man of the street does not, 
today, have a vehicle.

219
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:53,809
So all this planning is done 
for this average man,

220
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:57,650
who is the ghost, perhaps, 
of a middle class

221
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,709
which does not exist, 
or which barely exists.

222
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:03,348
And it is for him that one plans.

223
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:05,733
It is for him that roads are built, 
for he has a vehicle,

224
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:08,461
while in reality, this man does not exist.

225
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:10,794
And even if he does exist, 
he doesn't have a vehicle.

226
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:14,150
So this is extremely limiting in scope,

227
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,300
which is to say that one 
does not plan for the people,

228
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,790
for those who live in the city,

229
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,089
one plans for this image we have 
of a man who does not exist.

230
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:26,335
The next element is the link between

231
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:29,127
management and planning, 
which is nonexistent.

232
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:35,674
Planning is only useful if 
it guides urban management,

233
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:39,315
and if the two are coordinated. 
one with the other.

234
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:43,025
This is extremely important, 
because what one plans today

235
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,825
will need to be managed tomorrow.

236
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:48,164
So we cannot imagine 
a disconnect between the two.

237
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:52,417
Today there is on the one hand 
the city managers,

238
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,186
and on the other the planners, 
and they are not one and the same.

239
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:58,169
Which means that 
as long as these two areas

240
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:01,603
are not integrated into the same plan,

241
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:04,485
in the same way of conceiving 
the future of these cities,

242
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:06,419
we'll never achieve anything because,

243
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:14,287
we have on the one hand the planners, 
with their idea of a city, in 10-20 years,

244
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:18,553
and then we have the managers who, 
in the end, have to manage these things.

245
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:23,270
Yet this never enters into 
their management plans,

246
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,054
neither on the middle nor long term.

247
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:31,303
This, then, is the conclusion of 
the book I showed you

248
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:35,572
at the beginning of the video, 
at the beginning of this journey,

249
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:38,270
which is the question of 
another way of planning.

250
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,498
We see that there are 
a certain number of limits.

251
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:42,087
We have identical problems,

252
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:44,252
we have cities which 
are relatively similar,

253
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:47,270
we have limitations to these plans,

254
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,005
so we must know what one can do, 
despite all, in order to plan.

255
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:58,415
Because what we propose is a self-
organizing plan, one centered on people.

256
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,837
I will not dwell on this, simply that 
this is what is behind the idea

257
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:07,752
that all social practices, 
all land-use practices,

258
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:12,369
our relationship to the environment, 
all the social practices,

259
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:17,363
should be integrated in a reflection 
on the tools of planning.

260
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:22,085
We have a disconnect between 
the practices of people in daily-life,

261
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:24,532
and urban planning.

262
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:26,704
There are two solutions.

263
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:33,064
Either it is the discussion which 
is false, or practices which are false,

264
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:39,094
yet this discussion, what one says 
one wants to do and what one actually does

265
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:41,436
are two totally different things.

266
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,937
Either we change the discussion 
and tie it to our practice,

267
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:47,758
or we change our practice 
so that it ties into our discussion.

268
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:52,847
We are, today, in a situation where 
practice is of such importance

269
00:17:53,677 --> 00:17:56,219
that it is difficult to change,

270
00:17:56,219 --> 00:18:00,374
and what we propose here 
is that we adapt, partially,

271
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:03,140
at least in the beginning, the discussion

272
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,146
to an informal one, 
on the question of land use.

273
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:11,619
It is useless to wish, at all costs, 
to formalize the informal,

274
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:15,737
unless one realizes that the majority, 
the totality of people,

275
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:20,503
in their day-to-day relationships, 
in their day-to-day social practices,

276
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,897
reside in the informal.

277
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:26,619
There is no point in attacking things 
that cannot be changed.

278
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:30,169
These are not urban plans which 
will change ancestral practices.

279
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,171
We must now readjust our discussion 
in function of this,

280
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:38,424
go back to these practices, view what 
people do and how they do it,

281
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:44,987
and revisit the tools of urban planning 
in terms of these social practices.

282
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:50,167
It is not participation, it is not 
a process of decisions taken by all,

283
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:54,470
but rather to be able 
to integrate these practices,

284
00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:01,371
those of the land owner, those of 
the political elite, other practices,

285
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:06,438
and directly integrate them 
in our planning tools.

286
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:09,820
Otherwise all this serves no point.

287
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,466
If you embark on planning without even 
considering the question of land use,

288
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:18,353
and without trying to elicit 
some sort of response,

289
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:23,123
we already know that your planning 
will serve absolutely no purpose.

290
00:19:23,883 --> 00:19:27,296
So in a few words, a brief overview,

291
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:31,488
I refer you to the book, 
you'll find in its conclusions

292
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:33,737
all of the topics we've discussed here,

293
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,634
as well as other supplemental topics,

294
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:43,542
which we simply didn't have time 
to explore in the course of this video.
