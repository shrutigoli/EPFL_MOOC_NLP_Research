1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,610
Hello.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,220
Here, I would love to share ten basic 
principles while planning.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,721
So we could give 20, we could give 50

4
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:14,110
we could give three.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,706
I have come up with ten principles

6
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:22,880
that seem obviously essential 
while planning.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,582
So of course, they are not

8
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:27,750
directly operational to the plan.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,868
We cannot draw the principles like this

10
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,821
but we must keep them in mind 
when we are planning.

11
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:37,690
Always keep in mind these ten principles.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,464
And then at each stage we can reconsider

13
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:43,090
our plan in the light 
of these principles.

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,959
Do I realize the first principle, 
the second?

15
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,222
And maybe if none of these great

16
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:53,212
principles mentioned here is used 
in the planning,

17
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:56,770
maybe we need to look again a little bit 
the plan which

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,010
is about to be put in place.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,440
The first principle, we put it at number one 
because it's important.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,935
The importance of the pedestrian.

21
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:07,600
So this goes against everything 
we do generally,

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,823
since we are more focused on
the importance of the car.

23
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:16,200
The planning creates new roads, 
new highways,

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,952
new intersections, one more 
prestigious than the other

25
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:23,356
with roundabouts, sculptures,

26
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:27,716
statues in the middle, but I would like 
to put the emphasis on the pedestrian.

27
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:31,960
The majority of people in African cities
get around on foot.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,600
If we want to make the city 
for the majority of people

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,280
it's therefore a city for pedestrians
that must be created.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,690
So let's keep this in mind as rule #1, 
I favor the pedestrian.

31
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,616
We have seen it in 
the city models,

32
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:49,756
throughout the introduction
to this course that there are

33
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:52,000
cities like Kuala Lumpur

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,306
that are already much more advanced 
regarding pedestrian issues.

35
00:01:56,612 --> 00:01:58,920
Why wouldn't African cities 
be as well one day?

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,574
So it is not well seen for some 
to take walks, but know that

37
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:09,966
the majority of city residents 
go about on foot.

38
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:12,482
And it's for them that 
we create the city.

39
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:16,148
The second principle, we must think spatially.

40
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:18,644
This is the risk when we are 
dealing with strategy,

41
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:22,061
we forget the spatial question.

42
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:28,157
However, the purpose of the city is a 
city ​​that is three-dimensional, a street

43
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:31,244
that goes from here to there, 
that has dimensions,

44
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:34,041
the plots have dimensions.

45
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,420
So the spatiality is very important, 
and we must think about

46
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,420
the spatiality we are putting in place 
when we are planning.

47
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,546
We are not just dealing with strategy 
and communication, we are also

48
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:53,260
dealing with physical issues, 
real issues, spatial issues.

49
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,737
The planning serving above all 
to organize the activities

50
00:02:57,737 --> 00:03:01,710
which have a spatial impact 
on the land.

51
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,970
So it is important to think about it and 
have this as a basic principle.

52
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,290
Think about spatiality.

53
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,556
The third principle, you must have 
a minimalist approach.

54
00:03:13,556 --> 00:03:16,116
In all cases, the large majority

55
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:19,842
of cities have limited 
financial resources.

56
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:23,882
We must have a a pragmatic approach 
but minimalist as well.

57
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:28,520
We are thankful to some infrastructures
a basic structure.

58
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,484
Minimal structures that then allow

59
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:34,230
to complete, then to develop.

60
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,130
But basically, we try to see what 
is the minimum that I can

61
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,470
put in place to have the maximum effect 
and not the opposite,

62
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,230
as we see in most cities.

63
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,230
Another principle is that we need 
efficiency in resources.

64
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,640
The resources are limited, we have to be 
efficient in their use.

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,440
In all the resources, be they

66
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,400
financial, be they natural.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,434
be they human, we have to 
be careful to use

68
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:03,314
these resources the most 
harmoniously possible.

69
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:07,680
The fifth basic principle, is that 
opportunities must be developed.

70
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,620
What we are going to do, what
we are going to put in place,

71
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,690
the planning has to be supportive of 
opportunities for further development.

72
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,534
We are not in something that is closed.

73
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:25,085
We are dealing with an open process and 
the process must generate a number of

74
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:31,412
opportunities and that will then become
jobs, that will become other things.

75
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:36,410
But we have to provide the base to open
opportunities and not shut them out.

76
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,750
The sixth point, sixth basic principle, diversity.

77
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,740
We sometimes talk about mixing, 
we need diversity in the cities.

78
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,004
The idea is not to have neighborhoods 
with the same houses,

79
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:53,244
the same people who go around 
in the same cars,

80
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:56,992
but rather mixing and diversity,

81
00:04:56,992 --> 00:05:00,690
which allows the resident 
to have a vast choice.

82
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,560
Diversity in the economy allows for 
lowering of prices,

83
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,300
and having the choice of many products.

84
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,135
When there's only one product 
which is on the market,

85
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:13,550
we don't have a choice, we have to 
buy it, no matter what the price is.

86
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,960
Diversity allows to lower the costs 
but diversity allows also

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,130
to liven up the city and to increase
the quality of life within the cities.

88
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,070
The seventh principle, equal access.

89
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,780
They are not those who have access 
to the city​​, and those who have not.

90
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,955
It's important to give

91
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:38,730
all people who have a voice

92
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,534
when they vote, they must be given

93
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:46,340
equal access to infrastructures 
and facilities.

94
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,910
This is a basic principle that must 
absolutely be held onto.

95
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,662
We see more and more cities being born
from segregation,

96
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:57,270
access differentiated depending on

97
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,880
any number of criteria in the population.

98
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,205
We need a city open to the maximum

99
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:10,170
for all of the inhabitants of this city,
whomever they may be.

100
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,654
And this leads to the issue of 
diversity of people, and it is

101
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:19,410
in this diversity that urban quality 
surfaces and with it human quality.

102
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,205
Look at the big cities you know.

103
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:26,049
Look at the places you love to go to, 
and you will see that these places

104
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:29,880
are built on diversity, built on 
the quality of access.

105
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,640
Which brings us very naturally to 
the eight point,

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,980
this quality of access as a main point,
also as a basic principle.

107
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,008
We don't only need one access,

108
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:47,866
we also need to have a quality 
to this access.

109
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:52,585
And this search for quality, 
it's the search

110
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:57,120
for quality of life, quality of 
the urban environment.

111
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,540
So we have both quantitative issues,

112
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,670
or rather, do I have access or not, 
and how do I have access?

113
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,820
And it's important, this notion of quality

114
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,195
which is difficult to define and 
which we will not define here,

115
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:13,637
not right away, but it's of course one of

116
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:17,730
the main elements, is the quality of life 
of the population.

117
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,740
So everything we are going to put in place
is to increase this quality.

118
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,350
The second to last principle, 
sustainability of the action.

119
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,470
Everything we plan has to be 
sustainable with time.

120
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,467
If we realize that it's not sustainable,

121
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:36,860
this means that we will quickly have a problem.

122
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:43,570
So we are going to put in place a number
of physical, spatialized elements.

123
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:49,460
We are going to plan, program things 
that have to be sustainable in time.

124
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,876
And finally, the principle itself, 
planning,

125
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:57,220
it's about working on the medium 
and long term.

126
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,830
So we have said that we had to 
be sustainable, but we have to

127
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,370
truly set as a principle, the work on

128
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,088
the medium and long term, 
the short term being left

129
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:14,784
generally to the urban management who 
manages the city on a daily basis.

130
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:18,061
What we are interested in is the medium

131
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:21,327
and this long term, indeed, 
this very long term, even if

132
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:25,202
in the case of the very long term, there
is little chance we will get today

133
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:28,950
to plan something for the next 50 years 
or 100 years.

134
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,673
So let's remain more reasonable on 
the 10 or 20 years to come,

135
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:37,429
it's already a very faraway horizon.

136
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:42,152
The most result that we can have, 
is two political legislatures.

137
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:46,470
So sometimes it's eight years, 
sometimes it's ten, but we are

138
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,430
dealing with, in these waters, almost

139
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,150
a term planning, ten years.

140
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,110
There they are, the basic principles.

141
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,000
It's on these principles that we 
are going to then build a plan.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,920
So you have seen that certain ones 
are directly linked,

143
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,954
for example the question of access and 
the question of quality of access,

144
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:09,935
the question of sustainability

145
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:13,280
and the question of the medium 
and the long term.

146
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,524
It's normal, all these principles 
have a link, all these principles

147
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:23,640
have to be articulated which 
then leads to a plan.
