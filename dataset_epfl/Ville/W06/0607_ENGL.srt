1
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:06,674
In our video, we'll take another look
at climate change.

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,259
Another look, since we have already
mentioned this issue.

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,690
We'll talk about how this issue
can be planned.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,008
We'll take a certain number of items

5
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:17,977
that we have mentioned previously.

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:21,338
Climate change summons up
two words:

7
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:24,080
adapting and mitigating.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,401
Either we adapt to the changes:

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,774
the higher the sea level,
the more we'll factor it in in our buildings.

10
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:32,641
Or we mitigate,
which means we'll fight against

11
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:35,365
the effects of climate change.

12
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:37,885
So, either I adapt to rising sea levels,

13
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:41,511
or I prevent sea levels from rising more.

14
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:44,422
Then, from the perspective of populations,

15
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:47,189
there is a capacity for people to adapt,

16
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,446
but also from the perspective
of governments

17
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:54,220
there are financial, social capacities
to adapt to climate change.

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,305
At the other end of the spectrum
is vulnerability, being unable to adapt.

19
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:02,319
These are the four elements
to keep in mind

20
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:06,470
when discussing climate change
and urban planning.

21
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,810
What are the effects?

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,743
Let's take an example:

23
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:13,806
there are the effect itself, 
the problem it poses,

24
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:18,690
and the the measures at our disposal
in terms of urban planning.

25
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,899
Example: rising temperatures.

26
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:25,982
The problem are the heat spots,
everywhere in the city.

27
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:29,680
the measures to be considered
are planting trees,

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,350
the shaping of public spaces,
air currents in the streets, parks.

29
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,950
Another example: 
the rising number of insects

30
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,410
as a result of rising temperatures.

31
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,050
These are issues 
that are not well-known yet

32
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,340
but that will be more widespread.

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,283
What is there to do?

34
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:51,304
We can fight against insects,
with chemicals,

35
00:01:51,304 --> 00:01:55,305
but there is also the option
to drain certain wetlands.

36
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:59,393
Mitigating the effect of the change,

37
00:01:59,393 --> 00:02:02,126
in terms of urban planning,

38
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:04,154
means to make some important decisions.

39
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:05,818
We mentioned compact cities

40
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:08,622
that are less energy-consuming
than spread-out cities,

41
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:10,764
with all the caveats I mentioned

42
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:14,072
and the several other factors 
that need to be monitored,

43
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:17,190
but let's say that compact cities

44
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,975
would produce less green house gas

45
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:22,482
and, as a result, urban planning

46
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:24,990
is a way to mitigate.

47
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,662
On the other side,
the problem of heat spots

48
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:32,150
is a direct consequence 
of the effect of climate change.

49
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,859
There is not much to be done
apart from adapting

50
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:38,750
with a series of measures
in terms of urban planning.

51
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,825
Let's take an example of adaptation:
I'm going to draw three coastlines.

52
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:51,880
The water is here,
and we have three options.

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,607
If my house is right here,

54
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:59,412
I can move it,
or ban construction on this land,

55
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,927
thus saying:
for now on, future houses

56
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:05,456
will be built there 
and we'll take this out.

57
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:10,394
I can also decide that future houses

58
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:13,877
will be above ground, on stilts,

59
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:17,793
so that in case of floods
the water will be at stilt level.

60
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:25,660
Third option:
there is a house here and I build a dyke

61
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,290
so that if the sea level rises,
I won't face the consequential floods.

62
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,240
So, three examples 
of possible adaptations.

63
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:38,545
I don't want to pass judgments,

64
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:40,755
yet some are more expensive than others

65
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:42,700
and some are more sustainable than others.

66
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,453
For the millions or billions
of people living along the coast,

67
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:49,580
throughout the world,
at risk of rising sea levels

68
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,428
and who are very vulnerable indeed,

69
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:57,440
we need to start thinking 
about solutions.

70
00:03:58,294 --> 00:04:02,598
In a previous video,
we talked about the relation

71
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:06,392
between abundant tropical rains
leading generally

72
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:09,720
to a spread-out city pattern,

73
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,840
whereas, when in the heart of Sahel,
we'll rather find compact city patterns.

74
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,567
That brings us again to
compact versus spread-out.

75
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:22,683
Then comes this dual judgment call
we are faced with

76
00:04:22,683 --> 00:04:27,010
between urban patterns
and between adaptation and mitigation.

77
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,950
Will I choose to adapt my situation
to the problem ?

78
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,390
If so, to what extent 
can my populations adapt

79
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,880
and how vulnerable are they ?

80
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,218
If I choose not to adapt
but to fight against the effects,

81
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:41,820
what are the elements
I implement

82
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,720
to truly work against these effects

83
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,937
and substantially reduce
the effects of climate change

84
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:51,100
in the coming years ?

85
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,502
Today we have these dual questions.

86
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:59,040
There is, probably, 
a dual constraint, too.

87
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,961
In other words, it's either

88
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:03,452
working on adaptation
or working on mitigation,

89
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:05,614
because the effects or demands

90
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:08,228
to work in one direction or the other

91
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:10,694
are often two totally 
opposite directions.

92
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:14,570
There will be choices to make
over the coming years, drastically so.

93
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,713
We should bear in mind
all the different elements

94
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:20,854
that we have mentioned
in previous videos,

95
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,760
with the competing needs 
for a transportation system,

96
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,794
for urban agriculture,
for climate change issues,

97
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,721
for housing, for infrastructure,

98
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:32,241
all of which requires choices

99
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,920
based on needs

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,470
but also on what we want to develop
in terms of city pattern.

101
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,840
The final decision on the pattern
is yours to make, of course.

102
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,051
What we're doing here

103
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,731
is showing the mechanisms
and means of action

104
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:48,211
that can be used, or not used,

105
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:51,521
in order to change 
the situation of cities today.
