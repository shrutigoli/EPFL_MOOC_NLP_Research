00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:09,425
Hello, in today's video we'll discuss
transportation, travel, mobility,

2
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:15,692
and the link between transportation, 
land-use planning and urban planning.

3
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:18,678
There is a direct and concrete link

4
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:22,776
between the transportation system 
and the urban landscape.

5
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:24,824
It's the story of the chicken and the egg.

6
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,641
We don't know if it's the transportation 
system which creates the urban form,

7
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:31,657
or the urban form which generates 
the transportation system.

8
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:32,791
It's both at the same time.

9
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:36,991
I imagine one plays 
on the other and vice versa.

10
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:43,191
But we must keep in mind this extremely 
important correlation between the two.

11
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:47,842
There is an overlap between urban form 
and its systems of transportation.

12
00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:52,069
A concrete example: employment areas.

13
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:54,970
The densest areas are also the zones

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,424
where we find the most 
public transport, for example.

15
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:01,626
Why is that? Because of issues 
of cost-effectiveness.

16
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:06,124
For a public transport system to be 
economically viable, or at least useful,

17
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:11,491
it requires a minimum number of people 
within a given perimeter.

18
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:15,224
Without this, the transportation system 
has absolutely no purpose.

19
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:19,312
And so we have this overlap 
between population density

20
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:22,947
and the opportunity of having 
public transportation.

21
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:27,730
What this also means is that 
it influences land-use costs.

22
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,595
The more public transport, 
the greater the connectivity,

23
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:35,142
the more networks, 
the higher the land cost.

24
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:41,594
There is a correlation between, 
on this side here, density,

25
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:46,237
and the number of trips per person.

26
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:52,105
If I am in my car, my density increases,

27
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:56,700
and the fewer trips I will make by car.

28
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,171
And if we look at the bicycle, 
or of walking,

29
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:09,600
I am in the opposite position, 
because the denser I am,

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,437
the more walking I will do 
and also take public transport.

31
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:16,943
The denser I am the more I will walk.

32
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:22,738
So when we speak of transportation, 
of cars, of trips taken,

33
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:24,854
we are speaking equally 
of traffic congestion.

34
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:28,422
In order to avoid traffic congestion 
we must ensure that

35
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:36,638
the road grid, the roadway system, 
is extremely diffuse, hierarchical,

36
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:42,310
and that it connects all zones 
of significant population.

37
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,875
On the contrary, we can imagine that

38
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:48,746
the best system of traffic control
is traffic congestion.

39
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:54,306
In principal, highway engineers, 
transportation engineers,

40
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,338
jump up and down when they hear that,

41
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:58,470
but it is one way to regulate it.

42
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,755
Rather than expanding
the roadways each time

43
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,338
in order to allow more people
to pass through them

44
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:04,222
we might say, instead, 
that the limit is reached,

45
00:03:04,222 --> 00:03:07,671
to leave the congestion,
certain that new arrivals

46
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:10,775
will not take those routes because 
they are already congested.

47
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:13,686
An American urban planner, 
whose name escapes me,

48
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:15,588
said something which is very true,

49
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:19,993
which is that one cannot cure obesity 
by loosening one's belt.

50
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,005
In the road system, 
the more roads I make,

51
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:24,506
the more highways I build,

52
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:26,354
the greater the travel, 
for the more cars I have,

53
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,723
the greater the need 
for roads and highways.

54
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:30,353
We learn this relatively quickly,

55
00:03:30,353 --> 00:03:33,287
but we arrive very quickly 
at the saturation point

56
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:35,936
of the infrastructure we've put in place.

57
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:38,506
We are at saturation, 
and we create new highways

58
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:41,837
which in a few years 
will equally be at saturation.

59
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:45,005
So we must keep this 
in mind while planning.

60
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,656
We must know what we are doing.

61
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:49,222
More is often the enemy of what is good,

62
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:54,188
for it is not because I create more roads 
that the situation will improve.

63
00:03:54,188 --> 00:04:00,338
And on the contrary, once again, 
road congestion regulates traffic.

64
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:03,638
Second element after 
congestion, car-free zones.

65
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:08,404
It is trending in European countries, 
more and more in the U.S.

66
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:10,121
Let's take the case of New York,

67
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:12,938
where entire zones have been 
returned to the pedestrian.

68
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:16,805
They began this way, 
for there weren't many cars,

69
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:21,138
but the roadways and the right-of-way 
was given to the vehicle,

70
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:24,520
so today the attempt is 
to reduce the right-of-ways

71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,755
dedicated to vehicles, 
and give them to pedestrians.

72
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:31,308
This is a modern approach,

73
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:34,921
one that absolutely should be promoted.

74
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,389
This is one of our principles,

75
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,440
which we saw in an earlier video 
on core principles for planning.

76
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,392
It is extremely important, 
particularly for the African cities,

77
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:49,164
where the enormous majority 
of people are pedestrians.

78
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:54,955
A quote that I like very much, which is 
from the ex-mayor of Bogota,

79
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:57,220
who served between 2011-2012,

80
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,806
which says that "a developed country 
is not a place where the poor have cars.

81
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:06,155
It's where the rich 
use public transportation."

82
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:09,438
And it is truly here where 
work needs to be done.

83
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:13,275
It is on this model, 
the social model behind it,

84
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:18,754
and it is not the idea that 
everyone will have a car,

85
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:21,088
since the rates of car ownership in Africa

86
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,721
are fewer than 100 vehicles 
per 1000 inhabitants,

87
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:25,889
so this is a puddle compared to Europe,

88
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,005
which is at around 500 vehicles 
per 1000 inhabitants,

89
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:33,172
or the U.S. where there are
more than 600 per 1000.

90
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:36,520
We see that when it comes to 
the European and American models

91
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,503
there is a lot of latitude,

92
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,506
and the idea is not just 
to utilize this margin,

93
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:45,849
but rather to reflect upon 
which system to put in place.

94
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:50,588
We have transportation options, 
for as we plan we must make choices,

95
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:54,153
and these choices depend on
a certain number of criteria.

96
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:59,806
Among the transportation options we have
the bus, the BRT, the light rail, the metro,

97
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:05,236
with investment requirements, 
capacity, speed, travel time

98
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:07,088
and environmental impact.

99
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:14,088
And in each case we can classify these
as either low, medium, high, or very high.

100
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:16,721
So we know that with 
the metro, for example,

101
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:19,188
we have a very large investment,

102
00:06:19,188 --> 00:06:21,722
but a capacity which is also very high,

103
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:24,709
and a speed which is very high, etc.

104
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:28,755
On the other hand, the bus, which has 
low investment requirements,

105
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:33,056
a medium capacity, 
but also a very low speed.

106
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:36,089
So we find that, depending on
the choices one makes,

107
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:40,554
we will not have the same impact on 
the environment, the same capacity,

108
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:44,256
and the interesting relation 
is ultimately that between

109
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:46,738
on the one hand the capacity 
and the investment,

110
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:49,714
which gives a cost per person 
or cost per kilometer.

111
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:54,865
The modal choice, the choice of mode 
of transport is an individual one.

112
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:59,839
The people will decide which 
method of transport to take,

113
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,571
which they'll choose depending 
on certain criteria, which include

114
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:06,097
the distance to travel,
the shape one is in,

115
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:08,639
Can I move about or not?

116
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,839
The time needed for travel,

117
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,005
if I have five minutes of travel time 
it is not that same as if I have an hour,

118
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:18,509
so I will choose my method 
of transportation differently,

119
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,623
My load---what do I have to carry?

120
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:25,922
Do I have just a bag or a full load?

121
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:33,621
Comfort level, security. Am I more secure 
using one method or another?

122
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:37,089
And, finally, parking availability, 
which is logical,

123
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,737
for if I take my vehicle I want 
to know and be certain

124
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:43,421
that I will be able 
to find a place to park.

125
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,602
Otherwise I might choose 
a different mode of transport.

126
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:49,056
Here's an example, in N'Djamena,

127
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:50,641
between its northern and southern areas,

128
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:54,956
where we see cars, bicycles, motorbikes,

129
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:59,694
and, of course, all along it 
the pedestrians who cross the bridge.

130
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:02,155
When we discuss modal choice 
there is the question

131
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:03,783
of the individual who makes this choice,

132
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,740
but also the question of the collective.

133
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,105
What are the operative choices?

134
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:12,170
And what are the criteria used to make 
these choices for the collective public?

135
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:17,621
In sum, we can go on foot, 
on a bike, motorcycle, private car,

136
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:20,674
taxi, public transportation.

137
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:24,754
And all these modes, 
whether public or private,

138
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:30,671
have, most of the time, their own 
specificity, as we'll see.

139
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:36,671
And we should reflect today, 
in terms of space.

140
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:39,200
Not all modes of transport 
use the same space.

141
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,371
If I have here a lane which 
measures 3.5 meters

142
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:52,389
we know that of pedestrians, we will have 
19,000 who can pass per hour,

143
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:56,436
we'll have 14,000 bicycles,

144
00:08:56,436 --> 00:09:00,089
So more pedestrians will pass 
per hour than bicycles.

145
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,670
And we know that with mixed traffic, 
only 2,000 people will pass.

146
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,538
So space plays an important role,

147
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:09,437
when I plan the space at my disposition,

148
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:12,221
the space which I want
to put at the disposition

149
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:15,537
of the people who travel through it.

150
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:18,921
Equity---which is extremely important,

151
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:22,393
particularly in the cities 
of the south, social equity.

152
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:27,674
For the moment we give access to 
the fastest, the heaviest, the richest,

153
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:33,390
and we can imagine a system 
which grants access to the less costly,

154
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,437
the less polluting, the most fragile.
Why not?

155
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:38,306
This is truly the question of equity.

156
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:41,465
What do I favor and who will I favor?

157
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:44,520
The question of security 
also becomes very important.

158
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,737
To lower the number of accidents is 
an extremely important phenomenon today,

159
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:54,721
since the number of auto accidents 
in cities is considerable.

160
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:57,369
The question of energy.

161
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:02,455
We know that the energy spent differs 
depending on the mode of transport.

162
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:09,363
We must choose each time-- 
which will we use, which will we not?

163
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:11,505
The environment.

164
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:14,506
Clearly linked to energy, 
but the impact on the environment

165
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:17,945
of certain modes of transport 
is much greater than others.

166
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:21,921
The car has a significantly greater 
impact on the environment,

167
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,953
logically, than the bike.

168
00:10:23,953 --> 00:10:27,037
So these are the choices 
one must make and, finally,

169
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:32,595
a very important criterion 
to consider is that of cost.

170
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:37,137
These are not the same if we are walking, 
on a bike, or taking public transport.

171
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,422
And it's not the same thing 
if the cost is paid,

172
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:42,864
if the transport is paid 
by private car or by taxi.

173
00:10:42,864 --> 00:10:44,203
Who bears the costs?

174
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:46,221
And how much does this transport cost?

175
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:50,393
There is cost per kilometer, theoretic 
cost, and then there is, finally,

176
00:10:50,393 --> 00:10:53,305
whether it is the collective who 
pays a portion of this cost,

177
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:57,617
or the owner who pays all costs.

178
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:00,005
So, a brief overview.

179
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:03,488
How do I plan? How do I make choices?

180
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:07,188
modal choices, individual choices, 
collective choices.

181
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:11,806
And we must keep in mind 
that the choices I make

182
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:15,721
are those of society, 
of equity or inequity,

183
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:20,025
and above all, they will have an enormous 
impact on the environment.

184
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:24,340
We can use the environment, 
or energy as our main criteria,

185
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,938
but we might also take into account 
multiple aspects, and utilize

186
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:34,205
in an articulate way all criteria
in order to make the best choices.

187
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:36,722
But always keep in mind that urban form

188
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:40,205
and transportation systems 
are directly linked.

189
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:43,864
When we discuss climate change, 
we'll keep this in mind.

190
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:47,255
When we discuss density, 
we'll keep this in mind,

191
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:51,022
this question of urban form and 
transportation or public transport.

192
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:53,205
And we know that the diffuse city

193
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:58,724
is the urban form least favorable 
to public transport.
