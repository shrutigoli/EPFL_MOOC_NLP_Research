1
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:06,413
Today we'll talk about urban agriculture.

2
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:09,040
From the start, 
there are three questions.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,170
When saying urban agriculture

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,592
it involves first and foremost
acknowledging agriculture in cities.

5
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:20,560
It also involves planning spaces

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,366
and managing this activity.

7
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:29,788
In simple terms,
urban agriculture is working the land

8
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:34,600
within the boundaries of a city,
or the suburban area, most often.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,434
It means taking advantage
of the gaps, of unused land,

10
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:42,228
of everything that lends itself
to agriculture.

11
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:45,245
Every possible resource is used:
land, water,

12
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,262
and afterwards the markets
to sell the products,

13
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:51,280
and all that happening within a city.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,288
Urban agriculture appears 
to be an oxymoron,

15
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,017
two contradictory terms.

16
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:58,486
Why?

17
00:00:58,486 --> 00:01:00,586
Because, on one hand,
there is agriculture

18
00:01:00,586 --> 00:01:04,180
strongly associated with rural areas,
where agriculture is done,

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,242
and on the other hand
the urban world,

20
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:09,680
which by definition is not rural,
and so should not have agriculture.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,885
The conventional definitions of cities

22
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:14,290
do not take agriculture into account.

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,740
There are also many people
who are strongly opposed

24
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,490
to any agriculture within cities.

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,380
Why?

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,070
Because these activities
should not take place

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,300
within the city boundaries.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,810
Then, there is the opposite point of view,

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,778
acknowledging the vital importance
of urban agriculture

30
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:35,607
for African cities today

31
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:38,340
and taking it into account
in the planning process.

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,280
We'll see that 
there are some vexed issues

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,001
when planning agriculture 
within city boundaries,

34
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:48,301
one of them being land ownership,

35
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:54,240
but the social stakes are very high 
when it comes to urban agriculture.

36
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,721
Agriculture encompasses
social aspects,

37
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:05,235
issues of space, of resources,
of risks associated to it.

38
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:08,085
Let's go through every item
one by one.

39
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,295
First, the social issue.

40
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:13,556
Extremely important in social terms:

41
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:16,817
it's a source of income
that is not insignificant

42
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:20,080
for families that are, most of the time,
the most vulnerable.

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,840
There is a question of empowerment
behind this,

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,600
at least for some populations:

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,041
feeding oneselves,

46
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,848
even being able to sell some 
of their produce to make a bit of money.

47
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:36,020
It does have an impact to be considered
on employment.

48
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,439
The issue of space is extremely important.

49
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,529
Why?

50
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:42,320
Because agriculture requires space.

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,056
Except for Cuba, 
where during the Special period

52
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:48,200
every flower pot was turned into
a micro field planted with something

53
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,370
and every possibility to grow something
in the city was seized,

54
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,360
the usual pattern
is to use suburban lands.

55
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,648
Hence the question of space:

56
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:02,750
will I choose to build dense housing

57
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,790
or choose a more spread-out pattern

58
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,820
leaving room for agricultural production,
meaning income generation?

59
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,269
This is one thing.

60
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,255
The second thing is 
that the denser a city,

61
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:17,310
the more pressure there is 
on land prices.

62
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,160
At some stage, prices are so high
that it doesn't make any sense anymore

63
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,748
to grow a few vegetables,
and it drives people even further.

64
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:26,764
The issues at stake here

65
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:29,800
is the opposition between
spread-out cities and compact cities,

66
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,962
the issue of land use,
land speculation,

67
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,458
but also simply of land markets,
which, in most of the countries

68
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:40,282
and cities we are dealing with,
are open markets,

69
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:43,968
meaning they fluctuate
according to several factors,

70
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:46,982
but governments 
do not have the power

71
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:50,515
to regulate land prices,
which poses a real problem

72
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:53,380
leading to pressure being put
on urban agriculture.

73
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,715
Let's move now 
to the issue of resources.

74
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:57,402
Water is necessary.

75
00:03:57,402 --> 00:04:00,574
Not only is there a need
for a sufficient amount of water,

76
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,028
but this water needs to be good enough, too.

77
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:06,590
We'll see the potential health problems
associated with urban agriculture.

78
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,786
The main health hazard

79
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:12,694
is that most of the time
waste water is used.

80
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:16,000
Waste water are good in that
they fertilize soils,

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,145
but there are also a certain number
of germs which are pollutants

82
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:22,156
and will pass into the plants

83
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:25,580
and in turn into humans.

84
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,820
So, there is the issue of water quantity

85
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,158
and also of water quality,
with a caveat regarding waste water

86
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:37,857
which can become a time-bomb.

87
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:42,056
It's both a fertilizer 
and a potential health hazard

88
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,864
in areas with urban agriculture.

89
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:48,988
These are just a few quick elements
about urban agriculture.

90
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,480
There is much more to say,
but we won't go further today.

91
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,425
I would just want you to bear in mind

92
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:59,453
that there is an indisputable use,
a social use, to urban agriculture

93
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:02,640
but that it should be well thought through

94
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,642
depending on the density pattern
you choose,

95
00:05:05,642 --> 00:05:08,764
on the transportation options, 
or lack thereof,

96
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:11,530
and, in the end, on the ability
to retain ownership

97
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,542
over a piece of land in times
of growing land use pressure

98
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,100
in African cities.

99
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,180
In this week's classes
where we start to see how to plan,

100
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,964
we realize there is a certain number
of elements to take into account

101
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:29,050
and that these elements
don't always go in the same direction.

102
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,350
Which means there will be choices to make,

103
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,850
between the different options,
the different patterns:

104
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,836
spread-out cities with
room for agriculture,

105
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:43,073
which is very good for climate change
in tropical areas,

106
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:46,226
but on the other side
in terms of public transportation,

107
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:49,285
of increased commuting,
of the ozone layer,

108
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:53,968
since it is what it comes down to,
it should be avoided at all cost.

109
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:56,222
A dense city pattern is good

110
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,476
but it means there is no room 
for urban agriculture,

111
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:01,460
which eliminates part of the resources.

112
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,814
What it all comes down to
is that there is no panacea.

113
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:09,112
But one must be aware of the need
to make judgment calls

114
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:12,930
between those elements
that must be factored in

115
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,040
in our planning of future cities.
