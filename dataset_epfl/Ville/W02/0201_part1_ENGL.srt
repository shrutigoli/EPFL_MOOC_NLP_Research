1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,080
A few images this week, to start.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,520
We are in Dakar.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,190
Welcome to the participants from Dakar.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:21,370
The goal of our video is to further
our understanding of cities.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,250
In this instance, our understanding
not only of African cities, of course,

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,967
but of cities in general,
with three observations.

7
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:29,207
First, we observe that for the past few years,

8
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:32,625
maybe decades,
cities have become

9
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,720
a focal point of attention
including from the media.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,140
Cities are talked about more and more.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,116
Second observation:
some cities have become massive economies,

12
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:47,918
richer than some countries, undoubtedly.

13
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:50,200
There is a creation of wealth,

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,550
a whole economy around cities,
a very important one.

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,504
Third observation:

16
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,942
cities have started competing
with each other,

17
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:59,320
like companies.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,142
It's all the more interesting to witness

19
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:05,638
a renewed interest in cities

20
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:08,184
whereas, just to take one example,

21
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:11,310
statistics largely ignore cities.

22
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,748
There are national statistics,
regional statistics,

23
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:19,735
county statistics, municipality statistics,
depending on the administrative divisions

24
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:22,635
of each individual country.

25
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:27,560
But conurbations or metropolitan areas
as such are very hard to get a grasp on.

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,118
It clearly shows that we haven't moved on,

27
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,470
as far as statistics are concerned,

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,370
just to take that one telling example,

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,460
that we haven't completely moved on
to a management of cities.

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,100
We still have a relatively traditional way

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,000
of dividing up a given territory.
And that is the opposite

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,704
of the renewed interest and renewed
media attention that cities get.

33
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:58,670
Cities are gaining importance.

34
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,614
They are becoming societies 
in and of themselves.

35
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:04,241
And they intend to attract 
as much people as they can:

36
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:08,253
tourists, dwellers, companies,
conferences, sports events.

37
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,982
Think of the Olympic Games

38
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:13,640
or the Football World Cup,
for example.

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,402
Cities try to attract to them
flows and influxes:

40
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:20,400
capital flows and influx of people.

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,026
To do that, a city is truly a logo.

42
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:26,938
Coming from that is a reflection

43
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,210
in terms of image and advertising,
just like for a manufactured product.

44
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,504
We will talk in a minute about

45
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:36,070
what I call "the Towers war",

46
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,590
and the image that it conveys.

47
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,500
Another point.

48
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,110
Cities have moved from a technical management
to a marketing management.

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,810
Evidence of it are the different logos.

50
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,340
In that respect, African cities are absent.

51
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,185
All of them haven't redesigned their logo.

52
00:02:57,185 --> 00:03:01,187
But we see that all these cities,
like any brand selling any product,

53
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:05,841
have thought about a logo

54
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:09,724
that they can disseminate 
through pamphlets

55
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:14,530
advertising, sometimes events on TV.

56
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:22,298
The most striking example of it
is probably Mexico City.

57
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:25,910
This is the new logo.

58
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,492
Here is the old one.
The city moved from one to the other.

59
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:36,060
Showing this is a way to show
that you have moved into modernity,

60
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,260
into a type of management 
that is highly about marketing.

61
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,180
The "Towers War" I mentioned earlier.

62
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,140
What is it?

63
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,296
Every city wants to host 
the highest tower in the world.

64
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,810
Today, for the moment,

65
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,653
the winner is still,
for a few months or a few years,

66
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:59,284
the 828-metre high tower of Dubai.

67
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:02,870
We observe that all these cities have competed

68
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,040
one against the other:
Paris, New York, Shanghai, Taiwan, Chicago,

69
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,072
the Sears Tower, the Empire State Building,
the Eiffel Tower, and many others.

70
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:16,870
What's obvious is that every city

71
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,204
wants to boast a tower,
the highest possible.

72
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:22,070
Why?

73
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,274
Because it is a way to show

74
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:28,918
a high level of technology
that belongs to the city.

75
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,263
It means that there are in Dubai
the technological capacities

76
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:38,440
to build a 828-metre high tower.

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,944
It also shows that the city,
and in that respect Dubai is the extreme,

78
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:48,400
has enough wealth 
or hosts enough companies and investors

79
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,950
capable of building those huge towers

80
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,960
which, economically speaking,
are probably less profitable

81
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,262
than smaller towers,
but which are so important in terms of image.

82
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:07,133
About this competition,
there are three major changes taking place.

83
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:11,590
Or that have taken place,
but are still ongoing.

84
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:19,855
Cities have moved from a discreet system,
that is to say one within well-known limits,

85
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:24,790
within well-known borders,
to a completely blurred system.

86
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,200
We don't where a city starts
and where it ends.

87
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,480
It is blurred across the territories.

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,036
Lifestyles, or rather consumption styles,

89
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:42,420
tend to be the same pretty much
in every city in the world.

90
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,920
Let's take the example of a soda beverage

91
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,000
that everyone on the planet,
almost, with very few exceptions,

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,338
very few places or countries,
almost everyone drinks this soda beverage.

93
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:57,620
Or could drink it, because it's not free.

94
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,692
Then, third point,
third urban transformation:

95
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:07,030
new centres are appearing.

96
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,780
Urban networks are being reshuffled.

97
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,880
Today, state borders have clearly been
overstepped.

98
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,654
I would say cities today are not structured

99
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:28,000
according to states, regions 
or municipalities anymore.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,980
They draw networks far beyond 
the national borders they are in.

101
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,270
These are cities 
that are reshaping themselves,

102
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,560
creating networks with each other,
regardless of where they are.

103
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,340
The case of global cities exemplifies it.

104
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,762
These are the three 
ongoing transformations,

105
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:51,166
which started a few decades back already,

106
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:56,824
but which are widespread, 
concerning today every city on the planet.

107
00:06:56,824 --> 00:06:59,288
These profound changes, in the end,

108
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:03,860
gave us fours forms of cities:

109
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,790
spread out cities or sprawls, mega-cities,
global cities and mid-size cities.

110
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,327
There again, there can be sub-categories.

111
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:15,215
But these are the four main forms of cities

112
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:18,100
we find across the planet.

113
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,568
Of course, mid-size cities 
are the most numerous,

114
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:27,396
since not all are spread out, mega or global.

115
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:32,176
The majority if cities, really, 
can be called mid-size cities.

116
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:38,848
I'll take the example of a global city

117
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:43,172
and a mega-city to show that 
it is not exactly the same thing.

118
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:47,420
A mega-city is here.

119
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:54,174
Population makes it:
Tokyo, Delhi, Mexico, New York, Shanghai.

120
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:59,150
Here we move down 
from the most populated one.

121
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,384
The main factor is the population.

122
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:03,770
This is the mega-city.

123
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:09,340
Los Angeles, Buenos Aires, Karachi,
Calcutta, Dakar.

124
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,072
Then, we have a ranking of global cities.

125
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:18,715
This ranking takes into account 
not the population,

126
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,947
but a set of indicators that are flows,

127
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:25,363
most of the time, economic flows.

128
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:28,596
We have seven indicators here

129
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:33,059
in the report that is taken into account here,
in this chart.

130
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,801
There are indicators about political stability.

131
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:42,698
Of course, quality of living in these cities,
but above all what matters

132
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:48,389
are the economic flows.
In that respect, London comes first.

133
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:51,109
In the ranking of mega-cities,

134
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:53,730
it is clear in the first 30 cities,

135
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,010
London comes 30th.

136
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,085
So, not exactly the same kind of ranking.

137
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:03,955
Another example, Zurich,
which has a population

138
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:07,902
of about a million people,

139
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:11,815
is in the ranking of global cities,
but not necessarily

140
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:16,000
in the one of mega-cities,
with just a tiny million people.

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,782
We will come back, now,

142
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:22,080
to the issue of the stakes and the challenges.

143
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,154
Some may think these are synonyms.

144
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:26,952
We differentiate between a stake

145
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:30,165
which is a situation,
and eventually a diagnostic.

146
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:33,000
Here is the situation.

147
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,115
What is at stake in African cities?

148
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:37,614
We talked about it in the first video.

149
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:40,434
We are going to go over 
these different stakes

150
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:43,440
and talk about challenges awaiting.

151
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,917
Some stakes can be challenges as well,
but we see a difference.

152
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:52,980
For us, challenges are actions to take.

153
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,014
The stakes are the current situation,

154
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:59,658
and the challenge is the choice that is made,

155
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:03,184
vis-à-vis the current situation,

156
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:05,960
to act or not to act 
on these various stakes.

157
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,360
So, let's go over the main stakes

158
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,960
once gain, briefly.

159
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,605
We have seen these charts 
in the first video,

160
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:16,717
but I'll show them again briefly,
to have them in mind.

161
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:20,900
Population growth in cities.

162
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,246
Another stake:

163
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:27,305
urban growth without necessarily
economic development.

164
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:30,000
There is a break between 
economic development and urban growth

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,470
whereas in traditional models, 
so to speak,

166
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,890
cities develop at the same time
as the economy or the industry does.

167
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,658
Climate change, 
giving rise to deep undercurrents

168
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:50,664
that are extremely important and
that we'll have to take into account.

169
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:53,480
We'll see if they are taken into account
in our challenges or not.

170
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,760
This is the end of the first part.

171
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,600
I will meet you again

172
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,290
in the next video.
