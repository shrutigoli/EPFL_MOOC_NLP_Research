1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,160
We have previously seen 
various types of cities.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,730
We will now see what forms 
these types of cities generate.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,212
These different forms of urbanization, 
these urban forms

4
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:19,715
are a total of five, these 
are the main ones.

5
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:22,112
While there are of course subgroups, 
these are the five

6
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:25,355
main ones that we are going to find 
in all of the cities in the world.

7
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:27,654
First there are slums and 
working-class neighborhoods,

8
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:29,910
there are gated neighborhoods,

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,712
the gentrified centers 
most of the time,

10
00:00:32,712 --> 00:00:38,065
the large residential suburbs and 
business and/or commercial areas.

11
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:42,125
We are going to quickly review these
different forms of urbanization.

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:48,170
Here, we clearly recognize the slum 
or the working-class neighborhood.

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,570
We are now in Haiti, we have 
crossed the Atlantic

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,065
to find other forms of
urbanization

15
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:54,925
that are exactly and totally

16
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:59,000
the same as those that can be
found on the African continent.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,850
If I continue, we are now in Riyadh.

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,602
in Saudi Arabia in what we call 
the large gated neighborhoods,

19
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,231
that is the "gated" communities that are

20
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:16,360
protected from the outside 
by walls and we can see

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,494
that there are relatively 
few entrances in the neighborhood

22
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:27,207
so the resident movement can 
be controlled by two entrances,

23
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:31,569
three entrances with guards and 
we can clearly see that in this

24
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:37,130
situation the whole of the space here 
is without a doubt private.

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,590
Next.

26
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,383
The large gentrified centers.

27
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:46,802
Here we recognize the cathedral.

28
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:49,320
We are in the center of Dakar.

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,906
The process of gentrification is 
relatively slow in Africa,

30
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:59,455
but little by little, these centers 
are redeemed, whether the old houses

31
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:02,948
are once again purchased and destroyed 
to make places for buildings,

32
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:07,170
for populations that are much more well 
off than those who lived there previously.

33
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,455
The large residential centers. 
Here is a little atypical

34
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:17,680
of an example, since we are 
in Kinshasa.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,490
It's clear that we are not observing 
the formal but rather

36
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,538
the informal but that these large 
suburbs disperse and

37
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:29,126
the housing disperses over 
extremely important areas,

38
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:32,357
which we call a diffuse city, we could 
have very well used as

39
00:02:32,357 --> 00:02:36,596
an example a residential neighborhood
in the United States since

40
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:39,010
in principle, these are images 
that we know best.

41
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,276
The last form of urbanization, 
last type of urban form,

42
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:49,384
is the commercial center or the business 
center, we have combined

43
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:53,804
commercial and business, it is here that 
jobs are found in general,

44
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:57,835
and here we are typically 
in an industrial zone.

45
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:00,710
We see very clearly
by the form of the parcels,

46
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,191
by the size of the parcels and 
the size of the buildings.

47
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:07,687
As an example here, we have 
without a doubt neighborhoods,

48
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:12,490
islands in residential neighboorhoods, 
we see the size of

49
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,515
the highway and then we see that 
the industrial parcels

50
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:22,722
here have been subsequently subdivided 
in large parcels, so we see these

51
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:27,930
are no longer the same proportions here,
without a doubt, of kerosene or

52
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,749
of great buildings and hangars here, 
so without knowing exactly which

53
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:37,205
are the industries in these areas, 
we see by the form of the area,

54
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:42,200
the size of the buildings that we are in 
a form of business center.

55
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,644
Here are a few large forms of 
urbanization quickly described.

56
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,280
So there are subcategories,

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,510
we can find forms that 
are a little different,

58
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,088
but really they can be found 
in every city on the planet

59
00:03:57,088 --> 00:04:00,167
to which the African cities are 
not really an exception,

60
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:05,240
it's what we find in terms of 
forms of urbanization.

61
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,561
The only drawback of being on the topic 
of gentrified centers

62
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:13,750
since Europe is notably in a much 
more advanced process

63
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,810
but we see that the process 
is exactly the same in

64
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,904
the large African cities and that 
little by little these large cities

65
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:27,105
are gentrified, that is a much richer
population tries to settle

66
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:33,180
and finally change the form 
and the face of the neighborhoods.
