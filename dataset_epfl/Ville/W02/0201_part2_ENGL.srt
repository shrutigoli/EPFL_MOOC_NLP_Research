1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,250
The question of peripheries,

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,960
is finally almost the majority 
of the newcomers

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,670
who are going to settle down in 
the cities periphery, so the pressure

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,058
will be, not on city-centres, or 
on the today's existing city,

5
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:25,184
but on territories which are not urbanised yet,
so the natural

6
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:27,009
territories that surround the cities.

7
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:30,210
This is the main issue with peripheries.

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,490
Then, last issue, widespread mobility,

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,751
as we can see, statistics are helping us for that, 
people are more and more

10
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:45,912
mobile, they move around more and more,
have to cover

11
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:50,568
more and more distance, often due to
the effects of urbanization.

12
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:55,500
The more the city sets out the world, the more 
the city extends itself, the more each inhabitant

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,740
has to cover, against their will, most

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,730
of the time, distances everytime bigger.

15
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:07,680
So let's start from our urban mutations,
let's start from our important issues.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,605
Now we are going to show our big

17
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:13,230
challenges for the african city of tomorrow.

18
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,950
Challenge number one: the right to the city, the right

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,290
for everyone to have a spot in the city.

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,240
Challenge number two: the question about 
climate and environment.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,660
Challenge number three: reduction of mobilities.

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,392
Challenge number four: rethink the new 
forms of democracy.

23
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:40,280
Here we are, those are the four main challenges
for the african city of tomorrow.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,987
The right

25
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:47,450
to the city, is the issue of land,
of accession to the land, and the question is,

26
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,370
just: what are we going to do with those
thousands, millions of persons,

27
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,170
who can't have access to the land on a free-market,

28
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,970
and who are at the end of the day the products of
the economic system we set up?

29
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,045
This, is a fundamental question, what 
can we do

30
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:09,710
with this majority of inhabitants of
poor cities?

31
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:16,370
The second aspect related to the right to the city is,
advertising of public space.

32
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,535
Advertising within the meaning of public, and its

33
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:24,630
corollary that is privatization of
a certain number of places.

34
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,730
We see more and more gated

35
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,140
communities, which means that entire
streets don't belong anymore

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,202
to the public field, the public space,
with this noble concept of

37
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:38,402
advertising, that would allow everyone,
or that allows

38
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:41,419
everyone to move freely, and
we are in

39
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:45,250
a situation in which more and more
territories are privatized.

40
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,120
And this is an extremely important question,
that we should take

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,224
into account in our planification, in 
the next classes, where we are going

42
00:02:56,224 --> 00:03:00,193
to slowly learn how to plan, but,
make sure you keep

43
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:04,472
in mind that, we have that issue of the right 
of birthplace.

44
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:06,968
What can we do with that majority of people

45
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:09,830
who don't have access to a free property market?

46
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,200
We will have to put them somewhere.

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,140
So what to do with this trend of
privatization of public spaces?

48
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,370
Second challenge: environmental challenge, this is
actually an

49
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,940
energy challenge.

50
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,080
Countries, societies can go
in three distinct directions.

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,130
The first one, which is to link prosperity to
increase

52
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,180
of the quantity of used energy, or
useable, per inhabitant.

53
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,880
The more energy I consume, the more
prosperous I am.

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,808
Second possibility, is to transform,
to have the highest return we can get

55
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:47,910
per inhabitant.

56
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,328
So we are making sure that we use

57
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:55,084
in the best way as we can, with a high return,
energy for each one of us.

58
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:59,500
And third possibility, third option, 
is to

59
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,055
reduce, finally, the quantity of energy
per inhabitant.

60
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:09,243
So those choices depend on the States,
depend on certain cities,

61
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:12,020
but depend on the choice of society
we are going to make.

62
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,998
We now today that if we keep on
consuming more and more, we are going

63
00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:21,600
to extend our ecological footprint, and 
that we would

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,450
tend to reduce more the
consumption of energy.

65
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,634
And we also have to take that into account,

66
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:31,094
as we have on one hand a city that

67
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:34,337
is more and more spreading out, and that requires
in particular

68
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:37,063
mobilities every time bigger,
so an energy

69
00:04:37,063 --> 00:04:40,410
expenditure per inhabitant everytime
bigger, while the

70
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,490
sustainability would rather force us
to do the contrary.

71
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,447
So nowadays, poor people have to

72
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:55,542
move more and more often, 
further and further.

73
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,332
Why?

74
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:59,210
Because they are going to look for cheap

75
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,295
fields on the periphery, fields that are
the only ones

76
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:07,083
they may be able to occupy, or
buy, if they get to

77
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,240
reach this minimum price on the
free market of land.

78
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,135
So we are going to increase displacements of
people, that makes

79
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,115
the aspect of mobility, I would say
the overall

80
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:23,117
expenditure of the family increase and will
play an extremely

81
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:27,868
important part, and get to situations
in which people are sometimes

82
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:34,460
under house arrest, as they just can't
pay their mobility.

83
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,895
If I had to use 99% of my salary
just to travel to get

84
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:45,890
my salary, well it would be more advantageous
for me to stay at home without doing anything.

85
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,530
So this is an extreme case, of course, but

86
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,790
more and more often we have to face
those issues.

87
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,945
And therefore,

88
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:57,892
there is a huge lack of social justice,
as at the end of the day,

89
00:05:57,892 --> 00:06:02,085
rich people can go
everytime faster, those for which

90
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:07,066
mobility and distances are
not a problem, and

91
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:12,380
poor people, the poorest ones are the ones
who suffer from this situation.

92
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,081
A small anecdote is that if we take again
Ivan

93
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:18,010
Illich in energy and equity, the wheel
is not

94
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,121
the main invention, but
the ball

95
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:23,218
bearings has allowed the invention

96
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:26,055
of the bike, and has finally allowed
that with

97
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:29,349
muscular strength, we can move forward
much more quickly.

98
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,406
So it has allowed to do much bigger

99
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:36,925
distances with the same muscular strength
than we used to have before.

100
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:39,400
We should have in mind, when we talk about

101
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,570
regulating, reducing mobilities, that 
mobility today

102
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,080
creates segregation.

103
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,079
Speed potential allows rich people
to go

104
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,290
further and further, faster and faster.

105
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:58,770
Mobility consumes a lot of energy, no matter
what mode of transport we use.

106
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,593
Except for walking and riding a bike
which are human muscular

107
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:08,860
strength, everything works rather with
electricity or oil.

108
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,632
And we have to know that, having that

109
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:15,730
in mind, mobility creates 
urban sprawl.

110
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,203
Its corollary is that urban sprawl
also creates mobility.

111
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:23,846
So we are in a self-supplying system, and

112
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:27,206
if we want to regulate or reduce 
those mobilities,

113
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:30,878
we have to act for those sprawl issues,
on those issues

114
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:34,420
about energy and on the
spatial segregation.

115
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,152
When we talk about redefining the forms 
of democracy, we

116
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:44,184
obviously talk about participation,
participatory process, increasingly

117
00:07:44,184 --> 00:07:47,538
fashionable in all the cities, even if

118
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:52,643
we realise today how big the limits 
of those processes are.

119
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:55,919
There is a big difference between
asking

120
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,630
for advice, and taking a decision all together.

121
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,250
Those participatory processes pose
a certain amount of questions and set limits.

122
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:11,200
The first, is the question about
participatory democracy

123
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,010
against a representative

124
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,118
democracy.
Who are those people who are not

125
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:24,982
elected, and who takes part in those processes?
This is a question

126
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:29,543
we have to have in mind, as in 
a democracy, we have to elect

127
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:34,530
a certain amount of people, to whom we are giving
the power to represent us.

128
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,038
Of course, we are in the case of school, 
the case

129
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,991
of theoretical figure, but the question of
participation is about that.

130
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:44,860
Who are those people who are invited in
the participatory processes?

131
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,780
The second question, is about scale.

132
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:55,660
Can we use participatory processes
in order to negotiate,

133
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,600
manage, imagine, plan the
very big infrastructures?

134
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,016
Is it possible to sit
all together

135
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:10,070
around the table to think about
big highways within a city?

136
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,810
Does it make sense to ask
for advice to absolutely

137
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,690
everybody about those questions
of big infrastructures?

138
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,990
Third question is that we realise that

139
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,346
people only react about their own
situation.

140
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:32,390
It is the not in my backyard, the nimby, that we agree with, 
but not in front of one's own house.

141
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,778
And finally, those participatory processes are a

142
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:39,797
sum of individual interests, but we
never talk,

143
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:43,800
or rarely, about everyone's interest, 
of public's interest.

144
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,160
So those different challenges lead us
to ask a certain amount of questions.

145
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,385
Which are: which city do we want?
For whom?

146
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:56,824
For what kind of inhabitants?
What role should the elites of those city play?

147
00:09:56,824 --> 00:09:59,460
Let's take a fictional example.

148
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,270
In a city that would have twenty or thirty
vehicules for 1000 inhabitant,

149
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,230
am I going to create 
the same type of road or

150
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,410
highway than in cities that would have
500 vehicules for 1 000 inhabitants?

151
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,880
When I create a road, who am I going
to favour?

152
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,068
Which population?

153
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:25,292
Is it for everyone, or
is it only for a small

154
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,130
proportion, an elite which has access to

155
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,460
those infrastructures, 
that can ride way faster

156
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,820
than others?

157
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,460
I am not putting any value judgment,

158
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,390
we only have to wonder for whom
are we making the city.

159
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,003
Is it for the highest number?

160
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:46,739
Or is it for a small one?
So which city do we want,

161
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:52,920
which society do we want, what role 
do we attribute to all its inhabitants.

162
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,884
And that backtracks on the question of
the right to the city,

163
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:58,164
to the first challenge I was mentioning

164
00:10:58,164 --> 00:11:01,650
earlier, which is what are we doing,

165
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,458
how do we plan a city that could

166
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,334
take into account those tens of millions

167
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,679
people all over the planet that who don't

168
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,950
have access to the land market, 
because simply,

169
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,260
the smallest parcel is

170
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,150
already too eminently expensive
for their economical power?

171
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,528
I leave this question open,

172
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:25,000
we will come back to it
later on in our class.

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,560
We talked about the issues, 
the challenges, some questions.

174
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,258
To conclude, I would like to 
introduce the question

175
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,860
of the city's reading levels.

176
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,770
When we want to understand phenomenon,

177
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,220
there are three different reading levels.

178
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,950
The first one is the formal and technical one.

179
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,860
It is often

180
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,851
the level of physical planification,
networks' level.

181
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:55,670
The second one, 
is the social practices level.

182
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,475
At the end, the inhabitants of the city
have practices

183
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:03,940
that define a certain amount of
behaviors, and we can,

184
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,343
or we could read the city, and read 
the spaces

185
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:11,660
of the city only regarding those
social practices.

186
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,999
A beach for example, somewhere on
the atlantic coast.

187
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:23,130
Finally, the third level is the symbolic one.

188
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,778
No more technical questions here, 
no more

189
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:29,100
social practices questions, we are

190
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,410
reading questions 
of representation and picture.

191
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,220
And this level is often less

192
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,460
used, the reading level 
that we forget

193
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,530
a little bit, but that is extremely
important.

194
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,610
This is the position that we take

195
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,570
regarding the others, 
we have a symbolic position.

196
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,495
So the idea is 
to ask ourselves when

197
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:55,720
we try to plan, not only about

198
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,793
the network question, it is not

199
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:02,759
enough in itself, 
we still have to figure which

200
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,837
are the practices that people will do
on this network, and which

201
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:11,380
are the imaginary ones and the
representations that

202
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,080
will develop around those
uses.

203
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,840
And this is only once we have taken
into account those three

204
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,090
reading levels 
that we can truly take

205
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,280
into account 
all the size of the issue.
