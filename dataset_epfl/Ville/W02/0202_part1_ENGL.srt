1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,613
Just for once, in our discussion of models

2
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:10,807
of today's modern cities, let's go to Asia,

3
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:14,286
with the analysis of several cities: 
Kuala Lumpur and Singapore

4
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:19,230
in Southeast Asia and, in the Arab world, 
Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,318
We'll explain why we've chosen 
these cities in particular,

6
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:25,887
and what our reasoning is
for choosing to analyze these four cities.

7
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:29,893
What we'll try to show is 
that there are choices,

8
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:33,033
political choices, societal choices,

9
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:37,263
which are made as one plans a city, 
and that these diverse choices,

10
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:42,247
the panoply of choices which one makes, 
is what, in the end, we call a model.

11
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:44,254
There are great models one can follow,

12
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:48,287
we have city models which are, 
in the end, economic ones,

13
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:51,565
but not solely, for within these same

14
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:54,737
economic models in Southeast Asia
or in the Arab world,

15
00:00:54,737 --> 00:00:58,767
we can see that the choices made 
are extremely different,

16
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,194
with very diverse results.

17
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:09,728
So we'll begin with 
what we call "global cities."

18
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:10,748
Why global cities?

19
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:15,112
Because a number of cities, 
whether African, Asian,

20
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:18,354
European or American, today form part of

21
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:21,032
this worldwide competition,

22
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:24,631
where the goal is to attract 
the largest flow possible,

23
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,703
whether this is one of 
people or finances,

24
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:32,767
based at once on 
business and tourism.

25
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:36,758
Therefore the state of the global city 
is to a great extent linked

26
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:40,845
to these flows, which may be
of money, of airport rankings,

27
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:44,915
the number of mentions in the press.
This is where it all begins,

28
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:47,212
with the number of 
international visitors.

29
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:52,198
But a city cannot declare itself
a global city.

30
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:56,686
On the contrary, these are
key means to achieve this,

31
00:01:56,686 --> 00:02:00,075
via the number of international
conferences, studies, important indicators

32
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:04,308
which give or deny a city its 
status as a global city.

33
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:06,419
We will also see that

34
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:11,047
in certain global cities, 
whether in Africa or Asia,

35
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:17,109
the strategies are precisely the same. 
The goal is to attract

36
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:22,320
the largest number of people and 
the flow of finance and commerce.

37
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:26,653
So to speak of "global cities," let's use

38
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:33,978
the ranking which is practically 
the rule of law:

39
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:38,171
the MasterCard ranking, 
whose #1 in 2008,

40
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:41,912
---since we don't have the latest 
figures, this will work--

41
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:46,992
was London, a prime example 
of a global city, followed by

42
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:52,354
New York, Tokyo, and 
with Singapore in fourth.

43
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:56,789
I'll go down the list quickly, 
for as you'll see

44
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:01,109
it is made up of mostly American 
and European cities; we have to

45
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:05,603
go much, much lower in order 
to reach African cities,

46
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:11,185
or Asian cities. Yet these are the 
ones which interest us today:

47
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:13,962
Singapore, as we've mentioned,

48
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:20,782
Dubai in the U.A.E., and Kuala Lumpur,

49
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:26,659
which we find in here in 38th position,

50
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,794
Dubai in 37th in 2007,

51
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:35,738
moving down a bit in 2008, and Kuala Lumpur 
with a steep drop in 2008.

52
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:38,387
Abu Dhabi... the fourth city,

53
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:42,893
is not on this list of global cities.

54
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:47,459
Four cities, four countries: Malaysia, 
Singapore, the U.A.E,

55
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:55,004
Kuala Lumpur 1,500,000, 
Singapore 4,700,000,

56
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:57,480
Abu Dhabi, a very small city 
with fewer than 700,000

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,582
and a city such as Dubai which is on par 
with Kuala Lumpur, with 1,500,000.

58
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:09,279
The goal is not to calculate 
demographics based on this data

59
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:13,195
which are certainly of interest, 
but rather to quickly dive into

60
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,318
these other cases, and see how they

61
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:18,835
have treated urban space in a different way.

62
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,579
Abu Dhabi.

63
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,392
In a few words, Abu Dhabi was

64
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:27,659
a bit wary of opening itself up to 
foreign investment until 2004,

65
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:30,990
when upon the death of the Sheikh, 
Abu Dhabi found itself

66
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,480
as a regional center while Dubai 
saw itself as an international hub.

67
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,596
1962, a very important date.

68
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:41,650
The first commercial effort 
to exploit oil and,

69
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,942
since 2004, another important phenomenon,

70
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:51,322
the increase in oil prices, 
which transformed Abu Dhabi

71
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:56,540
into an extremely rich 
country and, conclusively,

72
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,123
allowed an influx of capital,
thanks to the security measures,

73
00:05:01,123 --> 00:05:03,960
notably in the U.S. 
after the terrorist attacks.

74
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,760
Abu Dhabi sees itself equally 
as a cultural city.

75
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,230
While it may not currently be, 
it will become one,

76
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,885
little by little, investing in 
museums, such as

77
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:18,028
the Louvre and the Guggenheim, both 
of which can be found in Abu Dhabi.

78
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:22,803
Dubai has far less oil than Abu Dhabi,

79
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:27,753
yet during the crisis of 1973 
quadrupled its price,

80
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:32,827
so that finally the royalties from oil

81
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:37,459
would become so significant that Dubai 
would achieve autonomy,

82
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:41,368
but very quickly exploring 
other options, outside of oil,

83
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:44,766
for development, notably thanks 
to their deep water port.

84
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:48,217
So Dubai sees itself as a solid base 
for the development

85
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:53,280
of enterprise and commerce and, 
while Abu Dhabi is a cultural city,

86
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,903
Dubai is one of commerce.

87
00:05:56,903 --> 00:06:03,315
Singapore, developed since 1980, 
with a huge recession,

88
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:07,386
and therefore other avenues
have been pursued, notably

89
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:13,355
the question of its patrimony 
during the 1980's, one will invent,

90
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:16,176
the invention of the patrimony, 
one will invent the patrimony.

91
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:20,410
They will take all that is more or less 
their colonial patrimony

92
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,307
and blow it up 
to make of it a selling point.

93
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:31,548
So they will rely at once on 
commerce and on tourism.

94
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:35,156
Our last city: Kuala Lumpur,

95
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:40,732
Kuala Lumpur arrives much
later, its delays in development,

96
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:44,767
blamed on the "Tigers," on the
large Séhoui-style cities

97
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:47,819
which had been developed 
well before in Asia,

98
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,850
and takes back the domains
that the others no longer wanted.

99
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,312
Singapore wants no more of 
heavy industry, neither does Séhoul,

100
00:06:55,312 --> 00:07:01,171
and it is Kuala Lumpur who will 
take back part of this development.

101
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,668
Kuala Lumpur will develop 
industry, for it is a city

102
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:08,660
of commerce and industry 
which profiles itself

103
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,865
equally on information technology. 
Why do I say this?

104
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:19,591
Simply because we can see how 
the paths are different,

105
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:23,799
the choices are different, one can at the 
same time base one's commerce on

106
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:29,802
development, on tourism, on industry,
yet in the end it is the same,

107
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:32,941
which is to say it must attract
the greatest possible flow.

108
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:35,960
We'll now see, in detail,

109
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,525
several flashes like this one, 
where the great differences

110
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:45,714
which one finds between cities which are, 
after all, which at the end of the day

111
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:51,298
have extremely similar strategies. 
But the answer we'll find

112
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:54,511
behind these strategies 
is extremely diverse.

113
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:56,528
It is what we'll see, within this

114
00:07:56,528 --> 00:08:00,450
first theme which explores the question 
of interior vs. exterior.

115
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:05,800
The Dubai Airport. Interior.

116
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,228
A shopping mall, where one 
sees only retailers,

117
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:14,684
stores, the ebb and flow of people,

118
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:17,475
all night long, who arrive at 2 a.m.

119
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:21,862
and leave at 6 a.m. for another place, 
and who in the meantime consume.

120
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:24,623
We are in an air-conditioned space,

121
00:08:24,623 --> 00:08:30,748
a closed space, one that is protected, 
100% controlled.

122
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:32,683
The Dubai airport, where the only

123
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:35,355
hard thing is to find the boarding gate,

124
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:39,600
sandwiched in between two large signs 
of world distribution.

125
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:44,081
Another example.

126
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:49,353
Dubai once again. A commercial mall where 
they have recreated an Italian piazza

127
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:55,920
with relative success, but where all 
the symbols of the Italian square

128
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,894
are recreated in the interior.

129
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:02,652
It's 40 degrees centigrade outside, 
in the shade, 18 degrees inside.

130
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:06,573
It is full of people, who spend their day 
in these commercial malls,

131
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:10,335
in these artificially created universes,

132
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:13,930
an exterior universe 
recreated in the interior.

133
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,213
Another example, again in Dubai.

134
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:19,157
Inside a commercial mall: a ski slope.

135
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:22,214
A ski slope that would 
normally be outdoors,

136
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:25,230
in countries where it is extremely hot,

137
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,178
like the U.A.E., can only
be achieved if it is indoors.

138
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:36,401
One leaves this commercial mall, 
leaves the ski slope,

139
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:40,538
and finds oneself, still in Dubai, 
with housing developments and banks,

140
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,442
yet no one is outdoors.

141
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:47,470
One sees only a flow of cars, 
yet not one person strolling,

142
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,585
not one pedestrian, for the conditions 
are such that it is extremely hot.

143
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:53,621
There is no shade. We can see 
how difficult it would be to

144
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:56,383
imagine sitting oneself down, calmly,

145
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:59,313
on a bench, under this glaring sun.

146
00:09:59,992 --> 00:10:04,519
On the other hand, we have Singapore.

147
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,668
The same temperature. 
Slightly higher humidity.

148
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:11,692
In other words, a heat 
which is difficult to bear,

149
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:14,465
yet a place where 
large shaded coverings

150
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:21,844
permit a natural ventilation 
and allow people to walk around outside.

151
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:24,669
Kuala Lumpur, at night.

152
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,273
Restaurants line the streets.

153
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:29,166
We see that there is truly life 
in the exterior.

154
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,664
We find that, in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi,

155
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,561
one recreates in the interior,
in a confined space,

156
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:40,720
in a completely temperate climate,

157
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,109
one that is completely controlled,

158
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,200
a universe which should be exterior,

159
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,668
while in the cities of Southeast Asia, 
one relies on the exterior,

160
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:56,445
knowing that the people will go, despite 
the heat, to these exterior spaces.

161
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:00,617
Another example, again in Singapore.

162
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:04,219
People wait calmly 
to cross the street.

163
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:10,134
while in Dubai or Abu Dhabi,
this would be practially impossible.

164
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:17,325
To finish up on these questions of 
interior/exterior, we should say that

165
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:20,570
when we speak of models, 
here are some choices.

166
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,800
Does one develop a city for pedestrians,
who can walk outside?

167
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,522
Or does one develop a city for drivers 
who park their car,

168
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:34,252
or take a taxi, who park their car,

169
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:40,293
and find themselves in an aseptic, 
totally air-conditioned climate?

170
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:45,244
We can see here that, between
the countries of Southeast Asia

171
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:50,290
and those of the U.A.E., 
the situations are extremely different.

172
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:53,294
Okay, let's stop here, 
at the end of this first part.

173
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:55,823
I'll see you for the next one.
