1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,042
Pedestrians/cars.

2
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:08,330
So we've just had the choice 
of interior/exterior.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,410
And also that of favoring 
the pedestrian or the car.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,042
We will see that in the United Arab Emirates

5
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:18,648
they favor the car, while in Southeast Asia,

6
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:21,768
in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, 
we find more and more--

7
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:26,000
and this is new-- that it is the 
pedestrian who is favored.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,538
There is also one with city models,
political choices.

9
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:34,553
What flow of people 
should I bring to my global city?

10
00:00:34,553 --> 00:00:37,844
Should I make sure that 
they can take a walk in fresh air?

11
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:40,650
We have just seen interior/exterior.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,618
Will they go out as pedestrians, 
or will there be more

13
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:51,302
drivers in city streets? For example 
in Abu Dhabi, as you can see,

14
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:54,454
very little space, one can 
nonetheless find

15
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,882
two people who try, under 
umbrellas since it's so hot,

16
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:01,330
to take a stroll, but one can see that,

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,313
while not all paths are bad,

18
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:06,725
it will be difficult to go from one point

19
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:11,031
to the next because sidewalks 
simply do not exist,

20
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,152
and that one can only cross

21
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:17,660
vast parking lots where the cars 
are taking up all the space.

22
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,302
Ditto, and even more striking, 
we can imagine a bad pedestrian.

23
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:32,388
There too, passing under a walkway 
which one can climb to cross the street,

24
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:39,090
but there is a barrier which 
completely blocks it from the road,

25
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,361
so to go from one point to the next 
you must go back up,

26
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,250
cross and go down on the other side.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,919
A striking example in Dubai,
where we have a pedestrian crosswalk

28
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:59,540
which ends, and even if it 
were to continue there is no sidewalk,

29
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,520
and even if there were, 
one would end up against a wall,

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,615
so one can basically do nothing; 
one cannot take a walk

31
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:12,725
in this universe, unless it is 
to walk on the road or ground,

32
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:16,886
and try however one might 
to find a place to cross.

33
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:21,990
On the contrary, Malaysia offers

34
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,150
signs for tourists, of course,

35
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,394
to the important city landmarks, 
and directions to them,

36
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:36,270
even indicating the time 
it will take to get there.

37
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,170
So there is a signage put in place 
for the pedestrian.

38
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,362
But, not everything is resolved in 
Kuala Lumpur, where there are

39
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:53,950
path markings for the blind, 
so sidewalks exist.

40
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,696
One can walk, but there is 
still a slight problem,

41
00:02:57,696 --> 00:03:02,048
shall we say, of parking, 
which is done precisely

42
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:06,520
in the same spot where 
the pedestrian should walk.

43
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,038
Singapore, old-style Singapore,

44
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:17,692
rather like Abu Dhabi, where one 
had to walk on the road in order to

45
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:22,750
cross, and now, little by little, 
all the overpasses

46
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,610
have been upgraded, 
which means that

47
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,651
in the Southeast Asian 
model they realize that

48
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:35,820
there will be pedestrians 
who encounter scooters,

49
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,760
who encounter cars, all this 
happening with relative ease.

50
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:47,990
On the contrary, in Dubai, in Abu Dhabi, 
all the different flows are separated,

51
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,089
making it extremely difficult for the 
pedestrian to get from one point

52
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:57,482
to another, as the flow is granted 
above all to the car.

53
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:03,586
Another element of our model, 
after interior/exterior,

54
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:08,290
after car/pedestrian, is the question 
of homogeneity, or heterogeneity.

55
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,830
In European cities there 
is research on homogeneity.

56
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,470
Buildings, and large groupings 
of them should be similar.

57
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,845
Such is the rue de Rivoli in Paris, 
the hundreds of arcades,

58
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:25,220
kilometers of the same type of 
buildings, always the same type.

59
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,380
The other way is to 
assume this heterogeneity.

60
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,574
We will see that, in Dubai 
as well as Abu Dhabi,

61
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:38,320
via their skylines they 
seek a homogeneity

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,270
of the image they offer to the city.

63
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,040
Not on the level of buildings, 
all very different,

64
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,012
but on a global level,

65
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:49,460
on a general level of city skyline 
where one finds

66
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,642
a situation which 
seeks homogeneity.

67
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:55,830
On the contrary, in 
Southeast Asia, in Singapore,

68
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,530
Kuala Lumpur, one clearly and 
simply assumes this heterogeneity.

69
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,852
Here is an example of homogeneity.

70
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:10,381
We see more and more 
a skyline whose buildings

71
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:15,630
have the same template, more or less, 
the same implementation,

72
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,180
and one tries to be homogeneous, 
throughout the region.

73
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,811
This is where it's even more striking, 
even if the buildings

74
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:30,000
are very different, it is the 
skyline which emerges.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,476
We can remove the image and see how

76
00:05:33,476 --> 00:05:37,910
what emerges is that of a 
relatively homogeneous city.

77
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,290
Again, this time in Dubai, 
this research method of

78
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,470
placing one line like this, 
across the buildings.

79
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,991
There are two layers of buildings, 
shall we say, lined up on the street,

80
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:55,071
which gives them a homogeneity 
which can be perceived

81
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:03,565
at any given moment. On the contrary, 
Singapore or Kuala Lumpur.

82
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:09,610
We will see the complete homogeneity 
of building methods.

83
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,612
We can have, as we have here, 
very small buildings.

84
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:15,920
We can have enormous buildings.

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,340
We can have the old, the 
contemporary, it matters little.

86
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,700
One assumes this heterogeneity, 
and one builds accordingly,

87
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,060
level by level, without seeking 
to homogenize the area.

88
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,320
So here we have a vision 
which some might find

89
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,120
a bit apocalyptic, with so many 
different and disparate elements.

90
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,600
But, it is a heterogeneity 
which is totally assumed.

91
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,120
Whereas in other areas,

92
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,447
particularly in Europe, one seeks, 
historically, a homogeneity

93
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:56,280
across the whole of the city area. 
There you have it.

94
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,155
Once again we have questions about models 
homogenous vs. heterogenous.

95
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:04,890
The last example, the question 
of flux vs. fluidity.

96
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,680
In the model of the U.A.E., 
what is sought is above all flux.

97
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,320
They seek the quantity of people, 
the quantity of maximum flow.

98
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,809
Whereas in regions of Southeast Asia,

99
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:23,054
in Singapore or Kuala Lumpur, 
it is exactly the opposite.

100
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:26,050
It is not the flux which is 
of interest, but the fluidity.

101
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,000
Everything should be linked, 
it should be possible to arrive

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,792
very quickly, to get off 
the plane, hop in a cab,

103
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,736
arrive at one's hotel, 
and quickly be in one's room,

104
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:36,702
all the sequences--
for the tourist, of course,

105
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:40,330
because the goal is to attract 
people from outside,

106
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:46,140
they try to reduce as much as possible 
these sequences for the tourist.

107
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,648
Here we have an example,

108
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:53,720
in Abu Dhabi, where we are not 
certain of fluidity but yes of flow.

109
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,790
There are cars everywhere, an enormous 
mass of cars, absolutely everywhere.

110
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,618
And the opposite example,

111
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:07,402
here in Kuala Lumpur,

112
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:12,840
where we have an aerial monorail 
which picks up passengers here,

113
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,806
who get on the monorail. 
The cars pass here.

114
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:22,594
We have crossing flows but it is 
very easy, from one's hotel,

115
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:24,248
to get on the monorail,

116
00:08:24,248 --> 00:08:27,814
travel two stops, get off, take a bus,

117
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,647
hop in a cab and off you go.

118
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:35,477
So each transfer, each change 
of means of transport

119
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:38,640
is facilitated and is extremely fluid.

120
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,870
And this is political volition, 
there in the background,

121
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,330
which ensures that it is 
the quickest possible.

122
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,064
So now we will leave Southeast Asia,

123
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:51,730
and leave the Arab world.

124
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,212
These few elements,
to help us to reflect once again,

125
00:08:56,212 --> 00:09:01,150
on the African city, so let's now 
think about Johannesburg,

126
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,691
Dakar, Kinshasa. 
Let's think of all these cities

127
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:09,310
and imagine how they are constructed, 
how they are arranged.

128
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,884
Are we in the interior?

129
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,742
The exterior?

130
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,536
The fluidity or flux?

131
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:18,138
A pedestrian, or a car?

132
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:23,070
The answer to the question of 
the car is relatively simple.

133
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,268
We do not yet have the 
example of an African city

134
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:30,490
specifically set up 
around the pedestrian.

135
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,402
Which is no doubt wrong, as the great 
majority of people are pedestrians.

136
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:43,218
We can offer as example 
Switzerland: 500 vehicles

137
00:09:43,218 --> 00:09:46,012
per thousand inhabitants, 
while Dakar must be

138
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:48,610
at fewer than 30 vehicles 
per thousand inhabitants.

139
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:55,904
So the great majority 
of people get around on foot.

140
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:58,982
And it is perhaps with these 
people that we should begin to reflect,

141
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:00,863
which is what Singapore did,

142
00:10:00,863 --> 00:10:04,391
and Kuala Lumpur, which is 
besides attracting more and more

143
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:09,380
this flow of tourists, of 
international business travelers,

144
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,060
this also allows those 
who live there

145
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,595
to be able to get from one place 
to another with relative ease.

146
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:24,454
Some examples now, of models, 
of the American model, as we see here,

147
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:29,340
You know the huge grid
found in the U.S.

148
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:35,096
This is a one-mile grid,

149
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:38,230
but all the land is squared off like this.

150
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,890
One by one, and then as 
each square is added,

151
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,822
urbanized little by little,

152
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:52,224
until all the squares which 
remain are urbanized.

153
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:55,610
But the pattern is exactly 
the same everywhere.

154
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,864
It is a model, as you can see.

155
00:10:57,864 --> 00:11:05,577
Another model, taking an example 
from Dakar, with its turnpike.

156
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:11,784
"A Large State Venture", 
"The Future of Amina," "Being Built Today"

157
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:15,502
They place on these great 
works and on the turnpikes

158
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:17,660
to be constructed a future 
for future inhabitants.

159
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,058
This is not to judge the value behind it;

160
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,970
it is simply another model,

161
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,640
which is already in use, 
particularly in Dakar.

162
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:32,644
Another model, this one historic,
is the plan of Nouakchott.

163
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:36,735
Nouakchott does not yet exist 
in its modern state,

164
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:41,756
the model kept is one of segregation,

165
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:45,386
between a residential North here,

166
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:50,989
and a much denser, more popular South.

167
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,928
So in 1957, three years before 
independence, we still have,

168
00:11:55,928 --> 00:12:01,140
for a new city which will be Nouakchott,
laying the first stone in 1958,

169
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,020
for this new city for which 
was chosen a segregative plan,

170
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:11,020
between a European city,
as one once called it,

171
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,102
residential zones for the rich,

172
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:17,683
for the elite, and then a Southern 
zone more popular, indigenous.

173
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:21,084
This is a city model.

174
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:24,808
One was not obligated to separate 
the population in two.

175
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:28,810
One might have imagined that, 
at the same time those

176
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,780
of the popular neighborhoods might be 
instead spread uniformly around the area.

177
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,100
Once again, not a value judgement, 
one does not say if this is good or bad,

178
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,959
one simply can say that,

179
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,450
these are choices made,
and different models.

180
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:51,122
Finally, an interesting model which 
I'd like to leave with you to reflect on.

181
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:56,310
Is it better to live in this first part 
of the screen, on the bottom,

182
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:02,730
in the market-- animated, informal, 
popular, or in a version

183
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,752
of modern Africa, in a building,

184
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:12,208
where one sees no one outdoors?
I leave this question hanging,

185
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:17,280
we'll have the opportunity to return to it
but the idea to reflect on is

186
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,270
which model would you prefer, 
for which city.

187
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:27,980
We'll stop there, 
on the question of model.
