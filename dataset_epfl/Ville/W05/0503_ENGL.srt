00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello
Today a history of urban planning.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,396
A brief history, going back a few plans,

3
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:17,072
a few decades, a few large 
types of plans,

4
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:20,662
from the first subdivision plans,

5
00:00:20,662 --> 00:00:27,196
often colonial plans, right up to 
current plans, strategic city planning.

6
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:29,374
We are going to divide it 
into different stages.

7
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:32,854
The first was what we called the 
first drawings, it is often

8
00:00:32,854 --> 00:00:36,273
subdivision plans, we will show 
an example a little later.

9
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:40,630
Then classical planning, which 
we probably know best.

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:47,140
Classical planning simplified, the 
project list or the shopping list.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,990
Planning by discipline.

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,690
Strategic planning.

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,630
First example of planning, what we call
the first plans.

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,942
We are here in Abidjan, the first 
plan of subdivision

15
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:05,107
of the city of Abidjan, it is a plan 
of military genius.

16
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:10,303
Most colonial cities, we are not referring
to precolonial cities of course,

17
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,546
the first colonial cities had plans,

18
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:16,007
which were generally made 
by military genius.

19
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:20,205
We are referring to 
the subdivision drawing

20
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:27,019
with an exact description of the 
roads and the size of the lots.

21
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:32,073
We have here, each time,

22
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:36,151
we know exactly the size of the street,

23
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:41,075
the boundaries of the roads, we also know
that the blocks

24
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:44,145
are well defined in a subdivision.

25
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,174
So we're really talking about 
a spatial drawing,

26
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:52,652
where we try to organize things, 
the large facilities, we have here

27
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:56,950
the hospital as well as 
a number of plots

28
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,530
which are common plots 
that could welcome

29
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,410
residents or facilities.

30
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,800
The second example here,

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,773
is what we call classical planning.

32
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:15,840
Classical planning, is a encyclopedic 
planning of the city.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,886
So there is no date on the side 
on purpose, since we are

34
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:26,167
of course looking at the first plans, 
in 1830, 1850, it depends

35
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:31,340
on the cities, but here we are 
dealing much more classical planning.

36
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:39,180
We are still in Abidjan, however, 
providing a date does not make sense.

37
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,873
Why?

38
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:41,962
Because this type of plan can be found

39
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,754
before in certain cities and well after 
in other cities.

40
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:49,003
We can even say that this 
classical planning

41
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:54,660
is still used today in any 
number of African cities.

42
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,190
What are its special features?

43
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,979
We plan the networks, we plan 
large subdivisions.

44
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:06,541
We see that it's mostly streets

45
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:12,590
that we have, we see that we plan 
the new subdivisions that we have

46
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,950
the large roads, mostly, that exit 
to the outside of the city.

47
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,960
So it's the road network 
which is planned.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,235
To do this planning, we use 
a large amount of data.

49
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:28,175
The idea behind it is that if we have

50
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:32,700
encyclopedic knowledge of the city,
we will be able to plan correctly.

51
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,040
Same situation here,

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,576
we find ourselves a few years later, 
it is the 80s,

53
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:43,175
in Nouakchott in Mauritania,

54
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:47,044
we are dealing with the same type of
planning, it's a classical planning

55
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:50,410
but based on an encyclopedic 
knowledge of things.

56
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,965
So we know absolutely everything 
about the city

57
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:58,898
and knowing everything 
allows us to plan well.

58
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:02,710
Then, we go to another type of planning, 
still in Nouakchott,

59
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:08,769
still in Mauritania, the so-called classic 
planning but its simplified version.

60
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,354
We realize that after a few 
classical planning failures,

61
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,800
finally, all of this encyclopedic data,

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,567
this mass of information,

63
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:21,117
is maybe not essential to 
the planning of the city.

64
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:23,917
So we are going to do the same type

65
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,718
of road planning, of large areas, 
of residential areas,

66
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:29,920
popular housing areas, but this time,

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,846
we are going to base it on data 
that is much more insufficient.

68
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:37,602
So we are going to look to simplify, 
both the diagnostic,

69
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:40,254
based on much less data,

70
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:44,302
and at the same time the result, 
starting with the principle that

71
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:47,110
the simpler and the clearer it is,

72
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,298
the more possibilities 
for planning to work.

73
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:56,980
So it's a secret for no one, we have 
reduced the complexity so much

74
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,695
that we are now in situations where 
planning is no longer effective at all

75
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:06,872
since it no longer represents 
urban complexity.

76
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:14,370
Here an example of the project list 
or shopping list.

77
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,601
We can see that we have 
a particular element,

78
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,556
we see that at an intersection,

79
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:24,509
we see that we have here a bypass 
that is drawn, we see

80
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:28,405
that we have sectors which without a doubt
will have to be restructured,

81
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:30,099
of particular elements.

82
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:37,053
Urban planning is seen, in this case, as
the succession of financeable projects.

83
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:40,160
So we no longer truly have 
a comprehensive plan,

84
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,212
or rather the comprehensive plan
is not that important

85
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:46,850
compared to the whole of the project list,

86
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,688
and finally urban planning, planning

87
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:52,528
is done by superimposed projects.

88
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:57,692
Another example,
we go from the project list,

89
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:02,684
to a planning by domain 
or by business sector.

90
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:06,072
Here we are in Nouakchott, Mauritania

91
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:10,606
with the road network hierarchy 
in the long-term.

92
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:13,624
So we go eventually from a planning

93
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:18,411
that wants to include all 
of the planning elements

94
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,918
which is broken down into different 
areas of activity, the road network

95
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,490
being without a doubt the most 
classic domain, really everything

96
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,466
that is transportation and mobility, 
but this is often about hierarchy issues

97
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:38,731
of the road network in the long-term 
which we primarily act on.

98
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:43,760
And finally the last invention 
in the history of planning,

99
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,956
is strategic planning.

100
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:51,990
Here we are in Douala, 
where we see that

101
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,264
we are talking about large sectors, 
sub-sectors which are

102
00:06:57,264 --> 00:07:03,049
secondary centers, a center 
with a number of arrows

103
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:09,015
which show the dynamic that goes 
in the direction of reinforcing

104
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:12,160
a number of precise ideas 
that were put in place.

105
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:19,002
So we see that, we are dealing with
agroalimentary industry issues

106
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:22,651
with the plan, so we are also dealing with
plans that are often sector-specific,

107
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,403
there is rarely a plan that synthesizes 
everything since it becomes

108
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:28,980
very complicated to read, but we realize

109
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,210
that we are no longer discussing
in terms of physical planning,

110
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:38,220
of project elements but of 
a regional dynamic

111
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,216
that we put ahead of a plan, 
with the use, in particular,

112
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:45,726
of a number of arrows, 
as we can see them here,

113
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:49,473
as we have seen them in 
the center of the plan.

114
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:54,245
So all of this to say that, in theory,
everyone has their own planning history.

115
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,450
Each time, it's said that up until now

116
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,838
we have been mistaken, that we are going 
to make a new tool,

117
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:03,119
and that thanks to this tool,
the planning will be useful and efficient.

118
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:07,956
We realize eventually that, aside from 
what I have called the first drawings

119
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:11,244
which are true subdivision plans,

120
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:13,238
which are plans of military genius,

121
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:18,670
but which shape the city, the urban shape, 
so the spatiality is created

122
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:24,696
through these plans, however templates 
are created, the size of the streets,

123
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:27,080
the size of the plots are created.

124
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,614
Everything else is after, after this first stage
of subdivision plans

125
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:34,150
which are the city's first urban plans.

126
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,421
After this stage, all the planning done,

127
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:43,505
from classical planning, 
simplified, the project list,

128
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:48,601
all this planning that I spoke of, 
that we saw in detail,

129
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:54,400
we have purely only done, exactly the same
thing, right up to the last plan

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,900
which is supposedly strategic, where 
we have invented nothing else

131
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,475
than doing what we used to do
except that it's presented

132
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:06,350
in a radically different way since we're 
trying to put forth the dynamics.

133
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,977
And then there is in the discourse
a way to make believe

134
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:13,169
that before it was being done wrong and
now we are going to do it correctly.

135
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,994
But strategic planning,
one must know,

136
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:19,405
is really the same as all planning.

137
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:23,452
And if the paradigm shift takes place, 
it is not between what

138
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:26,058
what happened before and today,

139
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,810
strategic planning, but it's really between

140
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,475
the first plans, which were 
subdivision plans,

141
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:35,721
which were urban plans,
which were an urban design;

142
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:39,955
there is a rupture between
this first part and everything after.

143
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,517
And the paradigm shift in urban planning

144
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:48,808
intervenes thus in this passing from

145
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:54,290
the first plans and the current plans
which are strategic plans.

146
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:00,263
There you have, quickly described, 
a history of planning

147
00:10:00,263 --> 00:10:02,812
without any date, which is distinctive.

148
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,052
Simply why?

149
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:06,524
Because the examples that I gave

150
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:10,228
were not necessarily created 
in a linear manner.

151
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:13,780
The different stages of plans happened 
in a linear manner

152
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,366
but some, like simplified planning,

153
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:23,233
was happening in 2000 in Mauritania 
while for other countries

154
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:28,710
it was happening in the 80s, even the 70s, 
even well before that.

155
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,634
So this whole history is not linear,

156
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,674
one must keep in mind that

157
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,965
we have these different stages and 
that today we're almost everywhere

158
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:42,590
in a strategic planning stage.
