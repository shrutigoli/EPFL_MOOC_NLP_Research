1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,939
In our video we are going 
to see the limits of plans.

2
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,460
We are going to see which 
elements do not allow

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,850
the plans to be more 
effective and more efficient.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,390
There are blocking elements
that we will try to identify.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,902
We will continue with general limits 
that are inherent

6
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:29,735
not to the making process of the plan 
but to the context,

7
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:32,280
and finally, we will talk about the method

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,950
as the success factor of urban plans.

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,680
In order to understand which levers

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,032
can be used to activate or modify the tool,

11
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:45,400
one has to understand the making process

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,704
of an urban plan or an urban planning plan.

13
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:52,050
We will see this step by step.

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,880
The different stages of the plan.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,740
First, the plan is an element
in the development project.

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,619
It does not contain all the projects,

17
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,520
but is one project among others.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,730
Then, the State and fund providers,

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,599
which can be the municipality but it's 
generally the State,

20
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,582
decide to make a plan, un SDAU
a master plan, a sketch, an outline

21
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:24,910
and determine a budget 
to create this plan.

22
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,120
Next is the writing of 
the terms of reference,

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,533
often outsourced to a private consultant, 
or done internally,

24
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,684
but in theory, 
the terms of reference are written

25
00:01:36,684 --> 00:01:41,810
and are eventually the guideline 
of the future urban plan.

26
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,533
After this, calls are made
for expressions of interest,

27
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:51,942
where the interested organisations
are asked to express their interest.

28
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:55,211
Then, a short-list is created

29
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:57,710
according to the files of the companies

30
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,821
to decide which organisations
will be able to bid.

31
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,932
Then, the tenderer is being launched

32
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:08,443
the offers are analyzed, 
negotiations with the best bid are made

33
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:13,220
and we have different stages of the project

34
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,833
and in the very end,
the structure of the plan is checked,

35
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:24,620
to see if the final product matches
the terms of reference,

36
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,640
if what was produced
matches what we wanted to produce.

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,335
It means that the key stage
in the making process of a plan

38
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:39,898
is the writing
of the terms of reference.

39
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:42,405
It is the only time

40
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:45,681
where it is possible to add innovation.

41
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:50,100
If you want to innovate 
with the planning tools,

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,516
there is only one moment in the whole process,

43
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:56,149
and that's when you write
the terms of reference.

44
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:59,953
After they are written, everything
flows from these terms of reference.

45
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:02,260
There is no more possibility for change.

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,044
It is said that a number 
of consulting firms

47
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:09,775
have a financial leeway and can be flexible,

48
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:15,556
it is true and false at the same time, 
since at the end of the process,

49
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:19,120
we will check if the firm
or the people in charge

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,748
of the urban planning 
have respected

51
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:25,002
the specifications, also called
the terms of reference.

52
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:27,566
So it is important to be aware of this,

53
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:30,660
it's the only time in the process where 
it's possible to change something.

54
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,720
And when it's understood
that this is the only time,

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,530
it is interesting to think about
how to write the terms of reference.

56
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,203
It's at that time that we gather

57
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:47,670
to imagine how the process 
will be able to develop.

58
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,620
We have seen one possible lever
for change,

59
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,426
to be able to inflect on the tools, 
to change them

60
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:03,500
or to add innovation 
to the planning tools.

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,230
We are now going to see
the limits to the plans.

62
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,784
By limits, I want to put forth
the elements which block

63
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:16,927
the plan or make it useless

64
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:22,180
since it is not made
according to the context.

65
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,770
The first thing to keep in mind

66
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,920
is that urban planning

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,840
is in direct connection

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,730
with the social structures 
of countries and cities.

69
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,239
First, be aware and remember

70
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:41,943
that urban planning is directly linked

71
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:46,304
to the political
and social structures of cities.

72
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:50,192
It means that
there are as many social structures

73
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:52,988
as there are cities or countries.

74
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:55,990
This is the first element to take into account.

75
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,192
The second one is to keep in mind 
that are being applied to African cities

76
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:03,602
only the tools which have been developped

77
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:06,620
elsewhere and especially in Europe.

78
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,020
It is easy to see that when 
we are in Abidjan,

79
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,927
we are not in Lausanne,
when we are in Dakar, it's not Paris.

80
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:15,783
The idea is not to give a value judgement,

81
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:19,010
but simply state that we are not 
dealing with the same reality.

82
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,530
We are not dealing with the same 
social realities,

83
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,162
we are not dealing with the same 
political realities,

84
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:26,052
there is no reason for the tool

85
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:29,220
being developed to be exactly 
the same.

86
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,058
Another element - in planning,

87
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:35,830
the size of cities is never 
taken into consideration.

88
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,019
Planning is different for a city
with 500 thousands people

89
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,720
and for a city with 5 million people.

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,149
The complexity is not the same,

91
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,860
the problems, the concerns, 
the challenges

92
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,456
are therefore not the same, 
so the answers

93
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:55,140
given with the planning tools
will not be the same.

94
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,430
Another element which largely limits 
the extent of our plans

95
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,426
is that the climate
is not taken into account.

96
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:09,420
It is the same planning in 
Douala, Nouakchott,

97
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,290
Ouagadougou, Addis Ababa, 
and Bamako or Kigali.

98
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,534
Yet the morphology and climate
are extremely different.

99
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:22,528
And this must be taken into account

100
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:26,240
if we want to be efficient
in planning the city.

101
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,753
Same thing for economic issues,

102
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:33,545
they are never addressed,
yet urbanization has a cost.

103
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:37,887
The decisions made at the planning level
have a direct impact

104
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:41,870
on the local communities and 
national finances.

105
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,682
And this is never negotiated, 
it is never underlined

106
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:49,560
and generally,
planning is made

107
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,989
like if it was totally separated
from the economic system.

108
00:06:54,989 --> 00:07:00,404
Finally, planning does not take
social practices into account,

109
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:05,062
be formal or informal, 
they are important

110
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:08,683
and they generate spatiality,

111
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:11,105
but they are also 
the very base of social life.

112
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:14,378
And if we don't understand
these social practices,

113
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:19,085
it's no use planning since we will 
be missing the point.

114
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:21,660
I am going to use a very simple example, 
real estate.

115
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,270
Most plans ignore the issue
of real estate.

116
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,808
Yet we know that it's a social practice 
whether it be formal or informal,

117
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:34,945
traditional or modern, 
it doesn't matter,

118
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:37,295
but the real estate issue
is fundamental.

119
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:40,685
If I don't take
the real estate issue seriously

120
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:44,102
it's useless to plan

121
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:47,613
since I will be missing the point anyway,

122
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:52,139
as real estate practices will be more
important than my practices as planner.

123
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,946
To conclude and sum up the limits,

124
00:07:55,946 --> 00:08:00,012
this long list of limiting elements,

125
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,924
we must realize that

126
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:07,320
we never really plan the
existing situation.

127
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,362
We plan for what we could call

128
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:14,510
the average man, a man who
would be neither rich,

129
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,075
nor poor, a man who, in fact,

130
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:21,680
does not exist or is in minority 
in African cities.

131
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,552
So there is an idea 
of an urban resident type

132
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:29,360
which is modeled after 
a few European cities,

133
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,728
of an average man, who would have a car,

134
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:37,426
a plot of land with a detached house.

135
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:41,739
Yet in African cities,
we are far from this,

136
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:44,456
and in all urban world

137
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,776
we are, in theory, very very 
far from this situation.

138
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,290
So we plan for a man 
who does not exist.

139
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,240
Not for an existing context,
but for one that does not exist.

140
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,040
And this is all the limits of the plan,

141
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,284
as we don't use the real social practices,

142
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:04,705
we plan for an archetype
which does not exist.

143
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:08,948
We ignore the climate 
and morphological context,

144
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,639
the economic situation, 
all these things

145
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,952
which really help planning the city.

146
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:17,430
So how to go about it?

147
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,180
We will see next week some recipes,

148
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,422
some don't like this word,

149
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:25,690
but I find it very appropriate to give 
some recipes,

150
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,430
some very simple ones,
which include the different contexts

151
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,362
but one thing is certain,

152
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:36,252
if we want to overcome all the limits,

153
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:41,412
if we wan to rethink the object, 
the planning tool

154
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:47,630
we need to reintroduce innovation in 
the terms of reference,

155
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,680
and what we need is a method.

156
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,204
In fact, we could use almost 
the same method,

157
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:58,509
it's a method which wants
to take into account

158
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:01,110
the particularities of each city.

159
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,500
In summary, there is no difference

160
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,804
between physical and strategic planning, 
as seen in the History of Planning,

161
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:16,228
we saw that innovation can only be
introduced into the terms of reference,

162
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:21,558
and finally, all the limiting elements
showing that each city need its own plan

163
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:25,437
and that it is not possible

164
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:28,354
to copy paste elements between cities.

165
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:31,090
All this is brought together
with the question of method.

166
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,200
And the method must give
some rules,

167
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,168
it means that we will make a plan, 
which should be done

168
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:40,006
within the administration, 
where we have brought

169
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,205
some external experts,

170
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:45,410
as we cannot know everything 
in the administrations,

171
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,860
in the large administrations and 
this works well,

172
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,856
in the little ones, the number 
of people is insufficient.

173
00:10:50,856 --> 00:10:54,506
We also need external opinions
in order to mix ideas

174
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:57,326
but it's necessary for the people

175
00:10:57,326 --> 00:11:00,779
who will manage the plan

176
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,000
to be the same as those who created it.

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,828
The person who creates it has 
to take it on and manage it,

178
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:11,270
and this situation only 
happens within administrations.

179
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,804
For this, we bring together a group, 
there is a great experiment which

180
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:16,856
was done in N'Djamena a few years ago,

181
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:20,314
we will show some results 
and we will describe

182
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:23,374
in the next videos the methods 
that were used,

183
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:26,704
but the idea behind it is to have 
a group that develops the plan

184
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:29,930
and introduces slowly their ideas into it

185
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,664
so they will be able in the future

186
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:37,007
to defend the ideas on a daily basis, 
to colleagues or other partners

187
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:40,028
such as public authorities,

188
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:42,680
if the plan was not made 
within public authorities.

189
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,592
It is definitely the idea that

190
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:51,340
there is one method allowing
to come up with a plan for a city,

191
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,521
and that this plan matches exactly 
in its structure and idea,

192
00:11:56,521 --> 00:12:00,620
the political and social structure 
of the city,

193
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,690
taking the climate and else into account

194
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,891
to overcome all said limits.

195
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:10,402
Finally, one of the criteria of our method

196
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:15,328
that we will clarify later, 
is that it is important

197
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:20,407
that all themes, subjects and problems 
are managed at the same level.

198
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,355
There is no hierarchy in themes,

199
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:26,003
we have to approach
all themes and issues

200
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:28,651
that we will find while planning
in the same way and with great respect.
