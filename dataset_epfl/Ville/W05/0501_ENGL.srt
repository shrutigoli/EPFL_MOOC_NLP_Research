00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,092
This week we are in Cameroon, 
in the capital.

2
00:00:10,422 --> 00:00:13,660
So welcome, all participants
to YaoundÃ©.

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,770
Briefly, in this video we'll discuss 
what is urban sprawl.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,346
Urban sprawl is considered, 
rightly or wrongly,

5
00:00:24,346 --> 00:00:26,362
as a form of urban dysfunction.

6
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:30,780
It is when the city outgrows 
its own administrative borders.

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,890
We speak of urban sprawl when a city 
begins to grow and spread

8
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,352
like oil stains, all over the place, 
beyond its administrative borders

9
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:48,576
Logically, the master plan 
should fix urban sprawl,

10
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:52,980
should establish the limits beyond which 
it is no longer possible to build.

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,670
Urban sprawl is when a city 
spreads throughout,

12
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,230
in all the gaps and spaces, 
even those most dangerous.

13
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,321
In other words, one of the principal 
effects of urban sprawl

14
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:07,545
is that it destroys natural resources.

15
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:10,235
So we seek out land 
further and further out,

16
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:12,850
for land virgin of all urbanization.

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,036
But urban sprawl is also where 
we have intrusion

18
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:19,622
in places were one 
simply should not build.

19
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:22,060
In ravines, in ditches.

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,936
And in the end it establishes itself 
in zones we call non-edificandi,

21
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:30,060
which are zones where one 
absolutely should not build.

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,988
Why? Because it's dangerous, 
or because it's a nature reserve,

23
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:36,439
or because there are specific resources,

24
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:40,482
this can be a groundwater table, 
or water resources, a lake,

25
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:44,749
this can be a marsh, 
a certain type of prairie,

26
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:48,120
a certain type of forest where 
there are protected species.

27
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,856
But urban sprawl not only
poses problems

28
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:55,904
in terms of resources 
or non-building zones,

29
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:59,060
it poses problems in terms 
of infrastructure.

30
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,035
The greater the sprawl, the growth,

31
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:04,800
the farther the city grows 
from its center,

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,340
the more difficult it is to set up 
the necessary networks.

33
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,438
The less dense the city, 
the more diffuse it is,

34
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:16,195
the more expensive the linear meter 
of pipe per capita,

35
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:21,390
or the greater the number of pipes 
or networks per capita.

36
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,720
So one of the important effects 
of urban sprawl is, finally,

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,152
that it does not allow us to service 
and sustain the entire area.

38
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,804
And the greater the sprawl,

39
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:37,850
the fewer the networks available 
for all these surfaces.

40
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,915
We were speaking of networks,

41
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:42,300
but its exactly the same 
with transportation systems.

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,784
The farther away I go, 
the farther it is to reach me,

43
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:51,200
or the farther I must go 
to bring them to the center.

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,578
But the question of networks 
or of transportation systems,

45
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:57,160
is exactly and strictly the same.

46
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,400
So what are the causes 
of this urban sprawl?

47
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,953
A legal question,

48
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:07,816
a legal case which, ultimately, 
doesn't exist, for it is allowed.

49
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:10,560
And if it exists, it is not applied.

50
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,700
Or if one tries to apply the law 
one simply doesn't have the means

51
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,490
to control its application.

52
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:21,098
It's not enough to just say, 
"This is the regulation, this is the law."

53
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:27,408
There must also be entire units of code 
enforcers whose job it is to ensure

54
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:31,350
that what is put in the law 
is truly applied on the ground.

55
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,255
The problem in most cities is that 
the legislative infrastructure exists,

56
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:42,024
but the means to control it do not,
and as we know, without its control

57
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:45,219
people will continue 
to spread out as they wish,

58
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:48,004
with or without the law's approval.

59
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:50,500
Beyond the existing regulation 
there are urban plans

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,132
which are, in principle, 
extremely outdated.

61
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,013
These are rarely updated, and even 
when they are, they are rarely utilized.

62
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:59,473
We'll examine the limits of these plans,

63
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:04,206
and how to overcome these limits, 
in the videos which follow.

64
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:10,996
For now let's keep in mind that 
the plan is rarely as it should be,

65
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:13,500
is rarely as useful as it should be,

66
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,640
but it should, normally, be able 
to contain this urban sprawl,

67
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,136
because it should define the perimeter 
within which one can develop,

68
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:26,170
and the perimeter beyond 
which one cannot.

69
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,970
Another cause of urban sprawl

70
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,030
is clearly that demand exceeds supply.

71
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,740
This is why people will go 
farther and farther out.

72
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,606
In a free land market, 
in a free housing market,

73
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:44,270
in a liberal economic system 
price is determined

74
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,351
as a function of a certain number 
of contextual criteria,

75
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:51,741
but in principle as a function
of supply and demand.

76
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:59,558
So if I wish to construct, to own land, 
I must go as far as possible

77
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:03,250
because the prices, in the center 
of the city, are beyond my reach.

78
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,772
Because of this people go 
farther and farther out.

79
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,591
And the denser I make the center,

80
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:10,970
the more I develop 
its infrastructure, its networks,

81
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,200
the higher the price of the land,

82
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,380
and the farther away the poorest 
must go to find affordable land.

83
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,580
This is one of the phenomena, one of 
the causes of urban sprawl.

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,921
Now that we've seen its causes,

85
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:27,216
let's look at how we might 
reduce its effects.

86
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:29,895
First and foremost we must put in place

87
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:33,159
a legal framework, one which 
is relatively simple,

88
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:39,190
yet operational, and one must provide 
it with means of control.

89
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,365
We must determine a certain number 
of non edificandi zones,

90
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:46,492
and implement strict controls, 
physical controls over the land,

91
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:49,281
so that no one can settle in the zones,

92
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:52,940
which might be zones with ravines, 
zones which could be dangerous,

93
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,520
whether due to flooding, 
because of marshlands,

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,540
because of sandstorms, 
or on dunes which can shift.

95
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,685
This is one of the first points, 
to put in place a legal framework,

96
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:15,226
correctly, simply, which may well exist, 
but as we've seen, but above all

97
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:18,590
it must clearly be able 
to control this framework.

98
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,754
And parallel to this, 
it is not just a matter of saying

99
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:24,480
this is authorized, this is prohibited.

100
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,595
There must be a series of measures 
which accompany this.

101
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,176
And if one does not look into 
the question of housing,

102
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:36,195
if one does not propose aids in supply, 
and demand, when it comes to housing.

103
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,793
If there is not a public housing policy

104
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:42,969
which enables even the poorest 
to gain access to land,

105
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,039
urban sprawl will continue.

106
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,686
So at the same time act within 
a framework strictly of planning,

107
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:55,273
regulatory, judicial, and their 
different forms of control,

108
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:58,890
and at the same time on public policy,
most notably housing and development.

109
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,630
If we do not address both aspects,

110
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,950
urban sprawl will continue 
now, and forever.
