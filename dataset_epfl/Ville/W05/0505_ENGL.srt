1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,568
Here, we go one step further,

2
00:00:06,568 --> 00:00:10,219
since we are going to go from 
what is called classical planning,

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:15,720
that I call physical planning
of the city, to strategic planning.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,653
So we're going to stop the suspense,

5
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:23,674
we are going to give the end of the movie,

6
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:26,658
meaning you will see, we will be talking 
about physical planing

7
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:30,294
or strategic planning, there is no 
paradigm shift.

8
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:34,464
We're dealing with the same type 
of thinking, the same type of tools,

9
00:00:34,464 --> 00:00:39,608
we have simply upgraded 
the questions a little bit,

10
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:47,495
we have opened the box, to go from
a rigid physical planning to a planning

11
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:50,121
much more flexible which would bring 
about the intervention of other players.

12
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:53,126
But, broadly speaking, the purpose,
which most of the time,

13
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:56,203
is a plan, is exactly the same.

14
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:59,416
Two definitions of strategic planning.

15
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:04,939
Strategic spatial planning is a process 
of collective elaboration.

16
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:09,840
There it is, the big news is 
that there is a participatory process

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,830
with a number of players 
who have to be present.

18
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,290
And this is a city project carried out
by the political power, inevitably, here,

19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:24,998
we are dealing with classical planning 
since it was already the case.

20
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:29,082
We define a general framework consisting 
of general guidelines

21
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:34,404
and principles of action to control 
the development of an urban area.

22
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:41,327
This is the main objective, it is
the mastery of an urban area of the city.

23
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:43,734
That is the French Agency of Development

24
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:46,500
which in one of its documents, 
which you will find referenced,

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,768
so all the documents 
that are used for this type

26
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:51,360
of definition are, of course, referenced.

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,807
You will be able to see the references,

28
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:57,210
and when there is a PDF link there

29
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,710
and free of copyright, the link is 
of course set and just go click.

30
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,410
Strategic planning provides 
a methodology.

31
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,190
Once again, we are dealing with

32
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,421
new methods which allow cities
to identify the strengths

33
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:17,560
and weaknesses and then

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,070
we define the strategies 
for local development.

35
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:28,928
It is the UCLG which gives 
this definition of strategic planning.

36
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:32,889
We are not going to 
make more definitions

37
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:39,956
since virtually each donor, each 
association, has its own definition.

38
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:45,368
The planning aspect means that we
are looking to regulate development.

39
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:48,763
It's the very definition of planning.

40
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:53,750
Planning gives us a notion of time,

41
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,712
we try to imagine what the city will be 
in the future and we try to imagine,

42
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,537
both spatially and socially 
what the city will be.

43
00:03:05,537 --> 00:03:08,480
We should not confuse planning 
and programming.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,710
Programming would be the 
operative version under the guise

45
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,230
of a number of projects in a plan.

46
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,570
Let's keep for planning the idea 
of frame-working, of mastering

47
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:27,823
a development, in time, both 
socially and spatially.

48
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:29,263
Urban, why?

49
00:03:29,263 --> 00:03:33,151
Because it is located in an area 
which is the city area.

50
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:36,092
So we are dealing with spatial issues,

51
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:39,160
we are not interested in planning

52
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,009
what is not directly spatialized 
or spatial or that would have

53
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:48,939
an important effect on 
the spatial aspect of the city.

54
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:53,620
Finally, the concept of strategy, 
it involves more the question

55
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,698
of process, of progress, to achieve
a goal that has been given.

56
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,902
So behind this, there is not 
only the objective

57
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:08,870
but the means to achieve this objective
which is also important.

58
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,092
So the few keywords of this planning.

59
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:16,423
The question of priorities, 
strategic planning demonstrates

60
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:22,812
what the city priorities are,
demonstrates these priorities in time.

61
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:25,400
So there is a notion of perspective.

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,042
The idea behind this, is that we will 
distribute resources, we come back

63
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:35,560
to the question of priorities, 
which resources are used first?

64
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,657
What resources do we use second?

65
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:46,146
There is there, behind the idea of 
of ​​strategic planning a new instrument.

66
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:48,968
We were talking earlier about progress,

67
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:51,216
we were talking about the goal to be
achieved, but of the process

68
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:54,423
which allows us to achieve this goal,

69
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:58,460
it's there that there is 
a new instrument to put in place.

70
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,805
A new instrument which is meant, 
it is the goal of the planning,

71
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:06,818
which is there to 
coordinate public politics.

72
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:12,413
So we are going to, thanks to this new 
instrument, transform public action.

73
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:16,634
We must be able to see this
in a dynamic question,

74
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:22,753
it allows to coordinate and transform 
public politics at the same time.

75
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:26,628
It can materialize in the form 
of drawings, plans,

76
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:32,755
but also regulations or public policies, 
as we have already said.

77
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:34,983
So the physical planning of the city,

78
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:38,790
this is also what we call sometimes
technical planning, in my opinion,

79
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:45,419
too reducing as a term, it's what 
some call classical planning,

80
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:50,371
allowing for the assumption or
understanding that it's the old version

81
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:53,670
of planning and that strategic planning

82
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,964
would come on the scene as something 
extremely new, there, in the middle.

83
00:05:56,964 --> 00:06:02,747
We have seen it earlier, 
there is nothing new in the strategy.

84
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:05,100
We saw it earlier,

85
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,305
there is nothing new in the strategic 
urban planning tool.

86
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,567
There are new things that happen but

87
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:16,130
there is no real paradigm shift.

88
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,770
So planning, for me, is not classical

89
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,560
but it is what I call 
the physical planning of the city.

90
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,656
This planning, it's here for,

91
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:30,806
both mastering the different uses

92
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:37,120
or the land uses and at the same time, to 
manage the distance between these uses.

93
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,932
It is a very reductive drawing, 
but it's true

94
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:44,849
that this drawing started from a 
quantification of the elements.

95
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:50,308
So there is of course, behind this 
an idea to quantify things,

96
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:55,930
an idea of modeling things, to be able to,
in this way, imagine their future.

97
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,310
So, physical planning, also known as 
technocratic, also known as technical,

98
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,290
that is known to be flexible, finally, 
it's what we wanted to put there.

99
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,690
Indeed, the plans are relatively rigid,

100
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,210
but nothing used to stop us before,

101
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,910
the invention of strategic planning 
to make documents

102
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,300
or to make tools that were 
much more flexible.

103
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,650
But it is clear that there is something 
much more static.

104
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,928
And what we look for then, 
is to go to something that

105
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:32,269
is flexible which corresponds much 
better to the city's rapid changes.

106
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:37,500
We'll start, of course, from the question 
of the new urban situation.

107
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,344
So each time that we want
to justify a new instrument,

108
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:44,384
we must of course say that 
the situation has changed,

109
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:46,978
which is, in this case is true, really,

110
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:49,185
this doesn't even truly change,

111
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:50,911
there are few paradigm shifts.

112
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:53,760
On the other hand, there is 
an acceleration of changes.

113
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,986
And we visibly have a change of scale, 
where we have gone

114
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:03,368
from municipal management to a 
management of towns and cities.

115
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:05,206
A change of scale, which doesn't mean

116
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:08,206
that the administrative network 
has already changed.

117
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:11,460
Most of the time, we are still 
dealing with municipalities,

118
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,466
a number of municipalities can 
form an urban community,

119
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:17,870
or a district but it's rare that we have

120
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:24,000
an entire town that would be treated
as a single and unique city.

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,880
We have a redistribution of powers 
due to decentralization.

122
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,020
So, often a power has been decentralized, 
the financial means have

123
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,090
never or very rarely been decentralized, 
which raises another concern.

124
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,974
We have in the context of globalization, 
new centralities that appear,

125
00:08:42,974 --> 00:08:46,462
so this is effectively 
a fairly recent situation.

126
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:48,755
We have seen with global cities,

127
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:52,230
there is competition 
of a number of cities.

128
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,781
The role of the civil society
that has increased,

129
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:58,150
the civil society will also get an input.

130
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,640
The emergence of new players who are 
particularly private players.

131
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,942
So it's quite interesting to see 
that they are considered

132
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:12,565
as new players in the African cities
or in the European cities.

133
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:16,780
If we consider urban planning in the USA, 
we realize that

134
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,188
the city development,
particularly New York

135
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:21,350
was made with private players.

136
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,698
So in the USA, it's something very old.

137
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:28,479
In Europe, in Africa it's something

138
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:32,430
much newer, to take into 
account private players.

139
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,420
In summary, the strategic planning 
has an objective, the improvement

140
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,320
of quality of life, evidently, this 
is not new either, this objective.

141
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,080
An objective, finally, little innovative

142
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,890
since it is the same in 
almost all the cities.

143
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,440
With behind this, 
notions of equity of area

144
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,751
of social equity, but it's about this,

145
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:02,098
the main objective is the improvement 
of the quality of life

146
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:04,920
of all of the residents of the city.

147
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,560
It's very important, the last part, 
all of the residents of the city.

148
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,893
If the goal, if the objective,
remains classical,

149
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:17,757
it's also a process, it's an instrument
that takes a different shape

150
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:21,441
since we are really dealing with
a planning process with

151
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:24,521
the new players as well 
as the private ones,

152
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:26,831
civil society, all of these people

153
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:30,820
are player who become
important in planning.

154
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,571
So we have a goal that remains the same, 
since the dawn of time,

155
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:38,560
in the end, the improvement of quality 
of life is what we're looking for.

156
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,318
But we also have an instrument 
that becomes dynamic

157
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:49,400
since it's no longer a finality but
it becomes an entire process.

158
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,850
Finally the shape of the instrument, 
it is flexible,

159
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,630
simple and finally modifiable 
rather quickly in time.

160
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,280
So in summary we have
a new scale of area, new players,

161
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:13,534
we have new themes, new thematics 
and all this shapes an instrument

162
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:16,500
that's called strategic urban planning.

163
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,322
To conclude, some drawbacks

164
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:23,076
to this strategic planning, 
which seems to

165
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:28,527
throw everything which was before, 
quantitative, we have gone from

166
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:32,210
a quantification of area
to a qualification of area

167
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,435
by throwing the quantification, 
I think that precisely

168
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:40,363
a smart tool should use the two, 
so it is not against the other.

169
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:44,159
Strategic planning gives the impression 
that it no longer wants to address things

170
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,855
from a model perspective, quantitative,

171
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:50,260
but above all with qualitative aspects.

172
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,550
I think they are actually very 
important, but we need both.

173
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,340
Again when we want to believe 
something is completely new,

174
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,875
we minimize what 
has already been done before

175
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,782
to the point of caricaturing, for this 
also there is a mistake,

176
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:04,668
there is a considerable bias
because we cannot say

177
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:07,578
that we are dealing with 
something totally new,

178
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:10,775
it is just reflections

179
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:16,030
that go a little further, that take on 
a few more player legitimately,

180
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,956
it's fine but we are not going to say
that nothing was happening

181
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:21,365
and that nothing was done before.

182
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,077
So we are really dealing with 
strategic planning not being

183
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,439
a rupture but fits exactly in the 
continuity and it should not be

184
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:31,000
made to believe that before this 
there was nothing

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,500
and that today we found a solution, 
it's absolutely not the case.

186
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,920
The proof is that the shape tool 
remains a plan, a regulation, so

187
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,040
this is the unsurpassable framework that 
even strategic planning has not suceeded

188
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,770
in surpassing, not succeeded 
in proposing something new,

189
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,938
it's important to understand it,
and there is behind this,

190
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,500
a very important point that 
I would like to highlight today.

191
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,652
In the global cities theories,
we have seen it,

192
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:02,340
the cities play on the competition 
with each other.

193
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,600
And we have seen that for this there needs
to be a concentration of powers.

194
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,728
In each city which has wanted 
to become a global city,

195
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:17,217
we have seen a reconcentration
of powers with a small group

196
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:21,065
that had their hands free to play 
on this competition.

197
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:23,531
Yet what strategic planning proposes

198
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:26,930
today is exactly the opposite.

199
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,415
It's that this power be given

200
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:31,870
to the greatest number, that we have 
a maximum of players.

201
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,325
So it's necessary to know that on
one side we have an opening,

202
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:38,226
it's the strategic urban planning

203
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:41,482
and on the other side global cities 
so as to be able to play

204
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:48,037
on the competition, we realize that they 
have to re-centralize the powers

205
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,600
and designate their actions

206
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,595
and their plannings according 
to these global objectives.

207
00:13:54,595 --> 00:13:59,812
So there is here a major paradox 
with two situations

208
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:02,860
that do not lead at all to 
the same type of city.

209
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,809
So if we wanted to continue to caricature 
a little more, we would say that

210
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:14,300
if the African cities absolutely want 
to become global cities,

211
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:20,800
play a role in the international scene, 
there must be above all strategic planning

212
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,362
or rather the planning method 
needs to be drastically changed

213
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:29,290
and the powers re-centered
to propose a planning

214
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,282
that is directly in total agreement

215
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:36,390
with the competition objective 
with the other cities.

216
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,235
I am not placing 
any value judgement on this,

217
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:41,435
I am not saying it needs to be
one more than the other,

218
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:44,584
one must simply be conscious that it 
will not result in the same objectives.

219
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:49,480
There it is, we stop here for 
strategic urban planning.

220
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,940
I look forward to seeing you
in the next video.
