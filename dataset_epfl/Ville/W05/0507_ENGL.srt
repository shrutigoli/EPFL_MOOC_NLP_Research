1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,250
In today's video, 
we will take a quick look

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,370
at a case study of the city of Nouakchott,

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,540
from the first plans from 1957,

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,700
to the master plans developed in 2002.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,137
To begin, some images.

6
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:28,190
Seen from downtown, we can see 
the soccer stadium in the distance.

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,018
Quickly, I hope that all of you know
more or less where Mauritania is.

8
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:39,536
But here's a little reminder, 
a map of Africa, its south cut off.

9
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:42,090
We can see where Mauritania is situated.

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,691
We zoom in a bit, and see that the city 
of Nouakchott is on its Atlantic coast.

11
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:53,450
Here we have a map,
a plan of the city of Nouakchott.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,816
Very quickly, we have the airport 
here, in the center.

13
00:00:58,816 --> 00:01:04,146
We have a main thoroughfare here, 
another which goes to Mali,

14
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:06,504
Another here which goes to Senegal.

15
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:13,750
The Atlantic side with 
its coastal dunes, here.

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:23,078
We have the Sebkha area, 
ancient salt flats, below sea level.

17
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:29,763
We have the historic center here,
split in two by a boulevard,

18
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:33,953
the administrative zone and 
the working-class neighborhoods.

19
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,845
The residential neighborhoods 
which are developed.

20
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:39,218
The working-class neighborhoods, here,

21
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:41,791
the large shantytowns here, and here,

22
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:47,584
and an urbanization which stretches out, 
lengthwise, along these axes.

23
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,940
Here, a photo of one of the markets.

24
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,860
This is the Socogim market, 
in a working-class neighborhood.

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,420
A view of downtown, 
a bank under construction.

26
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:06,770
Here a main road with some trees 
planted on the median.

27
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,680
Here, another view of 
a working-class neighborhood.

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,910
The images you see here were taken 
between 2000 and 2014.

29
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,424
There aren't dates on each photo

30
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:23,028
to bring us here to this one,

31
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:25,353
which is that of the governor,

32
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:29,418
whose name appears here, 
on a plan dated 1957.

33
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:36,954
We must remember that 1958 was 
when ground was first broken.

34
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:39,756
We can see here that a part of 
the plan is missing,

35
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:46,786
but one thing is certain; this was 
a governor who wanted to urbanize.

36
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:51,877
He tried, but didn't necessarily 
succeed in achieving much.

37
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:56,800
All of these plans are from Pitte, 
"Nouakchott Capitale de la Mauritanie."

38
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,054
like that of "Le Projet Hersch," 1957, 
and a series of plans which followed,

39
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:05,434
but we can already see 
a large boulevard here,

40
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:09,560
with residential areas and 
working-class neighborhoods.

41
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,822
Same here, still the large boulevard.

42
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:17,110
We finally see here the 3-meter curve,

43
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,441
the working-class neighborhoods 
in the south,

44
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:22,192
and the administrative area 
in the north.

45
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:25,224
"Le Plan Lainville," will develop rapidly.

46
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:28,590
There were truly seeking 
a form for this city.

47
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,886
And we see here that we have 
a boulevard which separates,

48
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:35,504
and which once again shows

49
00:03:35,504 --> 00:03:37,762
the working-class 
neighborhoods of the south,

50
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:41,590
and the residential and administrative 
zones of the north.

51
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,840
A diagram of the focus 
of the SMUH, from 1970.

52
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,960
We recognize the same 
boulevard we saw before.

53
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,999
We now see an airport here,

54
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,349
working-class zones below,

55
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:57,199
residential and administrative 
zones above,

56
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,080
with the addition of the fishermen's 
beach and the fishing port.

57
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,500
We are still using rather restrained 
dimensions for this city.

58
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,730
Then, in 1983, once again 
we recognize the boulevard here.

59
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,890
The airport is still there,

60
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,580
and then the administrative 
and residential zones.

61
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,670
The working-class neighborhood here, 
with its extensions to the south,

62
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,300
and the residential spread to the north.

63
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,006
And an idea...

64
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:34,732
When we see the definitive city plan, 
one thing makes us smile,

65
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:38,720
which is the addition of 
an enormous green space, here.

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,910
This green space will eventually 
become an enormous shantytown.

67
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,620
Another image, this of a street, 
the large boulevard which separated,

68
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,555
long ago, the northern part 
from the southern part.

69
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:57,240
The city outskirts 
with its livestock markets,

70
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,515
markets for small livestock, 
and those for large livestock.

71
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:04,990
But it is in the city's center where 
we find this type of activity.

72
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,810
A typical street in a middle-class 
neighborhood.

73
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,540
Again, a market.

74
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,090
We have here a rather difficult 
situation, on an environmental level.

75
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,784
View of a construction project.

76
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:25,340
It's is a relatively recent phenomenon 
to construct high-rises in Nouakchott.

77
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,741
A second-story addition.

78
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,876
So we utilize the first level here,

79
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:34,417
then soon we slowly build upwards,

80
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,817
one, two, three stories,

81
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:40,240
as income and finances 
allow, of course.

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,040
A view from one of the more 
precarious neighborhoods, Elmina.

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,228
We were speaking about shantytowns earlier.

84
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:53,385
They make up a large part of the city, 
these precarious neighborhoods.

85
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:58,630
A vast restructuring project in this 
neighborhood was begun in 2002.

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,762
The demolition in the city center 
of a building, from around 1960,

87
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:07,816
to make way for new ones, 
more densely built.

88
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:11,531
There is then in this way 
a certain recycling of buildings,

89
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:14,680
of land purchase, of demolition 
and reconstruction.

90
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,096
And now let's look at the final plan, 
the master plan.

91
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:26,770
We have a few maps which are 
the diagnostic plans

92
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,874
made by the design firm Urbaplan

93
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:34,836
for the Office of Urban Development 
of the city of Nouakchott.

94
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:39,117
So under commission by 
the administration

95
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:42,826
it is a private agency which 
prepares a diagnostic.

96
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:46,862
As we've seen in the different phases, 
following the diagnostic

97
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:50,700
it will prepare a master plan 
looking ahead 10, 20 years.

98
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,141
This is a very classic plan, 
because it has an activity zone,

99
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:58,640
and a commercial zone.

100
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,178
The different city zones 
are marked in this way.

101
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:05,286
We see the port, here.

102
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:10,550
We see a certain number 
of main economic areas,

103
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,360
and of course secondary ones.

104
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,074
The administrative system.

105
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:23,038
Nouakchott is divided in Murata
in a way that each has autonomy,

106
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,550
this relative, but autonomy 
nonetheless, with a central point

107
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,258
which is the intersection 
of my grid which allows us

108
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:32,780
to count the number of kilometers 
towards the South or the North.

109
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,350
The city limit of Nouakchott is situated 
at 12 kilometers to the North,

110
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,533
18 to the South, and 13 to the East.

111
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:46,166
Its western border is that of 
the Atlantic Ocean.

112
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:48,740
Primary water systems.

113
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,232
Here we see the major circuits,
and according to these plans

114
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:57,516
there is now another network which 
comes from the South, here.

115
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:03,244
It was not taken into account then,
because this dates from 2002.

116
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,745
The stages of expansion.

117
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:10,998
The plans are illustrative, I should say, 
for they are not fundamental.

118
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:16,381
We won't go through them one after 
the other, but just to give you

119
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:19,315
an idea of what was done 
in the city of Nouakchott.

120
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:21,467
I'm not making any 
value judgements here,

121
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:25,121
if it's good or bad, if it might have 
been done another way, or not.

122
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:28,825
I simply wish to use them 
to illustrate a master plan

123
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:30,403
for urban design and development,

124
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:31,851
which exists, which is in progress,

125
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:33,780
which is the case of 
the city of Nouakchott.

126
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,284
There, the housing zones which 
were allotted but not yet built.

127
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:46,432
Urban public transport services, 
the different bus routes which exist,

128
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:52,525
and the existing roadway systems 
and those planned for the future.

129
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,268
This is the result.

130
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:59,500
We've seen all the diagnostic plans.

131
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,553
The first result, Nouakchott in 2010,

132
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:09,560
a 10-year plan, or 8 years, 
since this was begun in 2002.

133
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,660
Next, the second plan, 
Nouakchott 2020.

134
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,880
It's 20 years, with a more significant 
urban expansion.

135
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,645
We won't go into much detail 
on these two plans.

136
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:28,336
Instead we'll simply indicate and show 
the type of instruments put in place,

137
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:30,165
and the form which each might take,

138
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:33,800
to formulate a master plan 
of design and urban development.

139
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:38,757
We've finished with the case study 
of Nouakchott.

140
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:40,718
We moved very quickly.

141
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:43,206
The documents are available 
as resources.

142
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:47,832
We'll include a few things which will 
allow you to dig deeper,

143
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:51,130
to read more about the city 
of Nouakchott, if you are interested.

144
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,961
But I wanted to quickly show you 
what a planning tool looks like,

145
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:58,582
what an urbanization plan looks like.

146
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:01,000
To conclude, the URL's for two websites.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,014
The office which made the plan, 
the client who commissioned it,

148
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:07,920
in this case the Agency for Urban 
Development of Mauritania.

149
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,380
Go to these sites and you'll find 
lots of additional information.
