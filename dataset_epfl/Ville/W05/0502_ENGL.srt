1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,240
We're going to take a quick look 
at urban professions.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,232
These include, of course, not just 
city planners or surveyors,

3
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:16,510
there are also lawyers, architects, 
engineers, land surveyors.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,995
We'll look briefly at some 
of these professions.

5
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:22,175
Why?

6
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:27,370
Simply to highlight the fact that 
the various inputs in urban issues

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,731
are not always the same, 
when it comes to discipline.

8
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:32,186
We should always keep this in mind.

9
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:35,706
The architect will, of course, 
look at urban design,

10
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:39,336
as well as at the relationship 
between things, spatiality,

11
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:43,668
while the economist will see only 
a vast web of interchange

12
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,960
between people, between societies.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,522
So ultimately the same aspect of the city

14
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:51,249
will be viewed from 
totally different angles.

15
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:54,720
This must be kept in mind 
when one begins to plan.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,487
The goal of planning is not to favor 
one discipline over another,

17
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:03,290
but instead to integrate and articulate 
all of these urban professions.

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,055
In formulating my plan for the city,

19
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:10,342
I can in this way just as well focus 
on questions of design,

20
00:01:10,342 --> 00:01:12,649
on questions of economics, 
of flow management,

21
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:16,197
engineering systems, etc., 
as we'll see when we continue.

22
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:20,337
First, the architecture.

23
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:23,000
We've found an old plan,

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,800
as you can see, one from 
classical architecture.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,486
Why are architects interested in

26
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:32,580
the relationships which exist 
between objects.

27
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,975
The idea is to create a spatiality, 
the representation is two-dimensional,

28
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:38,970
of course we represent 
in two dimensions

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,520
a reality which is three-dimensional.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,755
But the interest, as we've seen 
in the last image,

31
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,119
is to see the relationship 
which is established

32
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,513
between the different elements 
which make up the city.

33
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:54,278
We have here a map of land allotments.

34
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:57,368
Here too there is no explanation 
of its origin.

35
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:02,567
We see a certain number of parcels 
with, each time, let me mark it...

36
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:09,246
We can see a certain number 
of islets with parcels,

37
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:14,457
and then for each parcel,
there is a zone for the house,

38
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:17,558
and a zone for a garden behind it.

39
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:22,780
This is the plan of the surveyor.

40
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,320
The surveyor, also known as the 
topographer, is fundamental.

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,410
The surveyor plays a key role 
in the making of a city.

42
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,802
It is ultimately the surveyor who, 
in the end, has the most impact.

43
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:39,672
There is absolutely 
no recognition of this fact.

44
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:43,724
There is absolutely no recognition of 
this power of decision-making,

45
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:49,038
but it is clearly the surveyor, 
who subdivides, most of the time,

46
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:50,272
the parcels.

47
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:54,117
It is the surveyor who, 
as a general rule, maps out road systems.

48
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:58,600
So the surveyor has his own 
particular way of making a city,

49
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,540
but is one of the most important 
elements in its making.

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,251
An engineering plan.

51
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,299
Now we're not aware, 
not always aware,

52
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:13,950
We're here at ground level... 
the people are here

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,848
And what interests us is this zone, here, 
all that goes on underground.

54
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:24,170
And all that happens underground is 
the domain of civil engineering.

55
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,360
All the networks, the pipelines,
electricity, drinking water systems,

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,770
waste water systems, if these exist,

57
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,947
all this happens here, underground.

58
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:39,370
So we can also imagine 
an entire vision of the city

59
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,290
from the perspective of 
civil engineering, and its grids.

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,270
In a very symptomatic way, here, 
a carcass in a public space,

61
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,240
a cow's carcass.

62
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,970
A few donkeys, we see the problems 
of waste management,

63
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,630
the problems of the environment.

64
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,736
And we arrive at the role of the engineer 
of environmental sciences,

65
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:04,602
or the environmentalist.

66
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:09,180
He plays a role of growing importance 
in the reflection on the city.

67
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,177
For a long time the poor relative, 
it must be said.

68
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:14,934
There are still many cities 
who can't even imagine that

69
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:19,980
they need to call in an environmentalist, 
to imagine, to plan,

70
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,999
but this is, increasingly, a key role, 
and is extremely important,

71
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:28,242
for the safeguarding 
of natural environments,

72
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:31,933
to show how these 
ecosystems can function,

73
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:34,534
the role within it for animals,

74
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:38,594
we can then derive from these
questions of hygiene,

75
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:40,514
the questions of public health.

76
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:45,216
Now, without illustration, 
for we've already discussed this.

77
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:46,607
We have the economists,

78
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:50,238
who view themselves as a force, 
the market forces.

79
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:55,471
The lawyers or the notaries, 
all those in law professions,

80
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:57,483
who, finally, have an enormous influence.

81
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,345
Why? Because they draft the regulations.

82
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:02,438
Because the notary is 
the one who delivers them,

83
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:06,515
or who permits their deliverance, perhaps.

84
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:12,150
Because the notary is directly 
involved in, notably, land titling.

85
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,191
We have the surveyors,

86
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:19,662
who are more involved in
huge spatial mutations,

87
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:21,913
who are more involved in dynamics,

88
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:27,038
who explain the large movements 
which circulate in the city.

89
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:30,578
Finally it is the sociologists 
who will explain to us...

90
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:32,168
I exaggerate, of course,

91
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:37,498
but each profession has its own language, 
and has its own code,

92
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:40,210
and the sociologists will explain to us

93
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,800
which are the social practices 
that we'll find in the city.

94
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,295
Finally there are all the others,

95
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:48,883
who, directly or indirectly,

96
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:53,221
play an important role in planning 
or in management.

97
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:59,160
A police officer has a very important 
role in urban management.

98
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,045
As far as planning, 
there are also related issues,

99
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:05,745
we were just discussing public health,

100
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:10,885
and we can find in a city, doctors, 
veterinarians, or health specialists.

101
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:14,496
There is a whole armada of professions

102
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,683
which have, directly or indirectly,

103
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:19,508
an influence on these issues 
of urban planning.

104
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:23,002
And in planning one should use 
these different languages,

105
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:25,064
these different urban professionals,

106
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:27,020
in order to propose something

107
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,620
which is articulated within 
these different disciplines.

108
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,037
To finish up, we'll take the historian,

109
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:38,142
who looks to the past 
but who can equally help us

110
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:40,935
to understand what the past is made of,

111
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:44,215
and how we can better build and plan.
