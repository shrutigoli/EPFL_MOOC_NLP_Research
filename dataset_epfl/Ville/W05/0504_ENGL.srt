00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:06,133
Hello and welcome to our video.

2
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:10,471
Second part of what is Urban Planning.

3
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:15,517
The first part, we had it 
the first week of registration

4
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:17,951
was an introduction to planning,

5
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,449
and we would like in this video,

6
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,692
to go a little bit further with you today.

7
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:28,577
To begin, we're going to quote
Saint-ExupÃ©ry, just this once,

8
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:33,690
who said: "A goal without 
a plan is just a wish. "

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,993
This is the starting point from 
which we would like to start,

10
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:42,811
that is to say, to have a goal 
so that this goal transforms

11
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:45,766
in something possible, convincing,

12
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:52,868
it's about having the tool which allows
for the implementation of this goal.

13
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:57,153
The tool, most of the time, is a plan.

14
00:00:57,153 --> 00:01:02,506
Then of course the planning is 
not summed up by the plan,

15
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:07,806
but it is one of the main instruments
of this planning.

16
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:13,101
We could do planning with taxation, 
with public politics,

17
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:17,560
with a number of other instruments 
that are available,

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,385
but, traditionally, globally, 
in the majority of cases,

19
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:25,571
when we are speaking of urban planning, 
we are referring to plan: Master plans,

20
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:28,768
zoning plans, blueprints, 
you name it,

21
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:33,880
it's more or less always the same type 
of instrument that is used.

22
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,747
Let's go back to the actual context, 
once again, we are not going

23
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:42,850
to go over what has already been said,
simply to clarify a little,

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,776
you must keep in mind,

25
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:48,845
an increase in areas of 
substandard housing.

26
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:52,880
It is one of the urban problems today,

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,698
there is an impoverishment 
of the population, but overall,

28
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:59,436
on the entire surface of cities 
in Africa today,

29
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,907
in sub-Saharan Africa, 
there is an increase

30
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:06,587
of surface area devoted 
to substandard housing or slums.

31
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:09,427
Then, to take the second element,

32
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:12,799
we have an urbanization, 
we've seen that this is created

33
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,898
without economic development, 
but to speak in terms of urban planning,

34
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:18,828
particularly planning 
that is disproportionate

35
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:20,936
to the need for transportation,

36
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:25,756
with the need for servicing, with 
the overall need for networks.

37
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:27,397
There it is.

38
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,640
And in regards to this issue
of networks, of this issue

39
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,860
in particular of servicing 
or of transportation,

40
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,206
usually public transportation, 
there is a big deficit

41
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:40,540
in the African cities, to which the issues
of informality are added.

42
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,478
We also have already seen, 
already had some hints of informality

43
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:48,895
being a system that is superimposed 
on the formal system.

44
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:51,342
We have shown it very well 
in most of our writing,

45
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:56,168
it is not informality on one side 
and what is formal on the other,

46
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:58,895
but these two systems totally interlocked,

47
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:01,767
both playing the formal and informal,

48
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,649
depending on the situation.

49
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:05,213
We easily realize

50
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:08,516
that the literature presents 
informality as being

51
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:11,609
more the domain of the poor, 
which would really be

52
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:15,324
in the informal to compensate 
for the lack of formality

53
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:20,630
or the possibility of formalizing 
a number of things from the State,

54
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,562
so the poorest would be 
more informal than the richest,

55
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:27,589
yet we have seen it 
in very precise cases, particularly

56
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:32,771
in housing, it is mostly the elites
who are in the informal role.

57
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,700
Why the poorest?

58
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,734
Let's take the property for example.

59
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:41,173
When they have a plot would 
inevitably like to have a land title

60
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:43,808
and will do anything to appear

61
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:46,480
in front of the the notary to have 
the necessary papers

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,559
so that they cannot be criticized 
or removed.

63
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,351
That they cannot be criticized for

64
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:54,469
not having or not being 
the owners of the land.

65
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:57,482
Yet the richest do exactly the opposite.

66
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:59,780
No need for a building permit,

67
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,819
no need for a title, they begin to build
they build their property

68
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,609
and they know that, through 
the informal system they will

69
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:12,520
be able very quickly to find themselves in 
a situation that in the end will be formal.

70
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,380
But we see that formality

71
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,397
is not really the domain of the poorest
but of the richest.

72
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:24,905
So we have an urbanization that has
no ties to its own networks,

73
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:28,820
and its own networks and its own 
means of transportation

74
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,113
are increasingly informal.

75
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:33,357
This is the context today in which

76
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,877
we find ourselves when 
we must plan the city.

77
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,338
Last element of this context,

78
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:44,130
is finally, the planning, 
even if it is relatively old

79
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,113
in the African cities, it is still at
the prototype level.

80
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:53,477
It is still to be tested 
and it is emerging .

81
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:57,190
Of course the major capitals had 
their plans very quickly, but the rest

82
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,157
of the cities had in principle very little, 
if at all, of town planning.

83
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:03,959
So it's something relatively emerging, 
it is a discipline

84
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,152
which is not constituted as a disciplinary field 
but eventually comes

85
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:11,634
at the articulation of many disciplines, 
which is its very nature,

86
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:14,329
which is all very well, but which 
also means that it is

87
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,350
its weakness since it doesn't

88
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,131
have its own discipline that would 
support this planning.

89
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:25,352
So there are definitely great challenges,
we have already seen it considerably

90
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:32,044
in the introduction, great challenges for 
the cities, and there is a need to plan. ,

91
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:33,809
Why plan?

92
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:38,783
Why, simply because the city as such, 
even it is the most beautiful of

93
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:42,876
living organisms, even if it's 
a sort of ecosystem,

94
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,903
it would be the natural habitat, 
as some would say,

95
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:46,979
the natural habitat of man,

96
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,500
even if the city appears 
to be an ecosystem,

97
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,495
we realize that it doesn't 
manage itself,

98
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:57,915
that it doesn't generate itself spontaneously
in a desirable way for the collective.

99
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:01,624
So we are obligated at any given moment
to clearly intervene,

100
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:03,113
in this development, so it's

101
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:07,448
a interventionist notion in planning

102
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:10,735
because things in and of themselves 
are not done spontaneously

103
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:15,778
and those that are done spontaneously are
not necessarily those that are desired.

104
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:17,278
That is the first thing.

105
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:20,607
The second thing is from the Gestalt theory,

106
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:28,195
which is that the total is greater 
than the sum of the parts.

107
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:31,270
This means that the individual 
interests of some

108
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,967
do not form a public interest, 
but that

109
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:36,961
the public interest is above all of this.

110
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:43,417
As a result, I cannot see in individual interest
but the total, the sum of the total,

111
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,750
that's something else and for this

112
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,229
I am obligated to plan not for the individual
interests but that of the collective.

113
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,974
The need for planning comes also from 
that fact that

114
00:06:53,974 --> 00:06:58,290
the resources are limited and that 
changes are fast.

115
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,553
So I have to have a road map

116
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,572
to know where I am, at all times,

117
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:06,810
and to be able in this way to adjust 
and react quickly depending

118
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,482
on the situation, depending on 
an economic crisis,

119
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:17,397
depending on immigrant arrival, 
this speed of urban changes.

120
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:21,350
Finally we are discussing limited resources,

121
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,333
which are also financially limited, and so 
I have to plan to use them

122
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:32,154
in the most efficient way possible 
so as not to waste or lose

123
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:36,519
the resources, the scarce resources
that I have available to me.

124
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,449
The very foundations of zoning plans,

125
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,555
is then about managing
or controlling the soil.

126
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:49,578
We are speaking of sustainable soil management.

127
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:52,380
Zoning plans also have to control

128
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,850
displacement, to try to reduce it 
as much as possible.

129
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,600
Zoning plans give us indications

130
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,780
about the areas, about the type of areas, 
that we would want in different parts

131
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:11,662
of the city, it's about housing, industry, 
green space, not to mention only

132
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:16,995
the main area, the central space
and finally the plan must allow

133
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:23,414
for the management of resources and
the heritage that we have available.

134
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:26,897
So this, it's an important element, 
the planning must especially

135
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:29,809
allow for the management of
natural resources as well as

136
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:35,800
the management of cultural resources 
via heritage.

137
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,201
So we take what we have already seen, 
the three types of plans,

138
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:43,995
the first, orientation requirement,

139
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:52,805
detailed orientation requirements and 
the requirements for the soil usage.

140
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:58,518
So here, we have a limit 
since this is what is

141
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:02,416
called binding against third parties,
which is the force of law,

142
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,871
while the orientation requirements

143
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:08,320
or detailed orientation are for

144
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,784
the administration but are force of law 
for those that are private.

145
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:17,495
So often with the plans, there is a 
legislative and regulatory context.

146
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:23,724
There are no countries where there 
aren't countless regulations,

147
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:27,621
it goes against what we generally 
believe because it says that cities

148
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:29,776
are not planned, certainly,

149
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:33,470
there isn't really a zoning plan, 
on the other hand

150
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,794
there is a whole armada of 
legislative texts

151
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:41,578
which provide a very important
legal framework.

152
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:43,220
And we could even imagine that,

153
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,482
seeing the number 
of codes and laws

154
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:52,200
and orders and decrees in 
planning or annexed areas

155
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,211
we don't need plans since in the end

156
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:57,734
all these legislative texts are 
sufficiently abundant

157
00:09:57,734 --> 00:10:01,896
to manage all of the urban issues.

158
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:05,274
So, depending on the country, 
there may be Urban Codes,

159
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:06,484
Environment Codes,

160
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:07,953
Construction Codes,

161
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:11,445
Architecture Codes, often it's somewhat

162
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,125
the same thing, Water Codes,

163
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,804
the law instituting the urban community

164
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:22,335
when we have an urban community,
the decentralization laws

165
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,403
which determine the town governments, 
in particular

166
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:27,765
there can be property laws,

167
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:30,793
a whole series of other laws 
or other Codes

168
00:10:30,793 --> 00:10:35,763
that are in one way or another related 
to the issues of planning.

169
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:39,969
Finally, when we are talking about plans, 
when we are talking about tools,

170
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:45,260
which are the orientation requirements 
or land use?

171
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,870
We must quickly discuss
methodology since

172
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,521
we have a sort of basic plan
for the elaboration

173
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:55,154
of master plans and in general

174
00:10:55,154 --> 00:11:00,710
we go from a first stage of training 
and sensitization of stakeholders.

175
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,964
So this can be a ministry, 
the urban communities

176
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:10,204
but anyone who will have anything 
to say about the master plan.

177
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:13,686
It is very important that they 
be conscious and

178
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:18,927
trained in the usage and language
of the master plan.

179
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:21,530
Then a diagnostic is established.

180
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,687
This is the current situation of the city, 
the day that we look at the situation.

181
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,400
This means that we are at the 
beginning of our planning.

182
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,533
The orientations are going to be defined, 
we have already seen this.

183
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:40,606
On the basis of a diagnosis, we define 
the orientations that we will give

184
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:46,555
once spatialised, a plan that will have 
a horizon of 10 or 20 years.

185
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:48,400
Farther along, it doesn't really make sense

186
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,741
since we have already seen, 
things change quickly

187
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:54,431
so we have a horizon of 10 years
or 20 years.

188
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:57,406
So we must pay attention that the 
elaboration of the four stages

189
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:59,321
don't take 10 years alone

190
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:01,978
as we saw a few years ago
particularly in Abidjan

191
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:06,126
where preparatory studies 
lasted almost 10 years.

192
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:10,960
This means that the first study 
which was done, the diagnostic,

193
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,348
if 10 years later the plan is still not ready, 
you are obligated

194
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,681
to do the studies once again

195
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:19,497
and this is never ending so all 
these stages should be done

196
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:23,580
in a relatively short or very short 
period of time.

197
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,176
It is better to do it several times very 
short than a single time

198
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:32,384
where it's believed that formalizing 
the issue is going to work

199
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,439
and finally we realize that at the point

200
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:39,510
where this formalization is finished, 
it's no longer the same issue.

201
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,103
Once the plan is elaborated, 
we put it in motion.

202
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:43,966
Instructions will be given to put

203
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:48,160
the plan in motion with a number of 
accompanying measures.

204
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,907
A program with priority investments 
will be developed.

205
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:56,386
So we should put it between 
brackets like this.

206
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:57,430
Why?

207
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,950
Because it depends heavily 
on donor funds.

208
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,113
Certain donors don't want to make

209
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:06,890
a priority investments program and 
just want to do the planning.

210
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:11,780
Other donors find it important that this
planning be accompanied by

211
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,421
a certain number of projects 
that are feasible right away,

212
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:16,339
and others feasible in the long term

213
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:22,242
but this planning without projects to be
completed is not good for anything.

214
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:24,133
The next stage of communication.

215
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:28,895
The one which is forgotten, in theory, 
the fastest because

216
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,279
most people don't see the issue 
there would be behind it.

217
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,842
When really this is an extremely important 
stage since it is perhaps this stage

218
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:43,912
on which success rests and not on the plan
or in any case of it's being put in motion.

219
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:46,390
Finally, the evaluation stage.

220
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,447
So for this, one needs

221
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:50,321
to have precise criteria, 
specific prerequisites.

222
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:54,118
What are we going to evaluate?
Evaluating for the sake of evaluating

223
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:58,690
doesn't do anything; evaluating if we 
know what we are going to evaluate

224
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,662
is useful so we know if it was efficient

225
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:07,134
or not when we made our plan.

226
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:13,490
Here is a quick example of a plan, 
Nouakchott plan in Mauritania still,

227
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,465
a 1983 plan with a horizon in 1990.

228
00:14:19,465 --> 00:14:21,676
We see that it is in the detail there.

229
00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:25,519
The plan is a little bit deformed 
but that's okay.

230
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:32,546
We see the city center with a cutout of 
the land by land use.

231
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:37,971
Another plan, the blueprint for 
urban development, still in the city

232
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:42,861
of Nouakchott, we can see that
there are two types of different plans.

233
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:49,364
The first dates from 83, the second 
from 2002 with a horizon in 2010.

234
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:52,208
We see that they are excessively different

235
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,757
in their shape and then with a 
first horizon of the plan in 2010

236
00:14:56,757 --> 00:15:02,121
and a second in 2020 where bypasses 
have been drawn around the city.

237
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:07,400
The city of Nouakchott, the two examples
shown will be the focus

238
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,244
of a separate case study in a video this week.

239
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:14,350
So we will not go on here on the 
case of the city of Nouakchott.

240
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,250
And then, to wrap it up, we will show 
an example of the urban master plan

241
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,390
of Dakar, horizon of 2025 where we see
those who know it well,

242
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,704
Lac Rose, which is here and 
15 years ago

243
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:32,631
it was difficult to locate, 
to go to Lac Rose.

244
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:38,448
Today, urbanization has taken 
the whole scope of Dakar.

245
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:41,824
We still see some green breakthroughs

246
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:45,323
a few unoccupied areas 
but fewer and fewer.

247
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:47,974
The rest of the city of Dakar

248
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:52,114
is completely urbanized 
or being urbanized.

249
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:58,087
So there you have the second part of 
Urban Planning.

250
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:00,140
I'll see you in the following videos.
