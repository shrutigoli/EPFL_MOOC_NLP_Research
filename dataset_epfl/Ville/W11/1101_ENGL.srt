1
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:07,995
Hello, today we will read photographs.

2
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:13,677
We'll examine ways we can use photography 
to understand the African city.

3
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:16,670
Of course we've already discussed this 
in previous videos,

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,160
but I'd like to put the emphasis on 
reading these images.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,160
We'll review a certain type of images,

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,780
and will see what these images might
teach us about the African city.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,613
Now, some of the different
types of images.

8
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,419
Naturally, we have the traditional images,

9
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:37,825
those we might take with a camera.

10
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,446
We have satellite images,

11
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:44,517
with the introduction 
of Google Earth and Google Maps.

12
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:48,268
There are infinite possibilities 
for viewing images,

13
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:52,810
to view recent images, 
and older ones as well.

14
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,077
We have Google Street View.

15
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:58,620
Of course it doesn't cover 
all cities on the planet.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,404
In Africa, we have Gaborone, 
which is covered,

17
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:05,090
also certain cities in South Africa.

18
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,696
It's coming little by little.

19
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:10,199
In American cities there are already
infinite possibilities,

20
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:12,770
particularly if you take a stroll
around New York,

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,594
where you'll find 3D models.

22
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:20,810
With Google Street View, you can actually
take a walk around the city.

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,793
Aerial images, 
which are not satellite images,

24
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:27,806
which are either the old images 
used in making plans,

25
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:32,081
or aerial views, which is to say 
taken from above,

26
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,285
which are often 3/4 views,

27
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:36,870
and which allow us to see 
relatively interesting things.

28
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,833
Archival images, of course,

29
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,667
all old images which can serve 
as sources of information.

30
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:46,713
And then the series of images
that we've already considered

31
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:49,900
during our discussion of 
the question of public space.

32
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,744
We'll return to that quickly.
There are, of course, others.

33
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:57,653
If I refer to forensics,
these are also many types of images,

34
00:01:57,653 --> 00:02:01,627
which may not be the kind 
we can use in African cities.

35
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:07,347
The traditional images are those that 
you or I might take with our camera,

36
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:10,233
more or less from a distance 
of 1.6 or 1.7 meters,

37
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:13,519
from the ground, in the street,

38
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,865
taken in the traditional way,
which is why I referred to them as such.

39
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:21,135
These are the photos, 
taken on vacation, while on a walk,

40
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:24,343
all those photos which one might take
on a more or less daily basis.

41
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:27,622
In this first image we are in Dakar,

42
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:30,651
and what is interesting 
is that right away we see

43
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:34,341
colonial architecture, visible here.

44
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,453
We have a tiled roof, here.

45
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:38,404
Perhaps still the old tiles 
from Marseille.

46
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:41,993
There is a certain style of faÃ§ade

47
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,222
which tells us that 
this is an old building,

48
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:48,801
and behind it we've highlighted
other, more recent buildings.

49
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,388
So we are downtown.

50
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:52,864
From this image alone 
we can already

51
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:56,553
begin to surmise certain things 
about the architecture.

52
00:02:56,633 --> 00:03:00,937
We can do the same thing with,
on one hand, a private car,

53
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:03,471
which we see in the corner, a taxi,

54
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:10,307
a blue bus, which is a Dakar Dem Dikk, 
the bus lines of Dakar.

55
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:14,619
And thanks to this image we can
already see three methods of transport.

56
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:18,662
Of course the main method 
of transport is walking.

57
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:20,499
We see pedestrians who are moving,

58
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:25,796
others who are sitting 
or waiting, observing,

59
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:28,335
but most of them are moving.

60
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:30,438
What else does this tell us?

61
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:35,319
We have a street, a road, 
which is full of cars.

62
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,390
We have sidewalks, or a sidewalk,
something that looks like a sidewalk,

63
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,321
which is totally occupied 
by street vendors.

64
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,955
Which means that the two pedestrians,

65
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:48,730
the two people who are walking,
here in the forefront of the image,

66
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,699
have to walk in the roadway
in order to move.

67
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,888
We won't spend much more time
on this image,

68
00:03:55,888 --> 00:04:00,094
but we can easily see how,
from one image such as this one,

69
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:03,087
we can already reasonably 
gather some information.

70
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:06,469
Another image, another street scene.

71
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:08,354
Here we have some waste,

72
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:11,542
which brings up the problematic issue
of waste treatment,

73
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:15,824
but before that, of the management
of its pick-up, of waste collection.

74
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:20,424
We also see here that the sidewalk,
or what appears to be one,

75
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:25,404
has been totally occupied,
both by garbage or cars,

76
00:04:25,804 --> 00:04:30,807
which makes it extremely difficult
to take a stroll, to walk.

77
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:35,971
Here we have a car without a driver,
and here another,

78
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:40,956
which means that these vehicles
are parked directly on the roadway.

79
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:45,703
Another example, this one
dealing with public space.

80
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:51,654
We have storage of mineral water,
and of carbonated beverages,

81
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:54,136
right in front of a large store.

82
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:56,119
So large quantities are kept in stock,

83
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:58,802
and these large quantities are stored

84
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:01,416
not on the private property 
owned by the store,

85
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,460
but directly on the street.

86
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,206
Thus the street, the sidewalks,
become storage spaces,

87
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:10,926
a sort of privatization 
of space, of the street,

88
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:13,256
in favor of the private sector.

89
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:18,447
Another example of the privatization
of the street, the rug maker,

90
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:24,001
who spreads his rugs out in the sun
or who displays them for sale.

91
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:28,863
We see that the car, there,
can no longer pass.

92
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:32,605
In any event there is no driver,
so the car is parked.

93
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,537
It is a street which, ultimately,

94
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:40,338
because of the placement of a few rugs 
in the middle of the street,

95
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:42,162
becomes totally privative.

96
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:45,734
No one will dare pass anymore 
through this street.

97
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:48,054
Satellite images.

98
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:51,714
With the introduction particularly 
of Google Earth,

99
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:56,397
it is now possible to take a walk
in many of the world's cities.

100
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:00,000
In the country too, of course,
but we're interested here in the cities.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,977
So in this way we can walk around, 
gain knowledge,

102
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:08,460
see what's going on,
from a bird's eye view.

103
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,692
Here's a scene we've already visited.

104
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:15,535
We are in Ndjamena, 
in the center of Ndjamena.

105
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:17,554
The cathedral, in the middle.

106
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:22,587
And then, we have dates, here 
we're in 2004, in June of 2004.

107
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:27,963
Here we're in February of 2007,
a scene where the colors have changed,

108
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:29,637
yet the scene remains basically the same.

109
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:34,000
We see the same cathedral,
same time, same place.

110
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,586
Still there is no change.

111
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:39,093
2008, still no change.

112
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:41,638
Again, in 2008.

113
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:46,003
In 2009, from behind we'll take 
a look around the cathedral,

114
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:51,690
and will find that suddenly there is 
a change in the land, little by little.

115
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,585
We see how the land changes,
how trees are cut to make room

116
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:59,991
for a large esplanade 
around the cathedral.

117
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:04,745
If we go a bit further from 
the cathedral we'll see,

118
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:07,569
here also in 2010,

119
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:14,544
still in 2010 with little change 
to the trees, nothing over there.

120
00:07:14,544 --> 00:07:20,937
And then we see that 
on June 5, 2010, mid-year,

121
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:26,440
from an aerial view just in front,
we have demolition,

122
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,393
we see traces all around of buildings.

123
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:32,707
And then the systematic demolition
of all the buildings,

124
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:35,988
to make room for a huge square.

125
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:37,959
This square is then is 
our reference point, in the middle,

126
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,644
but we have the advantage of vacant lots 
ready for future use.

127
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:48,954
Now we are in 2011,
the beginning, first trimester.

128
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:51,281
And then 2011, end of the year,

129
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:53,495
one of the large land areas 
has been used

130
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:56,834
to build a large park, a large garden.

131
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:58,505
We have a square, a garden.

132
00:07:58,505 --> 00:08:02,894
And then, without doubt, we'll see 
the construction on the other sites

133
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:05,393
are going to happen,
little by little,

134
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:08,294
either for housing programs
or public facilities.

135
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:13,253
Yet another example, this one
in Brazzaville, in the Congo.

136
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:18,194
If you're not familiar with the city,
first we see there is an airport.

137
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:21,500
We can see, quickly, the airport terminal.

138
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,783
We see connections via 
a somewhat looser urban grid.

139
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:31,405
We have a soccer stadium, large parks,
perhaps a large palace.

140
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:37,379
If we take a simple look at the map
we'll notice a few things.

141
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:43,284
We'll see a very clearly defined limit
here, between the dense areas,

142
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:44,942
which are the poorer neighborhoods,

143
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,290
and the much less dense areas 
which are, of course,

144
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,048
the historic, colonial neighborhoods.

145
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:56,770
Without saying if this is true or not,
with just a bit of knowledge

146
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,206
we can begin to try 
to understand the city,

147
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,354
and then to formulate questions
regarding a number of elements

148
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:06,351
which we don't understand at first.

149
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:11,229
We can see these installations,
at water's edge, which are hangars,

150
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:16,853
directly, no doubt, connected to the river
and at the same time

151
00:09:16,853 --> 00:09:19,293
connected to the possibilities
the river offers,

152
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,647
as a means of transport via boat.

153
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:27,718
Street View offers a dynamic way
for one to walk around cities.

154
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:30,745
The coverage of Africa 
is still a bit sparse,

155
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:37,714
in other words besides Botswana,
a bit of Tanzania and South Africa,

156
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:42,245
the rest of the continent has yet
to be covered by Google Street View.

157
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:45,021
This will come in the next few months,
the next few years.

158
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:48,835
So we've chosen some examples,
particularly in Gaborone,

159
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:51,503
where Street View is already present

160
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:54,268
and where it is possible 
to walk around the city.

161
00:09:54,548 --> 00:10:01,994
Here we are in the center of Gaborone,
in Botswana, with a few images.

162
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:04,903
Now of course 
we can stroll around like this,

163
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,752
looking at the vegetation, the people,

164
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:12,327
a few images blurred out, of course,
for privacy reasons.

165
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:17,819
And then we can continue like this,
moving around the city.

166
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:21,495
We can learn about it and develop
an understanding of it

167
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,414
as if we were actually 
walking on its streets.

168
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:28,659
So this is an extremely recent 
source of information,

169
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:32,020
but extremely important for
urban planners.

170
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,844
Aerial images, the ancestors 
of satellite images,

171
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:39,354
used to be taken from a plane,

172
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:43,803
and restitutions were made 
from georeferenced aerial photos.

173
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:48,690
All aerial images include
all the images from above,

174
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,171
all the images taken from a plane,

175
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:53,751
so 3/4 views are also 
for us aerial images.

176
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,017
Here we have the example 
of a neighborhood.

177
00:10:56,017 --> 00:11:01,010
We see the main roads of the area, here,

178
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,326
and then the shacks 
within the neighborhood.

179
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:10,821
We are in a shantytown 
in Nouakchott, Mauritania.

180
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:14,431
Another view of Nouakchott,
this one a bit more precise,

181
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:19,669
still an aerial view 
taken from a small airplane,

182
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:23,129
and then here, a shantytown,

183
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,220
an installation which is no doubt 
a high school here,

184
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,689
and then open terrain 
which is left, at least for now,

185
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:37,344
with very sparse development.

186
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:40,153
We're not certain of 
the very high density, here,

187
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:43,650
but we can see its different elements,
the traffic circle,

188
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,069
streets leading to, in particular
to the sea, others to the South,

189
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:50,521
and this one which leads
to the center of the city.

190
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:55,610
So from this type of images we can 
reasonably obtain significant information.

191
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,414
It's an incredible wealth of information,

192
00:11:57,414 --> 00:12:02,554
whether we're speaking of vegetation,
or architecture.

193
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:04,804
We see the type of building,

194
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,735
and then we can see 
a small growth of shantytowns,

195
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:11,554
or perhaps the existing shantytowns 
within its interstices.

196
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:13,887
So there were several open lots,

197
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:17,588
and then those which come 
right up to the street,

198
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:20,786
thus facing a more precise 
city development plan.

199
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:24,787
We truly have the two layers here,
that of the shantytown,

200
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:28,405
and here a more traditional 
type of housing.

201
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:32,303
We still have little pockets, 
left and right, there too.

202
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:37,604
So each time we begin 
a true analysis of the image

203
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:42,473
we will see small things which 
we hadn't noticed at first.

204
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:46,547
This is a rich way of learning,
because it allows us to truly see

205
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:50,378
in which type of housing, 
of habitat, we find ourselves.

206
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:54,426
A school here, we can also see,
we saw another one earlier.

207
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:59,772
There is the possibility then, 
for those who can read these images,

208
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:06,986
to really be able to, in this way,
understand the city via these few images.

209
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:08,888
Let's look at these archival images.

210
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:13,447
Easily found on the internet, 
these were randomly chosen.

211
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:17,416
Most of the time we don't really know 
who took them, or when they were taken.

212
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,037
So they are merely illustrative.

213
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:23,046
They lack the databases 
which would allow us

214
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:27,305
to fully utilize these archival images.

215
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:29,485
A series of images.

216
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:33,999
We've already seen in previous videos, 
when it comes to public space,

217
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:37,698
the possibility we had of taking,
from one angle, every 30 minutes,

218
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:40,684
a series of images and to comment on them.

219
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,614
This offers us a dynamic view

220
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,054
of the scene as it takes place 
before our eyes.

221
00:13:46,414 --> 00:13:48,454
Here, another series of images.

222
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:54,648
A cigarette brand has built 
a small kiosk,

223
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:56,122
a permanent structure, as you can see.

224
00:13:56,122 --> 00:14:00,356
A metal structure, a set-up 
which provides shade at all times

225
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:04,610
and a step which offers a bit of 
a base to the structure.

226
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,453
We see only these things,

227
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:10,726
the children who run about 
are watch vendors,

228
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,289
recognizable by their small bags,

229
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,554
card sellers, newspaper vendors.

230
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:22,357
We see, based on the time of day,

231
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:24,987
that the images were taken 
every 30 minutes.

232
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:28,336
We have very different scenes.

233
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:31,521
This is where garbage is collected,

234
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:33,903
at a time when it is crowded,

235
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:38,263
for as we can see in the image 
many vehicles block the way.

236
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:43,045
And then the newspaper vendors,
who gather at some point,

237
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:47,535
to exchange or restock their newspapers.

238
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:51,202
One in the afternoon, 
no doubt a bit hotter,

239
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:55,365
with more people around, 
the newspaper vendor still here.

240
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:57,874
Now pay close attention 
to this zone under the tree,

241
00:14:57,874 --> 00:15:01,753
where we'll see that the limit 
is not defined by the sidewalk,

242
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:05,266
which disappears, 
but by the shade of the tree.

243
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:11,187
So it is truly the shade which defines 
the limits of the public space.

244
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:15,197
Look at the people here, 
almost in the road,

245
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:17,127
because they sought out the shade.

246
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:21,202
and along the roadway 
this will slowly change,

247
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:23,497
because they will move,
based on the shade,

248
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:28,993
and will either move on the road,
under the tree, or even on the other side.

249
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,236
There is yet another interesting element,

250
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:34,237
which is that here we see 
a small trace of water,

251
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:39,203
which means that an air conditioner 
is running, dripping in the street,

252
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:43,305
which tells us that even if we don't know 
what is happening behind the wall,

253
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:48,470
we know that it is inhabited,
because there is air conditioning running,

254
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,033
and this trace offers us proof that 
there is life behind the wall

255
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,106
which we've captured in the photo.

256
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:59,971
We'll continue quickly.
Look here, once again, in the shade,

257
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:01,754
which has disappeared, 
which has retreated.

258
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:06,083
Before it was almost on the pavement,

259
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,607
now it is once again retreating.

260
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:14,963
Now we'll go on to a second series, 
here it is.

261
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:17,346
Once again it is early morning,

262
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:24,391
and little by little we can see 
the sun rising, growing stronger.

263
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:30,486
Then soon we'll see an awning 
used as protection from the sun.

264
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:35,355
After a certain amount of time
it is opened further,

265
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:37,555
to protect the fruits and vegetables.

266
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:41,063
We can even count the number 
of bananas sold throughout the day,

267
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:43,514
which we'll see, are not too many.

268
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:46,840
But these images, taken every 30 minutes,

269
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:53,247
allow us to understand the relationship 
that the people have to the sun,

270
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,939
based on the time of the day,

271
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:58,502
and offer us scenes of daily activity,
of what goes on.

272
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:02,003
We can see here that there is vegetation 
pretty much everywhere.

273
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:06,967
So we are no longer 
in the center of the city,

274
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:12,164
where at times no one is around, 
or where everything is closed.

275
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:16,856
This tells us that there are rest times,
no doubt the hottest hours of the day,

276
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:21,906
and then life gradually picks up.

277
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:27,576
The shade grows wider, 
so it is the end of the afternoon.

278
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:33,904
We see that there are more cars,
and it is no doubt rush hour.

279
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,770
So play around with it.

280
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,127
Take photos, study them,
use Google Street View, feel free.

281
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:45,704
It is an unimaginable source of knowledge.

282
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,806
When one wants 
to approach the African City,

283
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:52,113
it is not always possible to move quickly 
within different cities.

284
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:56,284
It is possible, thanks to these images,
in particular,

285
00:17:56,704 --> 00:18:02,031
but also to the videos and literature, 
of course, with more traditional methods,

286
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:06,843
but these images offer us a 
deeper understanding of their context.
