1
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:08,531
Today we'll discuss community-based 
organizations and their roles.

2
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:14,649
Over the past decades we've seen in Africa
the emergence of a new party

3
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:18,793
in the form of 
community-based organizations.

4
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:23,277
Regrouping populations, 
often their poorest members,

5
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:26,971
who get together to work among 
such organizations in order to both,

6
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:29,377
participate in managing their future,

7
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,629
and to assist the State
or local authorities

8
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,981
with decision-making.

9
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:36,504
That's the basic plan.

10
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:39,027
We'll take a look at some of the processes

11
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:43,207
which involve these 
community-based organizations.

12
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:50,729
One often associates community-based 
organizations with civil society.

13
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:56,581
Civil society is much broader than 
our definition of it here.

14
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:00,880
In Africa It practically doesn't exist
or, on the contrary, it is very active.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,787
Let's put aside for a moment this
question of civil society,

16
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:10,739
to instead concentrate on 
community-based organizations

17
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,823
who form the battalion of the poorest
in African cities.

18
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:19,069
When we say community-based organization
we mean participation,

19
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,988
we mean participatory decision-making.

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,320
There are many forms of participation,

21
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,071
And of course we have, as always,

22
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:44,754
between a weak and a strong participation

23
00:01:45,364 --> 00:01:49,287
a cursor, which can move,

24
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:50,916
depending on the country,

25
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:56,187
depending on the city, 
but also depending on the project.

26
00:01:56,647 --> 00:02:02,010
Projects for which there is 
very strong demand

27
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,241
and a very strong participation of
community-based organizations.

28
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:10,897
Why? Because these are decisions 
which directly affect the community,

29
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:14,716
and perhaps because when it comes to
our ability to make decisions,

30
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:18,659
it is very weak, if not nonexistent, 
at higher levels.

31
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,712
There are, then, different 
types of participation.

32
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:26,158
We'll highlight the five main ones.

33
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,285
To begin with, appropriation.

34
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:31,232
Communities have decision-making power,

35
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,980
and it's the State 
who takes the initiative

36
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,702
when the community demands it.

37
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:41,535
There is cooperation.

38
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:48,665
It is the State and the communities 
who work together with one sole objective.

39
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:54,076
Often the processes are assisted 
by others, especially by NGOs,

40
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:59,054
but there is a sort of coproduction
on the decision and on the project.

41
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:01,339
There is consultation.

42
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,574
Thus the communities 
won't make the decisions,

43
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:07,941
but will be consulted on projects
to seek their input,

44
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:10,705
and then the project 
will be modified in a timely manner

45
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:13,445
based on the results of this consultation.

46
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:15,620
There is the information level,

47
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,785
which is a summarized 
version of the consultation.

48
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:24,042
Usually the communities 
are informed of what will happen.

49
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:29,183
And subsequently there is manipulation,
where, ultimately,

50
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:34,435
the communities are used 
instead for the wrong reasons.

51
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:38,496
They are given the impression 
that they have a say,

52
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:41,590
yet the decisions had already been 
taken well in advance.

53
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,276
We see that nevertheless 
there is a split,

54
00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:48,555
we have manipulation for
all the wrong reasons.

55
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:52,854
Here we have the four top ones,
for the right reasons,

56
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:58,542
with, once again, the cursor which
points strongly towards appropriation,

57
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:02,594
as the communities demand,
and the State acts,

58
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:08,571
and the lowest level of participation, 
which is consultation.

59
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:11,626
Between the two there is room to move,

60
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,841
and we have varying levels 
of participation.

61
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:18,866
What was just said

62
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,701
is for the participation
of all development projects as a whole.

63
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:24,538
We can go further in participation,

64
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:28,325
up to participatory budgeting,
which can be divided into four phases.

65
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:33,487
The first phase, preparatory,
we'll mobilize citizens.

66
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,861
Second phase, the identification of
problems and needs,

67
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,241
where we define priorities.

68
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:46,747
A subsequent phase of execution
and provision of services as identified,

69
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:51,027
and a supervision phase of what has
been done and the audit.

70
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:53,247
So first, we'll prepare,

71
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:58,617
then identify and allocate budgets,

72
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:03,058
do the work, supervise what 
has been completed,

73
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:06,263
to then return to the start,

74
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:11,408
a chain which allows us 
to revisit and modify

75
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:14,663
based on what has been found

76
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:17,910
during the supervision of
what was requested.

77
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,773
There is truly a daily control over 
the allocation of the different budgets.

78
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,376
This is, I would venture,
an absolute form,

79
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:30,411
which may possibly be 
at the local community level,

80
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:33,972
but which involves, in any event, 
community-based organizations.

81
00:05:33,972 --> 00:05:38,073
These are ordinary people
who have in their hands

82
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:40,062
this question of participatory budgeting.

83
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,757
There are communities who are given

84
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:45,690
only a portion of 
the participatory budgeting,

85
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:51,141
but the interest lies in the fact 
that they feel a responsibility,

86
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:55,975
an accountability on the part of 
the inhabitants for the budgets.

87
00:05:55,975 --> 00:06:00,475
Together they decide how much 
will be allocated, and where,

88
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:05,802
and then together they control 
these allocations.

89
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:08,676
So this is the participatory budget,

90
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:12,117
with or without community-based 
organizations.

91
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:16,041
That's all we'll say for now 
on participatory budgeting,

92
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,926
because the lecture was only on
community-based organizations.

93
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:25,841
After we'll return to it, but for now
what are the development projects,

94
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:27,740
which might be handled at the level

95
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,332
of community-based organizations, 
with the State.

96
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:35,154
We also have the very important 
question of housing.

97
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:38,737
There are large housing programs,
or perhaps housing benefits,

98
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:40,621
which can be implemented with,
at the same time,

99
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:43,241
community-based organizations 
and the State.

100
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:45,674
Infrastructure, of course.

101
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:48,974
Often it is the basic infrastructure 
in neighborhoods,

102
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:53,298
certainly not about building 
a large roadway together.

103
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:56,416
But all that is infrastructure and basic 
facilities within the neighborhoods

104
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:03,380
enters into the transactions which 
the communities have with the State.

105
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,596
Urban dynamism.

106
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:10,448
We can, within these given areas,
reinvigorate, spark urban renewal,

107
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:14,723
where a certain number of social programs
enable us to live together in harmony.

108
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:22,400
Thus with the possibility we have to work 
on-site on these social programs,

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,152
community-based organizations are,
I'd say, the strongest link to them.

110
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:32,608
And finally, the question 
of waste management.

111
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:36,941
Community-based organizations 
can play a very important role here,

112
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:40,786
because it involves being 
actually on the ground.

113
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:45,338
We quickly realize that what the State 
lacks is this anchor to the ground,

114
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:49,739
and being able to manage it 
with local communities.

115
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:54,066
This allows access to a central authority,
or even to a decentralized power.

116
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,811
It allows access on the ground

117
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:01,511
with those who face difficult 
situations on a daily basis.

118
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:04,390
In return, of course, 
the State must play a role.

119
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,325
It can not simply be demanding 
of the community-based organizations,

120
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:14,334
but should primarily recognize them,
which is no small task,

121
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:20,683
for within the normal plan of governing,
this civil society, these organizations,

122
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,284
do not exist.

123
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:26,353
So we're dealing with different stages 
or strata of the State,

124
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:30,047
but the first thing to do 
is to recognize these organizations.

125
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:34,656
Next to offer technical assistance for 
the development of their projects,

126
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:37,678
assist them with the financing 
of these projects.

127
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:42,972
The State finds within these 
community-based organizations

128
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:45,257
a neighborhood base.

129
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:49,298
But for this to happen the State 
must also invest in it,

130
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:53,860
the two levels of decision-making 
must be addressed.

131
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,480
And the State must recognize 
their right to have a say,

132
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,963
which is without doubt one of 
the most difficult tasks,

133
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:05,847
because it requires that 
a place be made for this

134
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:08,047
within the plan, within the organization,

135
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,923
within the actual governing of the city.

136
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,983
So limits and conclusions.
Limits, there are two.

137
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,839
It is that participatory decision-making,

138
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,573
as we've already seen
in a certain number of cases,

139
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:21,007
does not work.

140
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:26,280
It works as long as it involves 
decision-making on facilities, on layout,

141
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,067
within the neighborhoods.

142
00:09:28,377 --> 00:09:31,360
It works a bit less successfully, 
or not at all, when it involves

143
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,687
city planning on a macro level.

144
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:39,269
When we want to install 
large networks, roadways,

145
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,874
it becomes difficult to include

146
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:43,559
the participation of 
all the city's inhabitants.

147
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:47,390
The main result of this participation,

148
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,621
of these participatory processes,

149
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:54,553
is that in the end, the decision is 
that nothing will get done.

150
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:57,523
So if we want the city 
to evolve at some point,

151
00:09:57,523 --> 00:10:00,863
we must also make decisions 
on a centralized level.

152
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:05,759
And rather than having to apply 
one plan or another,

153
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,323
we must realize that, 
depending on the projects,

154
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:11,988
depending on the challenges 
of these projects,

155
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:14,702
we must make them 
to some degree participatory.

156
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:18,012
It is perhaps cynical to say 
these sorts of things,

157
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:20,822
but we must recognize 
the limits of the system,

158
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:24,948
and realize that we cannot ask
the whole of a city's population

159
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:27,925
for their advice on this or that project.

160
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:31,841
So there we are perhaps at the level 
of informing rather than participating.

161
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:35,924
We must inform and show clearly 
what we are in the process of doing;

162
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:36,873
this is undeniable.

163
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:40,493
This is, I'd say, the foundation,
but there are certainly times when

164
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:43,172
one can go even further 
in the participatory process,

165
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:45,569
and others when it must be 
placed on the back burner.

166
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:50,106
The end result is that, now that 
we've seen these important trends,

167
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:53,023
these new methods 
of urban governance,

168
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:56,440
these community-based organizations,
decentralization,

169
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,599
we must know how to utilize them.

170
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,904
There is no out-of-the-box solution,

171
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:06,187
there is no plan that should be applied 
to all African countries.

172
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:12,136
We must simply recognize the validity
of community-based organizations,

173
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:18,284
recognize them, and in collaboration
with them see in which measures

174
00:11:18,284 --> 00:11:21,223
they might or might not 
take part in the decision-making.
