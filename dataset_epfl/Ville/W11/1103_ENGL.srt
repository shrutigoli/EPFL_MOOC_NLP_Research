1
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:07,730
When we are talking about governance, 
we need to talk about decentralization.

2
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:12,297
We have seen it previously,
new forms of urban governance

3
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:17,047
presuppose decentralization 
and the challenge of new players.

4
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,185
Decentralization.

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,775
That's what we are going to look at now.

6
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,980
The few different stages 
and limits of the financial capacity.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,531
The three stages according to Gauthier
and Vaillancourt, revisited by Paulet.

8
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:32,580
We have decongestion.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,906
These are officers that perform 
functions in the local communities

10
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:41,082
but which are attached 
to the central government.

11
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:43,340
Delegation.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,400
So this is a transfer of responsibilities,

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,962
often in a particular field to entities

14
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,950
that can be autonomous,

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,436
but which must report 
to a higher authority.

16
00:00:54,436 --> 00:00:58,475
So we are still not 
at the local community level.

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,760
And then we have devolution 
which is a transfer of skills

18
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:10,513
to local governments and these governments
have autonomy in the decision process.

19
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,348
So it really is the last stage, 
the only one which corresponds

20
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:20,250
exactly to what we call decentralization.

21
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:24,577
So decentralization can be, 
at the same time, political,

22
00:01:25,227 --> 00:01:29,200
and this fits very clearly 
in the notion of devolution,

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,520
but decentralization should,
obviously, also be economic,

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,400
financial, and not only political.

25
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,098
And it's there, as we'll soon see,
that there is a problem,

26
00:01:41,098 --> 00:01:45,844
since often political decentralization 
has taken place,

27
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:49,810
but in fact, financial decentralization 
has never taken place.

28
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,007
The current state 
of decentralization in Africa.

29
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,470
You can find very old texts

30
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,156
that are actually 15, even 20-years-old

31
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:01,150
on the subject of decentralization.

32
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,668
Keep in mind that all the processes
are not taking place

33
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:07,346
in the same way 
in all of the African States.

34
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:09,466
It's the first thing that must be mentioned.

35
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:11,596
Secondly, it's that decentralization

36
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:13,952
has never really functioned very well.

37
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:19,992
There are few states which have 
clearly implemented decentralization,

38
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:24,612
since financial decentralization 
has never taken place or in rare cases.

39
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:29,204
And it's in seeing the state of finances
of local communities

40
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:33,120
that we realize that decentralization 
has not worked.

41
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:36,367
So there is always 
an extremely weak point,

42
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:40,050
the weak financial autonomy 
of local communities.

43
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:43,360
And we can say whatever we want.

44
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,254
We can say that the texts are there,

45
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:48,700
it is undoubtedly the application decrees 
that pose problems.

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,390
Most of the time, the law is enacted,

47
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,140
but its enforcement decrees are not.

48
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,852
So to summarize all of this, 
it's by the financial autonomy

49
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:00,066
of local communities 
that we will be able

50
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:03,138
to really establish decentralization.

51
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:06,090
Decentralization can also 
have undesirable effects.

52
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:10,660
Finally, there has been an increase in
the number of municipalities in the area.

53
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:13,732
So decentralization also means

54
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:17,512
creation of new entities that want to be
autonomous in an area.

55
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:20,164
So that is an undesirable effect.

56
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:22,748
It's that the more you decentralize,

57
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:26,960
the more you will see areas 
which want this degree of autonomy.

58
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,472
So we haven't won anything yet

59
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:32,160
since we are only fragmenting 
the areas further.

60
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,353
And it is well known that especially for

61
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:40,137
management of large cities, it's really 
not fragmentation that is needed

62
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,362
but a joining of these various powers 
that would in this way

63
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:48,210
allow a higher authority 
to manage the entire city.

64
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,334
What are the skills?

65
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:54,316
One could of course give 
management of large networks,

66
00:03:54,377 --> 00:03:56,450
management of urban services,

67
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,759
completely to the local communities,

68
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:04,230
but its weak financial capacity
prevents all transactions of this type.

69
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:09,050
So it will remain at the regulations level
or at the State level,

70
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,695
since the local communities,

71
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:14,120
except in some rare cases,

72
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,386
very rare cases compared to 
all of the cities, agreed,

73
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,589
but the communities do not have the means

74
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,365
to assume these types of tasks
due to a lack of resources.

75
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:28,860
This won't be comprehensive
however the skills

76
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,010
would be, for example,
the maintenance of the public domain,

77
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:37,771
lighting, waste management, 
basic education,

78
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:41,787
health, everything that concerns 
environmental issues,

79
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:48,460
so we see that we're mostly dealing with
social as well as environmental issues.

80
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,721
Agreed?
So that's what we have.

81
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:54,906
So when we talk about education, 
it is of course basic education,

82
00:04:55,214 --> 00:05:01,053
since in theory, universities are not 
considered in this diagram.

83
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:04,164
In fact, the universities are managed,

84
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:06,320
in theory, in every country, 
at the State level.

85
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:09,167
But basic education, elementary school,

86
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:13,110
high school, are the jurisdiction 
of local communities.

87
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,882
We of course have here items 
that have a cost

88
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:20,670
which have few possibilities

89
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,094
of recovering costs, and on top of that

90
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:27,033
we have the extremely limited resources 
of the local communities.

91
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,059
Financial capacity.

92
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:33,516
We have both what comes from 
the community's own capacities

93
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:36,306
but also from the transfer of State money,

94
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:40,348
in the form of grants 
or in the form of taxes,

95
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:44,211
on the value added, for example, 
where a portion of it should,

96
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,540
in theory come back directly 
to the local communities.

97
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,172
But we realize that in practice,

98
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:53,754
that this transfer of funds 
from the higher authority

99
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:58,399
to the local community is very weak
compared to the needs,

100
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,655
and the State keeps a large portion 
of these resources.

101
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:06,940
There you have it, we have quickly looked 
at the issue of decentralization,

102
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:11,596
by explaining what it is, 
showing its limits

103
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:15,308
precisely because it is not 
completely effective,

104
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:20,402
for reasons such as the fiscal year 
and to also show

105
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:25,474
that with the growing complexity 
of relations between areas,

106
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:29,435
the birth of large cities 
which require precisely

107
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:34,405
a more centralized management 
at the community level, certainly,

108
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:39,103
but a re-centralization of power 
to be able to manage these cities,

109
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,315
we realize that we are on
relatively shaky ground.

110
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,921
And in my opinion, it's of no help at all

111
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:50,003
to be too dogmatic,
because according to the times,

112
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:51,257
depending on the methods,

113
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:54,422
we see that the pendulum
swings back and forth.

114
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:59,320
We must simply understand at which stage 
we are in urban history.

115
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:03,631
In my opinion, we must take care

116
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:06,299
when trying to apply 
these ready-made solutions.

117
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:10,880
Decentralization can work 
in a number of cases.

118
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,100
It also has its limits, and we must find

119
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,877
forms of governance 
that are sustainable over time.
