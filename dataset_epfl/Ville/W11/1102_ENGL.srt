1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,460
Today, we're going to talk
about governance,

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,606
new forms of governance,

3
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:11,362
due to the rapid development of poverty

4
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:15,060
which is a statement to
observation planning failure

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,430
as, despite every attempt
we've had at planning,

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,449
we find ourselves in a situation
where poverty continues to increase

7
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:27,655
and therefore, inequalities also
continue to increase.

8
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:32,210
As a result of this failure,
we asked ourselves

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,020
what type of governance
should be implemented

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,266
in order for infrastructures,
for amenities,

11
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:41,777
for everything that
we plan for specifically,

12
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:44,494
physically, down to the ground,

13
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:47,070
can be effective one day or another.

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,356
We'd like to remind that
planning is only useful

15
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:52,764
if it is effective, efficient,

16
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:54,402
if it serves the majority.

17
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:59,020
If you plan a road
which will never be built,

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,026
it is useless to plan it.

19
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:05,372
So, we began to imagine
new government systems,

20
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:07,590
new decision-making processes,

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,540
which we regroup under
the governance umbrella.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,863
Today, this governance,

23
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,546
this government,

24
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:19,310
is no longer centralized

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,754
but requires a multi-party approach.

26
00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:24,730
We no longer just have
the State level of government,

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,006
we now have a larger number of parties

28
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,562
which can be at once public and private,

29
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:33,707
and together, these parties,

30
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:35,262
will more or less,

31
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,869
make decisions about the future

32
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,149
and the development of cities.

33
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:40,412
This is why we are no longer
talking about a government

34
00:01:40,412 --> 00:01:42,354
but a governance system instead.

35
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:45,154
We are, therefore, going towards
good governance

36
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:47,910
as there would be a basic scheme.

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,382
I say, "there would be",

38
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:54,330
we have not yet fully tested everything
in order to say, "this is how it works",

39
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,074
but we have a good governance,

40
00:01:57,074 --> 00:02:00,260
an idea of the parties' involvement 
needed in order to ensure

41
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,338
that decision-making on urban territory
is carried out properly.

42
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:07,756
To ensure this, multiple parties

43
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:12,430
and, mainly, less visible borders

44
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,070
are needed between both
public and private parties.

45
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,200
Which is public, which is private?

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,957
Until today there was a clear
delimitation between the two.

47
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,640
Which is formal and which informal?

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,029
Things are less obvious here as well,

49
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:29,938
less clear-cut than they used to be

50
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:32,887
and the State versus the civil society,

51
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:37,490
a centralized approach versus
a decentralized approach.

52
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,135
So, today's governance involves
our questioning regarding borders

53
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:44,180
between these different elements,

54
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,821
public/private, formal/informal,
the State/civil society.

55
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:51,125
The paradox of globalization
we already mentioned it.

56
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,420
What is it?

57
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,842
It is that on the one hand we'll try
to have a good governance,

58
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,983
a decentralization of powers
and on the other hand,

59
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:02,480
we realize that in cities,
in today's winning global cities,

60
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,388
there is a re-centralization of power.

61
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:06,734
Therefore we are in
a paradoxical pendulum

62
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:09,569
where, on the one hand we adopt
a decentralization approach

63
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,270
and on the other hand

64
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,671
on the contrary, on the world stage,

65
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:17,534
when one studies global cities,

66
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:20,403
there should be a tightening
of powers around a small number.

67
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:23,050
The other paradox is, if you go down
governmental levels,

68
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,975
decentralization, from the State
to the municipality, we find ourselves

69
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:29,351
in basic administrative units
which are municipalities

70
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:32,830
which most of the time,
don't correspond to anything.

71
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,464
Why don't they correspond to anything?

72
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,248
Because in the case of agglomerations

73
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:37,963
we find ourselves
in several municipalities

74
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:42,114
and it is exceedingly rare
to come across a complete overlap

75
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:45,119
between functional space

76
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:48,564
and political space.

77
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:51,070
The government rules over a space

78
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,442
and it's not necessarily the logical one

79
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,262
for the functions found in that city.

80
00:03:56,602 --> 00:04:00,137
In this case there is no overlap.

81
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,635
There is also the development

82
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:05,558
of large entities such as

83
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:07,301
the European Union.

84
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:10,566
Therefore, on the one hand
we will decentralize municipalities

85
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:14,920
and on the other hand we have
much more important developments

86
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,580
where large entities are being created.

87
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,420
It is a true paradox, as we have
opposing political movements.

88
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,077
And so decision-making
somehow becomes extremely blurry.

89
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:28,679
We don't know if we should
continue decentralizing

90
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:31,266
or, on the contrary, re-centralize

91
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:34,059
and fight on the world stage.

92
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:38,180
We have already said,
regarding environmental issues,

93
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,662
the municipality, the local community

94
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:45,920
is probably not conducive
to making major decisions.

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,970
Consequently, there are
a certain number of decisions

96
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,164
which must be made between the State

97
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,514
or between larger entities,

98
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:54,554
larger than the state, no doubt,

99
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:57,926
and others can be decentralized
at the municipal level.

100
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,312
Today, this new style of governance

101
00:05:00,312 --> 00:05:03,455
implies, first of all, a decentralization,

102
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:05,410
which we have already begun to talk about.

103
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,415
Decentralization, in other words

104
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:10,772
the State will transfer some of its power

105
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:12,639
to local communities.

106
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:15,537
Having multiple parties,
is the second element

107
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:19,261
to these new forms of governance,
we've already talked about it.

108
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:22,363
Decentralization, multiple parties

109
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,225
which include private ones

110
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:29,509
but also what's globally referred to
as civil society.

111
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:31,905
Once we take into account
these new parties

112
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:33,851
and decentralization,

113
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:36,819
there are types of partnerships
which can be created.

114
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:40,640
Two of the main parties,
as well as the State of course,

115
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,636
are, on the one hand,
community organizations,

116
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,180
and on the other hand, the private,

117
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,724
through public/private partnerships.

118
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,270
We have already mentioned
these partnerships

119
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,183
so, in the next video

120
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:57,430
we'll talk mostly about
community organizations.

121
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,127
Who are they and what can they do

122
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,294
regarding urban decision-making?

123
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:06,762
Are they parties that we can apply?

124
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:10,050
You know the answer, it's yes,

125
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,318
it is a new party,

126
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:13,948
which we are increasingly considering

127
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:17,272
but we will see that there are also
a number of limitations

128
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:19,586
to this new multi-party approach.

129
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,590
Involving these new parties, however,

130
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,925
shouldn't be a way for the State

131
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:30,940
to dissociate from
a number of rights they had.
