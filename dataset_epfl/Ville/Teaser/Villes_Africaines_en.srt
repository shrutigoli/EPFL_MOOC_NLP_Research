00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:14,739
Here are some images illustrating
the theme of this course: African cities.

2
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:18,499
No, not city, but cities,
with their numerous specificities,

3
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:25,499
from Johannesburg to Brazzaville,
from Dakar to Djibouti.

4
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:27,499
Why African cities?

5
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:29,589
Because their pace is accelerating,

6
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:32,859
because hundreds of millions of inhabitants
will move there…

7
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:35,450
in the decades to come.

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,530
Thus they will go through a rapid
and radical change in the futur.

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,000
There are many challenges.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,400
There are social challenges,
due to the growing inequalities…

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,590
and the exclusion process within the cities.

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,300
There are spatial challenges
due to the growing disparities…

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,140
between big and small cities,

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,500
which is to a big extent a consequence
of globalisation.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,540
But there are also environmental challenges,
both on a global…

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,090
and local scale.

17
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,760
Finally there are economical
and political challenges…

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,270
as long as the governance is part of the main concern
of the stakeholders…

19
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,750
of the city.

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,690
This course will let us look the main
urban issues and will show us…

21
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,440
the production mechanisms of a city.

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,660
In order to achieve our goal
we have to adopt 3 points of view:

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,060
A technical,

24
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,470
social and symbolic.

25
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,720
That will allow us
to raise the question about the city model,

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,750
and the infrastructures.

27
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,450
That will allow us to review
the theoretical…

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,670
as well as the most technical aspects
of the creation of master plan.

29
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,530
We will see in detail how
to plan and with what tools.

30
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,350
We will see how to balance between social
environmental… 

31
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,590
and economical preference.

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,220
In order to cover that matter,

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,680
the course will be presented over 12 weeks.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,780
Each week we will study
a major subject of planification.

35
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,910
There will be several videos…

36
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,520
with a duration of 10 to 15 minutes each.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,799
Each week there will also be quizzes,
exercises and lectures…

38
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,109
permitting to go into depth…

39
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:10,819
as well as case studies…

40
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:13,879
in order to illustrate our subject.

41
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,930
The exercises are an integrate part
of the course and they have to be…

42
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,159
accomplished successfully…

43
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,859
in order to be allowed
to go to following week.

44
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:24,889
That’s why we estimate the time necessary
to follow this online course…

45
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:27,689
to be between 4 and 6 hours.

46
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,099
There are no prerequisites for this course,

47
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,139
but an interest in urban planning
is necessary.

48
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:36,849
All you have to do is enrol and to follow
the courses week after week.

49
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,019
There is no need for additional material,
as all the material you need…

50
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:42,569
will be provided online.

51
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,359
I am Dr. Jérôme Chenal,
and I teach urban planning…

52
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:49,099
at the EPFL in Lausanne.

53
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,949
For more than 15 years…

54
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:53,539
I have been studying urban issues in Africa…

55
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:56,809
notably everything that has to do with planning.

56
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:00,610
I hope that I have awoken
your interest in the matter…

57
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,459
African cities.

58
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,409
I am looking forward
to seeing you online in February.
