Land registry
African cities: Intro to urban planning

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:06,945
Land registry is different
than addressing, why?

3
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:12,490
Because it allows to see
all the properties.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,481
On the address, the whole
property is indicated,

5
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:20,290
in square meters
and with the owner's name.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,290
In legal terms, the cadastre
allows greater security.

7
00:00:24,828 --> 00:00:28,448
In contrast, it allows 
to know the entire land,

8
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:32,970
and it enables the taxation
of a certain number of owners.

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,470
Land registry is not a new concept, 
it's been used for a long time.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,988
Since land property exists,
it has always been made in a plan.

11
00:00:44,842 --> 00:00:49,990
When we talk about Land Registry,
we mean land ownership.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,210
And possession of lands.

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,066
Land Registry is a sort of ID
for land ownership.

14
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,680
There is a plot, its owner
and some features.

15
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,075
There are three land registry missions:

16
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:13,180
technical, property and tax.

17
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,581
The cadastre is
a two dimensional representation,

18
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:23,972
a mapping of the city.

19
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:30,175
There is a number of plots with a database
attached to the representation.

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,803
So we have both alphanumerical data
and geographical data.

21
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:41,802
The tax cadastre allows the listing

22
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:46,271
of all personal and real properties,

23
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:50,640
and consequently the taxation.

24
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,122
The land registry is not created
only to know who the people are

25
00:01:56,232 --> 00:02:02,484
and where they live, but also
for taxation and levy purposes.

26
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,026
The legal land registry

27
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:10,452
is a security of land ownership.

28
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:15,480
The plot of these many square meters
located at such place

29
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,490
is registered somewhere
as Mr John Doe's property.

30
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:28,580
Then, the technical land registry, 
allows a sort of city plan

31
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,603
to help making decisions

32
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:37,016
for all networks and infrastructures.

33
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:41,160
It becomes a tool for daily 
urban management.

34
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:44,485
We realize that when making urban plans,

35
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:47,223
specific background maps are necessary.

36
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:49,433
The technical cadastre can play this role.

37
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:53,938
But for the land registry
to be used as such,

38
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:57,823
just like tax or legal land registry,

39
00:02:57,973 --> 00:03:01,400
it must be updated on a regular basis.

40
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,140
Each move, each change and each new owner

41
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,140
must be registered in the cadastre.

42
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,610
Each new plot must be identified
and put in the database.

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,884
It's major work with high resource costs.

44
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,697
Most cities do not have the resources
to update the land registry.

45
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:29,168
They often have the resources 
to create it and its layers,

46
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:33,200
but it remains untouched for years.

47
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,739
Yet the land registry is only interesting
if regularly updated.

48
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,561
Consequently, even if it demands
a lot of resources,

49
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:45,813
once in place and updated

50
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,803
it enables better returns
for the local economy.

51
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:55,942
So a part of the collected taxes

52
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:59,062
should be reinvested
to update the cadastre.

53
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:02,191
It's a whole system
that needs rethinking.

54
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:05,088
In some countries, 
there is the land registry,

55
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:11,262
in others, the law on taxation,
on land ownership,

56
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:16,596
but no one pays it because
no one asks for it.

57
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:20,496
There is still a long way to go.

58
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:25,564
This is to say that land registry
or addressing should have

59
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:29,520
their biggest impact on local finances.

60
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,160
The idea is not to have populations
paying, no matter what,

61
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,110
but that today, in our cities,

62
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,900
creating equipment and infrastructures,

63
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,210
or providing services, etc., has a cost.

64
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,442
And we must find mechanisms
to be able to cover the costs.

65
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,730
For example, having people
paying for these costs,

66
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,731
the wealthiest people of course,

67
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:08,048
we can't ask people squatting the land
to pay a tax, even if it were possible.

68
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:14,536
Tax is not individual, it serves
a collective effort

69
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,510
which enables, not to replenish
the government budget,

70
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,454
but to create a daily management
of lands where we are.

71
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:31,584
This is extremely important, because 
it is not in the spirit of the age today,

72
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:35,683
but we have to realize that the lack
of infrastructures and facilities

73
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:38,514
in the African cities
comes also from the fact that

74
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:43,756
people do not see why
they should pay taxes and levies.

75
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,793
Yet it's exactly to make up
for this deficit that taxes must be paid.
