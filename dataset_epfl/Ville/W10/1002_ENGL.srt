Planning & Financial Resources
African cities: Intro. to Urban Planning

2
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:07,106
Cities have financing needs.

3
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:09,338
They have infrastructure 
and facilities needs.

4
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:13,772
They need to pay for the infrastructure 
and finance this infrastructure,

5
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:15,970
but they rarely have the means to do so.

6
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:21,505
Earlier we saw the possible mechanisms
between loans and taxation,

7
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:26,755
and we'll see more specifically 
which may be the levers,

8
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,640
particularly when it comes to real estate,

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,599
which allow for an increase in local revenues.

10
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,875
It is possible to look for them elsewhere,

11
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:42,072
but there are also local possibilities 
to increase some of these revenues,

12
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:44,306
and we'll see that 
this is directly linked,

13
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:47,062
directly connected, to the urban plan.

14
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:49,922
The problems are numerous,

15
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:54,569
because the available resources 
do not meet the need,

16
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:58,805
but one of the main problems today
lies in decentralization.

17
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:02,923
Now decentralization itself 
is not a problem.

18
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:05,769
We've delegated 
a certain number of powers

19
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:09,436
from the central government 
to local organizations,

20
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,172
but we've delegated these powers

21
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:13,394
and these responsibilities 
to these organizations

22
00:01:13,394 --> 00:01:16,916
without necessarily budgeting for them.

23
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:19,460
So we find ourselves in a situation

24
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,988
where the local organizations 
have more work to do

25
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:26,935
without having more money budgeted 
to accomplish it.

26
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,611
That is the heart of the problem,

27
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:33,904
that we are in a situations where 
municipalities are in dire need of means

28
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:38,345
with which they might accomplish 
all that they are tasked with.

29
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:41,040
Revenue sources are two-fold.

30
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,682
There are property taxes 
and activity taxes.

31
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:56,755
For this, as we'll see, the property 
clearly needs an address or a cadastre

32
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:00,060
in order to collect these taxes.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,755
But we have within this plan 
taxes on property and activity.

34
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:09,816
There are three challenges.

35
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:18,421
The informal, how I can capture 
part of this informal activity.

36
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:23,383
The question of property,
and the question of economic activity.

37
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:28,346
These are the challenges to secure 
resources for a local government,

38
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:33,453
is to work on these three possible levers.

39
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:36,393
The question of informality 
is relatively simple.

40
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:40,011
How do we handle an activity 
that is by definition informal?

41
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:45,371
How can we succeed in capturing 
part of its resources?

42
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:47,566
Because it does have resources,

43
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:53,142
because the economic activity, 
while poorly paid, is paid.

44
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:55,404
So we can come up with mechanisms

45
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:59,290
to capture a small portion 
of this activity.

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,034
To do this we can, for example, 
impose a tax on street vendors.

47
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:06,472
Now these street vendors 
are accounted for and must pay,

48
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:10,616
each day, each week, 
a tax to the municipality.

49
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:13,572
These are relatively low taxes,

50
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:18,306
the costs to collect them is significant 
in relation to the low taxation,

51
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:20,783
but in the whole scheme 
of informal activity

52
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,989
this reaches amounts 
which can be significant.

53
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:25,242
It requires a systematic approach

54
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:29,950
so that this revenue source 
becomes a real source of revenue.

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,855
When it costs more to collect the taxes 
than those collected,

56
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:40,591
we must ask ourselves if it is not 
a problem in the system.

57
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,806
But even with the informal,

58
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,530
there is no problem 
when it comes to collecting taxes,

59
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,105
we must just know how and 
on which types of activities.

60
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,698
When it comes to transportation, 
it's the same thing.

61
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:57,872
We can collect taxes on private buses, 
which are by definition informal,

62
00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:00,915
at least organized 
in a totally informal way.

63
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:03,358
Real estate value.

64
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:09,196
I'll return to our city plan, 
with the city center, here.

65
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:11,856
There are two types of real estate values.

66
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:15,074
For this entire urban extension here

67
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:19,662
I can tax the price of my parcel,

68
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:24,602
I can collect tax upon its purchase 
but also an annual tax.

69
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:30,896
This tax must then be applied 
to the costs of roadways, electricity.

70
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:34,085
I'm oversimplifying, 
but this is exactly what it's about.

71
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:39,132
We take it once, at the time 
of the transaction, or annually.

72
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:43,503
Here too, the more roadways I build,

73
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:48,084
the more I densify key zones,

74
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:50,356
the more my value will increase,

75
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,455
and thus the land value will increase,

76
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:56,396
and the greater the appreciation 
on my real estate.

77
00:04:56,856 --> 00:04:59,340
We can imagine a mechanism

78
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,673
which would allow us to capture 
this appreciation, at least partially,

79
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:09,489
and this will then allow for 
the financing of our infrastructure.

80
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,385
The case study, my subway route,

81
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:15,621
which we saw in Rabat, 
in a previous video,

82
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:19,259
allows for the creation 
of a real estate appreciation.

83
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,846
We must find the mechanisms 
which allow us,

84
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:24,374
in the case of the sale or rent 
of an apartment,

85
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,899
to capture part of this appreciation,

86
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:30,009
which will in return pay for 
the infrastructure

87
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:32,099
which I put in place 
to create this appreciation.

88
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,909
Thus it's a cycle, a virtuous cycle,

89
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:38,929
the only problem being that as soon as 
we say we'll capture this appreciation,

90
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:43,055
there is a whole series 
of possible circumventions

91
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:45,909
which will allow us 
to keep these official values,

92
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:49,128
and then to leave the informal

93
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:54,317
to avoid paying, 
or being able to pay these taxes.

94
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:58,918
But we must keep in mind that, 
in the case of our urban plan,

95
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,806
of our urban planning, 
whether in the outskirts or in the center,

96
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:06,081
all the infrastructure that I plan

97
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:10,630
is directly interconnected 
with local finances.

98
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,712
This is to say that there is 
an enormous influence

99
00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:17,515
of my urban plan, of my master plan,

100
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:21,940
and of the way in which I plan 
on these local finances.

101
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:28,940
Urban planning has an enormous influence 
on infrastructure costs.

102
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,555
We've seen this 
in housing developments,

103
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:34,092
but there is also an influence

104
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:37,989
on the appreciation which 
one may or may not create.

105
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,065
So we must play both sides 
when planning,

106
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:45,539
on the one hand to limit investment costs,

107
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,680
and at the same time allow for 
an appreciation on these investments

108
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,714
so that we can, in turn, tax them.

109
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:58,586
In sum, there is an economic activity, 
we can be taxed.

110
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:02,504
The more it prospers, 
the more taxes we'll collect,

111
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:06,453
which is to say that the city plan, 
the master plan,

112
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:08,650
should enable us to provide

113
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,836
a certain amount of land, 
or through its infrastructure,

114
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:15,660
the necessary conditions 
for the development of economic activity.

115
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,704
It is always these sweeping ideas, 
this wishful thinking,

116
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:23,289
the infrastructures needed for 
the development of an economic activity.

117
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,306
But this is what it's about.

118
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:28,559
At the same time,
it is about land offers,

119
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:33,425
and about offering 
accessibility to them.

120
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:38,108
Accessibility, not only to the land, 
not only to the city.

121
00:07:38,518 --> 00:07:43,529
If I apply a global view, 
the fact that, for example,

122
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:49,004
When some countries allow 
easy entry without a visa,

123
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:53,490
and as such allow the stream
in and out of people,

124
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,590
this allows for 
the development of activity.

125
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,141
If while seeking to develop this activity 
you are subject to constraints

126
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:03,722
significant enough that you are 
no longer interested in its development,

127
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:06,824
then finally you will go and develop 
somewhere else.

128
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:09,765
There are some who are captive, 
because they are in the city,

129
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:12,606
and won't leave it to go to another city 
to develop their activity,

130
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:15,937
but for economic activity 
coming from the outside,

131
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:18,677
to position oneself 
at an international level

132
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:21,972
requires total accessibility,

133
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:27,622
and this accessibility passes through 
the airport system, the visa system,

134
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:29,606
and all the other things 
which make it so that,

135
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:32,239
yes, it is fluid and easy to come and go,

136
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:37,433
or no, it is extremely difficult to come 
and work or invest in this or that city.

137
00:08:37,723 --> 00:08:40,885
Here I am truly taking the perspective 
of a foreign investor

138
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:43,252
who comes to invest in this or that city.

139
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:47,499
Now, here too, 
what I wished to show quickly is

140
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:52,879
that there is a direct link between 
urban planning and finances.

141
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:58,395
The cost, the cost of urbanization, 
and, on the other side,

142
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,164
the possibility of capturing, 
via taxation,

143
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:08,252
the resources which can then 
be invested elsewhere.
