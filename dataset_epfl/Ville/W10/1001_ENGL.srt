1
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:06,666
We've understood, 
it is a secret to no one,

2
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:13,698
that rapid population increases put cities
in increasingly delicate situations.

3
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:17,765
So at the city government level, 
we call this the local government,

4
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:23,530
this might be an "urban government,"
or even in a small village,

5
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,239
we must deal with the arrival 
of these new residents,

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,109
but also the deficit in infrastructure

7
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:32,278
the deficit in city services.

8
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:34,854
In order to pay for the infrastructure, 
to pay for the cities,

9
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:37,126
we need financial resources.

10
00:00:37,526 --> 00:00:40,321
We are to going to see
how to obtain these resources.

11
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:41,986
And what interests us also,

12
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:47,440
is to see which are the mechanisms 
to obtain financing,

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,636
how to go about it so that the cities

14
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:53,190
have sufficient resources in order to 
be able to finance the infrastructure.

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,620
So we'll see what mechanisms 
are behind the investment.

16
00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:00,280
The city has to invest.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,209
There are two ways to do it,

18
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:05,479
we can either answer the demand 
or create the supply.

19
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,773
We can plan and program based on
the supply or the demand.

20
00:01:11,223 --> 00:01:14,308
We'll use the classic example 
of the railway, for example,

21
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:17,393
We'll use the example of the railway.

22
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:20,478
We have a demand, 
to take from point A to point B

23
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:21,604
a certain number of people

24
00:01:22,284 --> 00:01:26,410
But we can also program, plan,
based on supply.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,378
Say I'm providing service

26
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:31,977
from point A to point B

27
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:33,346
every 30 minutes

28
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,015
for a certain number of people.

29
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:38,566
And then see if there is a link
to the demand.

30
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:40,643
We can start with supply

31
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:43,186
or demand, for investment,
it's the same thing.

32
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:46,465
I offer and provide a service,

33
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:49,206
or I respond to a demand.

34
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:51,948
Most of the time we're dealing 
with responding to demand

35
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:55,160
and we are well below 
what would be needed.

36
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,116
Before providing for the newly arrived, 
we should note that,

37
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:02,093
Most cities, a huge majority of cities,

38
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:04,418
are underfunded 
in infrastructure and facilities.

39
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:07,343
So they don't have the means to provide

40
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:11,013
a number of services which 
are the basic services.

41
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,109
In order to finance the investment

42
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:16,889
we have our own resources, 
we will see what they are.

43
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,956
We have loans.

44
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:22,148
We have land.

45
00:02:22,998 --> 00:02:25,340
Public-Private partnerships,

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,382
and grants.

47
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:34,705
These are the five ways 
to finance investment in cities.

48
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:37,308
Community resources.

49
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:42,393
Broadly, there are four categories 
of resources.

50
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:48,620
Here are the four types of resources.

51
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,750
Transfers, which are issued 
by the State.

52
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:58,741
Taxes which are handled locally,

53
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,255
property taxes, professional taxes.

54
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:07,949
Subsidies, which can be given by donors,

55
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:11,325
and loans, which we'll see in a moment,

56
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:16,081
issued by banks or also by donors.

57
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:17,167
There you have it.

58
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:20,479
This is the classic pattern, 
these are community resources.

59
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,753
These are the resources 
of the local community.

60
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,110
The second type of financing is loans.

61
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,756
Loans, whether from the bank,
from a donor,

62
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:34,100
or a specialized organization.

63
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,789
So the loan is used to borrow money

64
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:39,466
to create an infrastructure.

65
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:42,371
There are infrastructures 
which are profitable,

66
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:46,249
and others which are not directly profitable 
but are necessary to the city,

67
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:52,320
yet others which are not at all profitable,
"not necessary,"

68
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,381
and we can question the relevance 
of building this type infrastructure.

69
00:03:57,381 --> 00:04:00,436
These are the infrastructures 
or facilities of prestige,

70
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:04,776
but in the typical case, at the start,

71
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,173
we borrow money to pay for 
the infrastructure that we'll put in place,

72
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:16,320
so this infrastructure has to be profitable 
in order to provide a return,

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,641
to pay the interest and finally

74
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,511
so that the loan that we took out 
can be repaid.

75
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:24,380
So there is a whole series of mechanisms,

76
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,159
a whole series of conditions 
or conditionalities if it's a city

77
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,474
who is borrowing or if it's a State, 
but it's important to know

78
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:36,411
that it's something used 
relatively little by cities, why?

79
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:39,676
Because they have relatively restricted
financial capacities.

80
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:43,665
States borrow, for the most part,
massively.

81
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:48,403
The cities in the North are 
constantly borrowing.

82
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:52,323
In the South of Africa it's something 
much more rare, why?

83
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:53,450
Because they don't necessarily

84
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,939
have the potential to then 
repay their loan.

85
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,773
So in order to borrow,

86
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:04,501
we must prove the ability 
to repay what has been borrowed.

87
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:07,812
The valuation of land is a way

88
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:12,198
to obtain money, for a local community,

89
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:15,705
in the form of taxes, 
in the form of taxes on capital gains.

90
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:18,480
We will come back later
to these questions,

91
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,354
but we have two possibilities, 
either on the lands not yet urbanized--

92
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:26,188
We saw in a previous video 
how the pressure

93
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:29,974
will be on the non-urbanized 
peripheral areas for now.

94
00:05:30,454 --> 00:05:34,389
We can say that we will urbanize 
these areas, and we can,

95
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:39,223
particularly through taxation, 
capture a part of the land value.

96
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:42,671
In the centers where we continue 
to build infrastructure,

97
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:46,189
or where public transportation 
is being developed,

98
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:50,949
we are creating a land value appreciation 
due to the centrality and the density

99
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:55,035
and this increase in value 
should be captured,

100
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:59,685
at least partially, 
to help pay for facilities.

101
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:01,959
We will come back to this a little later.

102
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,431
There is also the possibility
of public-private partnership,

103
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:10,838
where the investment is made jointly 
by private and public sources,

104
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:15,376
and then often the management
is handled by the private sources,

105
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:20,665
who pay the dividends, 
or who pay a return to the public

106
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:22,463
and after a given number of years,

107
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,891
the investment, the infrastructure 
returns directly to the public sector.

108
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,387
So there exist as many types 
of partnerships possible,

109
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:34,879
as there are types of contracts possible, 
we won't go into detail,

110
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,282
but it's something very common
in today's cities,

111
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:43,150
That is, one makes 
these joint investments.

112
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,642
If the municipality doesn't have 
the possibility to invest,

113
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:49,555
it will be the private sector who 
will invest, and will pay,

114
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:54,638
in the form of a fee, each year, 
a certain sum to the municipality.

115
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:56,316
Finally there are grants,

116
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,154
let's not forget that in certain contexts,

117
00:06:58,154 --> 00:07:00,784
the donor is extremely present,

118
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:06,362
and not only in borrowing 
but lending, with interest.

119
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,569
There is also a certain sum available

120
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:13,105
and often for studies, 
planning studies in particular.

121
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:15,193
It's in the form of grants,

122
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:19,883
and it's a country, 
via the World Bank, via a donor

123
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:25,621
who gives, without consideration, 
a sum for studies.

124
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:29,479
We are rarely dealing 
with large infrastructures

125
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,955
but there are bilateral co-operations 
which make grants without consideration,

126
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:36,125
even for large infrastructures.

127
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:38,688
Bilaterally, it is possible.

128
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:42,231
Multilaterally, often grants are given

129
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:47,575
for investment in studies
more than in infrastructure.

130
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:48,980
There you have very quickly

131
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,730
the few types of financing possible, 
locally, for a city.

132
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,300
In a very concise manner 
we have been able to see

133
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,534
which are the first mechanisms 
for the financing of cities.
