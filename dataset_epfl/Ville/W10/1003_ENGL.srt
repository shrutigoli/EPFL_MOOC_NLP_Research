Addressing

African Cities: Intro. to Urban Planning

3
00:00:04,044 --> 00:00:06,068
Today we'll discuss addressing.

4
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:10,147
We'll start out with what is addressing, 
what is its purpose,

5
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:12,132
and what are some of the techniques

6
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:14,430
to put in place when addressing a city.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,961
To address a city is to assign 
an address to each street,

8
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:25,319
each lot, each parcel, each monument,

9
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:29,660
must be visible on a map, 
must have an address.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,834
The address is a system 
of geographic references

11
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:35,360
which allows one 
to be located within a city.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,545
A well-known case is 
the grid street plan of New York,

13
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:43,679
with its streets:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

14
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,583
up to and beyond 125th St., in Harlem,

15
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:52,078
and then the avenues, which are

16
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:57,133
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7th, 
and which continue on like this,

17
00:00:57,303 --> 00:01:00,430
so then we have a reference system,

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,750
where one is at this street 
and this avenue,

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,750
at this number, East or West 
in relation to the avenue,

20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,501
but which allows one to say 
that this parcel here

21
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:14,518
has this address,

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:22,046
Fourth Street, to the East 
of Fourth Avenue.

23
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:25,450
It's not exactly this system, used in New York,

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,340
but the same principle, 
which enables us to know

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,603
where one is in relation to streets,

26
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,768
where one is in relation to avenues,

27
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:41,463
and if one is on the East or West side.

28
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:45,250
So, what is the purpose of addressing?

29
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,270
First, it allows us to gather
urban information,

30
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,422
to have up-to-date 
and simplified documents.

31
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:55,607
Second, to program investments.

32
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:59,314
Third, to maintain these same investments,

33
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:03,555
which is to say facilities 
or infrastructure.

34
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:07,140
And, fourth, and this is
certainly the most important,

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,638
it allows for taxation,

36
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:12,372
it allows for the improvement 
of local resources.

37
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:15,154
We will always say 
improve local resources,

38
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:19,242
which is clearly about taxation,
and in order to tax people,

39
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:21,361
we have to know where they live.

40
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:24,246
And to know where they live,
they must have an address.

41
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:28,640
So I would say there is 
a very clear separation here,

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,294
on this level here, or here,

43
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:36,115
but we arrive here without addressing,

44
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,286
while on the other hand, this part,

45
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:41,048
is not possible unless there is an address

46
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:43,820
or if there is a cadastre,
as we'll soon see.

47
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,660
So there are two types to capture 
these resources, these taxes,

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,396
whether via the cadastre 
or via addressing.

49
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,630
We'll talk now about addressing.

50
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,204
What we must realize is that 
with both the cadastre and addressing

51
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:01,868
we have two types of documents,

52
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:06,356
the first which is a graph, 
a graphic type, which is a city map,

53
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:08,850
and the second which is a database.

54
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,950
We must correspond these 
to a SIG, as we've seen.

55
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,810
For the SIG the two types of documents

56
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,880
are at the same time 
a spatial representation

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,220
and a database which is connected 
to this spatial representation.

58
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,602
We have the same thing, 
so we can use the SIG

59
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:29,476
as a tool in addressing, 
and/or the cadastre.

60
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:35,728
This establishes at the same time 
spatial data and alphanumeric data.

61
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:41,400
Addressing is a method which allows us 
to identify roads and buildings,

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,714
giving each an address,

63
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:48,841
so we have at once 
a spatial representation,

64
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:50,998
planimetric, in two dimensions,

65
00:03:51,368 --> 00:03:55,707
city blocks, parcels with, each time, 
its own address file.

66
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:59,810
If I were to differentiate between 
a cadastre and addressing,

67
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,588
to the left we have the cadastre,

68
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:07,953
to the right addressing,

69
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,948
the cadastral reference and the parcel,

70
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:17,085
parcel 1, 2, 3, or parcel A1, A2, A3,

71
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:19,590
there are many possible systems,

72
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,400
but let's go by block,

73
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:29,200
and then, within the block, 
we'll go by parcel number.

74
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,230
Addressing is a different system, 
where what interests us

75
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,236
are the entry points to each parcel,

76
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,482
since while we don't know 
what's going on here,

77
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:41,270
what we do know is that

78
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,593
here we are at 15 Something Street,

79
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:49,695
Something Avenue,

80
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:52,233
Something Boulevard,

81
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:57,900
and that we have numbers 
which mean that it is an address here.

82
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,291
We have, perhaps, number 17, or 19,

83
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:05,292
we'll soon see the different ways 
of city addressing.

84
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:11,872
The cadastre, on the other hand, 
is an exhaustive inventory of parcels.

85
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:14,146
The address is not longer key,

86
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,408
it matters little where 
the parcel is located,

87
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:21,354
what is important is that one can have 
a precise idea of the parcel,

88
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,169
and particularly the number 
of square meters it occupies.

89
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,750
Since we want to tax 
based on square meter,

90
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,226
the cadastre is a better means

91
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:30,492
since it gives us 
this information directly.

92
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:33,310
With addressing we have only 
a part of the information.

93
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,635
But the cadastre requires resources,

94
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:40,041
and requires a technical expertise 
far greater than that of addressing.

95
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:43,435
So we need human 
as well as technical resources

96
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:46,218
in order to have a cadastre 
which is current.

97
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:50,979
The problem with the cadastre 
is that it also must be updated often,

98
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,804
while addressing needs it
relatively less often.

99
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,164
Once you have your address,

100
00:05:56,164 --> 00:05:59,440
your address exists and you can,

101
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,950
without the need for regular updates,

102
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,380
continue based on this address book.

103
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,160
The methodology behind addressing 
is relatively simple,

104
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,156
I say relatively because it requires 
significant human resources,

105
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:17,736
but it requires a global implementation,

106
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:22,122
in three phases, of the addressing plan,

107
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:23,753
First we need a cartographer.

108
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:27,327
We must invent the codes to be used,

109
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,443
Next we begin addressing.

110
00:06:31,443 --> 00:06:36,175
We must put up signage,
put numbers on the doors,

111
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:41,045
placing these different address
in a very clear manner in situ,

112
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,554
and finally, once this work is finished,

113
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:48,298
we must compile an address book 
and its database.

114
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:54,010
So we've elaborated here 
a methodology and an action plan.

115
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,244
We've implemented it on the ground,

116
00:06:58,244 --> 00:07:00,494
placing signage and door numbers.

117
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:06,962
And then we've created a file 
of all the addresses,

118
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:08,750
which we've assigned on the ground.

119
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,340
This is the method we will use.

120
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:16,065
Which has, at the same time 
a theoretic part,

121
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:20,434
how we will number the streets, 
number the doors,

122
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:25,120
and a purely technical part, 
on the field,

123
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,855
where we must place signage 
and place the numbers

124
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:30,380
and then compile this database,

125
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,180
which is, ultimately, our goal.

126
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,475
Now, briefly, if I have my city

127
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:43,291
with its main roads, secondary roads,

128
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,900
and we'll determine the sectors,

129
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,639
which we'll call 1, 2, 3, 
it doesn't matter.

130
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,830
We can go clockwise.

131
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,110
Remember that the districts in Paris 
use numbers which go like this,

132
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,836
from one to the next, 
from the first to the second.

133
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:02,532
And then we have the inner suburb, 
and the outer suburb.

134
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:05,752
Then once we are at Sector 1,

135
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:09,212
we go back to an address, 
which will be 1,

136
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:12,522
and then we have a system of streets,

137
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:15,322
we might have a numeration,

138
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:18,488
1-1,

139
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:20,772
1-3,

140
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:22,786
1-5,

141
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:25,362
and then the streets 
going in the other direction

142
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,794
will be 1-2,

143
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:29,645
1-4,

144
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:34,166
1-6, and so on.

145
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:40,266
So if I live here, this means 
that in this house here,

146
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,946
this means that I live on 
Street 1, Sector 1--

147
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:45,981
No, sorry, Street 6,

148
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:49,710
and then there will be 
a certain distance

149
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,558
from the beginning of the street,

150
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:54,190
we'll explain this is in a moment,

151
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,960
but let's assume that I'm 45 meters 
from the beginning of the street.

152
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,896
Here's the type of address I might have.

153
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,882
So we determine the methodology,

154
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:08,870
and then we must go to 
the beginning of each street,

155
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,182
place the signage here.

156
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:17,008
Once all this is done,
we'll use all the addresses,

157
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:21,286
and all the addresses 
will give us a database.

158
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:24,220
Different ways of calculating.

159
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:30,794
Different ways of placing 
the number on the parcel.

160
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:33,870
Now I have my street here,

161
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,226
the two sides of the street,

162
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:40,632
and then we determine which is 
the beginning of the street,

163
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:42,606
which goes in this direction,

164
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:45,244
and then we have a first possibility,

165
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:47,822
which is what we commonly see in Europe,

166
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:50,420
evens on one side, 
and odds on the other,

167
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,521
so we have Door 1, Door 3,

168
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:57,301
Door 5, Door 7.

169
00:09:57,726 --> 00:09:59,902
And then on the other side, I'll have 2,

170
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:01,352
4,

171
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:04,772
6 or 8.

172
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:06,554
This is how it's done.

173
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:10,280
If I divide one of the two parcels in two,

174
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,306
I'll have 6-A,

175
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:17,912
then we'll have 6-B, etc.

176
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,531
The other possibility I have

177
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,085
would be to, again, from 
the beginning of the street,

178
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:26,550
which runs in this direction,

179
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,506
to count the number of meters

180
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:34,532
and choose, once again, 
the evens and odds.

181
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:38,100
I am, for example, at 6 meters,

182
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,745
at 20,

183
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:42,702
34,

184
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:47,049
52 and 64 meters,

185
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:52,777
which makes my parcel number 
relative to the doors' axes

186
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,576
and the number of meters 
which separate them

187
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:58,275
with the beginning of the street, here.

188
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:02,395
On the other side, 
I will find myself at 5, 19,

189
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:05,505
31, for example,

190
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:09,146
49, why not? And so on.

191
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,680
What this does is, 
if I split a parcel in two,

192
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,266
I can easily add a number

193
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:23,412
which would be 8, or 10, seems right,

194
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:26,140
which means that I will be 10 meters 
from the beginning of the street.

195
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,464
So it is very easy to do this way, 
to densify and redensify.

196
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:36,716
These are the two main principles 
of city addressing.

197
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:41,320
A system with existing numbers,

198
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,380
and a system which is metric 
that allows us, in this way,

199
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,769
to measure or to indicate

200
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,618
the distance of the parcel,

201
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:54,878
from its door, in principal, 
when there is a door,

202
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:56,492
from its door's axis,

203
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:59,396
from this same door 
to the beginning of the street.

204
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,810
The key dates of addressing.

205
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,130
We won't review the addressing 
of all African cities,

206
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,230
but it was during the 1990's, 
most notably,

207
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,980
under the auspices of the World Bank,

208
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,400
when most of the addressing 
of these cities was done.

209
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,940
We have recently, the addressing 
of Djibouti or of N'Djamena.

210
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,472
Each city which grew, and expanded

211
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:29,224
needs regular addressing campaigns 
for its new neighborhoods.

212
00:12:29,224 --> 00:12:32,620
It's more complicated when 
we speak of precarious zones,

213
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,776
but we must imagine that 
each urban extension

214
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,378
produces new addresses,

215
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:43,324
new addresses which must be 
identified and marked on the land.

216
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:47,230
The applications, which are two 
as we've already seen.

217
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,971
We can have addresses 
for these residents,

218
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:51,985
which allows us to tax them,

219
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:55,429
which allows us to require 
their payment of taxes or levies.

220
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,494
In return, they have an address,

221
00:12:57,494 --> 00:13:01,120
which gives them access to citizenship,

222
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,984
which is something eminently symbolic, 
for sure, yet fundamental.

223
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:09,630
We have an address, we can be found.

224
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,150
We are no longer anonymous 
within a precarious zone.

225
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,650
We have an address, 
we are a citizen of the city,

226
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,324
the proof being that 
we can receive mail.

227
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:21,340
A symbolic term for inhabitants,
it's fundamental.

228
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,961
For the local authorities, 
it is fundamental

229
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:27,602
to be able to secure payment 
for water, electricity,

230
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:30,084
real estate taxes, other taxes and fees.

231
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:33,121
We can invent a number 
of new taxes and fees

232
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:35,009
now that we have the addresses.
