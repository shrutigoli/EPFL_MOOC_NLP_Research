1
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:07,040
Today we'll look at 
the question of diagnosis.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,490
Diagnosis is a term borrowed from 
the medical profession.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:18,180
To diagnose is to perform the necessary 
analyses to diagnose an illness.

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,405
In other words to find out what 
problems the patient has,

5
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:27,267
in order to come up with 
the appropriate treatment.

6
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:33,775
By analogy, it is the same situation 
for territorial diagnostics.

7
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:37,456
What we want to know is 
what the problem is,

8
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:40,826
the state of the patient 
for as long as he is ill.

9
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:44,633
And this is what we'll examine 
in the following minutes.

10
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:48,322
Diagnostics brings up, above all,
two questions.

11
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:50,763
The first is <i>why</i> of diagnostics.

12
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:54,565
What are its reasons and what are 
the questions it answers?

13
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:59,074
It is critical to know how to respond 
to each question.

14
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,722
We should not perform diagnostics 
for the sake of performing diagnostics,

15
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:04,191
run the numbers for the sake 
of running the numbers

16
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:07,274
or to have an encyclopedic 
knowledge of a territory.

17
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:10,385
We must respond to 
the questions which arise.

18
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:14,681
Next, the important question of <i>how</i>.

19
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:18,124
What are the means and 
the approaches necessary?

20
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:22,395
These are the two questions 
which will guide our diagnosis.

21
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:25,552
Here's a very classic way to diagnose.

22
00:01:26,402 --> 00:01:27,887
We have our assets,

23
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:31,999
and we evaluate the present and past 
dynamics of the territory.

24
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:36,814
These can be economic, social,
environmental or architectural.

25
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:42,164
but we look at the presence or absence 
of certain problems or certain resources

26
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:47,151
which are considered to be 
the assets of a territory.

27
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:53,516
We try to understand the system's 
ability to function,

28
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:59,153
and determine if, in its present state, 
it will enable us reach our goals.

29
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,135
By analogy its weaknesses, 
which is the opposite.

30
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:07,626
This is the evaluation of present 
and past dynamics, as with assets,

31
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:14,266
but this time we'll instead focus first 
on what's not working in the system.

32
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:19,308
This time we look at the possible 
developments of the territory,

33
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,220
so we're looking ahead.

34
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,253
We are symmetric with its assets, 
both present and past.

35
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:32,066
With opportunities, it's the same idea 
of their effect on the system,

36
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:37,749
but from a perspective and by analogy, 
of course, of possible threats.

37
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:43,117
So we have here the past and 
the present, here looking ahead.

38
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:45,981
Here we are with the positives,

39
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:49,225
and here, with weaknesses and threats,
in the negative.

40
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:53,030
So here you have the grid for analysis, 
the initial framework.

41
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,397
These are the questions we'll ask 
for a holistic diagnosis.

42
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,694
A method of diagnosis 
by no means exhaustive.

43
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:07,797
We have questions of institution,
demographics, urban context,

44
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:11,149
roadways, water, lighting, 
and surely others,

45
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,075
here, without at doubt also 
the most important.

46
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:19,982
Why? Because we will try to offer 
a vision of the city,

47
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:22,192
of its past as well as its present.

48
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:28,589
We'll highlight some of its weaknesses, 
but also some of its strengths.

49
00:03:28,589 --> 00:03:34,508
Because of this we are, at the same time, 
on political and institutional levels,

50
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:40,392
as with questions of resources or other 
more complex issues of social context.

51
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:42,744
Let's look at this example.

52
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:47,257
The economic zone of a city, 
of Nouakchott.

53
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:53,157
Each zone where there is 
economic potential is indexed.

54
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:55,429
We'll soon see what becomes of it.

55
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:57,595
It is not simply because 
we've identified a zone

56
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:00,147
that it becomes useful for our planning,

57
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:05,466
but it gives us an idea of where 
economic activity occurs within a city.

58
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:10,743
Administrative questions, 
we're going to divide it up.

59
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:18,299
We know that the city is divided into 
a certain number of municipalities,

60
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:22,353
and we'll have the statistics 
for each municipality.

61
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,997
This is always where the difficulty lies.

62
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:28,881
If we plan for the whole 
of the urban perimeter,

63
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:32,982
we still have subdivisions, whether by 
community or municipality.

64
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,723
as a function of the cities 
they form part of.

65
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:40,291
Another critical element is that of 
primary water resources.

66
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:45,713
Right away we notice a deficit here,

67
00:04:45,713 --> 00:04:50,614
another large deficit in these zones, 
where there are few resources,

68
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:55,449
This x-ray of primary water resources 
gives us a quick view

69
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,344
of where the major problems lie 
when it comes to water supply.

70
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:01,252
The stages of expansion.

71
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,808
This helps us to understand 
how the city was developed,

72
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:10,282
with indicators of each stage.

73
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:18,715
We see that the initial nucleus was here, 
and how the city developed from it,

74
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:24,183
with indications of the time periods 
during which this or that policy

75
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:26,972
was put in place regarding 
the use of the territory.

76
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:28,994
Existing subdivisions.

77
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:33,974
We discussed earlier land issues, 
which are crucial here.

78
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:38,275
Which is to say that all these
indexed zones are subdivisions

79
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:44,920
which were offered or sold, 
yet were not developed.

80
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,891
In other words, all of these parcels
are occupied.

81
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:55,128
Which means that the city perimeter 
extends more or less to this point,

82
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:59,106
and if today we want to develop a plan,

83
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:03,656
all this zone is already occupied, 
even if in fact it is not,

84
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,989
so our plan must begin a bit further out.

85
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:10,876
A map such as this one offers 
a quick view of land issues.

86
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,763
Another map, this one 
of urban public transport.

87
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:20,973
This might be independent transport, 
or official transport by bus.

88
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:24,704
Here were are perhaps dealing 
more with small-scale transport,

89
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:27,677
but we see the breakdown 
of lines and stations.

90
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:36,106
Roadways, both existing and also those,
within the diagnosis, already planned,

91
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:40,740
since we're not just planning, but also 
dealing with ongoing projects

92
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,655
which take place over 
the next few months or years,

93
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:47,012
which are already "in the pipeline", 
which means they will happen.

94
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:49,554
We can, then, consider them 
as already existing.

95
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:54,856
Densities. If we have a subsequent 
policy for land density,

96
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:59,138
we need to know how we might apply 
this policy, in which neighborhood,

97
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:01,657
know which neighborhoods are densest.

98
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:06,654
We can easily see here that the densest 
neighborhoods are the poorer districts,

99
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:12,489
with shantytowns here, and here, so we're 
dealing with extremely dense areas,

100
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:16,129
with between 350-450 inhabitants 
per hectare.

101
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:22,989
We see, when we superimpose 
these different maps, different resources,

102
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:28,189
an idea of where the problems 
might occur, and what they might be.

103
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:32,755
If we look at the map of water supply,

104
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:37,387
we can see that this zone here 
is particularly problematic,

105
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:41,517
because it is extremely dense 
yet has a scant water supply.

106
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:47,039
Constraints, pressures,
and environmental potential.

107
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,873
In the case of Nouakchott, 
we have here these huge dunes,

108
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:54,922
one of which protects from the ocean,

109
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:59,934
and these areas of dry salt lakes,
which are below sea level.

110
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:06,123
This gives us a snapshot of the situation 
as it exists today in Nouakchott,

111
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:12,287
where a breach of the dune ridge 
would lead to the flooding of this zone,

112
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:17,954
and we see that this urban planning is, 
ultimately, dependent on

113
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:20,482
the stability or instability 
of these large dunes.

114
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,166
Land use.

115
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:28,641
A supplemental map showing 
habitat zones, green spaces,

116
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,291
the few industrial zones which exist,

117
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:41,581
and, finally, a summary of the questions, 
with a few problems here, others here.

118
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:46,435
This map tries, although doesn't 
necessarily succeed, but at least tries,

119
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:51,752
to illustrate the issues 
behind this diagnosis.

120
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:55,724
Quickly, another example, 
that of N'djamena,

121
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:59,466
a city, like Nouakchott, of fewer than 
one million inhabitants.

122
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:03,205
We have, of course, on this summary map

123
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:08,358
all the problems, the potentialities, 
of the city of N'djamena.

124
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:11,542
The most important thing is, 
of course, the map,

125
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:18,976
but let's not forget that we also 
need a legend, for without it

126
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:25,046
we wouldn't know to what the colors 
and arrows on the chart refer.

127
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:27,815
So that was a brief 
overview of diagnostics.

128
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:34,280
Don't forget the assets, 
weaknesses, opportunities, threats.

129
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,512
This is the starting point we need 
in order to build and imagine a diagnosis.

130
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:43,629
I've shown you several maps, and 
might have shown you others,

131
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:47,673
or taken others away, but what 
you should keep in mind

132
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:53,255
that a map is only useful if it 
assists you in your planning.

133
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:57,012
If you make maps just for the sake 
of making maps, they will be useless.

134
00:09:57,012 --> 00:10:00,429
Each element that you bring 
to your diagnosis

135
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:03,708
must contribute to your city planning.
