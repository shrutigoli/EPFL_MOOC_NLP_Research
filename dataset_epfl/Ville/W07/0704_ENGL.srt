1
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:06,234
Another tool, the S.I.G.

2
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:08,737
The SIG.

3
00:00:08,737 --> 00:00:13,088
We should understand that this 
is a tool which helps us,

4
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:18,502
often to make decisions, 
but that is not an end in itself.

5
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:22,456
There is a tendency today 
in African cities

6
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,284
to think that all should be 
resolved by the SIG.

7
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:26,797
This is false.

8
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:32,729
It is an aid which should be used 
when one can, or when one needs it.

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,166
It's an aid which also requires resources.

10
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:39,001
But we must be nuanced 
in our utilization of SIGs.

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:44,784
In a fair number of today's African cities 
there are SIGs which were created,

12
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:48,163
but which are not up to date, 
which no longer serve any purpose.

13
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:51,960
So we must pay very, very close 
attention to what we do.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,010
The definition of a SIG.

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,111
It is a tool which provides

16
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:06,122
information on geographic indications,
as well as alphanumeric indications,

17
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,450
to help in decision-making.

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,848
One is not simply limited to one map,

19
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:16,673
but can click on a geographic zone 
and find out its attributes.

20
00:01:17,423 --> 00:01:21,839
This allows us to link, for example, 
a population to a neighborhood.

21
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:27,578
There are two approaches,
one technical, the other functional.

22
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:33,285
The technical approach is 
an automated way of handling

23
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:36,935
a certain amount of data, 
often obtained via cartography.

24
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:43,576
The functional approach is a manner 
of treating and communicating information,

25
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:47,515
a tool for decision-making.

26
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:50,516
So within this functional approach,

27
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:54,848
decision-making is 
the final objective of the SIG.

28
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:56,869
A double approach, as we've said,

29
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:02,696
at once a spatial approach 
and an alphanumeric approach.

30
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:06,997
Here we are in a database system,

31
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:10,813
and here via cartography.

32
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:14,188
This can be of vectors, or images,

33
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:19,677
and the two together form the SIG.

34
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,913
Now, another example.

35
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:32,005
We have here a certain number 
of lots, in the land registry.

36
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:38,880
At the same time we have this lot here,

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,675
for example, with its spatial data,

38
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:52,200
and we have attribute data like
the number of the lot

39
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,937
or, for example, the name of the owner.

40
00:02:57,617 --> 00:03:00,417
and the attribute data like, for example,

41
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:04,341
the number of lot 
and the name of the owner.

42
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:10,260
Now, two modes of representation: 
raster and vector.

43
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,363
Let's look at the example of raster.

44
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:17,645
We have an image with an invisible grid,

45
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:21,535
but each square has a value.

46
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:23,586
This is raster mode.

47
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,947
Of course the grid is much smaller,

48
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:31,510
but each pixel can be 
attributed to a value.

49
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,694
The vector is different.

50
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:38,950
If we have a line, we can have a point,

51
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,586
or we can have a surface.

52
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:48,313
These are the two methods of 
spatial representation which we utilize.

53
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:52,819
With vector data we can have polygons,

54
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,533
a certain number of parcels, 
for example,

55
00:03:57,533 --> 00:04:01,675
each one closed off.

56
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:04,223
We might also have polylines,

57
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:09,368
not tree branches, 
but an example of waterways,

58
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,444
or a pipeline network.

59
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:15,894
And then we can have 
a certain number of points,

60
00:04:16,484 --> 00:04:19,178
each one corresponding to an index.

61
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:22,757
These are, roughly, the three types.

62
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:27,702
Polygons, polylines and points.

63
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,599
The three types of vector data 
which we utilize.

64
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,251
Raster data, might be for land use,

65
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:37,717
or, for example an elevation model.

66
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:42,966
Now the vector object
in our database will be like this,

67
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:47,503
or a line, with a beginning 
and end point,

68
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:50,029
as well as a curve equation.

69
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,677
And with this we'll move to a database

70
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:59,815
with a certain number of data points,

71
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:03,233
the whole of which being 
what interests us,

72
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:06,711
not just a vector or a curve,

73
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:10,189
but rather the vectors plus the database.

74
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,547
The operation of a SIG.

75
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:21,126
We have a real situation, 
which we'll measure and observe.

76
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:27,951
In the SIG we'll have
a certain amount of data,

77
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:31,256
and we'll do certain analyses.

78
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:36,171
We can also do some mapping.

79
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:44,767
So this will be a tool for communication
and decision-making,

80
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:50,538
this decision having, of course, 
an influence on the real situation.

81
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:57,118
We'll make the loop with this plan 
which is unending,

82
00:05:57,118 --> 00:06:00,066
but which should help us 
to reach improved situations.

83
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:04,501
A sort of virtuous circle, 
based on the SIG.

84
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:09,767
Don't forget this is but a tool, 
which won't resolve all problems,

85
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:12,174
but when dealing with a real situation

86
00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:17,023
one analyzes, one measures, one observes,
and then one communicates,

87
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:21,361
one makes decisions which modify 
this real-life situation.

88
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,168
The main components of a SIG.

89
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:27,656
Naturally, the data, without which 
we'd have nothing, as we just discussed.

90
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:31,078
It's also a question of hardware, 
of the machine.

91
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,566
One must have a computer 
which can process all this.

92
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:36,312
It's a question of software,

93
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:39,348
but also a question of users,

94
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:42,705
for there still must be people 
behind the machines,

95
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:44,799
it won't happen automatically,

96
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,234
as well as the processes put in place

97
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:50,784
between users, and between 
the user and the machine,

98
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:54,034
in order to manage the diagnosis.

99
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:59,922
Don't forget that it is not the SIG 
which will manage things, but the user.

100
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:01,899
It is an aid in decision-making.

101
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,100
We perform certain analyses 
with the SIG, based on the data,

102
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,934
but it is not the machine 
which will decide

103
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:12,790
which plan you will 
subsequently develop.

104
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,570
In summary, the SIG is meant to respond 
to different questions.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,878
Where? What? How? When? and If.

106
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:26,997
The SIG is useful in urban planning.

107
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:30,881
It is helpful when doing diagnostics.

108
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,460
But we must also understand 
that it has certain limits.

109
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,634
The limits are that the machine 
can only perform analyses

110
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:41,456
based on the figures we've provided.

111
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,526
If your figures are false, 
if the figures are truncated,

112
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,797
the analyses will be false and truncated.

113
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,237
That is the first thing.

114
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:52,419
The second is that in order for 
a SIG to work, it needs data.

115
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:55,456
Data is extremely difficult to obtain.

116
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,580
And data is extremely difficult to update.

117
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,128
If we use as an example the African city,

118
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:05,529
we've seen how cities change very rapidly.

119
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:10,316
It's also necessary that this data can 
take into account all these changes

120
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:13,450
in a very clear manner, 
very precise and very quick.

121
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,699
In summary, there is no point in having 
a machine which spins on its own.

122
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,917
We must feed it, and feed it regularly.

123
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,838
And it is because of this that we've seen,

124
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,502
in a fair number of cities,

125
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:27,317
a stage, a project put in place 
according to a SIG,

126
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:30,133
which ends up without the resources 
needed to keep it up to date.

127
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,867
If the resources aren't there to update it,

128
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:35,328
your SIG will quickly become obsolete, 
and will serve no purpose.

129
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:40,918
So it is preferable to have, rather than 
an encyclopedic knowledge of a territory,

130
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:46,779
only a few indicators, but indicators 
which are always kept current.

131
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:49,250
So this is the power of the SIG,

132
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,200
that we can be at once encyclopedic,

133
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,399
but can only use certain elements,

134
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,967
and it is clearly preferable, logical, 
to use only those elements

135
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,467
which are chosen in a very clear manner,

136
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,617
as those indicators 
we choose to put in place,

137
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:08,584
updating the data to which 
these indicators refer.
