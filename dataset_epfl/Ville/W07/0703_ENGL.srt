00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:06,945
Hello, today we are going to talk
about basic data.

2
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:10,222
To make a plan or a diagnostic,

3
00:00:10,222 --> 00:00:14,880
a certain amount of basic data
to work from is necessary.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,292
The basic data can vary,

5
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:22,300
the most obvious ones being
maps, satellite images, blueprints

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,900
historical plans, all graphical things,

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,365
the graphical representation
of the city on plans.

8
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:34,215
Those are the first data
that can be provided.

9
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:40,030
Then, we have other types of data
called statistics,

10
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,010
there is literature,

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,890
there is the official data,

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,574
there are field studies.

13
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:54,970
Next come multiple tools
that can be used for planning.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,956
Maps and images.

15
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:01,790
A Google image as a first example.

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,860
This is Madagascar.

17
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,557
We go on Google Earth or Google Maps

18
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:10,420
and we find most of the options
that are before us,

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,313
since we can quickly get maps
and see the situation.

20
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:20,086
There are always geo-referencing
and scale issues.

21
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:25,690
We must be able to measure things,
from here to there

22
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,290
or surface areas,

23
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,295
so it's not always easy,
but we do have a first source here,

24
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:34,763
with Google images or satellite images

25
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:38,796
bought by the city council or ministries.

26
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:43,250
Another example on the coast,

27
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,635
which shows a potential problem
in this area,

28
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:54,948
and we can start understanding
the different urban fabrics

29
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,770
here and there,
just with an image.

30
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,910
Here is Dakar.

31
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:05,230
Simply observe this area here

32
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,350
and the development of a new lot

33
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,163
where only the road network
has been built for now.

34
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:16,256
Maps may also be
historical maps or plan.

35
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:19,220
Here is an old plan of Nouakchott,

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,522
an image of Nouakchott from the 70's,

37
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:27,205
and other types of documents
which can be used as master plans,

38
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:30,791
they are old master plans
that we will be working on as well.

39
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,818
So every time, we try to assess

40
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:35,382
what has been done,

41
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:39,260
and history is expected to carry on,

42
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,370
something existed before,
even if the plan didn't work.

43
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,532
We will look for previous plans

44
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:50,792
to assess them and see
what has been established or not,

45
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:54,980
what has worked or not

46
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,710
and if it didn't work, in what extent
and why it didn't.

47
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,827
Let's see the statistics now.

48
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:04,258
Let's pick any country and enter

49
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:07,415
<i>« Institut national de la statistique »</i>

50
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:10,370
or <i>« Office national de la statistique »</i>

51
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,420
and you will find a website
with the main stats for each country.

52
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,890
Usually, it is national
and regional stats.

53
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,716
It's very difficult to find council stats

54
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:26,112
and even more so at the urban area level,

55
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:28,726
which is a gathering
of several municipalities.

56
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:32,375
So we must refer to national stats

57
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:37,470
for mortality rate, for example,
which is linked to the global population.

58
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,854
Literature, broadly defined,

59
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:42,717
includes all reports from experts.

60
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:46,855
For each city, you will find dozens
or hundreds of reports from experts

61
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:49,634
on subjects from access to drinking water,

62
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:53,031
focus groups, to socio-economic studies

63
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:56,260
or socio-demographic studies in poor areas

64
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,330
or general matters, previous planning,

65
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,120
study reports on previous planning.

66
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,910
You will definitely find
a wealth of information.

67
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,516
Just a downside to be careful about,

68
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:15,342
usually in these reports,
the figures are used over and over

69
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:19,284
the previous reports are used
to update the new ones

70
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:23,999
without questioning the reliability
and validity of the data.

71
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,635
We can often trace,
just like a historian,

72
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:33,750
the progression of mistakes
about the population

73
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,495
and we find the source
in one report,

74
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:40,300
and see that the following ones
have just copied it

75
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,890
without checking the information.

76
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,290
Pay special attention to this,

77
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,554
reports are a source of information

78
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:57,290
but the validity of the information
must be known and understood.

79
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:01,075
Official data.

80
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:03,840
Besides stats, 
there are different types of data

81
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,200
which may be land titles for example.

82
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,257
Those can be found at the property,
at the Land registry for cadastral plans.

83
00:05:10,257 --> 00:05:14,890
So there is a number of official data
which can be used.

84
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,432
They are often hard to obtain

85
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:22,755
because generally speaking,
whoever holds the data has the power,

86
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:28,790
and it is very difficult to obtain
full listings of land titles, for example.

87
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,158
However, in some countries,

88
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:37,100
the data are increasingly free
and available for all.

89
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,576
So we are going from
a centralized view of the data,

90
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:45,080
where nothing can go out

91
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,649
and everything is kept very tightly

92
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,540
as there seems to be no reason
to be giving them away,

93
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,329
towards a much broader view,
which represents more the present days,

94
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:00,330
namely to have basic data
available to everybody.

95
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,790
Finally, field studies.

96
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,950
They can broadly be categorized.

97
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,898
First, household survey

98
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:10,970
where a questionnaire is made
and it's carried out on the field,

99
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,832
and the questions will be processed
to create statistics.

100
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:18,336
For everything needed
that is not in the stats,

101
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,710
or can't be found in maps and plans,

102
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,102
reports and literature,

103
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:26,730
or in official data,

104
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,640
you must go on the field
to lead the necessary surveys

105
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,860
in order to obtain the data.

106
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,870
A field survey may also be
counting cars on streets.

107
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,830
You place people and you count
several hours a day

108
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,414
traffic loads at given crossroads.

109
00:06:44,164 --> 00:06:47,020
They may also be household surveys,

110
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,870
surveys, focus groups in districts

111
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,910
in order to try and understand
people's lives

112
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,706
before starting to plan anything.

113
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:59,490
It might be the most important part
of our basic data.

114
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,703
It's all the data that we don't have
and that we must find

115
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:06,190
and field survey is essential
for this matter.

116
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,580
This concludes this overview
of the data issue.

117
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,920
You need data and you can find only a few.

118
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,695
In African cities, data is national,
but not at town or municipality level,

119
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:25,520
so it can prove difficult to obtain
convincing information.

120
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,691
It doesn't mean it doesn't exist,

121
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:30,898
it's just harder to get.

122
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:34,118
Everything you won't find
you will have to go look for

123
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:36,148
with field surveys,

124
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:39,562
to set up methods that will allow you

125
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:44,438
to quickly gather the data you need
for your planning.
