1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,250
Hello.

2
00:00:00,954 --> 00:00:07,640
In this video we will see 
today a working method.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,424
We are going to talk at length about 
urban planning, the course subject.

4
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,803
We are now going to see an example

5
00:00:14,803 --> 00:00:17,190
of a planning that was done in N'Djamena.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,271
The interest in planning as we are going 
to show it, is to put

7
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:26,460
the focus on a method that we have 
developed some years ago.

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,310
So in a very synthetic way, 
the city of N'Djamena,

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,817
the historical and colonial center,

10
00:00:37,817 --> 00:00:42,600
working class neighborhood as we have 
often spoken of each time.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,160
A segregated city, a river here,

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,220
with bridges over the river to connect 
the South Shore to the North Shore.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,862
A border, since this whole area here, 
we are in Cameroon, the airport.

14
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:07,320
And finally we see that the city has 
developed like this

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,805
with a first beltway, a second, 
but when is the third ring?

16
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:16,450
There you have a very quick base drawing 
of the city of N'Djamena.

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,320
So let's review some images.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,665
Let's go downtown.

19
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,959
Some atmosphere pictures for those 
who do not know,

20
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,528
who have never had the chance 
to go to N'Djamena.

21
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:31,450
These are things that can be found in 
most cities of this region.

22
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,991
And the working class 
neighborhoods not far

23
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:38,268
from downtown, we see that just as
in many places in Africa,

24
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:44,467
we have here a waste water disposal 
that happens out in the open.

25
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:50,352
There are a number of collectors and
of course the streets are not paved.

26
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:52,500
Let's talk about method now.

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,040
Here's a first group of municipality 
and department officers.

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,686
The idea was to create the planning 
and to train people.

29
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,980
It was necessary to answer very quickly

30
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,645
to a demand from authorities 
to make an urban plan,

31
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:16,340
a framework document, the first document, 
a planning sketch

32
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,690
and for this we have brought together 
twenty participants.

33
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,736
We have brought together participants from

34
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:25,244
Ministry and participants and City Hall.

35
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:28,293
We have taken young, young 
budding urban planners,

36
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:31,940
to create this plan together.

37
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,483
Therefore, the application was both a 
training and a planning.

38
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:40,755
Rather than separate the two things, 
we have combined the two things,

39
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:45,870
and we have said, we are going to 
plan together, and to train together.

40
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,510
So we bring everyone together in one room,

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,988
we discuss, we draw in groups, 
each one making its diagnosis.

42
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:59,398
each image is discussed, each option, 
each part of the diagnosis

43
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:04,920
is put on paper and we draw 
once again together.

44
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,360
The idea here being that 
we have 20 participants.

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,189
We are not going to know 
who knows the most

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,790
about the city of N'Djamena, 
it's not the objective.

47
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,935
The objective is to add up all of

48
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:17,670
this knowledge and all of the abilities 
of the participants.

49
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,180
So there is no right, there is no wrong, 
there's no what's true.

50
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,078
There are abilities and knowledge 
that people have.

51
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,621
People can talk about 
their neighborhoods,

52
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:29,177
of the road, of the problem 
of a certain neighborhood,

53
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:32,710
of the problem of a certain facility 
or a certain infrastructure

54
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,100
and we put this all together on the paper.

55
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,190
And I guarantee you that with 20 people, 
we very quickly have a photograph

56
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,440
which is relatively correct of N'Djamena
in very, very little time.

57
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,700
That in two, three days we have 
a diagnosis together.

58
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,340
We discuss, we decide, 
people don't agree.

59
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,802
We put it on paper and then each group 
presents their ideas.

60
00:03:57,802 --> 00:03:59,746
So we make a diagnosis.

61
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:05,634
Then, this diagnosis, we are going to 
extract the main issues put on paper.

62
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:08,849
Then these issues, we are going to

63
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,830
transform them in political orientations.

64
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,694
Finally, it's not because there's a
problem that we decide to solve it.

65
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:20,422
So what is interesting for us to know,
is at what moment we have

66
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:25,534
a problem, what is the exact problem, 
and are we going to solve it or not?

67
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:30,022
And then it will become an orientation 
if we decide solve it .

68
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:37,000
In that regard, we have orientations, then
we're going to spatialize them on a plan.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,312
So, always in groups, 
in orientation groups,

70
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:43,882
we redraw and then

71
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:47,160
we project these different drawings,

72
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,335
these different handmade sketches.

73
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:53,475
And directly, all together, 
orientation by orientation,

74
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:59,010
we draw on the board, directly 
from the computer.

75
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,526
We do it so that the drawing is done 
little by little

76
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:04,930
with everyone coming to a end result.

77
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,967
So it's really we decide all together, 
we draw all together, and in this case,

78
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:16,300
the expert is here to bring a number of 
elements and reflection.

79
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,468
So it's not the expert that 
will make the plan,

80
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:23,080
it's the participants who make the plan.

81
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,538
They are questioned, they are pushed 
a little so that they come up with

82
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:29,708
the best of themselves and we realize 
very quickly

83
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,516
that we end up with excellent results.

84
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:37,710
Here is a quick plan which is 
the diagnosis plan.

85
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,812
This was made all together, 
we have just redrawn it.

86
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:46,882
And then, when it comes to the planning, 
stage by stage, we have a river

87
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:52,130
we have an existing city, 
we have city limits

88
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:57,258
urban perimeter limits, 
administrative cutbacks,

89
00:05:57,258 --> 00:06:02,852
then a slice, a road network,

90
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:07,850
a number of green areas and 
industrial areas,

91
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,550
water problems in downtown, draining,

92
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,794
large infrastructures, the center

93
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:17,874
which gets drawn slowly, the projection of

94
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:22,198
future roads, priority areas to be restructured.

95
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:28,611
And so, little by little, by phases,
we end up with a master plan,

96
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,238
of course with the final title block 
which is very important,

97
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:35,377
since it doesn't suffice to just make 
a drawing, it's also important

98
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:38,910
to know what the drawing is 
that was put in place.

99
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,292
There you have very quickly,
an experience that was done

100
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,366
with the Urbaplan office, a Swiss office.

101
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:51,690
I myself participated as expert to develop
this method with this office.

102
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,435
It's one way to go about it that 
we are proposing to you.

103
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:55,870
What are the advantages?

104
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,668
The advantages are undeniable.

105
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,644
It is then that people who have 
developed the plan,

106
00:07:00,644 --> 00:07:04,562
are the people in administration 
who will have to put it in action.

107
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:09,039
It's people who will finally 
have to enforce or not,

108
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,915
and it's easier to enforce regulations,

109
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:13,670
if it's you who has written it.

110
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,798
It's easier to enforce a plan 
if it's you who has created it

111
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:20,450
and who has integrated all the stages.

112
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,980
It's not something that 
comes from the exterior

113
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,310
which is imposed, it's something that
is imposed from the interior.

114
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,346
And finally, at each stage, each decision,

115
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:33,144
we know why such or such 
a decision has been taken.

116
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:35,030
So it's easier then to justify

117
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,430
to the exterior that this should have been
done like this,

118
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,991
because we know the whole story 
of this decision making.

119
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:43,716
And this is fundamental.

120
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:46,660
We are not dealing with 
a participatory process,

121
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,468
it's not participation with people.

122
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,772
We are dealing with macro planning

123
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:55,866
of a city, large orientations, 
big options.

124
00:07:55,866 --> 00:08:00,188
But we all do it within an administration,

125
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:04,449
within the municipality, which allows for
the training of young urban planners,

126
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:09,412
and also at the same time all these people
will be those who in five, ten years,

127
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:15,066
will still have to enforce this urban plan, 
this planning.

128
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:18,848
And it's for this reason that they must 
be quickly, very quickly integrated

129
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:21,905
in the process, rather working 
in workshops,

130
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:25,580
and above all using all of 
the abilities of the people.

131
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,520
Each person, each land planner,
geographer, political,

132
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,544
each citizen even has a number

133
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:37,610
of competences, knows the land, 
knows the problems that occur.

134
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,336
And the idea for us is to put all of this 
in common and have a situation,

135
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:49,368
a diagnosis, a quick basic image which 
may be validated by all and amongst all.

136
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:54,080
There you have it, the end of our case study 
of the city of N'Djamena.
