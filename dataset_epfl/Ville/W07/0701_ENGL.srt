1
00:00:00,639 --> 00:00:01,323
Hello.

2
00:00:01,323 --> 00:00:04,998
We are going to talk about

3
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:11,106
Land Use Planning Tools, more precisely, 
urban development operations.

4
00:00:11,106 --> 00:00:12,890
So before reviewing

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,427
the various operations, 
they serve above all

6
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:17,190
to maintain or welcome

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,720
new residents and new activities.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,802
So it's the objective of the game of 
an urban operation and also,

9
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:30,040
these urban operations help us to put in 
facilities and infrastructure.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,357
Thirdly, it also serves the purpose of

11
00:00:34,357 --> 00:00:38,020
preserving the heritage, 
or to showcase it.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,168
So there are different types of 
development operations,

13
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:48,350
urban restructuring, urban renovation, 
housing operations,

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,475
integrated land use planning operations,

15
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:58,720
major infrastructure projects, and 
finally, large housing programs.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,700
Urban renovation, these are land use 
planning actions in sectors

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,310
which are unregulated sectors, on sectors
which are extremely deteriorated.

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,000
The most concrete example is

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,060
the slum, the restructuring of slums.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,377
So in general, the aim is the improvement 
of living conditions

21
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,288
and this goes through a number

22
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:25,780
of things, that may be in particular, 
real estate,

23
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,720
water supply, so the infrastructures 
and services.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,345
It's generally this we're going to 
work on,

25
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:33,960
real estate, infrastructures and services.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,260
Urban renovation is the action of 
land use planning

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,867
on a substandard sector, 
but it's eventually

28
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:46,121
its total or partial destruction in any case 
and its reconstruction.

29
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:49,476
So, in the renovation, we were working on 
what was existing,

30
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,490
here we destroy it to make something else.

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,230
Housing or large framework operations,

32
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,270
next week, we'll see a whole

33
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,511
course series on how to 
make a subdivision,

34
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:04,640
but it's really urban expansion
that we're talking about.

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,247
On greenfield land, we are going to create
a number of subdivisions

36
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:13,550
which are lots where there will be parcels
where people will be able to come settle.

37
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,001
It's without a doubt the urban operation

38
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:18,880
which is the most current today 
in African cities.

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,680
It's the least mediatised.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,750
Rather we're going to talk about renovation 
or urban restructuring,

41
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,870
but in terms of number of people 
who are going to settle,

42
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,679
in terms of surface area, these are 
the subdivisions

43
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:33,800
and the large frameworks which are 
the majority in African cities.

44
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,070
The African city today grows 
thanks to these subdivisions.

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,689
And all of the programs which are
good things,

46
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:45,145
the restructuring of neighborhoods that 
are unstable is only

47
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:47,660
a small part of the problem.

48
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,170
The big problem, we have had 
the statistics,

49
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,329
this volume of urban people that will come

50
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,538
in the next 10 years in the African cities,

51
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:59,607
they will settle in the outskirts, mostly
in the subdivisions.

52
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:04,995
So the concern of the subdivision in 
the African city today is essential.

53
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:09,030
There also exist the districts 
of special planning.

54
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,330
So generally it's when we have 
a property issue.

55
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,983
This is both the State and

56
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:17,975
the property owner who is a private entity
who play planner.

57
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:24,278
There is a dialogue between two 
to put land on the market.

58
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:26,668
It's generally when there are lands

59
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:30,566
which are claimed by the customs who made

60
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:34,294
this type of planning, where a part 
goes back

61
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:37,860
to customs and another is 
placed on the market.

62
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,973
It's a tool that is known in France, 
a tool which

63
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:48,090
is not used in all countries and which 
is relatively little used in Africa.

64
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,260
But we need to know that this tool 
clearly exists

65
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,586
and that it's one of the possibilities 
to do the planning with this strategy.

66
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:02,230
The big infrastructure projects, therefore
the most classical, are water

67
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:08,425
electricity, but also 
transport networks,

68
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:13,370
large transport infrastructures: roads,
highways or public transport.

69
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,670
This gives the city a superstructure.

70
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,266
but the effect on the neighborhoods 
is quite visible.

71
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:22,247
When you draw a highway 
in a neighborhood

72
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:25,360
inevitably, we will separate 
the neighborhood in two.

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,770
But it's generally projects which are 
structuring for the city.

74
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,545
So the impact of infrastructure is huge, 
both in macro terms

75
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:38,965
for the whole city, as well as micro terms
in the neighborhood.

76
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,656
So we really must pay attention to

77
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,560
these large infrastructure projects, and 
and we must do so very clearly,

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,810
in an organized manner to know 
how we are going to succeed

79
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,564
in integrating the new infrastructures 
in the city.

80
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:55,832
How we are going to succeed in integrating
them but also

81
00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:59,650
what are we going to get out of it,

82
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,550
because the objective is to be able 
to use the structuring effect of

83
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,240
the infrastructure to drive 
urban development.

84
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,697
Finally, the large housing projects.

85
00:05:10,697 --> 00:05:12,710
We are straddling urban 
development operations

86
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,630
and public policy, urban policy.

87
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,393
In general, the objective is to offer 
a roof to the greatest number.

88
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:24,385
So we are going to make housing programs,
and we can be dealing with

89
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:27,675
specific parcels, some parcels,

90
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:30,375
or on the contrary with the whole city.

91
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,122
Here we are dealing more with,

92
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:34,680
no longer land use planning 
but public policy.

93
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,515
The large housing programs, 
they have had

94
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:39,910
hour of glory some decades ago.

95
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,474
Donors, including World Bank 
have invested heavily

96
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:48,130
housing before completely stopping
and doing only the stable parcel.

97
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,330
Today we are slowly coming back 
to these large housing programs

98
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,695
because we realize that beyond property,

99
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:59,254
we must also give a roof to the most 
vulnerable populations,

100
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:02,830
and it's through these large housing 
programs that it will happen.

101
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,458
So there is a consequence to all of this.

102
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,848
When there are the big events, 
let's say, Brazil, in Rio

103
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:14,780
in particular, with the World Cup and 
the Olympic games that will follow.

104
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,070
But also, when we create
large infrastructures.

105
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,079
When we create these 
large infrastructures,

106
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,812
this creates, or we want to 
create property appreciation,

107
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:27,452
or we do urban renovation,

108
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:31,924
all these phenomenons have a 
common point, these are the evictions.

109
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,814
This means that to build a new stadium

110
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:37,790
in Pekin, thousands of people
had to be displaced.

111
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,013
In order to build a highway in Dhakar,

112
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:42,578
it wasn't thousands but rather hundreds

113
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:45,371
of people that had to be displaced,
since they had

114
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,390
their housing exactly on
the highway layout.

115
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,070
This means that when we put in place

116
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,694
an infrastructure, this creates
property appreciation.

117
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:55,318
The more public transportation
in the center

118
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:57,942
of cities, the more the property price 
will increase

119
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:00,726
and the more the poorest populations
will no longer have

120
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:03,420
the means to pay their rent 
that will have increased.

121
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,300
So the property appreciation, 
the mechanisms that

122
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,650
are behind this eventually 
create evictions.

123
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,935
So in the first case mentioned, 
it is the State who is going to

124
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:16,239
displace the people, they're going to 
take them and displace them.

125
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:20,635
In the case of the property appreciation,
it is not necessarily in the same case.

126
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:23,110
It is the market which, in the end, 
will make it so that people

127
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,510
are going to have leave by themselves, 
but it's also a case of eviction.

128
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,470
The last case, urban renovaction.

129
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,350
We easily understand that in
urban renovation, there is

130
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,890
a part which is destroyed in order to be 
rebuilt, and often,

131
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,790
it is not built by the same standards, 
by the same norms,

132
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:46,164
and the housing size is increased, 
the construction standards.

133
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:49,062
So that they are not the same populations 
who used to live there

134
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:54,206
before and who will be able to live there
after, and this creates evictions.

135
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:59,507
There you have a quick description of 
some of the most classical urban

136
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:04,808
development operations, with their 
consequences always being evictions.

137
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:07,038
So it's important to question before

138
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,468
creating these large operations, 
what this means

139
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:13,298
in human cost, in evictions, to know if

140
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:16,070
you are going to displace 
many people or not.

141
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,062
Zero eviction is rarely possible, 
but we should,

142
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:26,120
little by little, extend towards 
this objective.

143
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,826
There is sometimes the impossibility 
of extending towards this objective,

144
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:32,389
since we have to, for the whole city,

145
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:36,044
and all of the people, carry out 
a number of infrastructures

146
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:39,890
in particular and we cannot simply 
avoid the dwellings.

147
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,702
However between, I'm going to 
displace everyone

148
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:46,780
and no one, there must be 
a way which is

149
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,487
the best possible for all of the residents
of the city and above all

150
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:55,750
for the residents of neighborhoods which 
are supposed to be the ones displaced.
