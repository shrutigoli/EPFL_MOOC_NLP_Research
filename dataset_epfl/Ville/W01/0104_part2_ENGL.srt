1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,050
If we further study the migration issue

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,170
with the migrants being the labour force 
of an African city nowadays,

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,666
then when we talk about migration,

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,867
the repulsion and the attraction issues
come up at the same time.

5
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:22,641
The cities are attractive,

6
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:26,019
but because of the rural areas,
people feel forced

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,725
to migrate to cities. Why?

8
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:31,219
Because most of the rural areas

9
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:34,430
cannot meet the needs 
of the entire population.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,712
Conversely, there is also a strong attraction

11
00:00:36,712 --> 00:00:39,550
to the city, where it feels,

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,754
often rightly,

13
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:45,024
that it is easier to find a job.

14
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:50,186
So it is a game between
being attracted by the city

15
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:54,420
and being pushed out of the rural areas.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,300
It is absolutely clear

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,342
that one of the main reasons for migration

18
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:02,843
is to find better living conditions,

19
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:05,670
a job more easily and
the concentration of people,

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,675
as they are the driving forces 
of urbanisation.

21
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:14,760
Precisely, one of the main features

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,220
is that the network is larger,
the networks are numerous

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,950
and the job opportunities will increase

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,830
in the city compared to the countryside.

25
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,211
Next comes the informality issue.

26
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:30,610
It is one of the features 
of the African cities.

27
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:36,570
It means that in most cities,
a part of the economy, if not all,

28
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,701
happens through an informal channel,

29
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:43,410
out of the regulations, out of the laws,

30
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,820
meant to formalise all the activities.

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,540
So by dint of informalities,

32
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,760
the border between formal and informal

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,608
narrows and we are not sure if we are
in the formal or informal anymore.

34
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:05,165
It also means that in African cities,
the informal becomes the rule.

35
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:09,584
So the question here is:

36
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:13,612
should we continue to act
as it has been until now,

37
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:18,087
trying to formalise the informal,
or should we use the informal

38
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:20,834
as a new paradigm,

39
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:26,030
and to rebuild an urban management
to plan on existing mecanisms

40
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,516
There are two main groups of actors:

41
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:33,660
the institutional actors
and the private sector.

42
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,820
Within the institutional actors

43
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,358
there will be the national level 
with the ministries

44
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,900
and the organisations under supervision,

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,930
and the local level with municipalities
or local councils.

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,520
Within the private sector, 
there is the formal or associative sector:

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,860
companies, NGOs, development partners

48
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,570
and the informal sector issue:

49
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,230
the community of poor people,
the ordinary people,

50
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,400
the people living in the cities.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,212
Some can be active on the informal level,

52
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:08,769
trying to be organised,
but always in an informal way.

53
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:11,901
This is roughly what the actors do.

54
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:14,944
There can be additional layers,

55
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:19,022
some relations can be very close

56
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:21,710
between development partners

57
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,240
and organisations under supervision.

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,859
So between the private sector
and the institutional actors,

59
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:33,490
but it is the basic pattern
of the actors in development.

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,656
The issue of urban macrocephaly
is the basic pattern we have.

61
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:42,282
In general, there is 
one big city per country.

62
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:46,155
It is the case in Dakar, Conakry or Nouakchott,

63
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:48,468
or Tunis as well,

64
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:51,816
where the majority of urban people
live in this big city.

65
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:55,337
There is also a bicephalic phenomenon,

66
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:57,717
so we drift apart from the macrocephaly.

67
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:01,024
For example in Douala-YaoundÃ©.

68
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:06,367
Or, we have networks of cities
like in South Africa, in Nigeria.

69
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:11,540
Or booming of a region or urban continuum,

70
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,933
for example in Nigeria, but also

71
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:20,030
in the whole region 
between Lagos and Cotonou.

72
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,228
So the basic pattern
stating a macrocephaly

73
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:28,697
does exist in many countries,

74
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:35,675
it exists in Bamako, Mali, however,
the number of exceptions is so high

75
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:40,540
that we cannot make a generalisation
for urban macrocephaly.

76
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,568
Finally, talking about characteristics, 
we must talk about the colonial heritage.

77
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:50,984
All African cities are not colonial cities,

78
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:54,822
but most of the cities we discuss today,

79
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:57,818
the big capitals have a colonial past.

80
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,110
A colonial city is a dual city,

81
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,102
between the city centre 
and outlying districts,

82
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:07,450
between the administrative 
centre for elites

83
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,802
and outlying districts,
mostly for working class people.

84
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:16,226
Currently, we see that the first sketches
of the colonial city

85
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:21,559
still have an influence today
on future plans.

86
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:26,973
The features of the colonial city
were actually quite simple.

87
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:32,080
There was a strict zoning between
working class and indigenous areas

88
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,160
and the city centre
reserved to the elites.

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,690
The state had control 
over real estate.

90
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,530
Most of the lands belong to the state.

91
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,060
Then would come the housing scheme,

92
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,938
the favourite tool in urbanism
as we would proceed in the same way,

93
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,754
one residential area after another.

94
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:02,848
Today, the same process applies

95
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:05,494
despite the planning guidelines

96
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:08,160
and all strategy plans for development.

97
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,540
We must admit that the African city,

98
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,403
as we will see on week eight,

99
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:18,170
grows through its housing schemes.

100
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,410
So the challenge is peripheral,

101
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,380
and it also depends on the competence

102
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,180
of the city planners to create spatiality 
in the housing schemes,

103
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,836
since the key for tomorrow's city

104
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:35,270
lays in the outskirts,
in the future residential areas.

105
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,205
To conclude this overview
of the African cities

106
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:41,529
and what characterises them,

107
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,560
let's talk about the "urban crisis".

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,220
The urban crisis is a rupture
in a certain number of regulations.

109
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,810
First, the spatial burst.

110
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,370
The city's surface grows

111
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,511
much faster than its population.

112
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:04,240
Even if the population growth
is sustained,

113
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,114
the spatial burst,
the area covered by the city

114
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:12,550
is much bigger 
and there is a disconnection

115
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,900
between space and the number of people.

116
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,771
There is a financial crisis

117
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,149
in countries undertaking 
structural adjustments.

118
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,700
That was a requirement 
from the World Bank back then.

119
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,076
So there is an obvious incidence

120
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,810
in the spatiality of the cities.

121
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,130
There is also a real estate crisis,

122
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,870
between modern management

123
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,880
and more traditional management.

124
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,662
Finally, the state has taken 
some land back

125
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:49,424
in the formality process,
and there are the customary claims.

126
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:53,234
There is a back and forth between
the customary lands

127
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:56,300
and the state lands.

128
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,817
The prices collapse

129
00:07:59,817 --> 00:08:04,556
and a scarcity of external sources arises.

130
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:07,394
So what was being sold at a high cost

131
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:10,866
on the foreign market will collapse.

132
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,115
This is the case of the Ivory Coast
in the eighties.

133
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:18,215
And finally the financial godsend
will stop coming in

134
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:22,735
and will cause the failure 
of many urban policies,

135
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:27,034
especially housing policies

136
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:31,190
where funding did not follow 
the implemented policy.

137
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,672
All this adding to 
the infrastructure crisis,

138
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:37,970
where we saw the importance
of the spatial burst.

139
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:44,260
There is again a disconnection between
the capacity of infrastructure,

140
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,550
to produce a network and the surface area,
as well as the number of people.

141
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,599
Eventually, all these ingredients
make the recipe for disaster

142
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,945
and the urban crisis arises.

143
00:08:56,945 --> 00:09:01,200
This is what we have
in nearly all African cities.

144
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:07,165
We have not talked about 
the historical question,

145
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:09,545
the pre-colonial issue, of course.

146
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:15,310
We cannot pretend that cities
did not exist before the colonial period.

147
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,285
What we are covering here is mainly

148
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:21,458
the colonial cities,
as they are the ones

149
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,226
that will become the big capitals.

150
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:27,178
It is the majority of the cities

151
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:30,658
that we will study for a few weeks.

152
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:35,140
But keep in mind that
there was a strong urban network,

153
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,048
especially in Nigeria,

154
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:40,630
before the colonial period,
and we talked about

155
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,970
the cities in the Maghreb
that have existed since Antiquity.

156
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,125
There are multiple examples.

157
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,520
Instead of looking at some features,

158
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,606
we could also have considered the city

159
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:59,144
with a historical vision
and its evolution through time.

160
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:03,100
We will also list some publications
and texts in the bibliography

161
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,883
that will help you study further,

162
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:08,238
as we have very little time

163
