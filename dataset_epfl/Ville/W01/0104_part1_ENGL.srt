1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,805
Today we will talk about African cities,

2
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:13,550
from urbanisation to the city, the forms 
of urbanisation to the forms of cities.

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,401
Why African cities?

4
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,237
You will notice that the lesson

5
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:20,070
is called African cities
and not African city,

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,040
simply because there is not only
one type of city, or one city

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,116
that we would find from the Maghreb

8
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:30,950
to South Africa, but multiple ones.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,356
What is interesting is to see 
the common points

10
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:37,831
between the cities which 
could represent a category,

11
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:40,960
the category of African cities.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,136
So let's study these African cities

13
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:47,695
and some geographical features.

14
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:52,351
First, two thirds of them

15
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:54,908
are coastal cities.

16
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:57,976
So they are close to the sea.

17
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:02,308
Therefore, we will mainly 
study port cities.

18
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:06,130
Then, three spatial groups.

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,613
The first one is the North African cities,

20
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:16,189
the Arab-Muslim cities, 
from Casablanca to Cairo.

21
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,112
They are quite ancient cities

22
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:21,830
as most of them 
have existed since Antiquity.

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,972
So not colonial cities,

24
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:27,152
even though they all have a colonial past,

25
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:30,224
but they are cities that were built

26
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,715
before the colonial time.

27
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:36,790
The second spatial group

28
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,356
is what can be called the cities
of the Gulf of Guinea,

29
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:44,330
in a broad sense, they are the cities

30
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:51,010
from Dakar to maybe Cameroon 
or even to Congo.

31
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:56,652
However it is a group and it is probably
the most inhabited in Africa.

32
00:01:56,652 --> 00:02:02,979
The third big group, 
which is of Dutch or English origin

33
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:05,729
is the South African cities,

34
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,687
namely at the southern point of Africa.

35
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:13,857
Today, some big cities are growing.

36
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:19,410
Some count on this front here

37
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,050
where there would be a new configuration
with new cities growing.

38
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,780
But for now, we will consider only

39
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,380
the three major groups we just named.

40
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,910
Another feature is the emptiness
of the continent.

41
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,300
Beyond the big cities we just saw,

42
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,769
there is more or less a continent
relatively free and it is fine

43
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:51,255
because we get into the Sahara,

44
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:55,710
the Sahel, the Kalahari or Namib deserts.

45
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,140
However we realise that

46
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,720
the structure itself of the cities
is coastal and not continental.

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,278
This stems also from 
the historical heritage

48
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:11,424
which is the colonial conquest 
that implemented in priority

49
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,570
port cities with railway

50
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,716
going further into the lands

51
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:23,991
in order to bring the raw materials

52
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:28,266
to Europe via the ports.

53
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:32,542
So, except a handful of cities
which have become capital cities,

54
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:36,570
the cities with no access to the sea 
and the secluded areas,

55
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,922
if we want to characterise, we can say

56
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:44,460
that the continent is completely empty

57
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,613
while the cities break down
all around the shoreline.

58
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:54,756
Initially, there are some forms 
of urbanisation growing into cities

59
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:58,910
or starting from the city 
to the form of urbanisation.

60
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,991
Today, we can say in short, even though

61
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:05,700
there are always exceptions

62
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,958
and some regional subtleties,

63
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,876
but, roughly, either we have isolated cities

64
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:18,420
or mega-regions, or lanes, 
or city-regions.

65
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,845
Meaning that apart from the isolated city,

66
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,532
the other cities are not isolated, 
but included in a network

67
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:30,132
with other cities or regions

68
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:34,415
to shape a huge region, a city-region.

69
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:38,585
Or as in some parts, like South Africa

70
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:41,979
or Nigeria, we find lanes,

71
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:46,037
which are a sort of succesion of cities

72
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:49,875
spread across 
the channels of communication,

73
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,568
sometimes the railway,
but generally the road,

74
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:59,650
being the main means of transport
or mobility between the cities.

75
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,910
The question concerns 
the driving forces of urbanisation.

76
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,942
What are the forces allowing 
this urbanisation

77
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:12,030
and ultimately our African cities to develop?

78
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,220
There are several forces.

79
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,232
First, we have what we call the "inputs".

80
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:23,048
What are the inputs?

81
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:24,746
The inputs are materials,

82
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:27,868
work force, transports, services,

83
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:32,730
water and power facilities.

84
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,590
It is everything coming into the city.

85
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:43,006
One of the driving forces
is the concentration of inputs.

86
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:47,270
Simultaneously, it is the market.

87
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,062
This means that cities gather people

88
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:58,056
who are consumers, so there is
a concentration of consumers in cities

89
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:02,525
which enables their development

90
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:05,710
and therefore represents 
urbanisation driving forces.

91
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,868
Next, between inputs and market,

92
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:14,371
we have service proximity,

93
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:18,874
by default compared to the countryside,

94
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:23,948
where business and administrative activities

95
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:26,245
are much larger.

96
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:31,234
Then, the possibilities are also much larger,

97
00:06:31,234 --> 00:06:37,270
we call them "network" or "networks"

98
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,250
in this case as they are numerous,
and they can be social or commercial,

99
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,686
but we have at the same time 
a proximity of the services

100
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:48,104
and a possibility of networking,

101
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:50,350
the inputs as well as the market

102
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,278
to sell the inputs.

103
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:56,591
There is a sort of symetry

104
00:06:56,591 --> 00:07:02,025
between producers and consumers,
between sellers and buyers,

105
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:04,506
but all this is happening within the city

106
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:08,640
and all this enables, 
unlike the countryside,

107
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,110
the development of urban areas.

108
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,334
Now, let's see some of the features.

109
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,140
We covered the stakes and the challenges

110
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,650
regarding urbanisation,

111
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,010
and can be true beyond 
the African borders.

112
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,140
Today, we will see the features
of these African cities.

113
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,651
Even if they are many,

114
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:38,022
we can assume that there is an entity

115
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:40,104
or an identity of the African city

116
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:43,350
and we will study some of its features.

117
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:48,189
These are non-exhaustively,
migration issues,

118
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:50,565
the labour forces of the cities,

119
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:54,650
the informality issue,

120
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,232
the actors, the same ones
we find almost everywhere;

121
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:04,611
we also have the feature
of urban macrocephaly,

122
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:09,300
which is a geographical criterion

123
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,135
and a little more complicated
than what we usually hear about it,

124
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:19,100
and finally we will talk about
the colonial heritage of these cities.
