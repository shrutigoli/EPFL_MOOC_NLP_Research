1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,915
The high growth rates

2
00:00:03,915 --> 00:00:08,000
that we see in the southern countries

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,110
are generally accompanied 
by a strong migration

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,219
of the inhabitants living in rural areas 
toward urban ones.

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:25,640
A correlation exists between poverty 
and the proportion of rural populations,

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,840
and the speed of urbanization.
The longer I am in a poor country,

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:40,350
the more rural the country is, 
the higher the urbanization rate.

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,504
This rapid urbanization in 
the South, that we find mainly

9
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:50,964
in the South, as we said, is going to 
create a certain number of problems

10
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:55,375
that we can list, and in particular,

11
00:00:55,375 --> 00:01:00,450
the environmental degradation,

12
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,048
widespread informality,

13
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:10,572
an extremely strong spatial segregation

14
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:16,090
that leads to a fragmentation 
of the territories,

15
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,530
public politics that we could qualify

16
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:28,044
as ineffective, a lack 
of correlation at once

17
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:34,214
between city-dwellers' needs 
and infrastructures,

18
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:40,680
and a weakly redistributive economy,

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,470
which is to say that it is an 
economy that cannot

20
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,260
reach all the population strata.

21
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,700
We can view this urbanization in a 
negative way, which is

22
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:01,140
what we just did by listing like that 
all its main problems,

23
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,935
but we can also, today, the benefits

24
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:08,887
of urbanization, the potential

25
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:12,905
that can be found behind 
this rapid urbanization.

26
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:18,360
One of the first aspects, is the question 
of population concentration.

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,282
Which is to say that it opens 
a range of possibilities, provides

28
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:26,356
opportunities to find a job,
to do business.

29
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:31,540
The more people, the more shoppers, 
the wider the catchment area,

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,376
the more commercial possibilities.

31
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:36,436
Which doesn't mean that 
it is always possible,

32
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:41,310
but we increase the chances 
of being to do business.

33
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,596
Another thing we see in these questions
of rapid and accelerated

34
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:51,666
urbanization, is that public powers 
don't always follow,

35
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:57,465
and new forms of democracies 
develop, here and there,

36
00:02:57,465 --> 00:03:02,920
participatory democracies that can
lead to participatory budgets.

37
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,683
Another important potential of
urbanization, is that,

38
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:16,165
even if the people's needs 
are much greater than

39
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:20,175
the infrastructures at their 
disposal in the city,

40
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:23,031
in relation to those in rural 
areas, these proportions

41
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:24,700
are extremely important.

42
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,760
That means that, even if it is lacking
infrastructures, these are

43
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,117
eminently greater than those in rural areas

44
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:34,151
which gives a definite advantage, an

45
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:38,798
incredible potential of city versus country.

46
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:43,525
We can then imagine, 
as well, that some forms

47
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:48,140
of decentralization, which accompany 
these urbanization processes,

48
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,790
may eventually offer some 
significant results.

49
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,430
So, for now, it is wishful thinking

50
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,098
that the decentralization would effectively

51
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:03,716
be put in place in all countries, giving

52
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:08,000
public authorities managerial autonomy.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,210
And even if we have this, from a

54
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,739
legal standpoint, these communities 
have the responsibilities

55
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,579
but not the means to implement
such reponsibilities.

56
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,728
So there are, for now, very few cities,
very few countries, that have

57
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:27,698
really implemented the 
decentralization process.

58
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:30,927
The last important potential point of

59
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:35,380
urbanization is the question of informality.

60
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,250
We have seen it just now as a negative

61
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,288
but informality can also be seen

62
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:46,521
as an extremely positive given, because

63
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:50,615
at the end of the day, it is a type 
of redistribution of an

64
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:53,405
economy, a way to manage

65
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:55,517
a territory, a city, which

66
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:58,746
are extremely different within 
a formal framework, but

67
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:01,484
which hold within them, 
equally, a potential

68
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:05,390
that is extremely important and
extremely interesting.

69
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,962
And without a doubt, we should 
move much further

70
00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:13,014
in the analysis of informality 
to see how it is distilled

71
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:17,184
almost everywhere, that it is not only
the prerogative of the poorest,

72
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:20,310
but that we also find them in every
population strata.

73
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,960
Our recent studies even showed
exactly the contrary, which is,

74
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,134
finally, that informality is confined

75
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:30,470
to the richest, who can do without

76
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:36,572
laws, while the poorest, still 
demand their right to

77
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:43,320
a legal framework and the security
that this legal framework can provide.

78
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,706
Here we have, in a few words, outlined
the questions of urbanization

79
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:53,120
in the world, the questions of urbanization 
in Africa, with some points.

80
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,685
We must take away from this 
one important thing,

81
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:59,199
which is that we have contexts that

82
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,919
are extremely different, both 
between continents, and even

83
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,956
within the African continent; 
between East Africa

84
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:08,293
and North Africa we have trends

85
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:10,646
in urbanization that are not at all

86
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:14,624
the same, and even within 
these different regions,

87
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,410
geographical subregions in Africa, 
we have countries that

88
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,906
are not similar, and within
these countries

89
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,978
we have extremely urban regions,

90
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:28,480
and extremely rural regions.

91
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,309
So, we have to be wary 
of big numbers,

92
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:35,252
which offer indications, but we must
then reach down to the level

93
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:38,570
of the city, to the level of the 
region, to truly understand

94
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:44,370
and identify the mechanisms 
underlying this urbanization.
