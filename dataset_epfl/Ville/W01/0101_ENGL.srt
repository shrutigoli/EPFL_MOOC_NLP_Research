00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,747
Hello.

2
00:00:00,747 --> 00:00:06,391
First video of our first week 
of the course, the first video in a long

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:08,508
series that will bring us, during

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,800
twelve weeks, to explore African cities.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,720
We begin the course, this week, with Mali.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,731
Welcome to the participants of Bamako. 
To begin,

7
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:31,471
first off, some figures on the 
urban population of the world.

8
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:37,300
Today, in the world, we have more than 
50% of people that are urban dwellers.

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,590
But, pay particular attention, 
it's a statistic reality that

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,457
is not the same on all continents.

11
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:49,515
And particularly, the African continent is
one of the least urbanized continents

12
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:53,647
since the figures for 2011 give us less

13
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:58,029
than 40% of people in Africa who 
are urban dwellers.

14
00:00:58,029 --> 00:01:04,060
We must keep going down since, 
if we look by large African regions

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,590
we see that we have notable differences 
between East Africa

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,590
which is urbanized at 23.7% 
and North Africa which is

17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,100
at more than 50%.

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,936
So, there also, we have enormous disparities 
and if we take examples

19
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:26,116
of countries we come across Ethiopia, 
17%, while the Ivory Coast

20
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:31,477
is at more than 50, like all the 
countries of North Africa.

21
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:33,930
So we see that, behind 
this figure of 50%

22
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,720
we have realities that are extremely 
different and differentiated.

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,886
Before we

24
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:45,699
jump in, week after week, in the detailed 
content of the

25
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:51,315
course, we are going to show major challenges of 
urbanization in Africa.

26
00:01:51,315 --> 00:01:55,104
We will try to give some answers.

27
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:59,770
We will address the issue 
of population increase.

28
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,768
We will address the question of

29
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:06,680
economic development, urbanization 
versus development.

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,470
We will address, of course, the issue of 
climate change.

31
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,970
We will also address the question 
of urban periphery.

32
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,950
And finally, we will address the question of 
generalized mobility.

33
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,268
So we have, at the same time, 
an urgency since the

34
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:31,685
number of people is increasing extremely 
rapidly, so we must

35
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:35,780
confront this development, 
this evolution of the

36
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,290
population, and then, at the same time,

37
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,956
another challenge is that 
we find ourselves

38
00:02:41,956 --> 00:02:46,263
in the situation of an urbanization without 
necessarily an economic development.

39
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:51,376
We know that the model of European cities, 
particularly, whether in

40
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,719
the secondary or tertiary, we know

41
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,914
that the development of 
the urbanization happened

42
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:58,961
with an economic development.

43
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:02,300
We find ourselves, in a 
number of African cities,

44
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,436
there are of course exceptions, 
all the cities

45
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:08,292
are not the same, but we have

46
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:09,867
figures where we can find

47
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:13,530
an urbanization without any 
economic development.

48
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,910
The next challenge, the question 
of climate change.

49
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:22,286
Very in fashion, certainly, but it means 
that at the environmental level,

50
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:27,232
at the climate level, we have major
changes that are expected

51
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:31,778
and so, the cities will have to either 
confront these changes or not.

52
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,917
But it's a new challenge, and it's
without a doubt

53
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:38,920
one of the most important challenges
today for the African city.

54
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,590
A little quiz before we continue.

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,429
How many more people will live in 
African cities in the

56
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:52,413
next 20 years? Answer one, 
answer two, answer three.

57
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:56,850
Answer one, 250 million

58
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,850
more urban dwellers. 
Answer two, 150 million.

59
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,774
And answer three, 400 million.

60
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:13,370
Well done, the answer

61
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,060
is 250 million. Indeed, there are now approximately,

62
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,970
in 2011, 610 million urban dwellers, in 2035

63
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,526
there will be 250 million

64
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:33,660
more, approximately 860 million urban 
dwellers in all of Africa.

65
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,610
Why this question?

66
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:45,973
This means that the challenge of 
urban peripheries will be great since

67
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:51,934
these extra 250 million city dwellers, 
in the next couple of years,

68
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:57,446
will not all live in the city center, will not 
all increase the density in the city

69
00:04:57,446 --> 00:05:03,722
but they will continue to make the city 
less dense, will continue to spread out

70
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:09,860
more and more in the peripheries. 
And so the challenge is great.

71
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,786
Finally, the last challenge which we

72
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:16,480
must confront, will be the issue 
of generalized mobility.

73
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,680
Actually, increasingly, people are

74
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,614
mobile, people move and that poses

75
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,500
a certain number of questions, 
we are not going to say

76
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,095
problems but rather questions 
about the way in which

77
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,990
we are going to plan the city 
in the years to come.

78
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:39,921
There you have it, we are wrapping up our 
short introduction by a view of Brazzaville.

79
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:43,383
I leave you to get familiar with the program

80
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:45,950
in the next 12 weeks on the Coursera website.

81
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,550
And as for me, I'll see you in 
next video.
