1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,634
Urbanization is a process of 
multidimensional changes

2
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:12,750
and centuries-old continuums which 
affect the world even today.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,715
Why multidimensional?

4
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,338
Because the changes are at once

5
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:18,750
spatial, demographic, economic,

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,416
cultural or even infracultural.

7
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:25,870
In the chart on the right we can 
see the rates of urbanization.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,808
For all countries, we can begin

9
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:30,574
with the middle column, the 
one which most interests us

10
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:35,580
because it shows the current situation,
even though it dates back to 2010.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,050
In the entire world we are 
approximately 52% urban.

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,790
This means that one of every two people 
who lives on the Earth lives in a city.

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,312
Africa and Asia are two continents 
with extremely low levels

14
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:55,464
of urbanization, a bit behind 
when compared to others.

15
00:00:55,464 --> 00:00:59,530
And the least developed countries are 
also those which are least urbanized.

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:06,726
On the contrary, Europe, whose urbanization 
process is several centuries old,

17
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:12,040
is urbanized to an impressive degree.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,405
So, this urbanization has not 
played itself out

19
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:16,780
uniformly across the planet.

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,306
We have selected some images,

21
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:24,560
all African, to show how we have

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,355
extremely different contexts 
if we are in the North or South

23
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,860
of the Sahara, if we are in 
the Sahel or the tropics,

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,000
in Southern Africa or in Equatorial Africa.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,075
So, when we talk of the process of

26
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:42,015
urbanization, we have the impression of

27
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:46,047
a sort of groundswell which is 
the same everywhere, so we must

28
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:48,533
take into account the fact that

29
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:51,899
we have extremely different contexts.

30
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,952
So, any gathering of data, by region,

31
00:01:54,952 --> 00:01:59,558
by continent, reveals realities 
which are extremely differentiated

32
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,510
within each country, even within

33
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,250
each of the regions within 
the different countries.

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,990
We can see, if we look again at the chart

35
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,192
in a slightly different way,

36
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:14,040
the percentages of urban 
populations in 2011.

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,516
We can see that we have,
in North America,

38
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:21,919
in Europe and in Latin America,

39
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,782
very high levels, since here,
in North America, we are

40
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:32,815
at slightly more than 80%.

41
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:39,260
If we look at the four largest continents: 
Oceania, North America,

42
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,850
Latin America and Europe, we are, 
in all cases, at over 70%.

43
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,290
Looking at the whole world, 
the limit is a bit over 50%.

44
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,599
And then, in Asia and Africa, we see that,

45
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,897
even if Asia slightly 
surpasses Africa, one is,

46
00:02:57,897 --> 00:03:03,360
roughly speaking, at less 
than 50%, closer to 40% for Africa,

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
and globally 45% for Asia.

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,246
Let's look now at a few numbers 
specific to Africa, from 2010.

49
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:18,380
Using the classical division of Africa into
East, Central, North, South and West,

50
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,090
we have a population of 
slightly more than a billion.

51
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,922
And of that billion, 413 million, 
or 40%, are urban.

52
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:35,590
We can also see that between 
a very slightly urbanized East Africa,

53
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,640
and an extremely urbanized South,

54
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,760
there are enormous 
regional disparities.

55
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,358
Finally, we find North Africa nearing

56
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,150
the world's average.

57
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,935
Still, the rate of urbanization 
as it relates to global rates.

58
00:03:57,935 --> 00:04:01,385
So here we are at 
this column, here.

59
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:07,320
We have seen it surpass 50%, 
to 52%, and then

60
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,695
in the future--these are, of course, 
projections--by 2050 it should be

61
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:18,430
around 70%. So, it continues 
with a curve like this,

62
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:24,203
and the rate of urbanization should not 
weaken but instead continue.

63
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:28,970
In Africa, we are at about 40%, here.

64
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:35,232
We begin very, very low, and 
then we must catch up slowly.

65
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:38,780
In other words the 
differential, in 2050,

66
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,542
will be clearly less significant 
than in 1950. So, in one century

67
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:50,456
the gap between the world average and 
the African average has been reduced.

68
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:57,340
This means that there will be an accelerated 
process of urbanization in Africa.

69
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,536
The rates of urbanization, once again 
by region, in function of years.

70
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:07,599
If we look at the 1970's, we can see

71
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:12,950
besides Southern Africa, already 
rather strongly urbanized,

72
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,965
based on it having a higher 
percentage, in 1970,

73
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:20,990
than the combined percentages 
of all of the rest of Africa in 2010.

74
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,214
The others, East Africa, 
for example, which has a

75
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:30,131
very, very weak proportion, 
roughly averaging

76
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:35,281
at around 20-plus percent in 1970.

77
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:40,712
In 2000, things are very different.
This is the current situation,

78
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:47,386
with Africa at 40% and with relatively

79
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:51,450
proportional growth, more or less, 
across all regions.

80
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,082
The projections for 2050,

81
00:05:54,082 --> 00:06:01,130
this time at 61.6%--this based 
on the data of 2009

82
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:08,170
projected against 2050, but one 
can see that it will be close--

83
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:14,160
besides East Africa which 
will not have caught up,

84
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,040
but will be around 60-70% 
of the territorial group.

85
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,300
The annual growth rate
is extremely important.

86
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,672
We can see this rate at 6%

87
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:38,050
in 1965, 1970, in East 
and Central Africa,

88
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,460
and these rates will shoot up 
rather spectacularly.

89
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,568
If we look at the whole of Africa,

90
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:50,962
we begin with a rate of 
4.65, which falls

91
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:56,170
as low as 2.15. This number 
is where we end up.

92
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,874
This is to say that the growth rate

93
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:05,100
is increasingly weakened 
and will weaken further.

94
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,142
By comparison, today 
we find ourselves,

95
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:19,512
at roughly 3.31, which is 
an extremely elevated rate

96
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:21,750
in relation to those one might find

97
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,180
in Europe, where the 
rate is well below 1%.

98
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,826
Another phenomenon, when it 
comes to the size of cities,

99
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:32,560
is that urbanization is not 
the same everywhere.

100
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,070
Look at the numbers from 2010 
for Sub-Saharan Africa.

101
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,441
Finally, for the whole of Africa 
we see more or less the same

102
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:44,355
proportions, were it not for the fact 
that instead of two agglomerations,

103
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:48,020
Lagos and Kinshasa, with more 
than 10 million inhabitants,

104
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,656
3 million for the whole of Africa,

105
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:52,848
there is Cairo, which has 
come into play.

106
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,808
What is interesting to see, is not

107
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:00,795
the different absolute numbers, 
this holds little interest for us,

108
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:06,090
but it is the percentages 
of urban population.

109
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,532
Which is to say that, 
today, in Africa,

110
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:15,073
57% of the population
---at least in 2010---

111
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:19,258
57% of the urban African 
population lives in cities of

112
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:22,810
fewer than 500,000 inhabitants, 
which we call intermediate cities.

113
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,968
Another very important number,

114
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:32,610
this 26%, which is to say that 
26% of the urban African

115
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,960
population lives in cities 
of 1-5 million inhabitants.

116
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,020
So, we can see very clearly

117
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,136
that between the two 
we have the whole,

118
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:49,320
the very, very large 
majority of urbanites,

119
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,730
and that the others 
are very residual numbers,

120
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,229
because one has 17% in 
other types of cities.

121
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:01,750
Therefore our task, as planners,

122
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,265
should be focused on, 
above everything else

123
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:07,548
these intermediate cities of 
fewer than 500,000 inhabitants,

124
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:11,536
so numerous that we have no 
data here, which is very important,

125
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:16,016
and the cities, which are often capitals, 
of between 1 and 5 million inhabitants.

126
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:18,464
It is within these two 
categories of cities

127
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:20,470
where the majority 
of urbanites reside.

128
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,805
Of course, in a very 
media-centered way,

129
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:30,675
the focus is on the group of cities of 
more than 10 million inhabitants.

130
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:37,078
We hear often of Kinshasa 
or Lagos, and also of Cairo,

131
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:43,031
but in terms of percentage of 
the urban African population

132
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:45,726
which actually resides there, 
this is relatively low.

133
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:52,270
So to effect change, it must 
be focused on those cities of

134
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:57,885
1-5 million inhabitants, and 
those of fewer than 500,000.

135
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:03,490
The urban population of 
Sub-Saharan Africa by city size.

136
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,140
It is the same schematic 
we just spoke of, except

137
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,694
we are using a temporal perspective,

138
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:19,080
between 1990 and 2025. We realize 
that in intermediate cities,

139
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,220
those with fewer than 
500,000 inhabitants,

140
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,750
their proportion, or let's say 
their relative importance

141
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:34,915
will clearly diminish, 
from 57% to 43%,

142
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:37,130
So this is where they 
become less important.

143
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,540
At the same time we find cities with 
more than 10 million inhabitants

144
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,604
where, still, there is great ambiguity 
because all it takes is to

145
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,903
add one city, and because 
we go from two to three,

146
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:52,050
the proportions increase,

147
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,325
and the numbers grow larger.

148
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:58,640
We can also see that 
in cities of 5-10 million,

149
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,950
all it takes is one city moving up a 
category and then we lose one.

150
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,690
This likewise diminishes the number 
of inhabitants from the next category.

151
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,810
So we can roughly say 
that it does not move much.

152
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,682
It will continue. Let's take 
for example the cities of

153
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:14,333
5-10 million or more, 
who will continue to

154
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:19,415
increase in size, little by little, 
gently, but with certainty.

155
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:23,804
So we have this curve. 
And then we realize that,

156
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:30,056
in the end it is within these 
cites of 1-5 million inhabitants

157
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:36,078
where the gap between 1990 
and 2025 will gradually increase.

158
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:42,114
It is within this category of cities, 
those with 1-5 million inhabitants

159
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:49,000
where we will see the greatest 
development of urbanization.

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,106
Another important element,

161
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:53,957
which we will look at 
in a moment is

162
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:58,418
how one looks, on a macro level, 
at numbers, at the great

163
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,150
trends of urbanization, 
without once mentioning

164
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,090
the living conditions in new 
and future urban centers.

165
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:11,025
To offer an example, in 1900--
no, excuse me, in 2000,

166
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:14,635
the UN-Habitat gave the figure 
that 32% of the world's population

167
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:19,813
lives in slums, within 
developing countries 43%,

168
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:24,890
and in the category of 
less-developed countries,

169
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:30,302
78% of inhabitants live in slums.

170
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:33,392
Therefore we have, at the 
same time, numbers which

171
00:12:33,392 --> 00:12:39,680
characterize world urbanization,
yet these numbers have

172
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,543
a very different meaning if one 
is in the South or the North.

173
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:47,577
And, as one can easily see 
and we'll discuss later,

174
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:52,835
one of the biggest problems of 
this urbanization is the increase

175
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:57,990
in slums and of the population 
who live in shacks.

176
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,562
Very good, this is the end of this first part.

177
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:05,680
I'll see you in the next video.
