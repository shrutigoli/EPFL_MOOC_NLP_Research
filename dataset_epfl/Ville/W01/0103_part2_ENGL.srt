1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,820
Planning is actually articulating

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,760
these different levels or thematics,
these levels of comprehension.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,554
In the end, their articulation 
makes the planning

4
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:24,600
effective or efficient, and little by little, we will
be able to make it sustainable.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,560
There are different kinds 
of planning tools.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,630
We use the most common ones.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,942
First, the orientation requirements.

8
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:38,074
This is what we call

9
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:44,116
"SDAU, PUR, SDU and PSU".

10
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:48,468
They are city planning 
and urbanism guidelines,

11
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:51,865
urban reference plans, master plans,

12
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,156
and urban development patterns.

13
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:57,088
So, all the denominations are possible,

14
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,490
but to sum up, we have two main types.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,068
The orientation requirements,

16
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:09,990
and requirements for land use,
which are applicable to third parties.

17
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,444
So, everything about orientation is
for the public institutions,

18
00:01:15,444 --> 00:01:18,210
but it's not legally enforceable
for the private sector.

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,255
We do hope these orientations 
are easy to understand.

20
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:24,175
And everything about land use requirements

21
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:27,880
is applicable to third parties,

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,617
so it is valid for both public 
and private sectors.

23
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:35,840
These are the housing scheme plans,
the area plans,

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,267
and the land use plans in general.

25
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,436
I mentioned the land use plans earlier

26
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:48,096
or simple housing development plans.

27
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:53,640
And between the two, we have a tool,
often ill-defined,

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,070
which could be the urban master plans,
or localized master plans.

29
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,346
They only exist in a few countries,

30
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:06,440
but we have, here, between them,

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,880
between the orientation,

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,310
and the land use requirements,
some tools.

33
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,740
We tend to develop these tools,
as we see the limitations

34
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,797
of the master plans and
of the land use plans.

35
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:23,500
So, we try to have between the two,

36
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,376
some documents that would be prescriptive,

37
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,520
and would give great orientations.

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,841
Tools for planning,

39
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:35,142
such as an SDAU or PUR,

40
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:38,264
what are their features ?

41
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:42,730
The first one should be flexibility.

42
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,070
So, the tool must be able
to evolve quickly.

43
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,410
But it is also a coordination tool.

44
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,170
It is a short-duration tool,

45
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,890
despite the long history of cities.

46
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,660
It should express

47
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,170
a common vision, and show as a priority

48
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,960
objectives with strong potential.

49
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,054
The main objectives, 
and the secondary ones--

50
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:15,026
we agree that the tool should 
in priority be based

51
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:17,730
on the objectives with strong potential.

52
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,422
We can imagine that the tool

53
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:25,580
is created in a very short 
analysing phase.

54
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,140
If the tool is made to last ten years,

55
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,769
and you take five or six years 
to set it up,

56
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,676
the data that you will have at that time 
will not be valid anymore.

57
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:36,896
And before being able to set it up,

58
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:39,270
you will have to update it again.

59
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:44,210
So, it is endless, which means
that it is more interesting for us

60
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,038
to make short-duration tools, 
which last ten years, like I said,

61
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:53,496
but that can be made in six months,
in a year or two.

62
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:55,910
If it is takes longer, 
the data are not valid

63
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,500
and it already needs updating.

64
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,010
The most important feature 
that we often forget,

65
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,309
is that the tool has to add up
to what already exists.

66
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:12,674
So as planners, there are things
that are bothering us,

67
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:15,121
things that we would like
to see elsewhere.

68
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,473
But we can't move them.

69
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:21,010
Some projects have already started

70
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,848
and we can't just erase them

71
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,447
like they don't exist.

72
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:31,078
So, we take them into account,

73
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:34,420
and we add our planning
to what already exists.

74
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,056
So, the objective of the tool

75
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,840
is to plan the key elements,

76
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,712
to give a reference
to the urban development

77
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:46,527
to limit the urban perimeter.

78
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:50,120
So, it is actually a choice of perimeter,

79
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,810
which might be secondary,

80
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,450
but that allows us to delimit 
the administrative territory of the city.

81
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,372
It usually tries to anticipate
the land reserves.

82
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:03,066
So we can underline the land question

83
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:06,576
as it is essential when planning

84
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:09,746
to offer a certain number of areas.

85
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:13,232
For example, if a chain of hotels

86
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:16,462
decides to build a hotel 
in an African city,

87
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:19,654
can I offer several possibilities of land

88
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:22,480
when I look into my plans?

89
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,256
The building of a new ministry is decided.

90
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:28,528
Is this building in my plans?

91
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,222
This is very basic and pragmatic.

92
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:35,530
But if we start analysing the existing plans,

93
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,650
we will see that this part is rare.

94
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,188
As I said earlier, the main objective

95
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:46,508
is to articulate the different thematics.

96
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:49,200
It is useless to make a list of things,

97
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,682
they have to be in harmony.

98
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:55,162
And what is more and more important

99
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,513
is to share a vision.

100
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:59,619
It is useless to plan,

101
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:02,222
if it is not shared between all actors.

102
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:04,611
There are many actors

103
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:08,510
as we saw in the video 
about the African city.

104
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,944
We know the actors are both
institutional and private,

105
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:16,480
formal and informal,

106
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,670
and all of these people 
must share the vision.

107
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:26,010
Very simple methodology, very common.
We will qualify that afterwards.

108
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,990
We first have a diagnostic.

109
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,085
This diagnostic allows us 
to define orientations.

110
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:35,405
So, we have to focus on that.

111
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:39,036
It is a chain.

112
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:41,977
If there is no diagnostic,

113
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:45,130
then, we politically define
other orientations.

114
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,090
No. It is based on the diagnostic
that we will define orientations

115
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:55,842
for tomorrow's city.
Those orientations are political.

116
00:06:55,842 --> 00:06:59,240
And, we will translate these orientations,

117
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,430
elaborate them with a plan.

118
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,154
Translating them in a project 
has an impact on the plan.

119
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:10,688
This will make us go from diagnostic
to some orientations,

120
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:14,280
then to the elaboration of a plan,

121
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,455
and a program of priority investment.

122
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:23,654
It is not elementary data,
but today, it is the basic pattern

123
00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:28,456
to set up a master plan.

124
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:31,750
Then, there will be the implementation

125
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,818
and what we forget at the end, 
but is also essential,

126
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:37,780
is the communication.

127
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,804
You have to be able to sell 
the plan you set up

128
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:44,220
to make it useful.

129
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,240
The diagnostic, is in fact, 
an initial evaluation.

130
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,990
We will have a look
at what we learned about the city.

131
00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:00,014
We will make a table of these findings

132
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:06,389
which gives us the opportunities, 
the strengths, the weaknesses and threats

133
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,250
of the internal 
and external issues of the city.

134
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,820
Let's look at the example
of N'Djamena, Chad.

135
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,964
This diagnostic was made quickly,
but allows us to see

136
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:25,470
the main elements, therefore, 
the main issues of the city.

137
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,165
Following the diagnostic,

138
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:33,020
we will elaborate some orientations.

139
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,320
What are the big objectives for my city?

140
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:44,375
After defining the orientations,
we make a plan.

141
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:49,550
So along the plan,
we will spatialise the orientations.

142
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,570
Once it is done,

143
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,790
the result is the urban plan,
a framework document.

144
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,950
It does not have the same status
as an SDAU or master plan,

145
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,310
but some orientations have been spatialised,

146
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,780
and the result is the urban plan.

147
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,202
After the "PIP", 
Program of Priority Investment,

148
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:16,720
the cities can usually 
submit some projects

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,510
to a sponsor who will finance them.

150
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,002
This is the reason 
for the Program of Priority Investment.

151
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:27,763
What are the priority investments

152
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:30,634
to implement in my city,

153
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:34,329
to start orienting and meeting

154
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:37,930
the objectives I have set?

155
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,070
Then, the implementation.

156
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,312
Having a good plan is not enough,
it has to be implemented.

157
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:50,770
And for that, we need to have 
an action plan,

158
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,960
to formalise the actions, 
to identify the different responsibilities,

159
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,130
the funding sources, the schedules

160
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,750
and set up a monitoring system
to have indicators.

161
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,165
That is also often forgotten

162
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:11,169
at the end of the planning.

163
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:15,317
Your planning is useless
without a monitoring system

164
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:19,967
or an indicator system which
informs you if you are realising

165
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:23,228
what you have planned,

166
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:26,582
or if you have negative effects

167
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:31,294
which cause the planning to go

168
00:10:31,294 --> 00:10:34,409
the opposite way you planned.

169
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,270
Finally, communication.

170
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,500
Every resident must know the orientations
and the vision of their city.

171
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,632
It is another strong wish,

172
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:48,294
but it is very difficult to go to 
all neighbourhoods to discuss it.

173
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:53,990
But the more you communicate, 
the bigger the consensus on the project.

174
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,860
To do so, you will need the media,

175
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,344
a clear message, easy to understand

176
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:07,395
and the use of what already worked
as a learning lesson.

177
00:11:07,395 --> 00:11:10,880
The last two elements are very important,

178
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,760
as it is basic communication.

179
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,936
But the message has to be clear and easy,

180
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:22,700
so everyone can understand 
what is it about.

181
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,120
Now, as we have some indicators,

182
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,755
we have to evaluate what we did.

183
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,220
We can do so in time or as we plan

184
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,304
but no matter how many years it takes,

185
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:37,527
the idea is to have a return
on the planning.

186
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,685
We will come back
to these elements,

187
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:47,233
but quickly,

188
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:53,040
the idea is to have 
an overview on planning

189
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,814
by giving a definition, some thematics,

190
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:01,223
and show that we can't work separately,

191
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:04,143
with separate thematics,

192
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:09,030
but that it needs to be articulated.

193
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,330
Finally, planning is articulating
this urban complexity.

194
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,192
We thought for a long time

195
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:22,790
that the more we simplify the planning
the more efficient it would be.

196
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,845
We witness the exact opposite.

197
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,325
In the planning today,
we must take into account

198
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:33,788
the complexity of the societies
and of the urban operating

199
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:37,750
to have a lever for action
for tomorrow's city,

200
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,660
and set up a sustainable city.
