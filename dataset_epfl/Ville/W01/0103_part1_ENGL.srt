1
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:08,705
As a starting point, 
there is the need to plan city development.

2
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:09,652
Why ?

3
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:12,498
Because, spontaneously, as some may say,

4
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:18,060
when alone, a city does not 
develop in a rational way.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,094
All the individual strategies and tactics

6
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:26,787
do not make a city 
but a mesh of strategies.

7
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:31,247
If we want to integrate
the communities, activities,

8
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:33,625
services, infrastructure within one space,

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,584
we have at some point

10
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:42,513
to plan it so that 
it all combines harmoniously.

11
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:47,983
When planning, there are 
some challenges to meet.

12
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:50,988
First, there is always the same issue

13
00:00:50,988 --> 00:00:53,141
of population growth.

14
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:58,414
We have to fit into a given space, 
which can grow along the way,

15
00:00:58,414 --> 00:01:02,088
an ever-increasing population, 
or in some cases,

16
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:07,335
as seen in Detroit, USA, 
a decreasing population,

17
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:12,060
which has to be managed
just as efficiently,

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,866
since a decline
is an issue that must be addressed.

19
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:19,261
We are here facing an issue
of rather population growth.

20
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:23,395
Then, it is important preserve resources:

21
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:27,537
water resources, social resources...

22
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:32,469
In that respect, an inclusive city 
should be able to preserve these.

23
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:35,388
Services need not only to be developed,

24
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:37,657
but also planned within a territory.

25
00:01:37,657 --> 00:01:42,973
Basic infrastructure, just as services, 
needs to be planned

26
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:45,323
in the short, medium and long term:

27
00:01:45,323 --> 00:01:52,133
what area, what part of the city 
are we going to connect in priority,

28
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:55,103
whether to services or infrastructure?

29
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:57,976
The housing issue remains crucial:

30
00:01:57,976 --> 00:02:02,823
where are we going to settle
all the city dwellers?

31
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:06,299
Activities, jobs, 
since, we have seen it,

32
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,902
migrants come mainly
from the rural areas,

33
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:15,032
with the hope to find a job,
among others reasons.

34
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:19,415
Also it is easier to find
a job or a trade,

35
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,514
than in rural areas.

36
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:25,958
Then, there's an environment to preserve,

37
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:31,511
the city is not hanging in the void,
but is set in a geography with,

38
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:36,428
most of the time, a hinterland, 
an immediate environment,

39
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:41,966
and one of the biggest challenges 
regarding planning,

40
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:45,269
nowadays, is to deal with
the issue of the urban fringe,

41
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:51,056
that is to say, the relation between
the city and its immediate environment.

42
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:57,835
The definition, or the definitions
of planning.

43
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:01,858
It is defined as a tool used to reach
sustainable development.

44
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:07,404
For this purpose, we develop a medium
and long-term vision of the territory.

45
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:11,204
We never look in the short term, 
when we want to rationalize

46
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:13,249
the means to reach the goals.

47
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,463
It allows us to link together the needs
of infrastructure and services with

48
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,637
the growth of the population or

49
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:24,299
the need of urban sprawl with
environmental protection.

50
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:27,822
We are going to work
within a limited area.

51
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:33,708
Planning offers a coordination framework
of public action and, to a lesser extent,

52
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,858
of private action, 
for social and economic development.

53
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:42,028
In this sense, planning is organizing
human action having an impact

54
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:45,678
on the territory, 
providing a framework to development

55
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:48,681
and mitigating adverse effects.

56
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:53,896
Here is the basic definition, 
a bit long, admittedly,

57
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:57,016
of urban planning.

58
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,278
Planning is a source of vision or ideal,

59
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:05,051
or in any case, 
a set of goals for the future:

60
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:08,618
a vision for the future.

61
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:13,885
This vision, in principle, 
should be shared by the community.

62
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:16,650
This community is going to 
mobilize around it,

63
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,867
in the best of all words, 
because we'll see that it's not that easy.

64
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:25,548
This vision must be 
a source of inspiration.

65
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:32,131
It means that it must lead projects,
give rise to other projects.

66
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:36,910
It must be both ambitious and realistic.

67
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,409
We have to, somehow, stir imagination,
since it is a long term vision,

68
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,955
it is an ideal, a goal to reach but,

69
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:53,170
we have to be extremely pragmatic 
and realistic,

70
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,677
and have a vision
that everyone understands.

71
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:00,865
One of the goals of this planning,

72
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:03,162
is the good management of 
urban development.

73
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:07,526
And this management features,
in principle,

74
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:11,140
prevention of or fight against poverty, 
acceptable living standards,

75
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,534
well connected districts, 
sustainability at the social,

76
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:21,420
and environmental and economic level.

77
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,397
There is a number of criteria, 
that lead to good management.

78
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:32,103
And the planning is here to set up
this good urban management.

79
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:35,156
It is one of its purposes.

80
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,985
Another purpose, today, is 
the strategic planning.

81
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:43,410
It's a tautology to me:

82
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,382
it is hard to imagine, indeed, 
a form of planning that is not strategic.

83
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:51,933
What we want to do, is to see
how we are going to design

84
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,852
not just a plan, because planning

85
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:58,909
is not just about a plan; 
its outcome is not the mere drawing

86
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,208
of a plan, but planning

87
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:07,989
is by definition strategic, 
with our main goals included in it.

88
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:15,339
These goals are then turned into
realities on the ground,

89
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:19,227
into projects, into public policies, 
urban policies,

90
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:23,848
a string of things, 
but first and foremost,

91
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:29,287
we have to plan the strategy
for the future of cities.

92
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:32,676
This entails the need to
adapt to the context.

93
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:35,132
This idea will keep coming up,

94
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,877
which is natural, since
we believe from the start

95
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:41,220
that there isn't just one African city,
but several African cities.

96
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,889
The idea is that planning

97
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,238
should match a specific context.

98
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:54,939
Therefore there is not one type of
urban planning but several.

99
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:59,870
What we are trying to find out today, 
are the methods

100
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,865
that we would put in place, everywhere, 
and that would lead us

101
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:08,790
to different types planning, 
depending on the contexts.

102
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,464
We are now going to take a look
at the major fields included in planning.

103
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:19,480
The first one being, 
of course, the economy.

104
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,829
The economy, wide subject,
can be dealt with in different ways:

105
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:29,989
there are the very pragmatic, 
down-to-earth issues of land use planning,

106
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:33,171
which then allows
the development of an economic activity,

107
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:37,484
of infrastructure, which also leads

108
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:40,265
to economic development,

109
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:43,397
and we could also think of
a certain number

110
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:47,309
of public policies which would facilitate 
the setting up of companies

111
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:50,649
or make business environment better.

112
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:56,441
We can also bank on competitiveness
among cities.

113
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:59,221
These are more macroeconomic issues

114
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,220
or marketing issues.

115
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:04,306
Another major field: 
environment.

116
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:08,773
We also have several takes on it.

117
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:11,522
We will not go through all of them.

118
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:14,815
We will go back to these issues later on,

119
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:18,485
but it ranges from ecosystem issues,

120
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:20,520
agricultural issues,

121
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,451
issues concerning the integration 
of the city in a more global context.

122
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:29,450
We could talk about pollution issues,

123
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,448
energy issues and 
energy choices

124
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:36,069
which would make the best of planning.

125
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,990
The issue of transportation:
there are multiple factors as well.

126
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,867
Individual transport, public transport,

127
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:48,402
the question of transport
as opposed to mobility,

128
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,004
and finally the central issue, 
in most cities,

129
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:59,519
addressing transport for the poorest,
or mobility for the poorest.

130
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:02,729
Another major field large theme
is the issue of energy.

131
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:08,998
Then again, we will not go through
the multiple options here,

132
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:15,306
but we could make an energy assessment,
and the sustainable city would be,

133
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:20,280
in the end, the city which
consumes less energy.

134
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,213
We also have to think 
of the distribution of energy.

135
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:29,255
In theory, it is not evenly
distributed across the territory.

136
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:36,736
Finally, the financial aspects.
This issue may be a little more technical

137
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:41,413
but just as important
as the other fields.

138
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:45,100
The idea is to spend a whole week
on financial issues.

139
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,616
Financing is about resources,

140
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:53,801
how to make the best 
of financial resources

141
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,935
which can be derived from
management plans.

142
00:09:57,935 --> 00:10:01,625
It means taxes,
or land-use plans,

143
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:06,960
but we may consider the issues of 
taxation as well as

144
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,112
the issues of project creation

145
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:13,589
and the public-private partnerships.

146
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:18,144
The financial overlaps economics

147
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:22,051
but finance is very broad.

148
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:26,418
Finally, there is the issue of governance.

149
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:30,781
It is most of the time
at the heart of discussions.

150
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:38,860
To engage in planning, we have to 
make sure we understand the stakeholders.

151
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,564
Because individuals alone,
when there are not integrated,

152
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:45,910
cannot make any planning.

153
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,056
Therefore, we need to understand
the interactions among

154
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:51,700
the different stakeholders,
how decisions are made,

155
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,180
where they are made,
and who does what,

156
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,971
so we need to know who governs what.

157
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:01,266
