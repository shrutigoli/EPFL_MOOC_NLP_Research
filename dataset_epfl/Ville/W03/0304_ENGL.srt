1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,362
In our video we're going to talk 
about urban environment,

2
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:10,562
from the perspective
of risks as well as

3
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:14,140
the issue of environmental deterioration.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,215
To address this, we will talk about 
households, neighborhoods, cities,

5
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:22,430
countryside, from the small scale 
to the large scale.

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,301
What is the risk when it 
comes to households?

7
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:29,152
The three main problems 
they are faced with

8
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:32,704
are water and sanitation problems,

9
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:34,776
the issue of air pollution
within houses

10
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:39,140
and the problem of household waste.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,245
The severity of these problems
may be explained by the generally

12
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:50,358
unsanitary and dense life environment,
as basic infrastructure is lacking

13
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:56,248
and authorities are 
not very active about these

14
00:00:56,248 --> 00:01:02,710
household environmental risks.
An example here: Nouakchott.

15
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,660
It is the shabby neighborhood of El Mina, 
the Kebbe of El Mina after a rainfall.

16
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,140
The risks inherent to 
underprivileged neighborhoods are:

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,836
the lack of sanitation systems,

18
00:01:16,836 --> 00:01:20,645
natural disasters

19
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:24,586
(most of the time, 
the areas that are built

20
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,538
should not have been built)

21
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:31,360
and there is the unchecked production
of toxic waste from informal activities.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,950
An example here, 
the niais of Dakar where we see

23
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:42,167
that natural sites are also 
dump sites, with waste and garbage,

24
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:47,240
and the point is that this waste 
and garbage create a backfill.

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,410
The risk at city level.

26
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,023
There are four major environmental

27
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:54,900
problems at city level.

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,600
Water pollution.

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,572
The whole water cycle, we may say:

30
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:01,791
supply, treatment, 
the issue of surface waters

31
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,500
and water tables which are 
increasingly polluted.

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,346
The management of solid

33
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:08,411
and industrial waste.

34
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:11,650
More than half of the waste 
is left on-site.

35
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,868
Natural disasters of course: 
hurricanes, storms,

36
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:20,353
earthquakes, the increase in heavy rains,

37
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:25,180
and industrial accidents and the 
storage of industrial waste

38
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,750
as in Abidjan some years ago.

39
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,357
Finally, there is air pollution:
the release or dumping

40
00:02:32,357 --> 00:02:35,490
without any treatment, 
of heavy metals or carcinogenic residues.

41
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,866
This is the classic pollution that

42
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,968
can be found in all cities.

43
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:47,493
But here, there is not treatment 
on the production of this pollution.

44
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:50,398
Finally, the risk 
for the surrounding countryside

45
00:02:50,398 --> 00:02:52,570
or the hinterland as we like to call it.

46
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,964
The environmental nuisances 
generated by

47
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:57,270
a city have an impact 
on a regional scale.

48
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,574
It implies over exploitation
of natural resources, water,

49
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:03,510
wood used for construction, fish,
you name it.

50
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,238
An unplanned urban sprawl
of some neighborhoods

51
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:08,610
on good arable agricultural lands.

52
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,950
Different forms of pollution,
as we have already mentioned.

53
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,910
And here we have an example, in 
Nouakchott, of a carcass,

54
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,238
it's a donkey that died and was
left like this lying on the street.

55
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:22,518
These are sanitary and 
environmental problems

56
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:27,210
which are extremely important and 
yet not managed at all.

57
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,298
Another example, in another city, 
where we find,

58
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:37,436
in the very center of the city, 
in a little pit used to dump waste.

59
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:44,020
We have now covered the household, 
the neighborhood, the city, the countryside.

60
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,190
Now, let's talk about some cross-cutting 
factors of deterioration.

61
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,230
We may want to mention
the lack of awareness

62
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,650
and the weak involvement of civil society,

63
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,873
the relationship with waste 
and finally the fact that

64
00:03:56,873 --> 00:04:01,020
this waste management really 
belongs to no one.

65
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,026
Or at least, this is what people think.

66
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:07,110
Legal loopholes and
overlapping institutional jurisdictions.

67
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,430
Obsolete property regulation 
which is inadequate

68
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,390
with a rational use of natural resources.

69
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,880
Exclusively sectoral approaches 
and implementations

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,140
which do not allow to take into 
account all aspects.

71
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,630
Weak institutional capacity when it 
comes to environmental management.

72
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,297
And finally, failing urban planning,

73
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:35,060
since it only rarely takes into account 
the questions of the environment.

74
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,418
Here we have, in just a few strokes,

75
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:41,122
a few elements both
about the risks

76
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:44,720
and the systems 
of environmental deterioration

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,632
We will have the opportunity 
to come back to it later,

78
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:49,444
but for now we will stop here

79
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:54,260
as a first introduction 
on urban environment issues.
