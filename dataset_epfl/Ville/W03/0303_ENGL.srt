1
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,848
The focus of this video 
is climate change.

2
00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:11,410
We will quickly see the link 
one can make between

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,722
urban form, between urban spatial 
systems and climate change.

4
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:20,556
To begin, we must 
remember a few things,

5
00:00:20,556 --> 00:00:24,934
which is that urban planning is not 
an autonomous activity,

6
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:31,450
but is at once dependent on 
demographics, economic changes,

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,198
political factors, technological progress

8
00:00:36,198 --> 00:00:41,310
and, very recently, it is dependent 
on climate change.

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,113
This is what we'll see.

10
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:45,366
Now, what are the types of effect?

11
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,746
There may be an elevation 
in temperature.

12
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:51,055
There may be an increase 
in sea level.

13
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,535
One can also have 
increased river levels

14
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:59,671
or an intensification 
of rain phenomena.

15
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,006
Finally, an increase in 
natural catastrophes:

16
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:08,103
tsunamis, periods of 
flooding or drought.

17
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:14,450
This chart is interesting because 
it shows the types of effect

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,377
and finally their relation to 
different human activities.

19
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:25,021
High winds, an increase in high winds

20
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:29,941
does not have a direct effect 
on agriculture or habitat.

21
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:32,682
On the contrary, in transportation, 
if we consider air travel,

22
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:35,318
there may be a direct impact.

23
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:40,754
Heavy rainfall may not necessarily 
have a direct bearing

24
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:43,344
on the whole of human activity.

25
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:46,432
However, without doubt 
it does on agriculture.

26
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:50,388
And in this graph we can see that 
ultimately it is agriculture

27
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:54,585
which is subject to nearly 
all these types of effects.

28
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:56,559
The same with transportation.

29
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,443
There are domains where
these climate changes

30
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:01,756
will have little effect, 
and other domains

31
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:05,186
where the changes 
will be greater.

32
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:09,135
So, when discussing climate change,

33
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:11,573
there are two attitudes 
on these changes--

34
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:14,351
Mitigation and Adaptation.

35
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,960
Mitigation seeks to 
reduce the effects

36
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:21,883
and adaptation tries 
to adapt to them.

37
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:25,920
So while on the one hand 
I look to reduce rainfall,

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,548
and flood frequency by 
reducing, for example--

39
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:34,173
because there is a direct link 
to energy consumption--

40
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:37,431
so I reduce my consumption 
and with this I will reduce

41
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:40,416
the effects of climate change.

42
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,847
On the other hand I say, okay,

43
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:45,280
I will adapt to these changes,

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,679
and provide technological structures 
which allow one, finally,

45
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:52,729
to live with these conditions 
of flooding, drought,

46
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:55,047
of high winds or incessant rainfall.

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,523
So, with mitigation 
one tries to reduce,

48
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:03,154
perhaps to begin with 
those on compact cities.

49
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:08,274
With an urban mix, we will favor 
public transport, promote walking.

50
00:03:08,274 --> 00:03:10,619
We've seen just now 
in this schematic

51
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:12,433
that there is a 
direct link between

52
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,753
urban density and 
energy consumption,

53
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:18,459
so one seeks to reduce 
this energy consumption,

54
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,859
and adaptation, 
this urban sprawl.

55
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,969
It is this diffused city which, 
ultimately, is the model to use

56
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:33,350
as it favors ground absorption 
in the case of rainfall or flooding.

57
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,368
It favors air circulation
in the case of pollution,

58
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:41,093
at the same time diminishing 
the number of pollutants.

59
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:43,890
Therefore depending on 
the strategy one adopts,

60
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,219
to reduce or adapt 
to these effects,

61
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,275
the urban forms 
will not be the same.

62
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:55,652
On one hand we have the compact city, 
and on the other the diffused one.

63
00:03:55,652 --> 00:04:00,653
Since we're talking about density, 
about densification,

64
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:03,847
in other words attempts
to reduce, or the mitigation,

65
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:05,960
to reduce the effects 
of climate change,

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,950
we must first determine 
what we will measure.

67
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,011
Are we talking about gas? 
Are we talking about CO2?

68
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:17,368
When we wish to say there is 
a density, what is its metric?

69
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:19,828
What measure is used?

70
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,000
Next is the question of 
low- and hyperdensity.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,980
Low density is very energy costly, 
while hyperdensity,

72
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,035
in the same way, is also 
very, very energy costly.

73
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,050
There is without a doubt 
an optimum which lies

74
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,162
between a too-high density 
and a too-low density.

75
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:37,253
And while we speak of density,

76
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:42,845
we must also speak of 
the social question.

77
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:47,222
What does it mean to live in 
an extremely dense city,

78
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:48,900
in social terms?

79
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:53,064
When it comes to climate 
and humidity levels,

80
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:57,344
we will have different answers 
depending on urban forms.

81
00:04:57,344 --> 00:05:00,503
We know that humidity makes heat 
even more difficult to bear,

82
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:03,708
and that often when we 
find ourselves in zones

83
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,763
where natural disasters are more 
or less common--flooding, storms--

84
00:05:07,763 --> 00:05:11,707
it is in tropical zones where there
is high heat and high humidity.

85
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:15,560
So the challenge is to find 
a pattern, an urban form

86
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,070
which addresses the issue of 
both heat and that of humidity.

87
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:25,182
First off, in very hot zones 
we will try to reduce

88
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:28,782
the heating effect of 
the sun with urban

89
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:31,270
and architectural elements.

90
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:34,840
We will try to achieve a 
maximum natural ventilation

91
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:38,395
in the street or in the home.

92
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:40,874
And in the end, the individual home,

93
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,235
in a hot and humid climate, 
can be a solution.

94
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:46,932
We'll start with the individual villa,

95
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:50,498
the single home, because it is 
increasingly disparaged,

96
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:53,576
in a certain number of cities 
because it makes up

97
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:56,300
the endless peripheries of 
American cities and,

98
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,040
increasingly, European ones,

99
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,442
and is extremely energy 
consumptive and on the move,

100
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:06,519
as an energy equally 
and in principal, today,

101
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,343
where the tendency is increasing to
criticize the individual home, the villa.

102
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:14,710
But, if we return to a hot 
and humid climate

103
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,454
we can question it might be 
one of its solutions,

104
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:23,076
or one urban form which 
can respond to all its criteria.

105
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:28,589
Finally, narrow, tall buildings 
are another solution,

106
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,842
for, ultimately, the less 
the sun's impact,

107
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:35,727
the more one can 
avoid this connection

108
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,432
between humidity and sun.

109
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:40,737
Let's take a look at high winds.

110
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:43,952
A compact form will have 
the greatest resistance.

111
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:48,303
Mid-height buildings, since 
low-level buildings will not resist

112
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:51,673
and the higher ones will pose 
a certain number of problems,

113
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:54,610
so the skyscraper is not 
very appropriate,

114
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,180
for it will have an 
acceleration effect

115
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:59,426
on the wind between high rises,

116
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:03,035
and neither is the low individual 
home appropriate,

117
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:05,320
for it has a funneling effect.

118
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:10,310
High density allows for a reduction 
in the effects of wind.

119
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:15,574
And finally, the effects dependent 
on street orientation.

120
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:18,860
If your street extends

121
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,990
in the principal 
direction of the wind,

122
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,526
it will have an 
accelerative effect,

123
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:28,416
whereas if one is perpendicular 
to this wind direction,

124
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,631
one will be protected 
from violent winds.

125
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:34,522
We can also see, when 
speaking of winds

126
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:36,290
and most notably their 
urban forms,

127
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,230
the urban response will not 
always be the same,

128
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,790
and suddenly, if we combine 
the effects of heat, humidity,

129
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,090
and violent winds, we will 
realize that we have no more

130
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,320
urban form which will allow us 
to respond to all this.

131
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:52,817
Let's look at yet another example.

132
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:56,470
Flooding, the increase in 
sea levels and the urban form.

133
00:07:57,331 --> 00:08:00,296
The ground should be able 
to absorb excess water.

134
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,505
We spoke of this just now.

135
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:06,408
So in the end the more natural 
surfaces, the more I am diffused,

136
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:11,664
the more my urban form can allow 
the absorption of excess water.

137
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:15,076
Let's limit once and 
for all paved surfaces,

138
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:19,505
or asphalt surfaces, 
any sealed surface

139
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:23,116
so that while one speaks, 
particularly about flooding,

140
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:25,888
one can try to take into 
account vast territories,

141
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:31,125
non-urbanized territories 
which can be utilized

142
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:37,034
as reservoirs to act as 
temporary buffer zones

143
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:41,634
so that the water can be stored 
upstream from the city,

144
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:43,558
rather than in its interior.

145
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:47,328
And at the same time, of course, 
the question of flooding

146
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:51,058
quickly depends on the question 
of the morphology

147
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:55,510
of the site, of the land forms, 
flat or sloping,

148
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,530
which clearly have different 
responses to flooding.

149
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:04,360
Pizarro, in 2010, 
proposed a matrix,

150
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:07,528
a matrix where one 
will see these diverse responses,

151
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:10,692
when speaking of high temperatures,

152
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:13,561
of strong humidity, violent 
winds and flooding,

153
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:16,430
and for each of these effects

154
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,376
one can ask what percentage 
of ground cover,

155
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:23,375
of the distance required 
between buildings,

156
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,244
the median height of buildings, 
the templates,

157
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:30,419
the spaces, the topography, 
the quality of sunlight.

158
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:33,295
In sum, a whole series which 
I will leave for you to read,

159
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:36,528
but one can continue like
this, in graphic format,

160
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:41,728
to have percentages, knowing 
the more one has, for example,

161
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:46,071
a high humidity or strong 
winds, the more the

162
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:53,879
ground cover should be minimal,
by covering I mean asphalt,

163
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,426
a covering which does not 
allow the passage of water,

164
00:09:56,426 --> 00:10:00,500
so at all cost this percentage 
of ground cover must be reduced.

165
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:05,026
So there you have a brief description 
of some of the effects,

166
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:08,493
some of the responses 
to urban form,

167
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:14,821
which is to say, when we continue, 
that urban form is clearly

168
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:21,042
dependent on climate, and on context, 
and that the response to climate--

169
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,373
and I'm speaking not of 
climate change,

170
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,452
but of climate in general---
that the responses

171
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:30,824
should be different if one is in 
a tropical, humid climate,

172
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:33,003
or a continental dry one.

173
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:37,390
So for each type of climate 
there are different responses,

174
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,540
which makes it so that 
for each climate zone

175
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,850
one should have 
different planning.

176
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,824
What we will soon see,

177
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:51,839
is how our planning 
should respond

178
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,408
to this context, to this 
particular context,

179
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:58,120
and how it should respond specifically 
to the context of climate.

180
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,440
We have lost this idea of an 
architecture, a bioclimatic urbanism

181
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,772
decades ago, abandoned in 
the name of modernity,

182
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:12,841
in the name of aseptic air 
in commercial centers,

183
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:17,820
air-conditioned, regulated, but 
today we must question

184
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,653
this model, which they try 
to place everywhere,

185
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:23,630
versus a model which will be 
contextualized,

186
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,528
with a planning that 
will not be made

187
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:30,607
except in a precise context 
with its own specifics.

188
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:35,480
In the end, while we're speaking of, 
and we'll conclude here,

189
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,570
climate change, it is impossible 
to view it from a local perspective.

190
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,020
It must be seen from 
a global perspective.

191
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,330
And this without a doubt 
poses a challenge

192
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:52,736
to a certain number of types, 
democratic and participative steps,

193
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:56,709
and we must review 
our system of governance.

194
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:01,993
So these climate changes 
will not only lead to effects

195
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:04,834
on the land, but also 
at a political level,

196
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,845
where the decision making 
can no longer be local,

197
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:14,217
but most be on a global level, 
between nations or even

198
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:17,287
between continents, on 
an absolutely global scale

199
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:21,620
in order to rapidly respond 
to climatic changes.
