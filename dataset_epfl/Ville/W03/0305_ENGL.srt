1
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:06,674
In this video we will examine

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,463
the question of 
transport and mobility,

3
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:12,267
once again not in an 
exhaustive way,

4
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:16,111
but just enough to help us
in our urban planning,

5
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:19,218
to help us to understand 
how this works.

6
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:22,182
When we speak of transport,

7
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:24,300
we speak of a 
transportation system,

8
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,052
and this system is made up of 
three elements, which are:

9
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:34,878
One, the services, the trams, 
trains, buses, taxis,

10
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,648
but also the police, who 
are part of this service.

11
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,479
Next we have the infrastructures,

12
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,049
the routes, the railways, parking lots,

13
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:48,158
and one has a network of users,

14
00:00:48,158 --> 00:00:50,221
which are the pedestrians, drivers,

15
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:52,574
the cyclists, the road-users,

16
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:56,466
as well as the 
mini-bus companies.

17
00:00:57,773 --> 00:01:00,820
This network is made up of
these three elements.

18
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:05,259
On the question of mobility, 
it is above all a necessity.

19
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:08,246
We need to be able 
to go to work,

20
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:10,802
to go to recreational activities, 
to go to the market.

21
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:15,282
It is above all a necessity, 
but it is equally a right.

22
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:18,842
One has the right to 
be able to get around,

23
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:20,810
its opposite would 
make one a prisoner.

24
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:26,588
What we take of this is, above all, 
is this right to mobility.

25
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,834
Even if I exercise this 
right only partially,

26
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:35,975
even if I don't use it at all, 
mobility is a right.

27
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:40,760
To continue, since we will deal 
principally with public transport

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,519
in this question of 
transport and mobility,

29
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,277
a quote from the 
mayor of Bogotá,

30
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:48,126
the ex-mayor of 
Bogotá, who said,

31
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:51,826
"A developed country is not a place 
where the poor have cars.

32
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:54,830
It's where the rich use 
public transportation."

33
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,017
We'll use this as a starting point 
for our discussion,

34
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:02,409
Used as a base for our discussion

35
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,699
and of particular interest 
is that today,

36
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:07,128
if we look at the major 
trends in Africa,

37
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,135
we'll see that 
the principal trend

38
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:11,905
lies in the increased
number of cars.

39
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:16,936
So the rate of car ownership 
increases, slowly but surely,

40
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,796
in the majority of cities, 
and in some very rapidly.

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,944
The margin, since 
car ownership rates

42
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,761
are very, very low, 
at this point,

43
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:29,152
the margin is still 
excessively large.

44
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:34,304
Along with this increase in cars,

45
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:36,657
we see a decrease in 
public transportation,

46
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,653
in walking and cycling, 
in nearly all African cities.

47
00:02:40,653 --> 00:02:42,654
And suddenly, as everywhere,

48
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:46,040
we find a diminishing 
attractiveness of city centers,

49
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,378
because it is difficult 
to get to them,

50
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,542
so ultimately it is the 
periphery which wins,

51
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:55,646
the diffuse periphery where one 
can fit the most vehicles,

52
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:59,869
and where the distance from 
point A to point B is the longest.

53
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,639
So there you have 
the actual trends,

54
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,959
and it is here where we 
should begin our plans,

55
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,454
and to try to understand what 
the possible means might be

56
00:03:10,454 --> 00:03:12,720
to achieve eventual change.

57
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:19,014
So let's look at the impact 
on the land, for each line,

58
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:23,205
each route, each space 
given over to transport,

59
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:26,174
whether private or public, 
has an impact on the land,

60
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:31,949
and its effect, for a strip of 
3.5 meters in length,

61
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:36,400
the example we have here, 
we'll note it somewhere,

62
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:41,504
can surpass 2,000 people 
if it's in mixed traffic,

63
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:47,045
or if in suburban railways, 
100,000 people.

64
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:50,935
So we can see that this gap 
is excessively large,

65
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:54,256
and that in the end it will 
have a huge influence

66
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:56,197
on the form of the city,

67
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:58,384
and a very large impact 
on the land,

68
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:01,402
whether one chooses one mode 
of transport or another.

69
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:04,921
Walking, as we just said,

70
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:11,826
we see that in certain cities 
can reach 70%, while globally

71
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:16,777
more than 50% of travel 
in African cities is on foot.

72
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:19,390
So what is the reason behind 
this downward trend?

73
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,610
Because the city grows outward, 
and distances are greater to travel.

74
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,715
The modal split, we'll see later on 
that this is the model,

75
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:31,575
but we can clearly see that it is
the distribution between

76
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,847
the different types of transport,

77
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:38,672
between the private car, the bike, 
walking, public transportation.

78
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:44,569
And we will find extremely 
different situations

79
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:47,514
when it comes to each city.

80
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:52,489
In Johannesburg, the role 
of the car is huge,

81
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:57,369
while in Douala or Dar es Salaam, 
it is very small.

82
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:05,704
The role of informal transport 
is huge in Accra,

83
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:12,058
yet in Douala it is very small 
when compared to other cities.

84
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:15,881
So we will see that there is not 
one model of the African city,

85
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:19,098
but that if we use several 
examples we'll find that

86
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:24,765
there are already exceedingly 
different modal situations.

87
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:28,847
There is a direct link 
between the morphology

88
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:31,229
of the city, between 
its urban form,

89
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:34,759
but also between its history, 
its trajectory,

90
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,195
or in certain numbers of 
choices made or not.

91
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:41,864
Within the schematic we can see

92
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:46,077
the number of private vehicles 
as a percentage of travel,

93
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:49,994
as a function of the
gross domestic product,

94
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:52,318
in dollars, for each 
of these cities,

95
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,717
for each country.
And we have here

96
00:05:55,717 --> 00:06:01,467
the American cities based 
exclusively on the car,

97
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:04,841
and then we have 
European cities

98
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:08,968
which are cities based 
slightly less on cars

99
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,941
but have the tendency to become 
more and more so,

100
00:06:11,941 --> 00:06:14,726
to Americanize themselves

101
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:18,794
and then we have here 
some developing cities

102
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:23,014
where one has at the same time 
modal parts of private vehicles

103
00:06:23,014 --> 00:06:25,579
relatively weak for some,

104
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,964
yet with gross national products 
which are very weak.

105
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:32,661
So the challenge here 
is to figure out

106
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:39,179
if this group will end up 
here or there.

107
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:44,112
So we see a significant margin today, 
notably within African cities.

108
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:50,036
The schematic of Newman and 
Kenworthy which we've already seen

109
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:55,065
shows the annual gas consumption
in relation to urban density.

110
00:06:55,065 --> 00:07:00,772
The more dense my city, 
the less gas I consume,

111
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:04,033
and this gives us some direction 
on how it is done.

112
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:09,728
And, finally, we'll just touch on 
the question of modal choice.

113
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:15,006
The modal choice is that, 
for each time you go out,

114
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:19,506
you'll ask yourself which mode 
of transportation you'll use.

115
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,834
Now some don't even ask 
themselves; they have a car,

116
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:26,906
they have the means to have a car 
and use it exclusively, all the time,

117
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,798
and others who on the contrary 
do ask themselves--

118
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:32,067
Will I take my bike? Will I walk?

119
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,891
Will I take the bus, 
or will I go in my car?

120
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:37,908
And these modal choices 
will depend on

121
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:40,434
a certain number of criteria,

122
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:45,283
factors, we might say, 
which include

123
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:50,269
travel time, distance, what 
I need to transport, for example,

124
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,809
if I have a large bag 
will I walk or take my car?

125
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,537
There will also be physical questions.

126
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:02,945
Am I in good enough shape 
to walk or bike,

127
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:07,430
or must I take the car?

128
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,316
The cost issue, certainly 
not negligible,

129
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:14,427
will often be considered when 
it comes to public transportation,

130
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,582
rarely the cost of the car,

131
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:22,993
while there will be other 
considerations, like parking.

132
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:28,217
If I take my car, will a 
parking spot be available?

133
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:32,748
Also other questions 
tied to security, for example,

134
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:37,999
I'd like to walk, 
but it's dangerous.

135
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:40,261
It's dangerous because 
it is on the highway,

136
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:44,374
or because there is 
a real safety issue.

137
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:50,407
Thus my modal choice will be 
influenced as well by safety issues.

138
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:55,706
So we've touched briefly on 
the question of modal choice.

139
00:08:56,721 --> 00:09:01,092
Some examples, of taxis, 
here, in the center of the city.

140
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:04,351
Mini-buses, which await passengers.

141
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:08,822
A taxi, a mini-bus; 
here we are in Dakar.

142
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,591
The same mini-bus which 
awaits clients, still in Dakar.

143
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:21,068
Or here, in Abidjan, the large buses 
which travel longer distances,

144
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:25,344
whose stops are preplanned 
and known in advance.

145
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:31,873
Taxis, facing difficulties 
in the rainy season.

146
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:36,603
Another type of station, 
with buses, this time,

147
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:41,463
which travel to neighboring cities 
or even cross several countries.

148
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:48,112
So to summarize a bit, we must keep 
something very important in mind.

149
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:53,156
which is that the mode of transport 
has a considerable influence

150
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:57,571
on the place where it is used.

151
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:00,399
The second thing to 
remember is that today,

152
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,464
the role of the car in 
African cities is very small.

153
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:07,363
It is growing, trending upwards 
as we've seen,

154
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:10,283
but there still exists a choice 
between on the one hand

155
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:13,729
a model which will be more 
American, or more European,

156
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:18,006
or without a doubt a third model, 
which will be clearly African.

157
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:21,624
Now that we are aware of 
these different aspects,

158
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:25,006
we will integrate them 
in our future planning.

159
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,576
What type of city?

160
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:30,392
Shall I make a city for the car, 
or for the pedestrian?

161
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:32,294
Or perhaps for 
public transportation?

162
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:35,745
These are the questions 
we'll address next.
