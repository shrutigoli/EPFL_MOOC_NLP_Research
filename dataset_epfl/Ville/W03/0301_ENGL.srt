1
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:08,015
This week we are in Mauritania.

2
00:00:08,245 --> 00:00:10,510
Welcome to all the participants 
from Nouakchott!

3
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:21,453
In our video today, 
we'll talk about globalisation and cities

4
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:24,243
and about the impact
of globalisation on urban planning.

5
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,940
In today's world, 
some cities have entered

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,863
a global competition to attract
as much influx as they can:

7
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,833
influx of people,

8
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,945
influx of goods or influx of capital.

9
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:41,843
This is what makes a city 
truly global or not.

10
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:46,020
Which means we are going to measure
a certain number of indicators,

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,380
which may be indicators of airport traffic,

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,632
of capital flows, most of the time,

13
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:54,791
and, increasingly,

14
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:59,527
social indicators telling about 
the quality of living are used.

15
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:03,675
In this international competition
to be a global city

16
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:06,016
strategies are about the same everywhere.

17
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:08,504
And this is what we're going to look at 
in the following slides.

18
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:12,046
When it comes to globalisation,
there are competing theories.

19
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:14,041
Let's have a look at the most common one,

20
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,700
and the one that states 
that globalisation is inevitable.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,192
The inevitable globalisation 
benefits everybody

22
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:28,582
through the trickle-down effect
from the richer to the poorer.

23
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:31,354
The globalisation of the economy

24
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:36,550
and of political interactions
implies the end of Nation-States.

25
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,742
It brings about a new political deal,
a new set of interactions,

26
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:44,902
not among nations,

27
00:01:44,902 --> 00:01:48,552
but among cities and companies.

28
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:52,454
What impact does it have on planning?

29
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:54,660
Which is what we are interested in.

30
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,320
First, we may say that
city leaders

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,765
now want a global city.

32
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:05,560
Everyone tries to be a global city.

33
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,920
This implies a concentration of powers

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,359
and a new approach 
based on marketing.

35
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:17,810
Cities become commodities
that are advertised and sold,

36
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,034
which requires an extremely strong power,

37
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:24,613
far from a participatory democracy.

38
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:28,125
We'll come back to all that.

39
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:33,811
But we do notice that it is the wish
of most city leaders

40
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:36,893
and that implementing this wish

41
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:40,036
requires power to be placed back
at the centre

42
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:42,588
and decision-making 
to take place at the centre

43
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:47,120
whereas over the past few years 
the tendency was to try to decentralize

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,172
and involve as many users as possible.

45
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:53,668
Which means, of course,
that the planning scheme

46
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:58,662
changes tack completely,
with radically different priorities.

47
00:02:58,662 --> 00:03:02,498
Planning is different whether the aim

48
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:06,660
is a global city or a « classic » city.

49
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:13,010
One main aspect is the focus 
on the richest.

50
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,360
The priority is more on high-end housing,

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,530
extremely expensive leisure
aimed at the uppermost classes.

52
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,510
Which means cities look for

53
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,114
maximization of profits 
in such a global economy.

54
00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:36,746
Each city is trying to position itself
within an idea of global competition.

55
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:39,287
Each tries to position itself

56
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:43,412
as far as the economy is concerned,
and to attract as many people as possible.

57
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:45,860
And companies are much sought-after.

58
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,344
There are several ways to attract companies.

59
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:52,057
One way is to try to put on the market

60
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,797
land that is fit for building.

61
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:59,330
The basic infrastructure, the land itself,
is made ready

62
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,188
so that we can say to such or such company
that would like to come

63
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:06,156
that we are ready, we have land available
and it's ready to be used.

64
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:09,340
Another way to attract companies

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,980
are projects that give a positive image
of the city.

66
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,820
These can be long-term projects,
or they can be events.

67
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,404
Think of World Cups,
Olympics Games, especially,

68
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:24,165
Summer or Winter Olympics,
that are associated strictly to a city.

69
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:27,722
Through these events or large projects,

70
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:30,850
the idea is to give or change the image

71
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,040
to give a positive image,
and especially a dynamic image,

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,320
to attract as many companies as possible.

73
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,186
Another way to attract companies
are fiscal incentives.

74
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:47,376
One idea is to lower taxes to make it
economically attractive

75
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:50,930
for such or such company
to settle in a city.

76
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,497
Another possibility is for the city

77
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:56,450
to offer a very high level of services.

78
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,772
It means everything is provided:

79
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,385
transportation, water supply,
power supply,

80
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,803
all of which is working well,

81
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,676
all of which is available to companies
wishing to settle here.

82
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:12,350
Yet another strategy
is to go for luxury housing.

83
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,892
This is betting, as I mentioned earlier,
on the uppermost social classes.

84
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:19,870
To do this, we put on the market

85
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,370
a certain number of properties
belonging to the type of housing

86
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,510
these categories appreciate.

87
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,266
Finally, another strategy

88
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:36,022
to attract companies is leisure.

89
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:41,150
The idea is to put on the market
a certain number of types of activities

90
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,800
that these classes, the elite,
like to practice.

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,232
Putting these activities on the market

92
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:50,760
and making them available
may attract people.

93
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,750
Of course, it's never a single strategy

94
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,480
that is implemented,
but it's a combination

95
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,574
of several strategies
that makes it possible

96
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:02,920
to position oneself 
on the global market.

97
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,274
Here are the rankings.

98
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:09,962
This first one I have already
shown in a previous video.

99
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:15,282
We'll just gloss over them

100
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:20,542
to see that there are a few
Global Power City Index, and many more.

101
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:24,111
If we want to have a look, 
just for the sake of it,

102
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:29,086
we see there are always London, New York
and Tokyo leading the ranking.

103
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:32,238
Then, usually, follow Paris and Hong Kong.

104
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:36,281
Depending on the ranking,
Paris and Hong Kong are higher or lower,

105
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:39,040
compared to New York and London.

106
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,231
Another one: Foreign Policy.

107
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:50,211
And the last one, which ranks the cities
as Alpha ++, Alpha +, Alpha +, Béta, Gamma

108
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:55,820
regarding a certain number of criteria
that are often economic ones

109
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,134
but may also be socio-economic criteria.

110
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:02,235
This is how they rank the cities.

111
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:05,040
So there is a major interest for cities

112
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,723
to feature in these rankings,

113
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:09,980
and to rank as high as possible.

114
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,496
As a comparison,
the exact same thing is being done

115
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:15,660
with universities today,

116
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,892
for which there are several types of rankings

117
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:20,620
to rank the best universities in the world.

118
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:28,831
Here is the image that captures 
this global city: inside Dubai airport.

119
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:32,970
Dubai has concentrated its strategy

120
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,910
on welcoming influx of tourists,
and on welcoming influx of capitals.

121
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,849
This image sums up, probably,

122
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:46,886
how Dubai positioned itself
regarding globalisation.

123
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:50,590
And what about Africa,
will you ask.

124
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,630
In some cities we know very well

125
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,510
we are far from Hong Kong, 
New York or London,

126
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,932
but we realise on a day-to-day basis

127
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:05,590
that more and more projects are trying
to set some cities

128
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,360
into this global city race.

129
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,978
Strictly speaking, if we consider

130
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:14,830
economic indicators or capital flows,

131
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,671
we'll have cities in South Africa,

132
00:08:18,671 --> 00:08:22,107
probably cities in North Africa,
the few major cities,

133
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:24,123
but overall, most African cities

134
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:26,920
do not feature in the rankings
of global cities.

135
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,880
However, little by little, 
there are intents,

136
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,765
to change the image of cities
through major prestigious projects,

137
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:40,006
to move from a chaotic city
to an international city.

138
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:45,768
The most striking example of this,
at the moment,

139
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:51,582
is the major project in Tchad
of the World Trade Center,

140
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:56,261
where we imagine an exhibition centre,
a symposium centre,

141
00:08:56,261 --> 00:09:00,330
a ministry, office buildings, 
a mall, a major hotel,

142
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,100
all of it next to 
the airport of N'Djamena.

143
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,370
It is still just a project for the moment.

144
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,181
But it shows, with these 3D images,

145
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:16,340
what type of urbanisation
African cities want to undergo today.

146
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:23,150
This is an example in Tchad.
There is another one in Burkina Faso,

147
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,406
There are in Kenya, including in Nairobi,
a series of projects.

148
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:31,639
So the idea of the need 
for an international architecture

149
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,302
for major economic projects

150
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:39,072
is now widespread 
across all African cities.
