1
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:08,200
In our video today, we will discuss 
sustainable development.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,363
Surely this is a broad field, 
and we'll address

3
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:13,847
only a few aspects of it, only those

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:18,666
which will help us understand 
more globally urban issues,

5
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:23,028
and the issues of planning, of course, 
for this is our key topic.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,771
In theory, there are three spheres:

7
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:32,445
the economic sphere, the social sphere, 
and the environmental sphere.

8
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,106
These three spheres are independent,

9
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:40,674
the economy generally preceding 
the social or the environmental,

10
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:46,043
for while the link between social 
and environment exists,

11
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:50,379
it is much weaker than that between 
the economy and the environment.

12
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:54,196
The basic pattern, these three 
spheres, autonomous,

13
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:57,944
with links to one another.

14
00:00:57,944 --> 00:01:01,832
The diagram of sustainable development 
is one which utilizes

15
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:05,851
these same three spheres, 
yet they overlap

16
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:12,851
and ultimately it is at their 
intersections where we find

17
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:15,391
the questions of sustainability.

18
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,523
So in order to be sustainable, 
we must take into account

19
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:21,840
economic, social and 
environmental questions,

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,224
and their relation to one another, 
paying close attention

21
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:27,726
that one does not take 
precedence over the other.

22
00:01:28,383 --> 00:01:30,816
When we discuss sustainable development,

23
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:34,618
or sustainable urban development, 
there are two basic theories.

24
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,584
The first says that sustainable 
development is impossible,

25
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:40,516
that the term is an oxymoron,

26
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:45,866
which is to say that the two terms 
have opposite meanings.

27
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:48,947
Or there is a conflict between 
development and the environment.

28
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:51,557
We cannot have, at the same time, 
economic development

29
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:54,894
and environmental development, 
or rather one cannot

30
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:59,580
preserve environmental resources, 
if one is developing the economy.

31
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,599
This is the first theory, by those 
who begin with the questions

32
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:06,822
of reduced or lowered 
energy consumption.

33
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:10,469
The second theory says 
exactly the opposite.

34
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,721
It says that sustainable 
development is possible,

35
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:20,237
this mainly because of technology, 
and the efficiencies it provides,

36
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:24,956
in other words we can use 
technology to increase yield,

37
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:31,123
and in doing so, use less energy, 
or use it more efficiently.

38
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:34,658
This is the second theory, 
by those who are

39
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:39,358
positive about technology 
and sustainable development.

40
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:42,139
As for these two theories, we 
won't choose one or the other,

41
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:45,605
but will examine for ourselves 
a certain number of criteria

42
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:50,972
which, we believe, will lead us 
towards a sustainable city,

43
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:54,255
or in any case a sustainable 
urban development.

44
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:57,055
First, though, if one considers the work

45
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:00,921
of Newman and Kenworthy from 1999,

46
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:05,187
they present the following hypothesis, 
which is not really one,

47
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:13,805
for while they present and prove 
that this consumer curve exists,

48
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:21,371
and that the annual fuel consumption, 
per person, is directly linked to,

49
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:26,138
or has a direct relationship 
to urban density.

50
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:31,638
The denser my city, the less fuel 
I will use, as seen in Asian cities.

51
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:38,589
And the less dense the city, 
the greater the fuel utilized.

52
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:41,588
This is the model of the American city.

53
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:46,519
We see this here, American cities, 
and here, Asian cities,

54
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,019
and between the two there 
we have the European city.

55
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:55,771
Another example offered by Benoît Lefèvre,
based on the work of the same authors,

56
00:03:55,771 --> 00:04:01,371
Newman and Kenworthy, 
those of Atlanta and Barcelona.

57
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:07,059
Similar populations, urban areas

58
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:10,920
which are calculated in 
kilometers in Barcelona,

59
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,888
and hundreds or thousands of 
square kilometers in Atlanta,

60
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:25,270
We see a very different consumption, 
which proves that the denser the city,

61
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,022
with the same number of inhabitants,

62
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:33,788
the less fuel consumption or, 
more globally, energy or CO2.

63
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:40,871
It depends which indicator is used, 
but they are all linked to one another.

64
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:44,006
So, what does sustainability 
mean to us?

65
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:46,889
It's from this point of view where 
I would say that we are situated

66
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,645
neither with the first theory which doesn't 
want sustainable development to exist,

67
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:55,596
nor in the second, where we think 
that everything's fine,

68
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:59,111
it is somewhere in between 
the two, since sustainability,

69
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:06,096
when one speaks of urbanization, is still
a reduction in energy consumption.

70
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:09,595
We've just seen the curve, 
where density allows

71
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:12,062
this reduction in energy 
consumption,

72
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,444
particularly in the preservation 
of natural resources.

73
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:21,777
This is the starting point for a system 
of governance which is sustainable,

74
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:27,936
sustainable over time, while all 
rapid political change hinders

75
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:30,846
long-term project planning.

76
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:34,617
Its inverse, if the governance 
is sustainable,

77
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:38,866
one can extend projects to 
medium or long terms.

78
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:43,546
Financial impact, the same thing. 
If we imagine that

79
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:50,167
urban sustainability leads to 
financial stability in the long term,

80
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:55,145
and also has a long-term impact 
on public health, on life expectancy.

81
00:05:55,145 --> 00:06:01,989
We normally use economic 
indicators, but we can also use,

82
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:06,782
as indicators of urban sustainability,
the life expectancy of its inhabitants,

83
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:10,082
and imagine that the more 
elevated life expectancy,

84
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:11,964
the more sustainable the city.

85
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:16,908
This remains to be proved, but 
can be an indicator among others.

86
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:21,711
Finally, sustainability, at any rate 
urban sustainability,

87
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:25,028
is we can call a peaceful society,

88
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:30,828
or where numerous people live together 
with mutual understanding,

89
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:36,962
without armed conflicts, guerrillas, 
gangs, or those groups

90
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:42,505
who spread trouble and violence,
like we've seen in recent events.

91
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:45,396
So it is a peaceful society, 
which is to say that living together

92
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:48,306
is commonly embraced by all.

93
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,050
So to reduce energy consumption,

94
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,731
because this is the crux of 
the war, without a doubt,

95
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:58,664
it can be waged on construction, 
on the building.

96
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:02,248
Let's take as an example those 
buildings with little insulation,

97
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:06,697
where air conditioners are to 
the max, where energy is consumed.

98
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:09,248
There exists, in bioclimatic architecture,

99
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:11,262
and without making any 
value judgements,

100
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:14,348
possibilities to reduce 
energy consumption,

101
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:17,199
most notably the electricity 
consumed by air conditioners,

102
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,179
via natural means, of air 
circulation, cooling methods,

103
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:24,948
which have been known 
for a very, very long time.

104
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:29,132
But let's say that addressing the issue 
of buildings is a starting point.

105
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:31,613
In the North it's a question of heating,

106
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:35,347
in the South it is generally around 
the question of air conditioners,

107
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:39,382
because more often one looks 
to cool rooms, rather than heat them.

108
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:42,947
We can also address mobility,

109
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:46,730
for as we've just seen there is 
a direct dependence between

110
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,882
fuel consumption, on 
the one hand, and density.

111
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:54,278
So finally, in planning 
one can go further.

112
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:58,214
And, finally, the third aspect 
relates to individual behavior.

113
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:04,415
There are some forms of consumption 
which are causes of the urban model,

114
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:12,563
or those due to the architecture 
buildings or the building methods used,

115
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:16,514
But energy consumption depends,

116
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:23,165
primarily and directly, on 
human behavior, on lifestyle.

117
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:27,762
And it is on this last aspect where 
one have the most influence.

118
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:33,130
There are many other areas were 
we might initiate changes

119
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,600
to reduce energy consumption, 
but these are the main ones:

120
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,551
human behavior, mobility 
and built environment.

121
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:44,335
The symptomatic example of 
what one should not do,

122
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,801
when it comes to energy consumption.

123
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:50,505
We are in the city of Dubai, 
in the middle of summer.

124
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:52,896
45 degrees in the shade, outside.

125
00:08:52,896 --> 00:09:00,088
On an artificial slope, inside an 
enormous commercial center, we are skiing.

126
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:04,117
As far as energy consumption, 
there is surely nothing worse

127
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:07,526
than skiing in the middle of the desert.

128
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:10,992
To finish up this very, very quick video

129
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:14,813
on the two or three aspects 
of sustainable urban development.

130
00:09:14,813 --> 00:09:18,042
To summarize, or to conclude 
this video we could say that

131
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:26,809
what we're looking for are planning 
methods which ensure long-term effect.

132
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:31,342
We also are looking for 
decision-making structures

133
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:34,192
which allow this long-term management.

134
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:37,560
This is why we can take action
at once on these questions of energy,

135
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,359
on urban forms, housing, 
human behavior, mobility,

136
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:46,759
but we must also influence 
those government structures

137
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,883
which determine whether 
or not to implement

138
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:53,783
these efforts to lower 
energy consumption.

139
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:58,316
In our future videos on planning, 
we will keep this in mind.

140
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:03,569
How can we, today, reduce 
our daily energy bill?

141
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,349
Whether it is the cost of CO2,

142
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:10,467
or a financial one, a monetary one,

143
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:18,116
or of liters of fuel, or calories, 
whatever indicator we might use,

144
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:22,500
but the key word is the reduction 
of this energy amount, per person,

145
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,330
which one needs to live in a city.
