Settlements - African Cities:
Intro. to Urban Planning (JÃ©rome Chenal)

2
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:07,410
Hello, our video today-settlement.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,530
Now settlement is not housing.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,975
It's not just a dwelling, 
a house, a shack.

5
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:16,610
Settlement has a broader sense.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,440
Settlement is a way of organizing 
human population.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,680
There is housing, the place 
where one lives,

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,678
and also all of its annexes, 
the small alleys which service it,

9
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:33,500
the spaces in front of the house, 
or even its gardens.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,442
All of these things make up 
the settlement.

11
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:39,790
So, in certain urban neighborhoods,

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,770
we have situations where 
housing is poorly represented,

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,440
is largely minoritized, in relation to 
the overall system of the settlement.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,058
But one thing is certain,

15
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:56,090
which is that, globally,
when we speak of settlement

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,120
in African cities, we are generally 
speaking of housing.

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:08,820
The idea is confused, I would argue, 
by the classic definition of settlement,

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,748
which we must consider in 
a much broader sense.

19
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:15,383
It is thus possible 
to classify settlement

20
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:18,378
an individual settlement,
a residential settlement.

21
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,375
There are many ways to classify it.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,048
But, generally, what is most important 
is how we formulate the basis

23
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:31,160
for a typology of settlement, which is 
on its mode of production.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,562
Now, by mode of production we do not 
mean solely the type of construction,

25
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:41,816
or solely its economics, but rather 
the whole of these interventions.

26
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:48,840
We can find ourselves at the same time 
on economic, social, or technical levels.

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,280
And we define this as the mode 
of production of settlement.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,233
This mode of production encompasses 
all of the interventions

29
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:01,389
which, in one way or another, 
modify or create a settlement.

30
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:06,280
In some ways this is 
a very restrictive definition,

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,535
but it is at the same time 
a vast one,

32
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:13,650
for we find ourselves on 
extremely different levels

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,176
when it comes to levels of intervention.

34
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,380
In addition, all of these interventions 
can evolve with time.

35
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:27,764
So, the one who begins 
a settlement project

36
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:32,528
may not necessarily be the one 
who will ultimately use it.

37
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:36,285
So in these modes of production 
there are two major types:

38
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:42,053
the planned settlement, 
that of long ago,

39
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:46,680
the managed settlement, 
and the working-class settlement.

40
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,250
The planned settlement is one 
of large complexes, extensive rules,

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,834
where the state builds a certain number 
of housing units, of housing projects,

42
00:02:56,834 --> 00:03:00,338
developments on vast tracts of land.

43
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:05,050
The managed settlement is one where 
it is the private sector who is given

44
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,580
the responsibility for its construction

45
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,111
but within the relatively strict 
guidelines provided by the State.

46
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:14,247
And then we have working-class
settlements,

47
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:19,019
where there are no rules, where 
the informal is given the upper hand,

48
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,750
and the people do more or less 
as they choose.

49
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,546
I say more or less, because with 
working-class settlements there are,

50
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:29,150
if the code is not strictly 
administered by the state,

51
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,590
within working-class settlements 
there are commonly accepted rules,

52
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,866
which are those of the community,

53
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:38,104
whether in terms of construction, 
those of implantation,

54
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:41,086
or lifestyle rules between neighbors.

55
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:44,264
So it is not that there are no rules,

56
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:46,805
but simply that these are 
community-based rather than

57
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:51,480
managed either by the state 
or by local authorities.

58
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,590
Thus there are different 
parties involved in

59
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,600
the production modes of the settlement, 
and these are numerous.

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,380
The list is not necessarily exhaustive, 
but we can include the community,

61
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,094
of course the state and local authorities, 
or even private organizations.

62
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:17,230
There may also be a developer, 
whether public or private.

63
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,384
Likewise, there may be investors, 
technicians, the architect

64
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:26,730
or design office, builders and 
of course the construction company,

65
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,690
laborers, inhabitants, managers.

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,710
These are some of those who form part 
of these modes of production.

67
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,305
Naturally there is one of greater 
importance than the rest,

68
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:47,120
and that is the inhabitant, because 
this is the final recipient,

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,560
the one for whom 
the settlement was created.

70
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,260
So before moving on to 
the production chains

71
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,206
of these various participants, 
two things.

72
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:03,800
The fewer there are, the greater 
the ease of the process.

73
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,027
This seems evident.

74
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:07,054
And when speaking of settlements,

75
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:10,040
the question of financing 
becomes, in principal, central.

76
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,295
There must be, on the one hand, 
a source of funding.

77
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:20,770
The beneficiary must be financially able 
to purchase their home,

78
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,550
Whether via a loan, or in cash, 
all possibilities exist.

79
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:32,390
But he must have sufficient financial 
autonomy to secure housing.

80
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,710
Now, when we speak of 
modes of production,

81
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,730
we must include the production chain 
of the settlement.

82
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,590
This is a chain made up 
of four main links.

83
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,258
The first is public policy as it 
pertains to the settlement.

84
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:52,210
So national policy is 
the first link of our chain.

85
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,121
Next is local planning, 
the second link.

86
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:01,620
The third link is property development.

87
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,670
The fourth link, real estate.

88
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:12,180
We see that we pass 
from a national level

89
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,410
to one strictly local down to 
the parcel, to real estate.

90
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,830
Now let's return to these four links.

91
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:26,164
The first link, the national level, 
state level, public policy.

92
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:30,708
What are the problems here? Primarily
it is the question of property.

93
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:35,050
The question of property is dual; 
it is two-fold problem.

94
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,822
On the one hand, land allocation

95
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,470
in no way corresponds to demand.

96
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,530
We distribute far more plots of land 
than are needed

97
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,935
This is the first problem.

98
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:53,570
The second problem is that 
it is extremely difficult,

99
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,068
and this in most countries, 
to secure a land title.

100
00:06:57,068 --> 00:07:02,862
One can secure titles of occupancy, 
but the definitive land title,

101
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:08,644
which is deposited with the notary, 
filed and paid for,

102
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,786
is extremely difficult to obtain.

103
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:14,475
These then are two problems 
inherent in land ownership.

104
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,970
But there is also another problem, 
which is a weak banking system.

105
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,824
Indeed, if you do not have 
a banking system

106
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:27,198
which allows one to borrow money,

107
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:31,352
it will be extremely difficult 
for a section of the population

108
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,170
to obtain housing.

109
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:39,980
And because of this, many prefer 
land speculation to property ownership,

110
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:47,805
and loans within the banking market 
in African cities are very expensive.

111
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:51,558
Mortgage rates are very high,

112
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:56,300
which in no way encourages 
mortgage lending.

113
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,625
Behind this is, without a doubt,

114
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,910
a cultural element as well as

115
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,465
a lack of confidence in and use of 
the banking system.

116
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,975
Because of this many prefer to use

117
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:10,510
other systems, traditional systems,

118
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,550
to finance their housing, 
rather than turn to a bank.

119
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,040
We've seen the two principal problems 
of land-ownership, the banking system.

120
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,772
This means that certain
solutions can be found

121
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:27,545
in an overhaul of 
the land-ownership system,

122
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:32,020
an end, surely, to 
the level of speculation.

123
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,505
Perhaps this is wishful thinking.

124
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:38,966
To put in place such a system 
is extremely difficult, agreed.

125
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:44,710
But at any given moment 
we may be obligated to rethink

126
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,493
the entire land-ownership system,

127
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,706
because it won't be possible to sustain, 
decade after decade,

128
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:51,801
to put on the market land parcels,

129
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,150
and more land parcels, 
and more land parcels, etc.

130
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,482
It's impossible.

131
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:59,226
So it must be redefined, made reasonable,

132
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:00,834
with a review of all the processes

133
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:04,260
which allow one to secure a land title.

134
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:11,182
At the same time, the state clearly 
must invest in the financing of housing,

135
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:13,940
particularly that designated 
for its poorest inhabitants.

136
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,455
Finally, the banking system 
must be developed,

137
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:22,980
mortgage rates lowered, with the state 
as guarantor of this system.

138
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,660
To continue, we were on the state level, 
so let's go to the city level.

139
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,330
Three principal problems.

140
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,240
The first is the total lack of control 
in urban development.

141
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,056
We cannot get a handle 
on this development,

142
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,940
despite existing documents.

143
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,860
This is the main goal of our course,

144
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,459
to explore how we can formulate 
documents which would,

145
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,510
in fact, create a framework 
for urban development.

146
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:56,120
The second problem is 
the chronic underestimation

147
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,070
of the number of housing units 
which should be on the market.

148
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:05,760
When the number is always 
underestimated, so is the need.

149
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,792
Third, we have public authorities,

150
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:12,676
who have little to do with settlements.

151
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:16,776
There was a long period in which 
international sources of funding,

152
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:21,476
bilateral or multilateral, 
financed settlement programs.

153
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:25,840
This has been abandoned, 
and now financing is only available,

154
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,550
with few exceptions, for 
large settlement programs.

155
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,458
Communities do not have the means 
to finance themselves,

156
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,644
and suddenly there is no more 
financing available for settlements.

157
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:40,974
This is without doubt one of the main 
objectives for urban development.

158
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,360
Once again, the solution is 
to counteract these problems

159
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,902
or to put in place systems which enable

160
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:56,070
the documentation of urban planning,
and to utilize these documents.

161
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,880
These documents should be made 
with, by and for the community.

162
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,177
The final beneficiary must be able to

163
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:07,576
contribute his or her advice about 
the urban planning document.

164
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:12,230
And this document of urban planning 
must be reinforced,

165
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,914
clearly on a legal level, and must 
be enforceable against third parties.

166
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:19,860
For now, as we've seen,

167
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,600
there are zoning, land allocation 
and land-use plans,

168
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,504
which are enforceable 
against third parties.

169
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:29,310
The private should be 
subject to the same.

170
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,120
The blueprints, master plans, the SDAU, 
do not have the force of the law

171
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,370
when it comes to private, 
only public administration.

172
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,192
This, then, is our second level.

173
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:46,303
This is the level of the city.

174
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,320
Now we'll go down to 
the level of land-use.

175
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,570
The level of land-use is 
that of development.

176
00:11:53,570 --> 00:12:00,130
There still, we have created a system 
which develops the parcel or plot,

177
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,316
with the sole purpose is speculation.

178
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:06,662
There is no concern for 
urban quality behind this.

179
00:12:06,662 --> 00:12:09,840
It is no production calendar

180
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,541
behind the development 
of these land parcels.

181
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:15,622
They are created one by one 
without a vision of the whole,

182
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:21,265
without consideration of the needs 
or the parcel demands of

183
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:26,308
the final beneficiaries, but instead 
according to administrations

184
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:32,442
who create parcels here and there, 
with very good or bad reasoning.

185
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,270
We won't go there.

186
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,390
But one thing is clear, and that is that

187
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,590
we have the obligation 
to counteract this problem,

188
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,250
to provide quality housing developments.

189
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,566
To ensure that quality housing 
is developed in places

190
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:51,700
earmarked for future urban expansion.

191
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,432
We have a global plan which 
would be a master plan,

192
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:58,975
which defines zones prioritized 
for urban development,

193
00:12:58,975 --> 00:13:02,693
and these housing developments 
must be built, exactly and strictly

194
00:13:02,693 --> 00:13:05,678
in zones defined by 
the general document.

195
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:09,340
This seems relatively simple, 
when put like this

196
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,816
But the examples we have 
where this has been working

197
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:18,780
can be counted on one hand, 
of this I'm very positive.

198
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:24,410
Finally, there remains one level, 
the last link, that of the parcel,

199
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,030
which is that of real-estate development.

200
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,482
One can be one's own promoter,

201
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:32,154
or have a company hired to do 
real-estate promotion.

202
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:34,520
But we are very much 
at the level of the parcel,

203
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,940
and on this level there are 
two principal problems.

204
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,346
The problem is the relationship 
with businesses.

205
00:13:41,346 --> 00:13:44,730
It is no longer, for the 
most part, in most cities,

206
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,930
about businesses, but rather 
about workers who do masonry.

207
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,600
Or of businesses already formed, 
teams, totally informal,

208
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,256
who do not have the minimum of
knowledge or competency

209
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:02,346
required for the technical 
aspects of building,

210
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:04,404
They are without doubt 
full of good intention,

211
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:07,092
but do not have the skills and 
techniques needed for building,

212
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:10,500
which makes the quality 
of construction often unreliable.

213
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,970
Another critical problem 
with real-estate promotion

214
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,580
is the price fluctuation 
of material costs.

215
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:27,390
A ton of cement can very quickly 
double the cost of concrete blocks.

216
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:33,160
If you begin with one price, and 
a few months later it has doubled,

217
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,259
this poses problems; it poses 
financing problems, surely.

218
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,225
These price fluctuations of materials

219
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:44,800
which has never been 
stabilized on a state level,

220
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,620
presents problems even on 
a neighborhood level.

221
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,903
As the price increases, as the price 
of a ton of cement increases

222
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:58,540
we see a halt, in some neighborhoods, 
of nearly all construction.

223
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,874
In fact, when we speak of housing,

224
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:03,980
we are often speaking of social housing.

225
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,696
Why? Because housing for those 
who are relatively well off,

226
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:14,506
or middle class, poses few problems

227
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:18,250
when compared to the number 
of poor who need housing.

228
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,864
And to provide housing for the poorest,

229
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:23,514
one needs an intervention by 
the state, or by other funders.

230
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:26,228
But without intervention 
from the outside,

231
00:15:26,228 --> 00:15:30,720
the only real-estate promotion 
by the poorest population,

232
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,816
for the poorest of the population,

233
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:37,080
is extremely difficult, and leads to 
the development of slums.

234
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,116
If we want to have an increase 
in construction quality,

235
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:46,520
we must return to these programs, 
and to obligatory state aid.

236
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,362
This plan is an extremely easy one.

237
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:53,240
We finally have standards.

238
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,235
These are the norms, the standards 
of construction.

239
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:02,470
The standards in housing 
are going down, for example.

240
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:09,968
And then here, whether in 
dollars or euros,

241
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:14,622
it is the cost of the standard norm.

242
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:22,100
And then, this is the income 
of the population.

243
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,724
We see that between 
this standard, this norm,

244
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:32,458
and income, there is 
a gap, a differential,

245
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:38,176
and this differential should 
be taken into account,

246
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:40,710
by public authorities.

247
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:49,925
This differential, is aid to 
the most modest households.

248
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:54,487
There are two possibilities 
to fill this gap.

249
00:16:58,511 --> 00:17:01,867
There is the possibility 
of offering assistance,

250
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:06,159
or assisting those who ask for it.

251
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:13,214
To offer assistance means 
to price land modestly.

252
00:17:13,214 --> 00:17:17,179
We can develop the land 
without being paid for it.

253
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,963
We can build at moderate prices.

254
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:21,704
This is what will go on the market.

255
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:26,265
One can offer aid as materials or land.

256
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:32,028
Aid on demand is based on a system 
of borrowing and spending.

257
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:37,212
On assists with borrowing, for example,

258
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:42,820
with a 0% financing, or lowered rates, 
with special duration,

259
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,600
or we put in place a system of savings.

260
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,880
We can imagine that 
the baseline here is lower

261
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,825
than normal, but we have 
these two possibilities.

262
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,460
There is supply, and there is demand.

263
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,587
So with housing programs, 
we must find out

264
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:02,537
where we stand, whether on 
the side of supply or demand,

265
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:06,550
or if we try, in an integral manner, 
to blend these two forms of assistance,

266
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,560
to balance at the same time 
supply and demand.

267
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,156
Surely, by linking together the two, 
we can achieve results

268
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:15,790
which are no doubt better, 
and much quicker,

269
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,924
than aid offered based only 
on supply or on demand.

270
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,669
We've touched briefly on 
the question of settlements,

271
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,511
the four links in the production 
of settlements,

272
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:29,260
from the state level, 
to that of the land parcel.

273
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,481
And then, some considerations 
on aid to the poorest

274
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:36,825
because this is the crux 
when it comes to settlements.

275
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:40,295
It is surely settlements, for those 
populations with the lowest incomes

276
00:18:40,295 --> 00:18:44,150
where we must succeed 
for urban integration.
