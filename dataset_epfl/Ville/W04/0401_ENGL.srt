1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,540
In this video we are going to talk about 
facilities and infrastructure.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,550
Let's start with facilities.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,685
So when we talk about public facilities,

4
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:16,250
we are talking primarily of users.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,620
The users, are the very reason,
for the existence of public facilities.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,280
Without users, inevitably no facilities.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,449
Then, to the user, who is the individual
who is going to use the facilities,

8
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:32,040
we must also add the service users.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,070
Service users, take for example 
a school, the user

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,840
is the student and and the service user 
is the professor or the teacher.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,080
Another example, at the hospital, 
the doctor is the service user

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,320
and the patient is the user.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,562
There, we differentiate between 
these two types of people.

14
00:00:54,255 --> 00:01:00,060
In countries where 
the state is in deficit,

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,305
or where the state is struggling to pay,
all the facilities, we can use the users

16
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:06,833
to create a certain number of facilities.

17
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,705
So the users are going to help
financially, whether by

18
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:15,370
manual labor in the construction of 
a certain number of facilities.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,990
So, if we try to group 
or classify facilities

20
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,716
we have several parameters 
that may be considered.

21
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:34,501
We can classify facilities that are 
either structuring facilities,

22
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:38,140
or accompanying facilities.

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,044
The structuring facilities are the

24
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:45,217
main facilities and the 
accompanying facilities

25
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:50,862
are the small facilities that are not 
necessarily essential to the whole

26
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:55,771
of the urban system. 
Then we can also

27
00:01:55,771 --> 00:02:00,198
group once again the facilities

28
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:07,523
depending on their size, 
status or their function.

29
00:02:07,523 --> 00:02:11,154
In regards to the planning,

30
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:13,126
we can plan.

31
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:19,328
We have, once again, three, four, five
levels, depending on the countries, but

32
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:26,175
we are going from state to neighborhood 
as a general rule.

33
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:31,050
So we are moving from state
planning to regional,

34
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,040
of urban area, of municipality, 
of neighborhood.

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,940
And its management is 
exactly the same.

36
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,465
We can move from state to 
neighborhood with, initially,

37
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:47,530
something very centralized 
at the state level

38
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,452
and something totally decentralized,
that goes back to the local collective

39
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:55,817
and which is managed
by the neighborhood people themselves.

40
00:02:57,432 --> 00:03:01,105
So when speaking of creating 
facilities, we have, I would say

41
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:02,960
a current position.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,420
Now is the time, of course, and then

43
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,014
it's the variable which is the number 
of people or the percentage,

44
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:19,681
we can do both, of the population which 
has access to the base facilities.

45
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:23,164
So the reality is almost that and then

46
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:29,054
we always have the same number 
who has access to these facilities.

47
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:33,540
On the other hand, the population 
increases like this.

48
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,888
So that's what makes it

49
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:39,770
so that the gap is so large and that 
there are less and less

50
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,658
people as we go along, who have 
access to the facilities.

51
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:52,781
The objective, of course, is one 
where we would have here almost

52
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:57,747
a contact point between on one hand 
people that have access to facilities

53
00:03:57,747 --> 00:04:01,876
in this low area and the increase 
in population.

54
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,256
So the objective would be that

55
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:09,190
everyone has access to the facilities
in a sustainable manner.

56
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,550
The reality is unfortunately
quite the opposite,

57
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,200
it's that we have facilities where 
people arrive casually,

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,644
increased thanks to a certain 
number of programs but the population,

59
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:27,911
like in the first diagram, 
is always expanding.

60
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:31,640
So the final gap here,

61
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,241
x is a little bit smaller

62
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:43,588
than in the current situation but
the level of service, the number of people

63
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:45,858
who have access to the facilities remains

64
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:48,150
extremely low compared 
to what it should be.

65
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,566
So there, basically, between
the current situation,

66
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:56,088
and the objectives, we have a 
real situation and we realize

67
00:04:56,088 --> 00:05:03,133
that the population increase is such that 
we would need a huge adjustment

68
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:07,238
in terms of facilities, equip the 
neighborhoods, equip the areas

69
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:11,186
and since these facilities 
are extremely expensive,

70
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,850
it is very unlikely for us
to be able to adjust

71
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,734
and that we would, in the next 
few years, find ourselves

72
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:22,180
in the second situation which is 
the situation of the objective.

73
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,800
Hence the problem, both of facilities and 
of the demand of facilities.

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,976
So the demand increases.

75
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:30,578
Why?

76
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:35,472
Because, we saw it earlier, there is
a population increase.

77
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:40,628
So this absolute number, the increase, if 
I take water for example,

78
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:44,350
the number of liters per person, we are
no longer talking about facilities.

79
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,470
We are already in the realm of
infrastructure, we'll talk it about later

80
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,210
but for my demonstration, 
water is the perfect example.

81
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,538
We see that with the number of people 
increasing, the quantity of water that

82
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:02,860
I have to put at their disposition will 
be larger- but we also know that with time,

83
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,746
the consumption, the number of liters
of clean water per person, is increasing.

84
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:12,533
So I have this double increase 
and it's exactly

85
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,131
the same thing with the facilities.

86
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:18,383
We are dealing at once 
with a population that increases

87
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:23,669
so a need for health centers, 
a need for hospitals that increases,

88
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,190
and at the same time, the number
of consultations increases also.

89
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,788
So we have greater tendency 
to go more and more,

90
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:35,037
of course according to its means, but 
more and more at the doctor's office.

91
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:36,747
So we have this double increase

92
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:39,210
making it so that the facility 
has to respond to this.

93
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,130
And taking into account the scarce 
resources, at the city level,

94
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,702
at the state level, at the local 
collective level, we finally have the gap

95
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:51,890
that is growing between people 
who have access to these facilities and

96
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,330
the people who have no access 
at all to these facilities.

97
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,218
Let's move on now to infrastructures.

98
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,136
So we define infrastructures as

99
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:03,111
being the necessary factors in the
functioning of the urban area.

100
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:05,094
So the urban infrastructure is

101
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:07,710
for the urban system, for
the functioning of it.

102
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,906
So we can have at both buildings,

103
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:14,928
warehouses, pipelines, these
kinds of things.

104
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:17,586
All this helps with the functioning of it.

105
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:24,350
Let's take the example of aviation. 
The infrastructure is the airport.

106
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,810
It helps in the functioning 
of the aerial system.

107
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,016
We don't need to have 
in the open sky

108
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,980
other types of infrastructures 
for the planes.

109
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:37,072
But in order for the plan to take off 
and land we need infrastructure.

110
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,364
This helps the system.

111
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:40,866
It is the same with water,

112
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:43,848
with electricity, with all these 
types of networks.

113
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:47,239
Also we have to take a look at, in the 
broad sense, the term infrastructure.

114
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:50,385
This infrastructure is finally 
also a question

115
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:53,193
of services, of the quality of services.

116
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:55,968
For the infrastructure, in order for 
the water infrastructure to work,

117
00:07:55,968 --> 00:08:01,427
we have both pipelines
but also standpipe managers

118
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,416
people who will read the meters

119
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,496
in your home and ultimately 
it requires in any case

120
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:08,880
a user like for the facilities.

121
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,310
Here also the user becomes, 
I would say the reference point

122
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,340
of the infrastructure as he was 
that of the facility.

123
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,216
So we are going to see exactly what 
are the facilities,

124
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:24,870
what is the minimum facility that would
allow the urban system to function.

125
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,776
Above all, it's not really a facility 
but we have to provide it

126
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,535
for the memory because

127
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:33,868
it's important, it needs 
available land.

128
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:38,852
At the same time to create facilities
but also to place users.

129
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,799
So without available land, there is 
no possible urbanization.

130
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,924
Then, there need to be means 
of transportation, water systems,

131
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:53,744
water drainage, household waste 
drainage, of electricity,

132
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:58,501
of telephone and internet, of course, 
more and more.

133
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:00,226
So, available land.

134
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:02,456
We have already indicated it a little bit.

135
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:06,886
It is necessary to create 
these infrastructures.

136
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:08,644
Of course available land 
is also needed

137
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:12,190
so that the users can settle, can live.

138
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,865
But without land, there
are great difficulties.

139
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:19,889
Sometimes, they are not available and
people are going to be displaced to put up

140
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:24,526
infrastructure but it's the essential
condition, the basic condition

141
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:29,740
that there be lands available on which 
infrastructure can be created.

142
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,491
We are talking about means of 
transportation but

143
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:33,168
we are more on the topic 
of road infrastructure,

144
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:37,099
we are talking about roads and we see 
that, in theory, in the city centers and

145
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:41,153
the major roadways, the roads are 
asphalted and then the farther we get

146
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:44,500
from the major roadways, closer to the 
neighborhoods, the less asphalted the roads.

147
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,630
So the road between cities is extremely 
important as it allows

148
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,030
easier connections or not but also

149
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,339
in the very interior 
of the urban perimeter.

150
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:57,220
It's extremely important for 
the large roadways

151
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,990
to have a certain number 
of asphalted roads.

152
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,758
So these asphalted roads, are 
in theory the national roads

153
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:09,828
which means that each area from 
the main city,

154
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:15,032
goes in every direction in a particular 
area, in another city.

155
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:19,003
Meaning that since the only 
asphalted roads are

156
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:24,718
the national roads, we have a development 
like this, we have to with each

157
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:30,967
national road that starts along the road.

158
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:36,043
It is difficult to have a compact 
urbanization, when we have roadways

159
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:38,594
that develop and urbanization in general

160
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:42,800
that develops around or along 
the asphalted roads.

161
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,585
Then, we have water systems for clean 
water, the main urban infrastructure.

162
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:52,640
It's more important to have systems 
for water than for roads.

163
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,010
Often it's the opposite 
of what is financed.

164
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,748
But it is extremely important and
we can see that

165
00:10:57,748 --> 00:11:00,634
there is an entire system 
that is organized

166
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:03,793
since there are water mains that reach

167
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:06,632
the neighborhoods, then, 
often we have

168
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:13,184
standpipes with operators, with people 
that will bring it, house by house,

169
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:16,030
in large metallic barrels of water.

170
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,614
So there is a whole system

171
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:22,268
and an entire economy that is developing
around clean water.

172
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:25,599
Drainage of waste water.

173
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,700
It's often the poor relative 
of the infrastructure.

174
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,700
We have both clear water 
and waste water.

175
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,604
It's very rare to have waste water

176
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:35,796
drainage systems that work.

177
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:39,084
They can perhaps be found in city centers
but the farther we get

178
00:11:39,084 --> 00:11:43,500
from the suburbs, the more these
are individual systems

179
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,841
on the plot which are septic tanks 
that are emptied

180
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:50,856
from time to time, or rather, no
system at all for the drainage

181
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:55,610
of waste water and waste, in particular 
fecal waste, remains on the plot.

182
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,307
Drainage of household waste.

183
00:11:58,307 --> 00:12:01,920
The same phenomenon as for the 
waste water drainage.

184
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,418
Certain systems are in place but 
don't necessarily reach

185
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:08,256
all of the neighborhoods and 
we see here and there

186
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:14,027
entire garbage dumps, since people 
have to store it not on their own plot

187
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:17,931
in the public space, but store the 
garbage in front of their house.

188
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:20,110
We then have the power grid network.

189
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,421
So there is a paradox when it comes to 
the power grid network,

190
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,850
some consider it a luxury.

191
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,691
Indeed we can live without electricity

192
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:29,990
it's more difficult to live without water.

193
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,015
However electricity allows, 
for the development

194
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:36,283
of crafts or of business,

195
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:41,260
some refrigerators, some electrical
appliances that can operate and can

196
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,760
allow for the development of an activity.

197
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,701
The paradox is that it is a luxury 
but it is the network

198
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,990
that without a doubt costs 
the least to put in place.

199
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,616
Since it is just some wires and 
some posts

200
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:58,883
comparing it to a road network, comparing 
it to a water systems network,

201
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:02,538
which are the networks in the latter, 
that are buried

202
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:05,034
therefore are extremely 
expensive to put in place.

203
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,330
The power grid system is

204
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,140
something that is relatively superficial.

205
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,356
However, the costs of electricity, 
the costs of production are such

206
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:16,120
that it's not necessarily what will be 
put in place first in a neighborhood.

207
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,440
Generally, we go from the road, then 
the waterways, then electricity.

208
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,760
Good.

209
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,640
We should without a doubt go 
from waterways first,

210
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,850
to the road next and then why not, 
to electricity.

211
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,547
Then it's about asking questions

212
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:38,021
about the telephone network really, 
there is a cabled network that

213
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:42,307
some countries still have, 
almost everywhere.

214
00:13:42,307 --> 00:13:46,549
Today's question: with the
development of the cellphone,

215
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:51,960
is it still useful to foresee telephone
networks in neighborhoods?

216
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,781
So this shows quite well that the 
standards that will be

217
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:57,070
put in place, the level of facilities,

218
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,029
can change with time.

219
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,606
There are things that 
are more immutable

220
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:06,148
than others but in the case of 
the telephone in particular

221
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:11,870
some have never had access to cabling, 
to telephone networks

222
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:17,707
and today have access to 
communication via the cellphone.

223
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:20,878
The question will be with the Internet.

224
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:25,100
In most of the African cities, they
have gone directly to a WiFi network

225
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,664
to a wireless network, rather 
than imagine

226
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:32,349
that one day there was going to be cabling
and the existing telephone networks

227
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:36,369
were going to be used perhaps, 
in particular for the Internet.

228
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:40,167
So a certain number could be cabled

229
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,770
but in the majority of cases

230
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,638
we realized that maybe 
it's a WiFi network

231
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:49,480
that is the most adapted to the
situation of African cities today.

232
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,598
So there are some synthesis factors.

233
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:55,752
First about the costs.

234
00:14:55,752 --> 00:15:00,600
Electric networks cost little, the road 
network is extremely expensive.

235
00:15:02,046 --> 00:15:03,480
Arbitration must be conducted when

236
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,738
there is an available sum to supply,

237
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:09,921
in a general sense, 
to service a neighborhood

238
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:12,871
or a new subdivision, there must be 
questions asked about the costs

239
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,670
of the various networks.

240
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,714
There are two types of networks,

241
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:21,900
there are those from which it is possible
to obtain cost-recovery.

242
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,833
It is the power grid network since 
electricity will have fees charged,

243
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,560
it's the water network since it will be
be charged by the liter or by cubic meter.

244
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,756
On the other hand, when it comes 
to waste water drainage,

245
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:36,050
household waste, it's extremely difficult

246
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,910
since the mechanisms possible for

247
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,490
cost-recovery have not yet been found,

248
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,966
in particular for waste water drainage.

249
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:47,233
Finally, there is sometimes a distinction

250
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:50,213
to be made between what seems to us, 
I spoke of water

251
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:52,491
earlier, which seems to me

252
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:55,908
totally legitimate and what the 
perception of the people.

253
00:15:55,908 --> 00:16:00,166
The rural populations that 
arrive to the city

254
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,370
don't have the idea that 
the water network,

255
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,222
the waterways of clean water 
are a priority.

256
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:09,512
They are used to doing otherwise,

257
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:13,232
in particular, going to the well, finding
a variety of ways

258
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:16,289
but definitely not having a faucet by

259
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:19,960
which clean water can be obtained.

260
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,891
It's not their priority, for the 
rural people that arrive.

261
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:28,610
However, we have to have an arbitration, 
because we know there is a balance

262
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,493
between the level of facility, between 
a certain number of facilities

263
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,510
and infrastructure and public 
health in particular.

264
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:40,218
So then it is possible to organize 
these various factors

265
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:44,142
in the form of a grid, that we call 
a needs grid.

266
00:16:44,142 --> 00:16:53,392
Very quickly, we have here the
infrastructure, for example

267
00:16:53,392 --> 00:17:00,616
water supply, roads, etc.

268
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:05,748
And on the other hand we have

269
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:10,642
the basic needs, the first level,

270
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:14,737
second, third, fourth,

271
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:19,496
we can continue like this depending 
on the level of service desired

272
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:24,194
So I'm going to take the example
here of water.

273
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:33,348
It's a number, liters per person, per day.

274
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:37,845
Some lenders give us 30, others 25,

275
00:17:37,845 --> 00:17:44,383
in reality we often have less than 
25 liters of water per day and per person.

276
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:47,624
So we could imagine that the first level

277
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:54,428
is 50 liters, the second 100 liters 
and the third 400.

278
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:59,180
Or rather, we can imagine that the first 
is 30 since we started below 25,

279
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:05,485
then we are at 40 and the maximum
at the third level is 50.

280
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08,399
So all of this, this question,

281
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:12,180
it must be treated according 
to the context.

282
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,809
All cities do not have the 
exact access to water

283
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:21,831
and finally, this sum at the third level 
here, the quantity of maximum water

284
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:26,836
has to depend on the geographical 
context, morphological of course ,

285
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:30,268
on the possibility of having or not 
having water for the residents.

286
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:33,467
In the Sahel or Sahara, we will not have

287
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,438
the same number here as 
in the heart of

288
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:39,410
tropical areas, this seems 
extremely obvious.

289
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,353
So we can define a certain 
number of levels.

290
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:49,614
Let's take five levels and then it is 
possible to say to what they

291
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:54,110
correspond, what type of work, what type 
of services correspond to what level.

292
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,540
So for the first level, 
we are talking about basic things.

293
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,360
This just means clearing the brush 
and limiting the plots.

294
00:19:08,835 --> 00:19:10,660
Second level.

295
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,750
Roadways profile, perhaps of the laterite,

296
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,552
perhaps lightly of a large paved highway

297
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:21,290
the edges of waterways that are coming,

298
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,615
very little at the beginning and the 
possibility of an electricity supply

299
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:28,520
for the community needs.

300
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:38,370
Third level, the highway network, 
maybe a little bit more paved.

301
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:44,490
We can imagine having roadsides, 
sanitation facilities, in any case,

302
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,560
ditches that allow rainwater to drain.

303
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,795
In terms of water,

304
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:55,780
either we develop the standpipes, 
or we can imagine

305
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,605
a clean water network and maybe electrical

306
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:06,916
that before used to serve only to the 
supply of public facilities,

307
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:11,010
may now also be used for public lighting.

308
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,952
Fourth level.

309
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,850
The highway network, we increase 
the amount of asphalted highways

310
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,309
and the sanitation is not much more 
than ditches that are dug

311
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:24,419
in the ground, but have a particular 
profile and are hard-surfaced.

312
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,110
Finally, the fifth level.

313
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,991
It is of course, the previous level plus

314
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:35,609
electricity issues where we can 
imagine the possibilities

315
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,490
of individual connections to the plot

316
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,370
as well as water systems 
or we can imagine

317
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:47,292
for all the plots this time a possibility 
of individual connection.

318
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:51,240
So there we have quickly examined
the facilities and infrastructures.

319
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,506
What is important to remember is that 
we have various

320
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:57,886
levels of facilities that are various
levels of services

321
00:20:57,886 --> 00:21:01,550
that are given to the population, 
that these facilities,

322
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,700
that these infrastructure have a cost, 
have a construction cost.

323
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,536
To build a network has a cost.

324
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:12,104
But they also have management costs as 
well, managing the network on a

325
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:17,230
daily basis has a cost when it needs to be 
renovated years later, there is also a cost

326
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,540
behind this which is the cost of 
updating the infrastructures.

327
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,070
So three types of costs 
must be considered.

328
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,865
In general, only the construction cost 
is taken into account

329
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:31,420
and then what happens doesn't 
matter very much.

330
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,245
If we want to create long-term 
sustainable planning,

331
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:35,792
it's not only the construction cost that

332
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:38,782
has to be taken into account but 
the operating cost also,

333
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:43,450
finally the cost of updating 
these infrastructures.
