1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,926
In our video, the issue of property.

2
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:14,050
First, we are going to mention tradition. 
Customary land law.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:20,960
In the customary norm of land law, 
the land belongs to the collective.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,252
There is a land chief who distributes 
land, but under no circumstances

5
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:30,996
can the land be privatized, 
so it belongs to everyone.

6
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:35,060
In this state of things, man 
is but an usufructuary.

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,118
There is no financial transaction,

8
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:43,276
He cannot buy or sell but he
can benefit from the land.

9
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,058
It was the customary norm, and

10
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:50,316
when the colonial administration 
imposed its rules

11
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:55,164
land administration was centralized, 
it was no longer the land chief but

12
00:00:55,164 --> 00:01:01,460
the colonial administration who was 
the owner of all of these lands.

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,861
It's the administration that is then 
going to distribute, give titles.

14
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:10,975
So we went from a collective ownership to 
a private ownership, and we obviously

15
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:18,220
go from community management to 
centralized management.

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,653
Where once there was a 
customary occupation

17
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:28,100
of land and then colonial 
property provisions,

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,797
we have today a property use system

19
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:37,622
that is extremely diverse.

20
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:42,536
We have both private property but also

21
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:47,758
registered lease, lease in the form 
of a cooperative,

22
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:54,563
there are still customary occupations 
and then there is a whole intermediate

23
00:01:54,563 --> 00:02:00,441
that goes from property and 
the most strict title

24
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:04,132
to land to the totally 
informal occupation with

25
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:08,492
between the two, all of these 
intermediate phases that exist.

26
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:12,280
We are not going to detail the board,

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,187
it's in the attached documents, it's 
up to you to take the time,

28
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:24,060
for those who wish, to look 
carefully at what it contains.

29
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:29,223
So when we discuss land legislation 
We must ask only one question,

30
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:30,920
to whom does land belong to?

31
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,470
It can be to the state,

32
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,674
the collective or to a private entity.

33
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:40,810
It's to whom does it belong, so we 
are discussing the right,

34
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,295
who holds the right poses three problems: 
the question of tenure,

35
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:49,190
the question of identification and 
the question of recognition.

36
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,766
It's not simply a matter of 
being an owner, it's also

37
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:55,622
about the others knowing 
that you are the owner.

38
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:57,360
It must also be registered.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,440
I must also be able to keep
my property rights

40
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,734
throughout the years and not have 
someone else appropriate them.

41
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,808
This seems in a certain context

42
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:09,836
extremely strange to speak of

43
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:13,759
this type of thing, but in 
the African cities

44
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,845
this is an everyday problem.

45
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:17,690
Land tenure.

46
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,426
I have a property, how will I be 
able to keep my property

47
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:25,078
as long as possible?

48
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:27,276
Now, some findings on real estate,

49
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:31,085
so in Sub-Saharan Africa we have a 
strong horizontal growth.

50
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:31,835
Why?

51
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:37,320
Because real estate, is less 
expensive than multi-floor buildings.

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,199
At the same time, there is a process 
of decentralization that means

53
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,870
that the territory has to be cut up 
and we realize that we have new

54
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,394
perimeters of intervention, that each 
collective has a new perimeter

55
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:57,843
with a complete redefinition 
of property rights.

56
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:03,514
There is a significant retreat of 
the state, which is slowly disengaging,

57
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:05,574
in regards to rights, not necessarily

58
00:04:05,574 --> 00:04:09,798
in regards to finance, we have owners, 
who have their piece to say,

59
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:14,061
not only about the role of the 
state and public collectives,

60
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:18,816
but the final owner, the final user, 
whether owner or not,

61
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:22,820
of the remainder, is an important 
element of the equation.

62
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,050
There is an extremely difficult
ground management,

63
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,390
we notice that even though 
the customary law

64
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,249
has been abandoned in the 
urban perimeters for

65
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:38,210
decades now, it still endures today,

66
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,390
if we begin the story of property in 
Douala we realize that even today

67
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,370
one of the biggest problems is 
the issue of customary law.

68
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,930
We have territory development that 
is problematic, why problematic?

69
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,163
Because, really, no one is interested,

70
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:03,580
we take themes, we take the issues
in a completely different way

71
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,845
however we don't identify them

72
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:08,870
as being territory development issues.

73
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,050
So there it is, when we are 
discussing property.

74
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,190
We have looked at some issues, 
that we are unable to manage.

75
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,245
So this means that urban sprawl 
continues, this means

76
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:21,845
that the city develops without there

77
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:25,136
being a strict management on 
behalf of the public collectives

78
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:28,780
or of the state on the ground

79
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,370
and as a result, we must ask ourselves 
the question: What to do about it?

80
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,820
Should we anticipate, or 
should we adjust?

81
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,640
Here we are looking at a case study, on
a hypothesis, where you can choose.

82
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,746
Anticipation is extremely difficult,
there are few examples where this works.

83
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:50,640
We are almost always adjusting.

84
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,270
Why?

85
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,790
Because the social practices,

86
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,380
because the demand, because
the demographic pressure

87
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,195
are in every case much more rapid

88
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:01,314
and much stronger than the reaction

89
00:06:01,314 --> 00:06:05,082
of the administration, be it 
centralized or decentralized.

90
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:09,617
So we are unable to anticipate things, 
and we are constantly taking

91
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:13,120
adjustment measures, in any case, 
at the property level.

92
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,320
The urban slum, the poor 
neighborhoods are an

93
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,227
extremely striking example of these 
thematics, that is to say

94
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:23,706
that we let it happen, why?

95
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:25,848
Because there was 
no other possiblity

96
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,495
than to let it happen and once

97
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:32,308
the slum is in place, once, often, that 
it becomes solidified, we try

98
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:38,692
somehow, to build roads and 
to plan the land development,

99
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:44,060
to give titles to people, to create 
parcels in the poor neighborhoods.

100
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,160
Anticipation would be in the 
form of sub-divisions but

101
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,556
we saw earlier

102
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:51,442
the sub-division is often planned

103
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:55,100
for good reasons but also for 
very bad reasons.

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,522
Finally, there are some other big 
property issues,

105
00:06:58,522 --> 00:07:02,308
when we project in the future, 
forecasting issues,

106
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:05,806
it is knowing how these resources 
are going to be managed,

107
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:09,174
as we imagine that these resources 
have an end, that we are going to

108
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:12,770
try to understand and imagine, how are
we going to be able to continue

109
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,064
to parcel out while knowing that

110
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:19,010
one day we will need, to reduce in any case,

111
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,450
maybe not stop, but reduce the rapid 
progress of sub-divisions.

112
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,010
There is also the question 
of finances also,

113
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,170
since it's one of the big urban economies,

114
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,738
that of property, knowing what 
the mechanisms are that

115
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:34,696
would allow to recuperate one part 
of this surplus land value

116
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:36,630
that is created by property.

117
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:42,342
There it is, quickly described, 
some property issues.

118
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:45,398
All these things, we will not have the 
time to go in depth about the issue

119
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:50,300
of property, we could do a whole MOOC 
about property in Africa,

120
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,762
the connection between modern law 
and customary law, without a doubt

121
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:59,420
is not the goal, the goal is only to 
put forth some questioning,

122
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,140
some problems that we've identified, 
and to say well here,

123
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:09,767
we have issues with property, which is 
first and foremost a speculative issue.

124
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:13,930
So there are huge financial issues 
when discussing property.

125
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,842
It is for this reason that property is

126
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:22,730
one of the biggest, even the biggest 
problem of the African city.
