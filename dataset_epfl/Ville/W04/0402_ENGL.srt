1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,005
Welcome to our video dedicated 
to public spaces.

2
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:10,820
We are going to take a 
look at space issues.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,290
We are going to see 
how to define them.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,445
We are going to see the difference between
a public space and public spaces.

5
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,495
And then we will show examples.

6
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:22,925
The first is the construction 
of a public space

7
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:25,628
in the N'Djamena city center.

8
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:26,518
The second,

9
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:29,370
is a method of capturing
public space.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,557
A photographic method that allows 
to see modifications, changes

11
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:39,120
throughout the day, that occur before
our eyes, in the public space.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,050
How to define public space? 
Several solutions.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,330
We can define it by its issues, we will
see what the issues are later.

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,698
We can define it by its atmosphere.

15
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:51,930
We can define it by its players.

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,909
But we can also define it 
by its context, its form or

17
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:03,780
rather by its connection between what
is public and what is private.

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,075
The big themes of public space,

19
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:10,675
the issues, the themes that then 
become issues.

20
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:14,616
The first, without a doubt, 
the most important maybe,

21
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,020
is the question of infrastructures.

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:23,216
Then, there is the question of public
or private transportation plus mobility.

23
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:29,912
The environmental question 
is fundamental.

24
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:35,978
Occupation versus management 
of the space.

25
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:38,645
The question of built space.

26
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:42,095
There are a certain number of 
public spaces that are

27
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:46,130
built spaces, I'm thinking 
specifically of markets.

28
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,624
The street, is also a resource. 
People live off the street

29
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:56,735
and by the street. 
But public space can be

30
00:01:56,735 --> 00:02:04,149
a space of protest, a space 
where a certain number

31
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,553
of civil or civic activities occur.

32
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:12,933
Then, public space is

33
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:18,080
a violent space, be it real or assumed.

34
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,964
And finally, it's a daily life space

35
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:26,330
where we pass by, where we stop, 
where we discuss.

36
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,340
These are the big themes of 
public space as we define them.

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,492
With all these big themes,

38
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:40,153
we combine about all the 
questions linked to public spaces.

39
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:43,440
So, should we say public space
or public spaces?

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,580
The distinction is made by Thierry Paquot, 
which is very useful here.

41
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,728
Public spaces is when we are 
talking about something physical,

42
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:59,056
it's the network support, 
the question of

43
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:02,648
the organization of architecture, 
the question of urban design.

44
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:05,551
But we understand that 
the public spaces

45
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:08,417
it's the network of roadways, 
of spaces.

46
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:11,130
And we have on the other hand, 
public space

47
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,223
which is the political space, 
as it is defined by Habermas.

48
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:19,249
It is connected with political sciences, 
the social sciences here,

49
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:23,224
and more with architecture, 
as we saw earlier.

50
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:27,675
And it's the space of politics, 
therefore the space of protest.

51
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,030
There it is.

52
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,614
Between the public space which is
an immaterial space,

53
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:34,810
space of the politic of protest and

54
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,550
public spaces which are the material

55
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,980
and spatial network of 
streets and places.

56
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,476
We have a cursor, like this, which 
shifts more to one side, or more

57
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:51,492
so to the other with a possible 
superposition in the middle,

58
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:55,975
at once of a space of protest which 
would be a real and physical space.

59
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:59,795
And the example we most 
often have in mind

60
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:03,827
for this type of things is La Sorbonne
in Abidjan which was

61
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:09,544
in any case before the crisis, 
the perfect place of protest

62
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:11,890
or at least of a part of the protest.

63
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,604
Of course, there was only part 
of the population that came out.

64
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:18,762
But where, freely, more or less 
freely, we are going to

65
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:23,090
discuss about political questions, 
about societal questions.

66
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,274
And then at the same time, 
this space is quite real,

67
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:28,100
since it's a public space 
where people can go.

68
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,601
So we have at the same time 
the question of the immaterial

69
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:34,836
of protests and the question of 
the public material space.

70
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:38,030
So it's for this as well 
as to facilitate,

71
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,870
we go from public space 
to public spaces.

72
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,878
So when we speak of public space

73
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:48,400
or of public spaces, we have 
seen the difference.

74
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,550
We must talk about public domain.

75
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,268
It's often the network, of roadways

76
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:57,200
and places that belong to 
their local collectives.

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,509
Okay.

78
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,150
And then there are the spaces 
open to the public.

79
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,036
Spaces that can be private but 
are considered

80
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:10,320
public spaces since everyone 
can have access.

81
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,330
It's the case, in particular 
of big private markets.

82
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,744
So, we must make the clear distinction

83
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:19,580
between the virtual space of protest, 
the public space.

84
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,108
Public spaces which are the network

85
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:25,560
of streets, of spaces, that are 
physically there.

86
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,850
The public domain which is really,

87
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,210
which corresponds to the land title
and the spaces which

88
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,500
are open to the public, 
but which are not.

89
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,263
These are the private spaces.

90
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:42,031
During our research we have 
been able to put forth

91
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:46,320
a certain number of structuring 
factors of space.

92
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,846
I am referring to the bibliography and 
the book "The West-African City".

93
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,799
But like its thesis, we have been able to

94
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,857
put forth that there are
three structuring factors.

95
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:56,730
The first, is the question of climate.

96
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,294
The fact that we are in
a warm and humid climate

97
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:02,399
where the hot and dry considerably 
influence what we are

98
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,033
going to find and the way in which people 
are going to move in the public space.

99
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,931
The second idea in our synthesis, 
is that public spaces

100
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:13,418
are first and foremost 
the place of the populace.

101
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:18,990
It is here that the majority 
of the poor live.

102
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:23,022
There is a clear division 
between rich and poor

103
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:26,910
in the public space, and the public space

104
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,078
is first and foremost the place 
for the poorest population.

105
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:34,100
The rich only pass through, 
most of the time by car.

106
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,820
Finally, the third structuring element, 
is the question of informality.

107
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,071
The informality which structures 
a part of the public space, since

108
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:49,800
a part of social practices that take place
here are of an exclusive domain

109
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,670
of formality or informality.

110
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,730
Here we had the example, earlier, between
public space and public spaces

111
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,609
of La Sorbonne in Abidjan.

112
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:10,928
Another image, is it really a public space?

113
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:14,170
A kind of no man's land 
which is in fact a road.

114
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,653
I leave it an open question.

115
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:22,360
In central Dakar, we see 
that if we focus on our themes,

116
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,728
we have at the same time

117
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:28,514
questions about resources, people live, 
conduct business in these streets and

118
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,819
at the same time questions about 
transportation in this image.

119
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:39,514
The environment, the public space
is also a space of waste storage

120
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:44,010
but also a place of storage of any kind.

121
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,984
Another example where finally 
there is a sort of

122
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:51,656
privatization of public space 
since the merchant

123
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:55,200
and the carpet manufacturer are 
drying them out in full sun,

124
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,839
in the street and appropriates 
the available space.

125
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,200
Which makes it so that the cars 
can no longer pass by.

126
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,275
So it's a very clear way here
to appropriate a public space.

127
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:09,870
Finally, public space is also

128
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,847
to do sports: soccer or 
its reduced version.

129
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:20,000
We are going to see now the 
development of a public space

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,926
a big square in the center of N'Djamena.

131
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:29,104
Thanks to Google and the map history, 
we can go back like this,

132
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:33,406
from 2004 to 2011, and we are 
going to gradually see

133
00:08:33,406 --> 00:08:37,059
the changes that happened in 
the creation of public spaces.

134
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,124
So there is no value judgement 
about what has been done.

135
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:41,820
Is it good, not good?

136
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,437
I just want to show the process 
that is in motion when

137
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:51,050
public spaces are created in places 
which are already urbanized.

138
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,610
It takes places gently.

139
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,378
Here we are in 2008, 2009, 2010

140
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:06,391
also in 2010, some destruction, and 
here we have a space that takes

141
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,844
the whole of the homes 
that we had before.

142
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:12,292
We finish with this image.

143
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:17,195
Maybe if we go on Google today, 
there will be the following.

144
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:19,370
I leave you with the care 
to go and see it.

145
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,062
We are in N'Djamena, Tchad.

146
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:27,416
And we now going to see an example 
from the same work which I was

147
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:31,054
talking about earlier, 
"The West-African City"

148
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:34,618
where a method of capturing
public space was developed.

149
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:37,098
A method which allows us to see

150
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:41,166
the daily changes that happen 
in the public space.

151
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,794
For this we have placed our camera

152
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:48,636
and we have taken a photo throughout 
the day of a public space.

153
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:52,530
We are in Nouakchott, an 
ordinary downtown street

154
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,632
and every 30 minutes, we took a photo.

155
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:58,631
So we can see the movements

156
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,090
which take place throughout the day.

157
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:20,922
All these movements allowed us to evaluate
the number of men and women.

158
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:30,007
For example, if I take this x axis here, 
we have the time or the hours

159
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:32,655
from early in the morning 
until late in the evening.

160
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:36,245
And here we have the number 
of men and women.

161
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:39,539
So what interests us, is not 
the exact number

162
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,309
since it largely depends on the 
framing that we do.

163
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,330
What interests us, is the balance
of men and women.

164
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,795
And we see that there are very, 
very few women

165
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:53,030
and that we don't see them 
the whole day.

166
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,280
They are there at precise hours.

167
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,826
We can do the same thing 
with the children.

168
00:10:57,826 --> 00:11:01,073
We can do the same thing with vehicles.

169
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:04,390
Another example, another framing 
in another village.

170
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:10,445
We see here that the presence of 
women is much more important,

171
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:17,202
and that the women are 
present the whole day.

172
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:22,887
This allows to see the rhythm of 
the city, at which time the city awakens,

173
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:27,540
at which time we have the most people
walking in the public space.

174
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,246
This allows us to quantify a 
certain number of things.

175
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:34,432
Another example, without any comments.

176
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:38,941
Another street in Nouakchott, 
early in the morning, a seller.

177
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:42,820
Look carefully at the right hand side of 
your screen, what is going to happen.

178
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:50,347
There. At a certain time, one seeks 
protection from the sun.

179
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:56,737
At certain hours, there is no one
in the street.

180
00:11:56,737 --> 00:12:00,490
At other hours, we see many cars.

181
00:12:02,474 --> 00:12:06,520
And we see, throughout the day, 
the sale of fruits, of bananas.

182
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,156
We see the bananas disappear gradually

183
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:13,495
as the buyers arrive in this tore.

184
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:21,161
There, very quickly described, some 
themes of public spaces,

185
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:26,828
some structuring elements, the creation 
of a public space, a solid example

186
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:31,148
N'Djamena, and a method of research
which allows the capturing like this,

187
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:36,120
of the public space 
throughout the day.
