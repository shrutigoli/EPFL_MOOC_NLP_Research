1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,790
We continue on our journey 
on the restructuring,

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,275
the resettlement of our precarious zone,

3
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:13,610
to arrive now at the habitat program,

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,590
which is called the Twize Program,

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,916
which was put in place by the NGO GRET,

6
00:00:20,226 --> 00:00:25,212
with, as its main collaborator,

7
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:27,268
the Mauritanian Commission on Human Rights,

8
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:29,464
Against Poverty, and for Insertion.

9
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:33,150
Its goal was to design a program 
of around, I believe,

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,401
7,500 modules within Nouakchott,

11
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:41,364
of which 2,300-2,400 would be 
in the zone which we'll discuss today.

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,180
The module is a simple one.

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,250
It's one room, concrete, measuring 
4 x 5 meters, 20 square meters.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,700
There is a whole process which allows 
the financing of this type of thing.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,534
There will be access to microloans,

16
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:58,716
the residents will pay month after month

17
00:00:58,716 --> 00:01:01,594
to have access to their dwelling.

18
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,554
They must make a down payment,

19
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:07,020
often the money they'll put 
is that which they've received

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,702
as compensation for their resettlement.

21
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:13,348
They were displaced;
they were compensated for this,

22
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:16,120
and it provided them with money 
for their down payment.

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,128
Then, each month, they'll pay interest,

24
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:28,370
and the restructuring program will play 
a significant role in subsidizing it.

25
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,510
So even though they pay interest, 
they will have their house,

26
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,152
their room, cheaper than 
if they had built it themselves.

27
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:39,710
That's the end goal, as well as 
to strongly subsidize it,

28
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,955
so that it will be extremely attractive.

29
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,218
A few images, here's a plot.

30
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:48,450
We see the part in concrete 
and the one that remained,

31
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,142
built with flimsy materials.

32
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:54,625
We find this situation, 
materials such as boards and fabric,

33
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:59,220
with children playing, and goats and dogs,

34
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:04,450
and the goal is to provide access 
to durable housing.

35
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,356
Here again we see a house made of wood,

36
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,410
and behind it the construction of a home, 
built of concrete blocks.

37
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,124
The end result is this, 
where we see how

38
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:24,225
each dweller has made 
a small decoration around his door,

39
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:26,612
and around the roof's parapet.

40
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:30,212
There are still some traces 
of resettlement,

41
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:32,585
as we saw in the previous video,

42
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:36,238
in which each family 
was identified by a number,

43
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:40,550
and each shack was identified 
with the same number,

44
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,685
which is what we see 
in this new neighborhood,

45
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:45,250
since they simply moved the shacks.

46
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,483
Another example with, 
here in front, the latrine,

47
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:54,618
built on the plot when the house 
was already finished.

48
00:02:55,398 --> 00:02:57,182
An image from the neighborhood

49
00:02:57,182 --> 00:03:01,390
where we still find both 
new and old buildings.

50
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,316
The program had four axes,

51
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:07,020
but the two which interest us here

52
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,974
are housing programs, access to housing.

53
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,508
There is a whole process which 
enables people to build their homes,

54
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:19,770
and then the access to microloans, 
to financing for these homes.

55
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,660
One cannot exist without the other,

56
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,916
If we have just a housing program 
with laborers, materials,

57
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,838
that's not enough, since 
the people will not only lack

58
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:32,664
the means to access it,

59
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:36,585
but it will also require 
a financial process

60
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:39,726
to facilitate their access 
to this durable housing.

61
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:43,238
There are three types of population,

62
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:45,278
those who cannot access the program.

63
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:47,163
Why? Because they are too poor,

64
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:50,142
They are indigents, who have 
neither a down payment,

65
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:53,786
nor the possibility to pay interest,

66
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:56,150
so they are excluded from the program.

67
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,775
In any event, each time 
you make a housing plan,

68
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:01,829
there will be people who 
won't have access to it,

69
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,122
even if it's strongly subsidized.

70
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:05,857
Their poverty level is such that

71
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:07,632
they will not have access 
to these programs.

72
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:10,198
So for them, there is a double 
sense of marginalization.

73
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:12,633
They were already poor and marginalized,

74
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:16,640
but now even more so because, 
compared to their neighbors,

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,170
who have been able to access 
the housing program, they were not.

76
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,985
The second, those who 
adhere to the program,

77
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:25,265
in the end they have no other choice.

78
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:26,650
They have no other way to do it.

79
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,110
The interest on a loan remains 
an extreme burden.

80
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,220
It is for 36 months in 
this housing program.

81
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,950
So for 36 months, 
they will have to have

82
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,008
an extremely important load,

83
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:40,627
which is the interest payment 
and a part of the amortization.

84
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:42,428
And, finally, those who simply don't want

85
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:45,109
to take advantage of the housing program.

86
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,392
They simply have 
the means to do otherwise,

87
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:50,666
so they don't understand 
that there is a subsidy

88
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,590
that would allow them to pay less.

89
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,492
For them, for those of some means,

90
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:56,648
they buy the material,
they build as they're able,

91
00:04:56,648 --> 00:05:00,550
but they don't own anyone anything; 
they have no interest to pay,

92
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,660
and they can manage things 
their own way, as they wish.

93
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,795
Why show these three types of population?

94
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,487
To show that when one 
develops a habitat program,

95
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:13,200
or whatever type of program, 
one can't reach everyone.

96
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,735
There are those who you'll never reach,
because they are indigent,

97
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:19,637
and those who simply 
don't want to participate,

98
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:21,260
because they have 
the means to do otherwise.

99
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,852
So we must understand 
that between these two extremes,

100
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:29,077
we have one client, who is captive,

101
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:31,252
because she doesn't have another choice

102
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:33,308
but to go with the program.

103
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,900
We need a large clientele.

104
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,630
We need to study closely 
the terms of accession.

105
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,446
Because we might 
find ourselves in situations

106
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:46,569
where the burden 
on this part of the population

107
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,774
is such that she becomes impoverished,

108
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:52,952
and ultimately ends up in worse condition,

109
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,130
with a durable house, for certain, 
but in a worse state financially

110
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,624
than when they lived in 
a house made of wood.

111
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:01,514
So when developing a habitat program,

112
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:03,960
the questions regarding mobility 
are extremely important.

113
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,836
We must toss out old ideas,

114
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:10,300
the first being that the poorest 
are speculators,

115
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,210
and that the first thing they'll do 
is resell their parcel,

116
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,534
resell their housing so that they can

117
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:17,698
go and build a shantytown somewhere else.

118
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:21,586
As we study this question, we realize that

119
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:24,244
things are a bit more complicated 
than we may have been told,

120
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,874
which is to say that those who have lived,
in precarious conditions,

121
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:29,238
for 30 years in this neighborhood,

122
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:33,032
dream of only one thing: 
to live in less precarious conditions.

123
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,524
They are not cold speculators

124
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:37,206
who are only waiting for one thing,

125
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:39,636
because that would be 
a really bad strategy,

126
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:42,485
for it would mean they'd 
been waiting for 30 years.

127
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,344
So they are not cold strategists 
and speculators,

128
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:48,778
but, on the contrary, 
people who are waiting

129
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:50,702
for their living conditions to improve.

130
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:54,916
And we cannot deny that, 
the poorest as well as the richest,

131
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,980
may also have residential mobility.

132
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,508
One is not obligated, all one's life, 
to live in the same place.

133
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:06,285
There is, in all countries, 
and there too, divorce.

134
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,370
There are people who leave because 
they have a job somewhere else,

135
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,472
maybe in Europe or the U.S., 
or in other regions in Africa,

136
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:16,720
or in another part of the city,

137
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,556
and they are not there all day,

138
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:21,838
or all week, as we have families who

139
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:25,490
break up and get together,
as in all of today's world.

140
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,870
There are deaths, and widows and widowers,

141
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,640
who leave for the country, 
return to their parents' homes,

142
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,581
and who ultimately leave, 
abandoning their neighborhoods.

143
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:41,994
This residential mobility is not 
only for the wealthiest,

144
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:46,180
or for the middle class; 
everyone has residential mobility.

145
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,103
Behind habitat, lest we forget, 
there is a symbolic value.

146
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,470
For a durable home, 
we're ready to make sacrifices,

147
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,520
because it's better than one 
made of precarious materials.

148
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,430
It has a symbolic value: 
I have a sturdy home and so

149
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,308
I've achieved a standard of equipment, 
a standard of housing,

150
00:08:05,308 --> 00:08:07,850
that makes me a full-fledged citizen.

151
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,210
So the parcel, per se,
the title to the land is not enough.

152
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,788
To have a title, 
but to a shack made of wood,

153
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:19,083
is not enough to truly belong 
to the neighborhood,

154
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,489
to truly belong to the city, 
and to be its citizen.

155
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,040
For that we need durable housing.

156
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,435
Now we'll go from 
the status of the inhabitant

157
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:34,239
of a precarious zone, to the city-citizen,

158
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:38,034
with the possibility of claiming a parcel,

159
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:41,619
a right to the land 
which one has finally obtained.

160
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,664
On the contrary, we must be 
a bit careful with the theory

161
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:49,969
which says that durable housing 
encourages hoarding,

162
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:53,954
allows for the quick development 
of an economic activity.

163
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:57,814
Surely this happens to some, 
but not to the vast majority.

164
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,580
It's not because one has a durable home

165
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,856
that one suddenly becomes an entrepreneur,

166
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:04,980
do one's business and get out of misery.

167
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,554
There are always success stories, 
of course, they exist everywhere,

168
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:12,739
but the vast majority of people 
have had to make sacrifices

169
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:15,054
in order to pay for their durable home,

170
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,869
and once they have made these sacrifices,

171
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:19,705
they have, in any event, no possibility

172
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,420
of investing in anything else.

173
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,516
So the relation between 
economic development,

174
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:28,854
the development of revenue-producing 
activities and of durable housing,

175
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:32,565
still remains, today, for us to demonstrate.

176
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:37,491
While dealing with a holistic view 
of a city, it's habitat,

177
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:42,456
its construction, its housing programs 
and land tenure,

178
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:46,190
we are obligated to question

179
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,150
the impact of these projects 
on the whole of the city.

180
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,844
The NGO's who work in cities

181
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:55,070
principally go to zones 
in the urban periphery.

182
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,830
Each NGO goes where 
there are no other NGO's,

183
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
which is legitimate, easily understood,

184
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,870
to help with water distribution, 
to help improve living conditions.

185
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,315
Strictly in terms of city-planning,

186
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:12,355
and I'm not speaking 
of living conditions,

187
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,255
but strictly of city-planning,

188
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:18,325
this means that an NGO 
who assists in a shantytown,

189
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:21,620
or in the distant periphery of the city,

190
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,315
where there is no equipment, 
no infrastructure,

191
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,470
the act of helping these populations

192
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,400
will settle these populations 
in their neighborhoods.

193
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,820
And suddenly, these housing programs,

194
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,178
these water distribution programs,

195
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:39,508
the work of these NGO's, 
will contribute to urban sprawl,

196
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:42,100
because it will settle these populations 
further and further away.

197
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,622
So in terms of urban planning, 
this is one of the elements

198
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:48,659
which expands urban sprawl even further,

199
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,696
is the role of the NGO's

200
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:55,033
which settle populations 
in conditions or in zones

201
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,950
where they should 
absolutely not be settled.

202
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,815
In terms of urban planning, 
it's a disaster,

203
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:04,190
because one can never 
manage this urban sprawl.

204
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,247
In terms of living conditions, 
we all agree when we say

205
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,699
that their work is necessary, and useful,

206
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:13,060
for it allows one to better 
one's living conditions.

207
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,824
But we must reflect 
on these large projects,

208
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:20,236
on the daily work of the NGO's in zones, 
with a broad view.

209
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:22,872
We must view this globally, 
for the entire city.

210
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:27,224
And there are certain programs 
which should be avoided altogether,

211
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:30,869
because they plan for 
the construction of durable housing

212
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:33,239
in areas which are very, very remote,

213
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:35,609
which only makes matters worse.

214
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:40,640
Finally we have the problems 
of bringing in electricity, water,

215
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,010
and in the end nothing will be resolved.

216
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,870
In the end we'll leave people 
in the conditions which,

217
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,410
in a few years hence, they are more 
vulnerable than before.

218
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,962
When we say habitat, we are also speaking

219
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,644
of the financing of this habitat,

220
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:54,407
which is a heavy burden, 
subsidized, but still,

221
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:57,188
they must come up with a down payment, 
they must pay interest,

222
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:00,174
which is extremely difficult 
for these populations.

223
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:04,452
And we've seen certain programs, 
in other countries,

224
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:09,270
where effectively the people 
had access to apartments, to housing,

225
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,652
but where they also found

226
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,332
prostitution increased,

227
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:17,381
the number of children 
enrolled in school decreased.

228
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:18,231
Why?

229
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:20,377
Because it's such a financial burden 
on the family

230
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:22,983
that they must find 
other sources of revenue.

231
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:25,505
Now, in the neighborhood 
we're dealing with, here,

232
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:27,450
we haven't seen this type of phenomenon,

233
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,404
but we might, in other countries, 
fall into these processes,

234
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:33,931
where the financial burden on a family

235
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:36,698
of having durable housing is such that

236
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:38,346
they must send their children out to work

237
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:41,827
rather than send them to school

238
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,690
Why?

239
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:47,790
Because they have to pay interest 
for the housing built for them.

240
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,836
So these are the limits of the system,

241
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,775
We must be really conscious, 
really pay attention,

242
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:54,098
to make sure that this doesn't occur.

243
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:59,205
To finish, an image of a neighborhood, 
one we've already seen,

244
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:04,947
an area without a housing program,

245
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:07,779
and one with a housing program.

246
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:14,471
In conclusion, there is no miracle recipe, 
to show us what to do,

247
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:19,440
but we must each time remain cognizant 
that each action which favors,

248
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,252
which improves the quality of life, 
has also its downside.

249
00:13:23,492 --> 00:13:27,620
There are two sides to every coin, 
as the saying goes.

250
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,168
But we must always keep in mind 
the other side of the coin,

251
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:35,250
so that we can analyze it, minimize it.

252
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,030
We're not only on the positive, 
but must also,

253
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,806
when it comes to habitat programs, 
minimize any negative impact,

254
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:47,180
and ask ourselves, 
which neighborhood will I help?

255
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,691
And while helping,

256
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:53,572
is the financial burden on the families 
acceptable or not?

257
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:59,095
Will it introduce other behaviors, 
most notably child labor,

258
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:02,180
in order to pay this heavy cost,

259
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,300
so that they might live in 
a home of cement blocks?

260
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,820
We can ask ourselves if it's worthwhile 
to live in a cement-block house,

261
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,450
or if it's better to live in 
a wooden shack, and go to school.

262
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,292
This is a bit of a caricature, 
but these are the true questions

263
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:20,228
which we must truly, 
as planners, ask ourselves,

264
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:22,792
when we're dealing with 
plans for a precarious zone.
