1
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:05,337
Hello.

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:06,886
In our video we will talk about

3
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:10,268
one of the forms of urbanization, 
which is the shantytown.

4
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:12,921
Shantytowns, 
which we will define briefly.

5
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:17,271
But to preface it, 
we should note that, in principle,

6
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:21,706
shantytowns are too complex 
to be defined by only one criterion.

7
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:23,520
Because of this, normally we use

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,254
a battery of criteria 
to define the shantytown,

9
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:29,870
at times with the whole 
of criteria present,

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:36,289
and at others, only the one, two, three, 
four, six criteria present.

11
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:39,571
Shantytowns are also defined locally.

12
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:42,371
What is considered a shantytown 
in one country or city,

13
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:45,970
may not be in another country or city.

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,064
So we cannot have certain global criteria

15
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:53,255
which are applicable to the whole planet,

16
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:57,038
but instead have 
particular, local situations.

17
00:00:57,038 --> 00:01:01,705
We must also keep in mind 
that the criteria can change with time.

18
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:05,353
What one day is a shantytown 
may no longer be one

19
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:07,903
a few years, or a few decades later.

20
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:13,020
And, conversely, what was not one, 
based on changing norms,

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,686
based on periods, can become 
a precarious zone.

22
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:22,738
We'll use shantytown 
and precarious zone as two synonyms.

23
00:01:22,738 --> 00:01:26,505
We'll avoid, however, speaking 
of informal settlements, because,

24
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:31,338
as we'll see, this housing 
has nothing spontaneous about it,

25
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:34,238
It's a term one finds, generally,

26
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:36,171
used when speaking of shantytowns in Africa,
when speaking of informal settlements.

27
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:41,182
So it become common usage 
even though, in fact,

28
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:44,526
its meaning is essentially false 
within the African context.

29
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:47,872
There is nothing 
spontaneous about, on the contrary,

30
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:51,821
this slow settling 
of this form of housing.

31
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,205
A few current statistics.

32
00:01:53,205 --> 00:02:00,454
In the world we have 923,986.

33
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:07,103
We are of course, in thousands, 
of a total of 7 billion,

34
00:02:07,103 --> 00:02:10,620
which corresponds to 31.6%,

35
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,955
the percentage in relation to 
urban population.

36
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:19,900
So of the total urban population in 2000,

37
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:27,791
which was 2,000 million, 
861,000, we have 31%,

38
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:33,711
or 923 million 
who live in shantytowns.

39
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:39,220
If we look now at Africa, 
at all of the African nations,

40
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:47,687
we'll end up at 187.562 
million inhabitants,

41
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:51,964
and this represents, globally,

42
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:56,241
61.3% of the urban population.

43
00:02:56,241 --> 00:03:00,519
The number is huge, and means 
that 6 out of 10 people living in cities,

44
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,420
in Africa, live in shantytowns.

45
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,705
For comparison, let's look at Asia,

46
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:17,420
where 539.917 million

47
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,192
of urban dwellers are living in shantytowns,
which corresponds to 40.1%.

48
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:25,738
There we have,
we won't continue, we could see

49
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,820
how the most developed regions 
and the less developed,

50
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,936
share Africa in a certain 
number of sub-regions,

51
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:36,554
we would have numbers 
which would be relatively different,

52
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:39,303
if one is in a more developed country,
or in a less developed country.

53
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,005
What we must remember here is that,

54
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:47,120
there is nonetheless 
a high proportion, a majority,

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,354
more than 50%; 
one of every two people

56
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:54,387
living in an African city 
lives in a shantytown.

57
00:03:54,387 --> 00:03:57,153
Of course this number is one which 
we'll try to reduce as much as we can

58
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,309
at the same time that, as we've seen,
urban population numbers continue to increase.

59
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:06,622
Let's start with some definitions.

60
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:10,388
The first we'll find in the document
<i>UN-Habitat, The Challenge of Slums</i>.

61
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:14,154
<i>UN-Habitat, The Challenge of Slums</i>

62
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,132
We'll see if what they use 
as criteria for their evaluation,

63
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,110
as criteria for their evaluation,

64
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,088
when vetted against 
their diverse criteria of shantytowns,

65
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:26,089
will allow us to determine 
if the zone we are studying

66
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:31,138
can be considered a precarious zone, 
or, on the contrary,

67
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,816
if it in no way meets the criteria,

68
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,494
then it is not.

69
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:36,172
Now one of the first points is, of course,

70
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:40,888
the lack of basic services, 
the precarious habitat

71
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:45,010
high population density, 
minimal living conditions,

72
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,132
difficult conditions, land insecurity,

73
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:53,256
poverty and social exclusion,
and small-sized parcels.

74
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:56,053
A certain number of criteria,
we could add others.

75
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,838
But we can already see 
that we are under conditions

76
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:01,537
at the same time 
of spatial precariousness,

77
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:02,954
which is the question of land,

78
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:07,281
and at the same time 
with questions about habitat,

79
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:11,608
about construction systems, 
also relatively precarious.

80
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:15,937
Then we can look at the different zones 
and see whether or not

81
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:17,622
they meet all criteria, or not.

82
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:21,373
And we can imagine 
it must meet all criteria

83
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:22,538
to be considered a shantytown.

84
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:24,404
Otherwise we can well define,

85
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:28,005
as long as we have 
three or four criteria,

86
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:33,588
the zone to be a precarious one.

87
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:34,470
Another group of experts from the U.N.

88
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,487
uses other criteria, this from 2002.

89
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:43,138
We'll see some examples.

90
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:46,505
It's in English, the criteria 
are defined in English.

91
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:49,871
But we have questions about sanitation,

92
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:52,904
questions about access to water, 
questions about latrines and waste water,

93
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:00,137
about quality of habitat, 
questions of overcrowding

94
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:06,922
and, as we saw in the beginning,
questions of security of land tenure.

95
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,505
We define the major characteristics,
then a certain number of indicators,

96
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:21,353
and then we define 
in a more precise manner.

97
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:24,555
We will not get into detail on this chart,

98
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:27,838
but we should keep in mind 
that we are dealing with questions

99
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:32,039
of access to water, waste water 
and infrastructure,

100
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,638
questions of habitat quality, 
of overcrowding,

101
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,617
Now, what causes the emergence 
of shantytowns?

102
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:44,169
and, of course, of land issues.

103
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,723
We can assign three basic categories:

104
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:50,255
the first, second and third.

105
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:55,301
The first is demographic, 
a natural growth,

106
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:58,920
an increasingly large urban population.

107
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,338
The next is economic, rural exodus, 
ever increasing, land speculation

108
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:08,039
and, finally, the balancing 
of supply and demand.

109
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:13,671
We must keep in the back of our minds

110
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:16,790
that we are in the process 
of the pauperization of societies,

111
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,672
that there are more and more people
for an economic development

112
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,554
which has yet to take place.

113
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:25,437
This means that for each person 
there is impoverishment.

114
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:31,204
And all the people

115
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:33,621
who don't have access 
to the land market, as we are in

116
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,221
a free land market, all of those who

117
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,821
don't have access 
to the land market because

118
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:38,421
it is too expensive, must find situations

119
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:45,469
where they can live, and this often means

120
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:48,158
a squat, or land occupied

121
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:50,847
by those who do not own it, and it is

122
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,538
the emergence of precarious 
and illegal zones.

123
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:57,171
Finally, there are legal questions,
with, as we've already said,

124
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:02,254
the question of land tenure,

125
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:05,593
and, finally, of private property.

126
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:13,621
If you occupy land 
which you do not own,

127
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:16,749
and which has a private owner, 
you are squatting,

128
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:19,877
and you are not 
legally living on the land.

129
00:08:19,877 --> 00:08:23,005
To wrap up our quick journey 
through the shantytown, the most famous,

130
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:26,887
without a doubt, in Africa,
and the largest, in Kenya: Kibera,

131
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:34,804
with its very recognizable rail line 
and its shantytown,

132
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:43,370
which formed along its huge periphery.

133
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,886
So, there are no official numbers,

134
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:49,505
some claim it has 1 million inhabitants, 
others 500 thousand.

135
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:51,932
What we must remember

136
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,359
is that we are in a shantytown 
covered extensively by the media.

137
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,787
But despite this, we haven't noticed

138
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,570
any apparent change, difference,

139
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,354
restructuring, or upgrading 
of the shantytown.

140
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:03,954
We are still, more or less, 
in the same situation,

141
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:08,854
and this despite the presence 
of dozens of NGO's,

142
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:13,021
who for decades have worked 
in the very heart of the shantytown.

143
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,088
A quick introduction to the shantytown.

144
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,237
We'll now look at a specific case,
the restructuring of a precarious zone,

145
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:23,570
the Kebba of El Mina, in Nouakchott,

146
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,320
a program over the last 10 years, 
the last 15 years,

147
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,270
which is a rather symptomatic program

148
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,591
because it began as urban sprawl,
affecting thousands of people.

149
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:39,288
And we'll see the basic plan 
of this type of program,

150
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,870
divided between the restructuring, 
resettlement and, finally,

151
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,538
the habitat program aid 
for the population.
