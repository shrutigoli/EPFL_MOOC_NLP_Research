1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,459
After an introductory video on slums, 
we are now going to take a look,

2
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:12,684
by way of a case study, 
at the restructuring of a slum.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,753
This slum is the Kebba of El Mina 
in Nouakchott,

4
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:19,220
a restructuring process that 
took place in the lat 15 years.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,652
So there are different types
of irregularities.

6
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:25,270
I'm talking about land irregularities.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,681
Two scenarios.

8
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:29,430
The first is when the residents

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,189
squat lands which are owned by the State.

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,950
Second scenario, when the residents

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,290
squat lands which are are privately owned.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,410
We can realize that the degree of 
instability is not quite the same.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,866
And we are dealing with a much more

14
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:47,554
significant instability when 
there is squatting of lands

15
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:49,466
which are private, which 
are owned by people

16
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,524
who can the claim them at one point.

17
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:55,687
Meanwhile, when we are dealing with 
lands belonging to the State,

18
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:57,838
we know that there is a leeway

19
00:00:57,838 --> 00:00:59,555
which is a little bit bigger and 
that we will be able to

20
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:05,090
deal with the State and maybe we 
will stabilize the situation.

21
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,508
The example we are going to use, 
we were talking about

22
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:10,688
private lands, so dealing with 
instability on a very large scale,

23
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:13,936
meaning that the "hardening process" 
of housing

24
00:01:13,936 --> 00:01:18,485
that goes from housing made from 
excessively unstable materials,

25
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:23,650
made from planks and sheets, to housing 
which is done by hard cement blocks,

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,230
this hardening process, which is a neologism,

27
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,100
this process doesn't take place 
while the land is

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,020
an exclusively private land.

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,556
On State lands, we will see that 
this process takes place

30
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:38,850
much more rapidly because the residents

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,849
almost have the guarantee of 
never being driven out.

32
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:51,818
So here, in a normal urban fabric 
we can clearly see the slum areas.

33
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:55,710
So we are already in 
a period of restructuring.

34
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,744
We see that we are dealing with 
a framework here

35
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,980
while we are dealing with another type
of blueprint which is lower.

36
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,687
Second scenario, also compared to 
unstable neighborhoods, why?

37
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:12,620
Because they are largely under-equipped.

38
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,240
So indeed have a screening,

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,084
of lots, of roads, a regular framework,

40
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:27,555
but we have all the other characteristics,

41
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,746
aside from the land ones, which are 
the characteristics of a slum.

42
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:37,370
So the lack of infrastructure, poverty,
housing instability ,

43
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,176
all these indicators which we have 
previously seen,

44
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:43,626
we find them once again, the only one 
that we do not is

45
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:48,020
the land issue since the resident 
is the owner of his plot of land.

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,900
All the other criteria, we also 
assimilate it to the slum.

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,960
A photo of a slum that is 
a little bit bigger.

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,760
It matters little where it is located.

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,503
We see that it is quite characteristic 
of housing

50
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:06,910
which is scattered or dispersed 
here and there.

51
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,327
And we are dealing with housing 
that is relatively dense.

52
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:18,398
So if we do the density we will be more

53
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,371
at 350, 400 residents per hectare, 
which is relatively high.

54
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:23,070
Two images of this type of density.

55
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,274
The top one, in the fringes of the city.

56
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:27,974
The second, about the slum 
that we are going to look at,

57
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,818
the Kebba of El Mina,

58
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:35,612
where we see that there are 
two types of materials,

59
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:39,140
firstly there are units, which are 
metal canisters,

60
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,855
which are unfolded, we find, which form 
the units, and then there are also

61
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:48,353
the old wooden port crates

62
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,598
which are now replaced, little by little 
by containers,

63
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,276
but which have allowed the building 
of shanties that are passable.

64
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,342
So we have shanties that are in 
very precise units,

65
00:03:57,342 --> 00:04:01,240
which are the metal canisters, 
or the wooden crates.

66
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:06,418
So let's get to the heart of the matter with 
this slum in Nouakchott

67
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:10,957
and make an inventory of 
the current situation.

68
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:14,547
So for the moment, before the project,
of course, we were dealing with

69
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:20,519
a powerless voluntarism to resolve 
the issues of slums.

70
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:26,208
There was a will but it wasn't enough, 
and a total powerlessness

71
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:30,702
in the face of this situation, 
given the magnitude

72
00:04:30,702 --> 00:04:32,500
of slums in the city of Nouakchott.

73
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:36,237
Here we are in 2000, 2002.

74
00:04:36,237 --> 00:04:42,774
And we are going to see that we will need
10, 12, 14 years in order to, little by little,

75
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:47,573
like this, make this slum 
a full-fledged part of the city.

76
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:54,480
Another thing, there was also a sort of
acceptance of informal practices.

77
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,010
Really, we let it happen and 
we watch what happens.

78
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,274
Everything we let happen, it's everything 
the State does not have to manage.

79
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:05,617
So that situation in which 
we found ourselves in 2000,

80
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:09,920
is a situation in which we let 
informal issues happen.

81
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,204
And at this time also, we found ourselves
in a situation where

82
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:16,346
we had tried to resolve some

83
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:20,377
problems of precarious housing
more by supression.

84
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:23,430
So we had the people flee manu militari.

85
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,585
The context of the city.

86
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:27,885
It's important to know that 
there was a deficit of land,

87
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:30,049
of housing, of infrastructure.

88
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:33,040
and support for the local economy.

89
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,011
What we are going to try to do 
with this project, it's exactly

90
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:41,551
to allow the stabilizing of 
land tenure, it's exactly

91
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:46,080
the upgrading of housing, 
meaning to raise standards.

92
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,670
And we are also going to see 
a reinforcement of facilities

93
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,421
and infrastructures, which 
really structures the space,

94
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:57,469
as we already saw, with the establishment,
at the same time,

95
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:00,736
of a number of activities which 
can generate revenue.

96
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,696
It's perhaps the greatest difficulty,

97
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,770
this one, it's often a pious hope,

98
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,733
but it is extremely hard to develop 
income generating activities

99
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,947
in the poorest of neighborhoods.

100
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:13,840
The main principles of restructuring.

101
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,904
Above all, it's keeping a maximum 
of populations in place,

102
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:22,328
that is without a doubt, 
the number one principle.

103
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:26,313
Then, we try to adapt 
the norms and standards

104
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:29,207
that we are going to put in place to
the financial capacity of the residents.

105
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:30,129
This is very important.

106
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:33,210
Otherwise this means that 
the residents are then going to,

107
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,548
after the restructuring of the slum, 
find themselves in

108
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:40,100
an even more difficult, more restrictive
situation than before.

109
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:44,110
Which is absolutely not 
the aim of the game, of course.

110
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,850
Another principle, is to give

111
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,500
visibility to the interventions 
that are made.

112
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,288
It's not about sprinkling some
interventions here and there,

113
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,954
but it's about being systematic, 
and above all

114
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:58,000
being pragmatic in the way 
of doing things.

115
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:02,378
And finally, often a pious hope,

116
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:07,318
since it is rare that this works, 
but the idea is to always use

117
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:11,887
the HILO method, 
High Intensity Labor Force,

118
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:16,372
to put to work a maximum of people 
in the restructuring of the road.

119
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:21,370
So we will choose as in certain cities, 
notably in Porto-Novo,

120
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,866
we will choose paving rather than 
asphalt for the road

121
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:29,410
since we know that for 
the labor force to do the paving

122
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,310
is much more important than when 
we are asphalting an entire street.

123
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,663
So it's not always possible 
to do cement paving,

124
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:40,622
rock paving, the conditions 
that must be met

125
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:43,460
so as to be able to get to this, 
but the aim of the game would be

126
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,770
that all these rehabilitation programs 
benefit the greatest number of people.

127
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,520
Let's now go to the neighborhood, 
in the Kebba of El Mina,

128
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,130
located in the Moughataa of El Mina, 
Moughataa is a municipality of Nouakchott.

129
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,891
Surface area of the neighborhood 
which was looked at was 128 hectares.

130
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:05,160
An estimated population between 
36 and 50 thousand residents.

131
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,770
An estimated density between 
280 and 390 residents per hectare.

132
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,190
Unstable living conditions, of course

133
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,555
since it's the neighborhood 
that's going to be restructured,

134
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:19,180
so it's left to be assumed that 
it fulfilled a certain number

135
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,110
of criteria which made it a slum.

136
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:27,286
And a total absence of structure 
and internal organisation,

137
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:31,678
internal organisation, meaning, official, 
public, this does not mean

138
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:36,390
that there were no interest groups, 
tontines, and these kinds of things,

139
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,541
as can be found in all neighborhoods.

140
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:41,248
Finally, one of the characteristics,

141
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:44,300
was the very strong land occupation 
by the residents.

142
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,092
The role players.

143
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,750
In such a restructuring project

144
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,052
of the slums, we always have a contractor,

145
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:55,115
a delegated contractor, financing, 
technical studies,

146
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:58,197
meaning a consulting firm that will 
do that.

147
00:08:58,197 --> 00:09:00,630
We will make a resettlement action plan,

148
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,390
there needs to be a specialist 
in action plan resettlement.

149
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,360
A social impact study, there needs to be
an specialist in social impact studies.

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,693
A census of the entire population, 
and supervision of the census.

151
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:17,790
So the main role players were, 
at the time,

152
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,412
the City Hall of Nouakchott, 
the Commissioner of Human Rights,

153
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:26,328
of Poverty Reduction and Integration,

154
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:30,073
the World Bank which was financing 
via the PUD,

155
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:33,426
the Project of Urban Development, 
was financing the neighborhood,

156
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:36,769
the restructuring of the neighborhood, 
a consulting firm, URBAPLAN,

157
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:39,215
which did all the technical studies,

158
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:42,552
and a certain number of experts 
who intervened,

159
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:46,020
throughout the process 
for particular input.

160
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:49,558
What is interesting to see here, 
is the number of players.

161
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:54,150
It must be said that there is not just one
City Hall that mandates an office,

162
00:09:54,150 --> 00:10:00,015
but that there are many, many players
which are all partners, with whom

163
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:03,587
there must be discussion, who must be 
convinced and one must articulate all

164
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:08,381
of these opinions and all these partners
so as to succeed in developing a project.

165
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,720
Quickly, a few images of 
the diagnosis of the situation.

166
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,964
On the right, an image of the neighborhood
already restructured

167
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:24,210
since we have opened here, the roads, 
we have the presence of

168
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,866
utility poles, which show 
the presence of electricity.

169
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:34,170
And then here, an image, it's a well
with carters

170
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,620
who go to get water from the well 
and then go and sell it.

171
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,592
So there is little or no network 
of internal roads,

172
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:41,720
no network of water distribution,

173
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,370
no sewage system, no public lighting,

174
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,234
no waste pickup service, very few 
primary and secondary classrooms,

175
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,210
no structured market,

176
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,350
no recreation space or 
other types of developments.

177
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,545
So we are really dealing 
with unstable situations.

178
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:04,298
Here we see carters who are waiting, 
around the well, to go and deliver

179
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:07,055
or mainly fill their canisters to then

180
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:09,010
go and deliver them to 
the neighborhood.

181
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:14,710
The example of spreading in a 
non-structured market is that

182
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:22,250
we see extreme poverty and instability 
of installations in front of the product.

183
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:27,366
Same conclusion on the issue of housing:
extreme poverty.

184
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:28,920
A few images.

185
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,094
So we see that the materials used 
are mostly

186
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:35,544
sheet metal and wood, 
as we have said previously.

187
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:40,316
Here we see a latrine, but most 
of the dwellings,

188
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,848
of the concessions, the groups of shanties

189
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:46,230
have absolutely no latrine, 
nor do they have fences,

190
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,070
nor foundations, nor hard materials.

191
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,064
And so we have an omnipresence 
of materials like wood, sheet metal,

192
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:59,470
or as we can see here, even tissues 
or sheets.

193
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:03,377
The principles of restructuring 
which will be put in place,

194
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:06,782
we are going to create a road network,

195
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:10,280
a drinkable water supply system,
an electricity system.

196
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,995
We are going to build classes, classrooms,

197
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:15,610
primary schools, secondary schools 
and a little market.

198
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,004
The principles of restructuring which
will be retained: is that we are going to

199
00:12:21,004 --> 00:12:26,310
create a road network, a drinkable water 
supply system, electricity.

200
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,950
We are going to build classrooms,
health centers.

201
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,750
We are going to build little structured 
markets, put in place public lighting.

202
00:12:35,642 --> 00:12:37,597
That is the restructuring piece.

203
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:41,028
Then for the regrouping of lands in situ,

204
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:44,664
we are going to have to, inevitably, 
displace some people to

205
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:49,197
a resettlement area, which is just next to
the area that we are going to deal with.

206
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:52,731
The idea here is that we're going to
minimize the impact of the displacement.

207
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,260
The goal is to keep everyone in place.

208
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,125
And when it's not possible, 
we are going to put them

209
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:03,236
on plots in the vicinity, and not displace
them in resettlement areas,

210
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:05,346
as we see in numerous cities,

211
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:09,205
which are kilometers away from 
the primary area where the people live.

212
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,030
And so, the people that are going to 
be displaced will have a land security

213
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,160
which people being displaced 
don't always have.

214
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,084
So, finally, the fact of displacing people

215
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:23,906
will allow them to have a plot 
with a land title.

216
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:29,150
So there is the perimeter, here,
circled in black that interests us.

217
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,966
And then, we have this area which

218
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:37,300
will become the resettlement area 
for the population.

219
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,968
So we are going to create a system here,
of roads, very simple.

220
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:45,938
And then, all the people 
who will not be

221
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:51,653
on these roads, will stay 
in these parts here.

222
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:53,536
On the other hand, 
all these dwellings here,

223
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:58,915
all these concessions here, are going to
have to migrate, then, in this zone here

224
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:02,350
which will also become a subdivision,

225
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,660
as we will see consequently.

226
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:07,798
The road network put in place,

227
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:10,129
we see the real right of ways 
better here,

228
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:14,910
we see that all the concessions 
will have to eventually leave

229
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,830
little by little so as to
settle in this area here.

230
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:24,400
If I take my right of way roads,

231
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:31,168
it is possible that 
this shanty here belongs

232
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:36,760
to the same group, it's a family who
has a concession with three shanties.

233
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,032
And here if I am on a right of way,

234
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:43,150
this one here, this part should go, 
this one here also.

235
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,126
Finally it's all three that are going to
have to move since we are not going to

236
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:51,009
let just one and move the other two
on another plot.

237
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:57,375
So we are going to have to, the impact
is not just on this road,

238
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:03,191
these right of way roads, but maybe also
much greater since we are going to

239
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:09,805
look to the left, to the right, each time 
other shanties which belong

240
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:12,750
to the same people who are themselves
on the right of way roads.

241
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:17,490
Some will be paved, 
some exist.

242
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,719
Typically we have here the existing ones.

243
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:30,022
All of this is paved, of course, 
this also and this one also.

244
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:36,680
What has been done, in this case here, 
is that we have tried to minimize

245
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,810
the impacts and be able to reattach this
to the existing urban fabric.

246
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,385
So we have a number of routes that

247
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:51,220
we have simply prolonged here, 
which are roads which almost existed.

248
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:56,618
Then, we subdivided, in large parts, 
so as to find the routes,

249
00:15:56,618 --> 00:16:03,497
and then subdivided in two 
these same routes, each time in two,

250
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:08,158
by large frameworks with 
compacted pathways.

251
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:12,662
So what was in green, the pathways which

252
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:16,750
were not paved, and the large 
pathways were paved.

253
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:24,684
Water system: there is a stand-post here, 
joined with another.

254
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:32,012
We have a tertiary system which comes to
a much larger system here,

255
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:38,460
in a loop, which ensures the water supply 
in all cases, which is grafted on

256
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,711
a larger system, which is 
a primary system,

257
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:47,051
which was already existing since the water
left for the port,

258
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:49,640
so we have a system which 
existed previously.

259
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,915
Same goes for electricity.

260
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:59,015
We review that it is, somehow, 
the roads framework.

261
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:02,738
Inevitably we will use the primary, 
secondary and tertiary roads

262
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:06,940
to put in the public lighting system, 
this appears logical.

263
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:14,363
To put in the water system, it simpler 
to create a drinkable water network

264
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:17,819
on the roads network rather than have to
go from the interior of the neighborhoods.

265
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:25,240
And then, the restructuring plan, that's for
when we open the road network.

266
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,470
The resettlement plan is 
a plan of subdivisions

267
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,920
for the area which we are creating.

268
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,818
So, all of the people that are here, 
on the road network,

269
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:39,617
are going to find themselves 
in this area here, where we created,

270
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:45,215
we see each time blocks with plots 
and then there is a number of other types

271
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,989
of plots which are stand-posts,

272
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:51,720
facilities, latrines, 
commercial activities.

273
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,260
In brown, what we see most,

274
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,960
is of course, the plots for the dwellings.

275
00:17:57,498 --> 00:18:02,600
So if I find myself here, I would have 
without a doubt a plot somewhere here.

276
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,428
There you have it, the overall 
restructuring plan.

277
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:07,769
We have the opening of 
the road networks.

278
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:14,090
We have our facilities, our stand-posts 
and our electric transformers.

279
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,806
We have the greatest facilities, 
for example schools,

280
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:23,908
a market which will be here, 
a health center, schools.

281
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:29,600
We have a range of facilities
and infrastructure to implement,

282
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,154
that is grouped in a synthesis plan 
which is the restructuring plan.

283
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,852
With each time, do not forget,

284
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:41,825
the legend and of course the title block
since we need visas

285
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:43,737
and these plans have to be, 
at one point given,

286
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:48,175
approved by the authority 
in charge of restructuring.

287
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:54,160
Here we have an example where 
this is a new route,

288
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,132
this is a road opening, a school 
that has been built in the neighborhood

289
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:05,676
and we see that, little by little, 
the people settled in these areas

290
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:11,002
which are this time, parceled with 
plots that are rectangular plots.

291
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:15,679
And then, there is again the presence 
of a certain number of shanties,

292
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,150
the people having clearly moved
their shanties.

293
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,140
We see that, in this area here, 
there is a big difference

294
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,050
with what was there before, which is 
the area that was really the slum.

295
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:31,907
Some images, quickly.

296
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:33,660
We are on the edge of the neighborhood.

297
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,660
A resettlement area, completely 
unoccupied, completely flat.

298
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:43,310
A plan, which is an old plan since 
we have shown the most recent plan.

299
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,585
But we see that we are going trough 
various phases, the plan doesn't happen

300
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:52,840
at once but it is the object of numerous 
negotiations and discussions.

301
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,424
And then, once we have defined the plan,

302
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:58,615
that we have defined what 
we were going to do, we are then

303
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:02,650
going to begin the restructuring 
by opening the roads.

304
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:09,227
Each person finding themselves on the road
will have to be displaced

305
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:12,223
and go in the area of resettlement, 
as we say.

306
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:18,427
Previously to this, the census must 
be done of all of the households

307
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:22,380
which are in the neighborhood, before 
even being able to displace them.

308
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,679
It seems logical, to displace people, 
we must know who they are beforehand.
