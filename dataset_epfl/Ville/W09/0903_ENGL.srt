1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,015
Next in our restructuring 
of shantytowns, resettlement.

2
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:10,730
Now, what are the main principles 
of a resettlement?

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,030
The households situated on rights of way

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,132
will have to be moved, this is inevitable.

5
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:20,396
But, we'll make sure 
to minimize this move,

6
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:22,200
to make it the shortest distance possible.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,956
We'll resettle these people 
as close as possible

8
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:26,970
to their original homes.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,224
The resettlement zone must provide 
conditions which are similar,

10
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:36,526
even better, but certainly not less.

11
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:40,780
In the case we're studying, the people 
we're resettling will have a land title,

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,998
so their condition will surely improve,

13
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:46,920
which means that we'll find the mechanisms

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,442
which allow us avoid 
the systematic resale of parcels.

15
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:54,496
If you resettle someone,
and give them the title to the land,

16
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:57,395
there is a possibility, 
a very strong probability,

17
00:00:57,535 --> 00:01:00,300
that the parcel will be quickly resold

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,230
so that its owner can return to 
their old neighborhood or elsewhere.

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,394
So we'll avoid this type of model,

20
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:10,105
and to do this the land title 
will not be issued right away,

21
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,565
but instead, at the beginning, 
housing permits.

22
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:17,411
The plan which we've just seen,

23
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:20,948
the plan of allotments 
for the settlement zone.

24
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:23,545
We have here, on the plan, 
several thousand parcels

25
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:26,440
which are ready for those 
who we'll resettle.

26
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,340
Another plan, which was the first.

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,356
We see that between 
the first and last version,

28
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,288
there are a certain number 
of choices which were made,

29
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:38,604
and a certain number of simplifications,

30
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:42,950
because we had zones of lots here,

31
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,362
designs for lots which were 
a bit more complex.

32
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:51,620
The resettlement, the zone, 
we have an existing area, here,

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,850
and then the zone there, 
which we can barely see,

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,335
which is the zone where 
the people will be resettled

35
00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:00,733
Again, a totally empty zone.

36
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:06,453
The global plan, as we've seen, 
is the one which interests us today.

37
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,710
So before implementing a resettlement

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,378
we must first conduct a census, 
and develop a plan of action.

39
00:02:13,518 --> 00:02:17,843
We have to know who we are displacing 
and how we will displace them.

40
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:20,228
To do this, we'll conduct a census 
of all of the inhabitants,

41
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:26,194
issue questionnaires, visit the site, 
and photograph the households,

42
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:30,712
each time with a code number 
so that we can quickly locate them.

43
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:35,110
This number has an identifier 
which can also be found

44
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,884
on the facade of the shack 
we are dealing with.

45
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:46,830
Next, after this step, we'll issue
information and compensation.

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,930
The people have the right 
to know what rights they have,

47
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,721
and to seek the money 
offered to them as compensation.

48
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:58,780
Next, we will displace the people, 
with the work yet to be done.

49
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,083
Then, we'll open up the rights of way.

50
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:04,473
The people who were between this limit

51
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:07,853
and this one in this central zone,

52
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:14,555
were displaced, and displaced 
with only their shacks.

53
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:17,723
So we've just moved the shacks.

54
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:21,689
But this time, on the lands which 
are marked with boundary markers.

55
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:24,811
We've seen that there was 
a preliminary allotment plan,

56
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,570
that there was a land survey,

57
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,599
and then all the boundary 
markers were placed,

58
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,880
and the homes readied 
to welcome their inhabitants.

59
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,390
At night. 
We've installed electricity, of course,

60
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,560
public lighting, not everywhere,

61
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,566
but we can see that 
there are improvements

62
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:41,108
over the previous neighborhood.

63
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:44,509
The construction of certain facilities,

64
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:49,101
whether schools or markets, 
roadways, electricity.

65
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:54,619
And here the people, little by little, 
are building with concrete.

66
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,318
We will see later, 
thanks to a habitat program.

67
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,959
Septic tanks were placed throughout.

68
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:06,727
On each parcel a septic tank was built,

69
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:13,163
On the 2,300 lots, the necessary 
2,300 septic tanks were placed.

70
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:17,362
2,300 lots, each measuring 
120 square meters.

71
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:18,643
Why 120 meters?

72
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:24,219
Because we have a certain number 
of people to displace and resettle,

73
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,940
and, ultimately, this corresponded 
to a size of 120 square meters,

74
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:33,621
which was smaller than the norm, 
which is 180 square meters,

75
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:36,159
but there was no other solution

76
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:39,756
for the resettlement of these people 
near where they lived before.

77
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:43,780
So, either we reduce the size, 
which allows them to be

78
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,102
in a settlement zone 
near their previous home,

79
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:50,028
or we adopt the larger standards,

80
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:52,770
but that would mean that
they are displaced much further.

81
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,280
There the choice was clearly made 
to leave the people where they were.

82
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,730
Now another image, 
of the same zone,

83
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:06,130
with a mosque and the stores 
needed for everyday life.

84
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,480
The outcome is very positive, 
but pay attention.

85
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,975
Know the limits of 
this positive outcome.

86
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:18,760
We've bettered the living conditions 
of approximately 50,000 people,

87
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,320
which is extremely positive.

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,244
The people are beginning to 
form part of their neighborhoods.

89
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:28,065
We will see in the images that this area 
is now integrated in the city.

90
00:05:28,255 --> 00:05:30,900
It is no longer a ghetto, 
but a city neighborhood.

91
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,945
We've minimized the displacements

92
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:34,520
and the resettlements, which is very good.

93
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,925
And all of that was done 
in a very pragmatic way,

94
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:41,836
but keeping close to the idea 
that we had to minimize

95
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:43,767
to the maximum the impact.

96
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,080
Now there are, of course, 
negative aspects.

97
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,816
One of the biggest negatives is that

98
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:53,484
the more success you have 
with these types of operations,

99
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:56,323
the greater the politicization,

100
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:58,494
and the politicization of those actions

101
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:02,484
which should have remained as the basis 
of these "technical" measures.

102
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:06,322
Another negative aspect is that 
these are operations

103
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,676
which are extremely costly, 
and it's not certain

104
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:12,644
if the states or the cities 
have the means

105
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:15,012
to carry out these types of operations

106
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:17,630
for all of the shantytowns 
in their countries.

107
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,305
So it serves well as a prototype, 
as a showcase,

108
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,840
but it is extremely difficult 
to carry this out for all shantytowns.

109
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,590
On this image we see the limit.

110
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,987
The lot allocation plan 
has a form a bit like this.

111
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:45,210
We are there, in the process, 
little by little, of "hardening,"

112
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,264
while here we are in its initial stages.

113
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:54,660
Just these few roadways 
have been opened up, here,

114
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,992
and those who were here 
have come to settle in this zone.

115
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:03,812
Looking at the time, how it has passed,

116
00:07:03,992 --> 00:07:08,800
we can clearly see the part 
still remaining, of the shantytown,

117
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,120
we are already there 
in the lot allocation plan,

118
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,517
and return to the lot allocation plan 
which was like this one.

119
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:21,660
But we will see that, little by little, 
by 2005, 2008.

120
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,778
Look at this zone here, 
we can hardly see it anymore.

121
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:29,568
2009, and we are in the situation 
in which we are today,

122
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,633
2011, 2012, 
2012 still, where finally the area

123
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:38,032
has fully become a city neighborhood,

124
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:41,567
and we realize that the structure 
of precarious habitat,

125
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:44,532
as it existed previously, 
has totally disappeared.

126
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:45,556
One last image.

127
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:51,688
This one, from 2013, 
with no trace of the old area.

128
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,576
So there it is. 
We've restructured, resettled.

129
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:59,584
Now we must develop a habitat program,

130
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:04,475
so that the people can transition 
from their homes of tin and wood,

131
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:06,492
for these are the homes 
which we've displaced.

132
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,651
We didn't destroy the shacks, 
disassemble the shacks,

133
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:13,857
but simply moved them 
a few hundred meters,

134
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,677
reassembling them in the settlement zone.

135
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:21,830
Subsequent to this, 
a program entered, called Twize,

136
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:27,438
which allowed people 
to obtain a sturdy home,

137
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:29,882
of cement blocks, to have a module.

138
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:31,694
We'll see more on this in the next video.
