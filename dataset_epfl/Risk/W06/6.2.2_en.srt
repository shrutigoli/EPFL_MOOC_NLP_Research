00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,867
Hi. Andrew Shroeder is the Co-Director

2
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:11,241
of the humanitarian 
UAV network, <i>UAViators</i>,

3
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:14,209
which is a global network of UAV pilots,

4
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:17,098
professionals, 
disaster response agencies,

5
00:00:17,098 --> 00:00:20,930
and NGOs participating
in humanitarian activity.

6
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:24,389
He is also the Co-Founder of <i>WeRobotics</i>,

7
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:26,532
which is a new social organization

8
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:28,949
devoted to applications of robotics

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,881
for the social good
throughout the Global South.

10
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:35,988
In this video he will talk 
about the use of UAVs

11
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:38,950
for emergency and reconstruction.

12
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,392
Well, <i>UAVs</i> are unmanned aerial vehicles.

13
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:48,063
A UAV is a robot

14
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:53,275
that can be programmed
to fly around a defined area,

15
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:57,552
and to do that for a variety 
of different purposes.

16
00:00:57,552 --> 00:01:01,204
So they're a way 
to take pictures of an area,

17
00:01:01,204 --> 00:01:03,744
they're a way 
to collect sensor information

18
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,976
about a particular area of various kinds.

19
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,045
They're a way to deliver a payload.

20
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:15,317
UAVs can be used in the pre-disaster phase

21
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:21,725
through what's commonly 
understood as <i>"remote sensing"</i>

22
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:27,346
or the taking of pictures 
to produce models or baseline data

23
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:28,737
to understand change.

24
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:30,827
So, to give you one example--

25
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:35,036
Many areas of the world 
are subject to intense flooding

26
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:36,336
on a regular basis.

27
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:40,195
To understand the behavior of a flood

28
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:44,872
requires an understanding 
of the underlying structure

29
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,273
of the ground--

30
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,525
what's called a <i>digital elevation model</i>--

31
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:52,625
as well as the inundation of that ground.

32
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:58,466
UAVs can take those pictures
in extremely high resolution,

33
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,626
down to one to two centimeters,

34
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:04,976
so that the behavior 
of water on that surface

35
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:07,266
can be understood very precisely.

36
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:11,181
That helps people understand
where to allocate resources,

37
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:15,181
what's likely to happen 
in the wake of a flood,

38
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:19,200
and where communities are likely
to be most adversely affected.

39
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:23,602
During response, UAVs can be used

40
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:28,645
for a variety of applications
ranging from surveillance...

41
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:34,345
Just being able to look around
in a remote setting

42
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:36,204
is often extremely important.

43
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:42,546
When you are faced with, say, roads 
that have been damaged,

44
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:48,684
infrastructure that may be 
not functional in other ways,

45
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:52,846
UAVs can provide a simple
and very cheap way

46
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:58,791
to just look at that environment
and understand what ought to be done.

47
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,596
You can also use them to create 
three-dimensional models.

48
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:05,511
So when you take a UAV

49
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:08,808
and you fly it around 
a three-dimensional structure,

50
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:14,637
the data about that structure 
can be compiled into a model

51
00:03:14,637 --> 00:03:17,725
that lets you look at how 
a structure may be damaged,

52
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:22,523
what's required to rebuild it,
and other things that are important

53
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:25,589
in the recovery from a disaster.

54
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:27,978
They can also be used to deliver goods.

55
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:33,748
This is an early stage application
in disaster response,

56
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:38,210
but one of the most provocative
potential use cases

57
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,707
involves being able to move small amounts

58
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:45,497
of extremely important 
supplies like vaccines

59
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:49,870
out into areas which are otherwise cut off

60
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,831
from normal ground-based means
of getting supplies to them.

61
00:03:54,831 --> 00:04:00,367
So UAVs can be effective
in filling gaps in the logistics system.

62
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:05,330
In the recovery process, 
UAVs are primarily--

63
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,901
again, you're going back 
to the pre-almost--

64
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:13,539
used to understand change
because you can fly them repeatedly.

65
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,099
In the same areas it's possible--

66
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,824
and much cheaper 
than using satellites--

67
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:22,521
to understand how an area 
is being rebuilt.

68
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:25,021
So you can monitor, say, settlements.

69
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:27,760
As a settlement is being rebuilt,

70
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,159
you can image it and re-image it,
and image it again,

71
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:34,199
and understand 
how those settlements are growing,

72
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,236
where the gaps are 
in promises to rebuild an area,

73
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:41,590
and actual rebuilding of the area.

74
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:45,421
They can be used in recovery
of agriculture systems

75
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:47,956
to measure the health of vegetation

76
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,610
as that vegetation comes back online.

77
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,673
And, again, in creation 
of better baseline imagery

78
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:55,611
in preparation for future events.

79
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,959
One of the really interesting examples
we saw recently

80
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,552
was in the Nepal earthquake response.

81
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:07,203
Many organizations came into Nepal
following the earthquake

82
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:09,812
with intent to use UAVs.

83
00:05:10,572 --> 00:05:14,060
They were working 
in search and rescue capabilities.

84
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,753
People that had been buried under rubble

85
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:23,451
or potentially were in more remote areas
and may have been lost,

86
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:28,845
and a number of UAVs were equipped
with thermal imaging

87
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:32,215
that allows for detection 
of the heat signature of a person.

88
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:35,480
And so, in search and rescue,
those were really important.

89
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,375
One of the things we discovered
was that there were real challenges

90
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:46,026
with the regulatory environment
in Nepal that made it very hard

91
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:48,231
to operate consistently.

92
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:51,643
So after the earthquake was over,

93
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,732
we decided to really lean more

94
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:59,615
into building the capacity 
of Nepalese to do this work.

95
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:02,314
There are a lot of people there
that have capabilities

96
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:06,393
to use UAVs, and to use the imagery,

97
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:09,770
and to play a productive role
in disaster response

98
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,745
if they had the capacity in advance.

99
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:14,495
So we went to Panga, Nepal

100
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:20,506
with <i>DJI</i>, the drone company 
from China, and <i>Pix4D</i>,

101
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:26,195
and worked on training engineers 
to do 3D modeling and imaging,

102
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:28,834
and to build the capacity 
of the people on the ground

103
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,905
and got a great response,

104
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:33,186
and extremely enthusiastic,

105
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:38,486
and they have played a role already
in the six months since we were there

106
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:41,525
in filling in gaps in the imagery

107
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:46,507
and creating a much more robust
baseline picture of Nepal,

108
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,886
so it's been really great to see.

109
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:53,768
One of the examples 
that my colleague, Patrick Meier,

110
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:58,927
was really closely involved in
was in Vanuatu

111
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:03,908
following the cyclone, Cyclone Pam,
which struck the island of Vanuatu.

112
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:09,851
The problem in that case 
was widespread destruction of housing.

113
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:17,710
Vanuatu has very fragile 
housing infrastructure

114
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,239
and the cyclone was extremely powerful.

115
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,008
Many of the islands 
are very hard to get to,

116
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:26,941
they're far away from each other
or are only accessible by water.

117
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:31,529
So Patrick was contracted 
by <i>The World Bank</i>

118
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:35,731
to help create rapid models

119
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:40,048
of the damaged housing infrastructure 
throughout Vanuatu.

120
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:43,067
One of the things that was really learned
through that process

121
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:46,418
was how to deploy rapidly.

122
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:51,489
We were using a variety 
of different vehicles,

123
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:55,268
and the vehicles, in that case,
that proved to be most effective

124
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:58,599
were those that were 
most easily transported--

125
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,290
lightweight, small vehicles
that could get the job done

126
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,070
to produce digital models
of damaged infrastructure,

127
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,489
damaged housing throughout the area.

128
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,330
And the need to create oblique imagery.

129
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,380
So, <i>oblique imagery</i> is imagery 
taken at an angle

130
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,655
on a structure.

131
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:23,185
The reason why that's important
in disaster recovery

132
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:28,313
is that you don't really understand
how a structure has been damaged

133
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:31,494
if you're only looking at it
from the top down.

134
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:33,884
<i>Satellite imagery</i> only looks 
from the top down

135
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:36,065
because the satellite 
is directly overhead.

136
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:38,056
That lets you see the roof,

137
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:41,315
and you can tell a lot 
from the condition of the roof,

138
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:46,386
but it doesn't tell you whether that roof
is sitting on top of a collapsed building,

139
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,727
or whether it's on top 
of an intact building.

140
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,227
It doesn't tell you 
the condition of the walls,

141
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:55,167
it doesn't tell you a lot of information
that's needed to really determine

142
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:58,635
priority areas for rebuilding housing.

143
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:02,317
So I think the testing

144
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:05,957
that was done around oblique imagery

145
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:08,639
and rapid identification of,

146
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,277
and classification of,
damage to the structures,

147
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:15,429
was one of the more important parts
in Patrick's work in Vanuatu.

148
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:18,868
The context for using UAV technology

149
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:22,909
is a little bit different 
for each disaster,

150
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,028
and that can mean the context
for how you fly,

151
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:29,419
what sensors are required,

152
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:34,980
and the kind of data that you're 
collecting and using in that disaster.

153
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:38,356
I talked about floods already,

154
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:42,975
where digital elevation modeling
becomes extremely important.

155
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:46,266
Earthquakes are--
which I also talked about a little bit--

156
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:51,164
tend to be more concerned
with damage assessments,

157
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:55,337
particularly physical damage
done to buildings, bridges, and roads.

158
00:09:56,237 --> 00:10:00,215
Some of that overlaps with floods,
but you're looking for different signs.

159
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:03,527
So in terms of differences 
in application context,

160
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:08,357
I think one of the differences
that I forgot to mention earlier,

161
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,246
but which is quite important
to bear in mind,

162
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:13,927
is that there are many 
different kinds of UAVs

163
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,617
in terms of how UAVs fly.

164
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:21,577
The main difference is between
UAVS that fly based on rotors

165
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:26,916
and UAVs that fly with fixed wings,
that fly like airplanes.

166
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:31,259
The main difference there
is that a <i>rotor-based aircraft</i>

167
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:36,739
you have more control over,
so it's more variable in its flight path,

168
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:42,494
and it can be used 
to fly around a structure

169
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:46,623
or some local area much more easily,

170
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:49,345
but it burns energy at a much higher rate

171
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:53,659
so if you're going to use it
to cover a very large area,

172
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:56,274
then it's an inappropriate technology.

173
00:10:57,714 --> 00:11:00,213
<i>Fixed-wing aircraft</i>
that fly like airplanes

174
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:04,245
are much more appropriate
to cover a large territory.

175
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:09,068
The main difference so far
in the use of UAVs

176
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,764
in countries in the Global North
versus countries in the Global South

177
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:15,096
has really been

178
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:20,146
the much greater restriction
in countries within the Global North

179
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,344
around the use of the technology.

180
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:26,828
Greater access exists

181
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:30,037
because there are more people
that can afford the technology.

182
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:33,795
There are more examples 
of the technology in use,

183
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:39,286
but the rules have been quite restrictive

184
00:11:39,286 --> 00:11:42,196
around areas that you 
are not allowed to fly.

185
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:46,898
For instance, there was 
a famous incident in the United States

186
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:50,955
where a security guard at the White House
lost control of his drone

187
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:53,730
and it landed on the lawn 
of the White House

188
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,011
and created a kind of panic

189
00:11:56,011 --> 00:12:01,915
around the possible 
implications of technology

190
00:12:01,915 --> 00:12:04,960
landing in places 
that you don't want it to

191
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,100
that could multiply as more examples 
of the technology get out there.

192
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,161
What has been put in place
is a series of <i>"no-fly zones"</i>

193
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:18,091
in the Global North
that are enforced by, in many cases,

194
00:12:18,091 --> 00:12:21,179
something called <i>"geo-fencing technology."</i>

195
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:25,021
Geo-fencing is a piece of software

196
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:29,739
that the drone or the UAV has onboard

197
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:31,758
that can tell where it is in space,

198
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:34,928
and whether it's inside or outside
of a no-fly zone,

199
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:39,555
and that can ground it, if it finds itself
inside of a no-fly zone.

200
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:44,790
That's been something 
which is used to protect airports,

201
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,795
sports stadiums, and other areas.

202
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:52,079
The entire city of Washington, D.C.
is now a no-fly zone,

203
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:55,940
for better or worse.

204
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,381
The same restrictions 
can be applied in the Global South,

205
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:03,110
but have been slower to be adopted.

206
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,979
The likelihood of encountering 
geo-fenced areas is much smaller,

207
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,260
even though you are <i>supposed to</i>.

208
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,780
Best practice says 
that you need to consult

209
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,321
<i>all</i> of the various relevant authorities 
in order to gain permission.

210
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:22,240
Often, these are not followed

211
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,691
and the application 
of the consequences of the rules

212
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:32,376
has been uneven, at best,
throughout countries in the Global South.

213
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:37,930
So it's been unclear, often, as to what
some of those dos and don'ts are

214
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,480
for people that are actually 
using the technology,

215
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,729
and governments may not have resources
to be able to track all of that down.

216
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:49,820
UAVs are changing very fast.

217
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,959
The development lifecycle 
in the commercial sector for UAVs

218
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,022
is down to about six months.

219
00:13:57,022 --> 00:14:00,561
That means, every six months 
a new model is released,

220
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:06,314
and this is very hard for international 
agencies to keep up with.

221
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:12,982
It's a lifecycle that's changing 
the conditions around how safe they are,

222
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:17,093
it's changing the conditions around
the kind of data that can be collected,

223
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:19,082
the length of time they can fly--

224
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:21,783
the applications are very dynamic.

225
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,102
So it's really important to think

226
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:30,083
in much more rapid terms
about technology adoption

227
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,572
and to really forecast 
more than we've been used to

228
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:37,021
in the international 
humanitarian community

229
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:41,184
about the <i>potential</i> changes 
that are coming.

230
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:43,191
Just as one example, UAVs are

231
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:49,722
not the only automation technology
that's about to be introduced

232
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,313
in significant ways throughout the world.

233
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:56,855
We're starting to see the introduction 
of autonomous cars.

234
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:01,694
We're starting to see the introduction 
of autonomous marine vehicles.

235
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:05,268
We're starting to see an increasing number

236
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:11,239
of jobs that can be done
through a form of social automation--

237
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,878
software bots, things like this--

238
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:16,597
that can do medical diagnosis 
and can follow through information.

239
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:20,479
This kind of social automation

240
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,719
also proceeds extremely rapidly,

241
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:27,595
and I think it's important 
to have a dialogue <i>now</i>

242
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:30,606
about the implications 
of social automation

243
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:35,782
for humanitarian, development,
global health systems in general

244
00:15:35,782 --> 00:15:40,857
and not wait for the world
to be full of autonomous cars,

245
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:45,846
or we will have a repeat
of many of the most-challenging aspects

246
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:48,578
of things like the introduction of UAVs.

247
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,439
We can see this coming,

248
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:54,318
and we should take steps now
to really think it through.

249
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:58,213
I think the model 
by which <i>UAViators</i>, in particular,

250
00:15:58,213 --> 00:16:00,493
has been able to create a conversation

251
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:04,294
around this introduction
of automation technology--

252
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:06,165
in this case, UAVs--

253
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,074
is something we should think
very seriously about

254
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:10,263
for the whole range 
of automation technologies

255
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:12,534
that are about to be introduced 
into the world.
