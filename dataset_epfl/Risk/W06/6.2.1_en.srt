00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:08,023
In this video I will present 
the definitions of recovery,

2
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:10,455
rehabilitation, and reconstruction,

3
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:15,006
and a few examples of science 
and technology for recovery in general.

4
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:17,895
To better understand 
recovery, rehabilitation,

5
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,776
and reconstruction definitions,

6
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:23,096
let us first look at examples 
of capital assets.

7
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:26,724
The building blocks of livelihoods, 
or capital assets,

8
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:31,006
include human capital, 
such as knowledge, skills, and experience,

9
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:34,918
natural capital, natural resources 
and ecosystems,

10
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:38,629
financial capital, such as credits, 
savings, and insurance.

11
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,108
The capacity to maintain 
or recover these capital assets

12
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:46,679
defines the impact 
of a disaster on livelihoods.

13
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:51,048
Recovery includes the "decisions 
and actions aimed at restoring

14
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:55,630
or improving livelihoods, health, 
as well as economic, physical, social,

15
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,140
cultural and environmental assets, 
systems and activities,

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,993
of a disaster-affected 
community or society,

17
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:06,077
aligning with the principles 
of sustainable development,

18
00:01:06,077 --> 00:01:10,954
including build back better
to avoid or reduce future disaster risk."

19
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:14,653
Rehabilitation is "the rapid 
and basic restoration

20
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:18,454
of services and facilities 
for the functioning of a community

21
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:21,334
or a society affected by a disaster."

22
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:24,996
Reconstruction is "the medium-
and long-term repair

23
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:28,487
and sustainable restoration 
of critical infrastructures,

24
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:32,876
services, housing, facilities,
and livelihoods required

25
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:35,347
for the full functioning of a community

26
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:38,167
or society affected by a disaster."

27
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:42,087
In the early phases of recovery, 
the rehabilitation,

28
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:46,018
the cluster approach presented earlier 
in the course, is also used.

29
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:50,388
Recovery should include addressing 
all the capital assets that you see.

30
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:54,517
For example, health, 
nutrition, shelter, et cetera.

31
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:59,370
During recovery, it is important 
to target the social and economic sectors

32
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,880
that need the most help.

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,130
For this, it is essential 
that socio-cultural factors

34
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,542
are present in all assessment tools.

35
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:10,201
There is equal representation 
and participation of minorities,

36
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:13,592
and culturally sensitive tools, 
technologies,

37
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,773
and materials should be used.

38
00:02:16,463 --> 00:02:20,003
Science and technology are essential
in helping obtain information

39
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:22,713
on livelihoods, 
through livelihood assessments.

40
00:02:22,713 --> 00:02:25,184
For example, through 
the development and use

41
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:27,604
of baseline information and analysis,

42
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:31,522
the use of empirical evidence,
and the understanding of impacts.

43
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:35,175
In addition to the use of science
and technology during assessments,

44
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:38,026
other examples of science 
and technology for recovery

45
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:40,755
include the use of software and computers

46
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:43,137
for education and skill development,

47
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:46,554
mangrove fauna cultivation
and small-scale aquaculture.

48
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:50,438
Both the education and sustainable
economic activities

49
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:54,073
can help those affected, 
regain their sources of income.

50
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,847
Other examples include 
alternative energy technology,

51
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:02,089
when moving back from temporary shelters
to their communities,

52
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:05,929
and sanitation systems 
and storm water management systems.

53
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,251
Other technologies being used,

54
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:10,930
and that have been emerging
for the recovery phase,

55
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,350
include 3D printers, biometric scanners,
real time translation

56
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,862
that can help psychology professionals 
access more people

57
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:20,620
in need of support services.

58
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,391
Furthermore, EPFL and ICRC have been 
further developing orthopedic feet,

59
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:30,202
increasing the level of agility 
for the person wearing it.

60
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:35,263
In addition to a variety of recovery 
science and technology examples,

61
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:39,724
we saw that the capacity 
to maintain or recover capital assets

62
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:42,944
defines the impact 
of a disaster on livelihoods.

63
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:45,738
We also saw that science and technology

64
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:49,266
are essential in helping obtain 
information on livelihoods,

65
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:52,328
and that several sciences and technologies

66
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:55,456
can help in the recovery 
of those livelihoods.
