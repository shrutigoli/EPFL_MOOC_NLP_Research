To be back to normal life and how to build our house before the rainy monsoon or the next snowy winter are our biggest concerns.
We have received corrugated metal sheets which alone are not sufficient.
We don't want to construct our house only with stones as before.
If possible, we want to build a stronger house using cement and iron rods.
Me, villagers and district people, all of us have the same wish and request.
Dear participants,
Welcome to chapter 6 of the MOOC,
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology for Disaster Risk Reduction
In this chapter, we will introduce the technologies that can assist in the post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, and illustrate how they can help to build-back better.
We will also foster the exchange of information and knowledge about strength and weaknesses in the application, adaptation, transfer and adoption of technologies via the online forum.
In this chapter, the following questions will be answered by interviews with our external partners, courses, and case studies.
What are science and technology that can be used in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction?
How can Unmanned Aerial Vehicles contribute to emergency and reconstruction?
How can we "build-back better" after a disaster?
After watching the videos, we invite you to participate in the second online discussion of this MOOC on the strengths and weaknesses in the application, adaptation, transfer, and adoption of science and technologies in developed and developing countries.
I hope you'll enjoy this chapter, and that you will join us in the discussions via the online forum.
