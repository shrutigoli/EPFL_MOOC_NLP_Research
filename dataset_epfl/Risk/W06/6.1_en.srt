1
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:09,350
To be back to normal life

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:15,255
and how to build our house before
the rainy monsoon or the next snowy winter

3
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:17,011
are our biggest concerns.

4
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:19,485
We have received corrugated metal sheets

5
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:21,665
which alone are not sufficient.

6
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:24,661
We don't want to construct our house
only with stones as before.

7
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:28,187
If possible, we want to build a stronger
house using cement and iron rods.

8
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:36,921
Me, villagers and district people,

9
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:43,931
all of us have the same wish and request.

10
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:47,715
Dear participants,
Welcome to chapter 6 of the MOOC,

11
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:52,105
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction

12
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:55,945
In this chapter, we will introduce
the technologies that can assist

13
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:59,436
in the post-disaster recovery
and reconstruction,

14
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:02,918
and illustrate how they can help
to build-back better.

15
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:07,062
We will also foster the exchange
of information and knowledge

16
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:12,712
about strength and weaknesses
in the application, adaptation, transfer

17
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:16,533
and adoption of technologies
via the online forum.

18
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,765
In this chapter, the following questions
will be answered by interviews

19
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:24,405
with our external partners, courses,
and case studies.

20
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:27,856
What are science and technology
that can be used in recovery,

21
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:30,373
rehabilitation, and reconstruction?

22
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:36,293
How can Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
contribute to emergency and reconstruction?

23
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,892
How can we "build-back better"
after a disaster?

24
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:43,205
After watching the videos,
we invite you to participate

25
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:45,895
in the second online discussion
of this MOOC

26
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:50,197
on the strengths and weaknesses
in the application, adaptation, transfer,

27
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:55,133
and adoption of science and technologies
in developed and developing countries.

28
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:59,282
I hope you'll enjoy this chapter,
and that you will join us in the discussions

29
00:01:59,282 --> 00:02:01,272
via the online forum.
