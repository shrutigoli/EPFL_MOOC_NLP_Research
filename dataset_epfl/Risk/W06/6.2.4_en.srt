00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:06,076
Hello. 
My name is Katrin Beyer.

2
00:00:06,076 --> 00:00:08,394
I'm a structural engineer,
and I'm the head

3
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:11,024
of the Earthquake Engineering 
and Structural Dynamics Laboratory

4
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:12,284
at EPFL.

5
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:14,147
In my research group we are studying

6
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,526
how structures perform during earthquakes

7
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:19,727
and we develop tools 
for predicting their performance.

8
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:23,276
Today I'm going to talk to you
on how we can design structures

9
00:00:23,276 --> 00:00:26,958
in such a way that they behave well
during earthquakes.

10
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,547
It is important to remember

11
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:31,228
that not the earthquake 
itself kills people.

12
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:33,367
If you're in the field 
during an earthquake,

13
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,789
it is rather unlikely 
that you're injured or even killed.

14
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:40,263
Most people die 
because man-made structures,

15
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:43,302
such as buildings and bridges, collapse.

16
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:46,440
It is therefore in our, 
the structural engineer's hands,

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,152
to protect the people.

18
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:52,704
This lecture is a first brief introduction
to seismic design of buildings.

19
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:57,483
Obviously it cannot replace
a five year degree in civil engineering.

20
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:01,141
The objective is really to give you
a first idea about some points

21
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:03,953
that need to be considered
when designing a building

22
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:06,300
to withstand an earthquake.

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,926
What I'm presenting is not 
how to prove by calculations

24
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:11,926
that a building is safe 
for a seismic hazard,

25
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:14,561
I will be talking about 
the conceptual design.

26
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:17,463
This is really the first phase
of our design.

27
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:20,514
So, for example, where we decide
which structural system we are using

28
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,786
for bracing the building.

29
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:25,986
In order to really obtain 
a good seismic behavior,

30
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,344
there are two other factors 
that are really important.

31
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:30,845
So we also, of course, need to do analysis

32
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:33,339
and you need to detail 
our structural member

33
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:35,745
in such a way that they behave well.

34
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:41,507
These two parts, this is really the task
of the structural engineer.

35
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:44,557
But for the conceptual design,
it is really, very important

36
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:46,643
that the structural engineer 
and the architect

37
00:01:46,643 --> 00:01:48,437
work very well together

38
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:51,088
so that we, in the end, 
have a building configuration

39
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:54,519
that suits the structural 
and the architectural requirements.

40
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:57,656
So this presentation starts 
with some general rules

41
00:01:57,656 --> 00:02:00,124
for the conceptual design of buildings.

42
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:04,337
Then we will look at damage 
to non-structural elements,

43
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:07,735
these are elements that are 
not important to carry the loads

44
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:12,310
during an earthquake,
but they can be damaged nevertheless.

45
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,696
And then we will conclude 
with a summary of the main points.

46
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:20,084
A large part of this presentation
is based on the booklet

47
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:24,088
by Professor Hugo Bachmann:
"Seismic conceptual design of buildings,"

48
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:26,110
which has been translated 
to many languages

49
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,395
and is available online.

50
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:31,168
It's an excellent introduction 
to the conceptual design of buildings.

51
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:34,145
The first step 
of the conceptual seismic design

52
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:37,156
concerns the choice 
of the structural system.

53
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:39,135
Many different systems can be chosen.

54
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:42,997
The most common ones 
are structural walls, or frames.

55
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,494
Which of the system 
is the most suitable one

56
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:47,571
depends within the height of the building

57
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:49,473
and the use of the building.

58
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:52,742
Typical construction materials
are reinforced concrete,

59
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:54,829
steel, and timber.

60
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,732
All of these materials can behave well
during earthquakes,

61
00:02:57,732 --> 00:03:00,968
provided they're designed in such a way
that the structural elements

62
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:03,833
have a sufficiently large 
space and capacity.

63
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,937
Masonry can behave well 
if it's reinforced.

64
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,967
Also in countries of low seismicity,

65
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:12,921
unreinforced masonry buildings
with stiff concrete slabs might be okay,

66
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:17,015
however stonemason buildings,
like they were built in the past,

67
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:20,945
or adobe masonry structures
with flexible timber floors

68
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:24,260
are really among the most 
vulnerable structures during earthquakes,

69
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,466
and often cause 
large number of casualties

70
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,536
in the event of an earthquake.

71
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:32,101
Independent of the choice 
of the structural system,

72
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:36,256
one should aim for a simple 
and robust structural system.

73
00:03:36,256 --> 00:03:38,358
That means that for a system

74
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:41,652
that is relatively regular 
in plan and elevation.

75
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:44,488
And also for a system 
that has some redundancy.

76
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:46,810
The behavior of a building

77
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,093
is really a very complex affair 
during an earthquake.

78
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:52,710
The building is shaken in all directions.

79
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,598
The loading is cyclic, 
goes back and forth,

80
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,806
and during a large seismic event

81
00:03:57,806 --> 00:04:00,509
which drives the seismic design 
of all buildings,

82
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:04,311
you also expect the buildings 
to undergo inelastic deformations.

83
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:07,462
Simulating this behavior with computers

84
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:10,270
is today, still a very challenging task.

85
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,821
Moreover, we never know exactly

86
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,072
how the next earthquake will look like.

87
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:19,112
For this reason 
it is really very important

88
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:24,045
that we choose a structural system
that is robust and simple

89
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:27,693
so that it is easier to understand,
predict, and build.

90
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:32,348
To achieve this goal, we should aim 
for a simple and compact

91
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:34,157
floor plan configuration.

92
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:37,165
For example, if we have 
such an L-shaped floor,

93
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:38,874
like here on the left,

94
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:43,031
it might be better to split it 
into two rectangular floors,

95
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,566
like here on the right.

96
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,409
If one divides the building in two,
one needs however,

97
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:52,758
to provide a sufficiently large joint
between the two buildings,

98
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:56,471
so that the two buildings 
don't pound against each other

99
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:57,765
during the earthquake.

100
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,856
This applies, of course, 
also if you build just two

101
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:04,015
completely independent buildings
next to each other.

102
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:06,741
There needs to be 
a sufficiently large gap in between,

103
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:09,626
that they don't hit each other
during an earthquake.

104
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:13,869
Here on the right, you see a case
where this rule was not respected.

105
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:16,545
An example of a building 
with a complex floor plan

106
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:19,427
is the Olive View Hospital
that was heavily damaged

107
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:22,041
in the San Fernando earthquake in 1971.

108
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:26,485
You can see here on the photo,
that the building consists of four wings

109
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:28,389
that are connected to each other,

110
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,275
and this really creates a dynamic response

111
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,580
that is really difficult to predict.

112
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,319
But the building had another problem.

113
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,290
Next to this complex floor plan,

114
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,614
each wing was also made up 
of two structural systems.

115
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:45,089
So the main part of the wing 
consisted of frames,

116
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:47,243
and frames are rather flexible,

117
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:50,921
but the end part of each wing
was the staircase,

118
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:54,833
and the staircase was built 
with relatively rigid walls.

119
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:58,534
So these walls are really 
much more rigid than the frames,

120
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:01,061
and therefore the frames 
during the earthquake

121
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,013
were sort of leaning onto the walls,

122
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:06,969
and they're transferring 
their forces to the walls.

123
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,503
But the walls had not been designed for it

124
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,564
and therefore these staircases failed,

125
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:16,412
and in the end three of them 
actually fell over.

126
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,754
Also the slabs that connected 
the frames to the walls

127
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,707
had not been designed to transfer
these forces and they broke too,

128
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:27,377
as you can see here on the right,
for the one staircase

129
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:30,213
that actually remains standing up.

130
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:33,814
So if you combine 
two structural systems in one building,

131
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,481
it is important to remember
that you need to design

132
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,891
the more stiffer structural element

133
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:43,827
to take forces from the more flexible one,

134
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:48,258
and you also need to design 
the slabs to transfer these forces.

135
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:52,309
We should further make sure
that the structural elements

136
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:54,401
that provide the horizontal stiffness

137
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:57,089
are well distributed over the floor plan.

138
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:02,505
Here in this slide, you see two examples
that are actually not so good.

139
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,508
For example, if you look at 
the case on the left,

140
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:10,390
if you consider an earthquake action
from this direction,

141
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,489
we only have this wall here

142
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:19,150
that provides the horizontal 
stiffness and strength.

143
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,434
So this wall is rather eccentric 
to the center of mass,

144
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:25,042
which is at the center of the slab.

145
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:30,754
So due to this eccentricity,
the building will not only translate

146
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:32,860
but it will also rotate.

147
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,888
So the behavior of the building
could really be improved

148
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:41,122
if we added another wall here
on the other side.

149
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,499
The same applies 
to the building on the right.

150
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:46,642
So here we have a core wall,

151
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:50,922
which is often used to accommodate 
staircases and lift shafts,

152
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:52,995
but again this wall is very eccentric

153
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:55,314
with regard to the center of the mass.

154
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:57,945
And the behavior of the building
could really be improved

155
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,287
if we added, for example, 
another core wall,

156
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:04,773
or also just a simple wall
on the other side of the building.

157
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:08,216
An example of a building 
that has an asymmetric floor layout

158
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:10,454
is the O'Higgins Building in Concepcion

159
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:13,974
that was damaged during 
the 2010 Chile earthquake.

160
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:16,961
At the back of the building
there's a long stiff wall.

161
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:20,055
On the other three sides 
we have many windows,

162
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:23,890
and hence these sides 
are much more flexible

163
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,017
than the backside of the wall,

164
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:30,328
and this can introduce 
some rotation to the building.

165
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:33,318
So if you use walls to brace a building

166
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,162
it's good to have at least two walls
in each horizontal direction.

167
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:42,047
The structural engineer can design
these walls in such a way

168
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:44,002
that they behave in a ductile manner.

169
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:47,258
This means that they have 
a large deformation capacity.

170
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:49,379
The deformation capacity is really a key

171
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,193
to a robust structural performance,

172
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,511
so it's really a very important point.

173
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,850
If we place these walls 
at the perimeter of the building,

174
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,012
we also obtain 
the torsional stiffness that we need.

175
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:05,461
Walls are also good to control
the deformations of one story.

176
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:07,681
This will limit actually the damage

177
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,920
to some of the non-structural elements.

178
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,681
We will talk about this later.

179
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:15,543
One part of the building 
that we actually not see normally,

180
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:18,845
but which is very important 
for the seismic behavior,

181
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,343
is the foundation.

182
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:25,445
We need it to transfer the forces 
that are created as inertia forces

183
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:30,104
in the upper part 
of the building to the ground.

184
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:35,573
So a stiff foundation ensures 
a good force transfer to the ground,

185
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:40,066
and it also prevents 
differential settlements between the walls

186
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:43,325
and therefore limits 
the damage to the building.

187
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:48,508
Another element of the building
that is very important are the floors,

188
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:50,775
the floor slabs.

189
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:53,934
There we should really choose systems

190
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:56,700
that are relatively stiff in-plane.

191
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,809
This will allow us to transfer 
the forces from the floors

192
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,726
back to the walls,

193
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:09,145
and the walls can then take 
the forces down to the foundation.

194
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:12,609
So if the floors are stiff in-plane,

195
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:15,279
it will allow us 
to distribute the forces well

196
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,219
between the different walls.

197
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:21,699
So let's go back to 
the vertical elements to the walls.

198
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,901
In order to obtain 
a stable dynamic response,

199
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:28,021
we should avoid discontinuities
in these elements

200
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:29,951
over the height of the building.

201
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:32,731
In particular, reinforced 
concrete elements

202
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:34,631
don't like discontinuities.

203
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:38,042
Such setbacks will always cause
stress concentrations

204
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:40,503
and therefore concentrations of damage.

205
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:46,311
The force demand increases from 
the top to the bottom in the element.

206
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:50,727
It is therefore worse 
when the section is reduced, like here,

207
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:55,075
than if it's increased, like here.

208
00:10:56,005 --> 00:11:00,082
An example of a building 
with irregularities in the elevation

209
00:11:00,662 --> 00:11:03,133
is, again, the O'Higgins Building
that we've seen before.

210
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:07,293
This building has really several setbacks
over the height of the building,

211
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:10,882
and that might have really 
contributed to the damage.

212
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:13,258
One of the most common causes

213
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,595
for the collapse of buildings 
during earthquakes

214
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:17,925
is the soft story mechanism.

215
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:23,717
Often the ground floor of a building
is used for shops or parking spaces,

216
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:27,677
and for these uses 
we need large open floor areas.

217
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:31,316
The top floors, on the other hand,

218
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,047
they're often used 
for offices or apartments,

219
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:36,409
and we need walls to separate the rooms.

220
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:42,087
As a result, we obtain 
a rather rigid box of the top floors

221
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,976
that sits on this really flexible 
ground floor.

222
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:47,969
So when the building 
is now subjected to an earthquake,

223
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,849
all the deformations will concentrate
in this flexible ground floor,

224
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:56,090
and the deformation demands
will soon be too big for the story

225
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,021
and the story will collapse.

226
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,575
Here we have some examples 
of residential buildings

227
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:05,180
that were damaged during 
the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake in Italy.

228
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,710
These buildings have garages for cars
on the ground floor,

229
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,753
and apartments on the top floor.

230
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:14,130
The large garage stores, 
the ground floors,

231
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,551
was much softer than the top floors,

232
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:20,812
and the deformations concentrated
really in this ground floor.

233
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:22,814
And for a number of these buildings

234
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:25,223
this lead to the collapse 
of the ground floor.

235
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:30,223
You see here on the right,
the collapse of the ground floor,

236
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:33,516
the columns are completely crushed,

237
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:36,736
and the cars are sandwiched 
between two slabs.

238
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:39,663
Fortunately, the earthquake 
happened during the night,

239
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:42,752
and no one was in the garage
and no one was harmed.

240
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,503
Such soft stories are most common
on the ground floor,

241
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:50,194
but they can also form on upper floors.

242
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,085
In the O'Higgins Building,

243
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,715
one of the upper stories 
partially collapsed,

244
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:57,489
most likely due to the discontinuity

245
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:59,246
of some of the walls.

246
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:02,448
Let's now look a little bit more in detail

247
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,291
at the other structural system and frames
that we mentioned before.

248
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:10,416
So reinforced concrete frames
are often filled with masonry.

249
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,738
One calls this masonry, <i>infills.</i>

250
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:16,997
And the interaction of frames and infills
is really rather complex.

251
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:20,876
So you can see here, on the left,
an example of a building

252
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:24,157
that has, again, been damaged
during the L'Aquila earthquake,

253
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:26,941
and you can see that 
the cladding has fallen off,

254
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:31,124
and actually also part
of the masonry infills have fallen out.

255
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:35,953
So these infills consisted here 
of two layers of masonry,

256
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:39,060
and the outer layer has fallen out.

257
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Frames, as such, are rather flexible.

258
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,138
The masonry infill, 
however, is rather stiff.

259
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:49,286
The frame's the primary structural system

260
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,273
and carries most of the horizontal loads.

261
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:55,961
But when it tries to deform 
under an earthquake, a diagonal--

262
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,372
it sort of pushes 
against the masonry infill

263
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:02,442
and a diagonal compression strut
develops in the infill,

264
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,503
and prevents part 
of the deformation of the frame.

265
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,044
This can have two effects.

266
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:11,574
For one, this force in 
the diagonal compression strut

267
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,284
can become rather large,

268
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:16,195
and then it pushes against
the reinforced concrete frame,

269
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:20,042
it can damage this frame,
and in particular, the joint.

270
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:24,824
You can see an example 
of such a damage, here on the left.

271
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:29,676
Further, this force can also damage
the masonry infill itself

272
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:32,698
and lead to typical diagonal shear cracks.

273
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:38,002
If an infill is cracked in shear,
it becomes very vulnerable

274
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,247
to out-of-plane accelerations.

275
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,048
These are the accelerations
that act perpendicular

276
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,146
to the plane of the infill.

277
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:50,268
If the infill is cracked, then only small
out-of-plane accelerations

278
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:54,010
are often sufficient to make 
the infill fail out of plane.

279
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,627
This causes, of course, 
first of all, repair costs,

280
00:14:57,627 --> 00:15:01,600
but more importantly, 
the falling infill is also dangerous

281
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,387
to people outside the building.

282
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:06,039
And there's another point to consider.

283
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:10,240
The failure of infills 
can also increase the likelihood

284
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,156
of a soft story mechanism,

285
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:14,681
and it might amplify torsion.

286
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:18,213
Let's look again, 
at these buildings in L'Aquila.

287
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:22,823
In this building on the top left,
the infills did just not fall out,

288
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,671
though you can clearly see
that they were damaged,

289
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,963
and they separated from the frame.

290
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:32,332
So once the first infill really fails,

291
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:36,212
the infills of the ground floor
were those that were damaged most

292
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:39,324
because the ground floor
was already more flexible

293
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:41,908
than the top floors 
due to the garage openings.

294
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,983
So now if the infills 
of the ground floor fail,

295
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:49,314
the ground floor will become 
even more softer,

296
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:53,105
and this will really trigger, 
in the end, the soft story failure.

297
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:55,995
Sometimes the masonry infill

298
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:59,111
do not reach over
the entire height of the story,

299
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:03,335
but part of the story
is left free for window openings.

300
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:06,286
One calls this a <i>partial infill.</i>

301
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:09,016
These infills are particularly dangerous

302
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:11,746
because they create short columns.

303
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:15,016
These short columns are subjected
to very high shear forces

304
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:19,269
because most of the deformations
in the columns really concentrate

305
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,848
in the free part of the column.

306
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:24,210
So far we have talked about

307
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,751
how earthquakes can damage 
structural systems.

308
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:30,761
But the financial loss 
due to an earthquake

309
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:32,654
has more components to it.

310
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:35,511
We call these the <i>3Ds:</i>

311
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:40,015
Death, Damage, and Downtime.

312
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:45,560
The downtime is the loss caused
when businesses are out of operation

313
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,209
after an earthquake.

314
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:50,013
Our primary goal of seismic engineering

315
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:52,950
is, of course, to minimize 
the number of deaths,

316
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,682
and the number of casualties,
and injured people after an earthquake.

317
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:02,982
But minimizing damage 
and downtime is also important.

318
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:06,362
And when we talk of damage, 
we have so far considered

319
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:08,763
the damage to the structural components

320
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:12,827
but also the damage 
to non-structural components

321
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:14,964
can be very important.

322
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:17,914
So the non-structural components
are all these components

323
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:23,354
that are not contributing 
to the load transfer in a building,

324
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:26,445
and also the content of a building.

325
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:31,167
In some types of buildings, 
like for example hospitals,

326
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:35,825
the costs caused by the damage 
to these components

327
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:39,236
can be much larger than 
the costs caused to the damage

328
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:41,298
to the structural components.

329
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:46,173
So now we will look at some 
of the typical non-structural components,

330
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:48,027
and how they can be damaged.

331
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:52,657
Here we see some examples
of non-structural components that failed.

332
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:56,458
On the left, a partition wall 
that fell over,

333
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,847
in the middle, suspended ceilings
that fell down,

334
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:03,404
and on the right, 
facade elements that fell down.

335
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:08,359
And it can have secondary effects,
like blocked emergency exits,

336
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:12,417
it can cause fires, or the emission
of dangerous substances.

337
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:15,969
So this was a brief overview
on some fundamental aspects

338
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,841
of the conceptual 
seismic design of buildings.

339
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:21,360
To implement these effectively,
it is really essential

340
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,801
that architect and engineer 
work closely together

341
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:25,974
right from the start of the project.

342
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:28,522
We have also seen that we should not stop

343
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,987
with the design of the structural system,

344
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:34,184
but that we also need to consider
the non-structural components.

345
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:37,753
Their failure can be 
very dangerous and costly too.

346
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,276
If you consider these guidelines,

347
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:43,783
we can achieve that buildings
are safe during earthquakes.

348
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:47,262
The problem today lies really 
with existing buildings

349
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:50,400
that have been constructed 
without considering these guidelines.

350
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,564
Many of the most vulnerable buildings,

351
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:56,115
such as buildings from past centuries,

352
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:58,273
are part of our cultural heritage.

353
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:00,956
The question how we can retrofit these

354
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:03,896
without destroying 
their characteristic features

355
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:06,066
is a current research topic.
