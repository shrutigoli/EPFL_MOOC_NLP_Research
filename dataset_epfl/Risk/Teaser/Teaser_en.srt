Disasters linked to natural hazards
happen everywhere in the world

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,412
and they are very likely
to increase in the future.

4
00:00:17,412 --> 00:00:24,072
Between 1994 and 2013,
earthquakes caused 750,000 deaths

5
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:27,908
and affected 121 million people.

6
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:32,588
Economic damages are estimated
at $660 billion dollars.

7
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:36,942
While floods killed less people:
160,000,

8
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:40,247
it affected over 2.4 billion people.

9
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:41,999
During the same period,

10
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:46,849
landslides led to 18,000 deaths,
affecting 6 million people,

11
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:52,053
and leading to economic damages
of $4.3 billion US dollars.

12
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:56,178
Rapid urbanization is leading
to an increased proportion

13
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:59,631
of people at risk,
especially in coastal areas.

14
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:03,695
In addition, more than half
of the world's largest cities

15
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:06,653
are facing high risk from earthquakes.

16
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:10,118
Science and technology can help
prevent and reduce

17
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:13,001
the potential consequences
of natural hazards.

18
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:15,432
They can help build
the resilience of communities

19
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:18,122
and lead to more sustainable development.

20
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,802
Investments and the use
of science and technology

21
00:01:20,802 --> 00:01:25,032
have proven to be effective in reducing
the impact of natural hazards.

22
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:30,234
For example, in 1991,
138,000 people were killed

23
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:33,846
by a category 4 cyclone
in Bangladesh.

24
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:36,575
Later, investments were made
in embankments,

25
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:39,412
protective mangrove planting,
early warning,

26
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:41,987
risk awareness and contingency planning,

27
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:45,137
and the construction of cyclone shelters.

28
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:50,007
In 2007, when a category 5 cyclone
hit Bangladesh again,

29
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:56,283
loss of human life was reduced 26 times
and limited to 5,000 casualties.

The MOOC, A Resilient Future:

31
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:01,153
Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction

32
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:02,693
developed by EPFL,

33
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:07,465
aims to introduce you to existing
and emerging technologies in DRR,

34
00:02:07,465 --> 00:02:11,325
while promoting the overall goal
of sustainable development.

35
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:13,932
This MOOC covers the main DRR topics:

36
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:17,934
risk assessment, prevention,
preparedness and early warning,

37
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:22,684
disaster response and emergency relief,
reconstruction and resilience building.

38
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:28,068
We will focus on three main hazards;
floods, landslides, and earthquakes.

39
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:30,838
I am Dr. Silvia Hostettler,
Deputy Director

40
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:34,294
of the Cooperation and
Development Center at EPFL.

41
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:38,804
Using case studies, examples and videos,
invited guest speakers,

42
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:43,914
EPFL lecturers and myself, 
we'll discuss the potential benefits,

43
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:49,014
the challenges and the limitations,
of using science and technology in DRR

44
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:51,567
in developed and developing countries.

45
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,187
I hope you will join this course

46
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:57,407
to learn more about science and technology
for disaster risk reduction.

47
00:02:57,407 --> 00:03:02,044
I would also like to invite you to share
your experience in science and technology

48
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:06,734
in DRR with me, and the other course
participants, via the online forum.

49
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:11,544
I am looking forward to our discussions
and I hope you will enjoy this course.
