00:00:04,898 --> 00:00:06,929
Hello, now I will present

2
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,909
Participatory Capacity and Vulnerability
Analysis and Assessments,

3
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:13,739
how we define PCVAs,

4
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:17,663
some examples of guidelines, 
and main steps and tools.

5
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:23,073
Lastly, we will look at additional factors
that are needed to strengthen PCVAs.

6
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:26,986
According to the organization,
Action Contre la Faim,

7
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:30,741
"PCVA is an investigative method
that uses a variety

8
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:35,151
of qualitative participatory tools
to engage local stakeholders

9
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:39,357
in their own disaster risk
and vulnerability diagnosis."

10
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:43,188
It combines local knowledge
with secondary information

11
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:46,529
from science, policy, or practice.

12
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:51,219
For Oxfam, "PCVA is a risk analysis
process that is designed

13
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,790
to engage with communities in contexts
where disasters and climate change

14
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,093
are significant drivers
of poverty and suffering."

15
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,335
Many other definitions exist.

16
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:05,655
Many organizations and institutions
have developed guidelines and toolkits

17
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:09,116
on how to conduct a PVA or a PCVA.

18
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:12,728
These are some examples
that you can find on the internet.

19
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:17,558
PCVAs can be conducted during
an emergency or a conflict context,

20
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:22,953
the recovery phase or during prevention
in a development or stable context.

21
00:01:22,953 --> 00:01:28,265
The length and extent of the PCVA process
has to be adjusted accordingly

22
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:32,705
in terms of time, length, 
and resources available.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,033
There are many strengths
and limits to PCVAs,

24
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:39,972
you can see examples
of pros and cons in this overview.

25
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:44,983
For example, PCVAs place importance
to indigenous capacities and knowledge

26
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:48,695
and they're easily transferable
to different contexts.

27
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:53,313
However, PCVAs can increase expectations
of community members

28
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,522
and is resource demanding.

29
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:58,895
Different guidelines and toolkits
propose a series of steps

30
00:01:58,895 --> 00:02:01,593
to design and complete the PCVA.

31
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:06,423
Here, I just show one approach developed
by Oxfam and the Government of Australia.

32
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:08,971
It is a one-level approach.

33
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,951
For example, at the community level,

34
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:15,386
although it could be used
at other levels when adapted.

35
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:19,986
The steps go from preparing for the PCVA
to generating a community view

36
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:23,535
and prioritizing an action plan.

37
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:27,875
According to an ActionAid publication,
one should not follow any toolkit

38
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,528
mechanically, but should apply judgement 
on the context and needs.

39
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:37,762
PCVAs include participatory methods,
background and context research,

40
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:41,329
and stakeholder consultations
and participation.

41
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:45,730
Now I will show you a few of the tools
that are used in some of the steps

42
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,155
followed during a PCVA.

43
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:50,797
The list of these tools is not exhaustive.

44
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:54,589
Tools and information needed during
the compilation of secondary data

45
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:59,161
might include GIS, remote sensing, 
government policies and plans,

46
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:02,899
census and statistics
from different institutions.

47
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:08,009
To generate a community overview,
tools such as an analysis of hazards,

48
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:13,526
daily time charts, historical timelines,
and seasonal calendars can be used.

49
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:18,475
This is an example of a disaster
history tool developed in Burkina Faso

50
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:21,754
from a publication
by Action Contre la Faim.

51
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:25,205
This means that major disasters
having occurred in the history

52
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,346
of this community are documented.

53
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:31,742
This is an example of a seasonal calendar
in Ethiopia.

54
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:35,782
It is also described
in the Action Contre la Faim guidelines.

55
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:39,197
Here you can see a group of women 
developing a map

56
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:43,927
where buildings, the river, agricultural
fields, et cetera, are laid out.

57
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,914
Long term trend analysis and the review
of secondary scientific information

58
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:53,133
may be used during livelihoods analysis.

59
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:57,445
This is an example of a circle diagram
where the size of the circles

60
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:01,502
show the importance of the actor
and the proximity between circles

61
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:05,680
shows how close and significant 
a relationship is.

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,732
For the governance analysis, 
some methods and tools

63
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:11,311
include problem and solution trees.

64
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:13,793
Here you can see a problem tree
on the right

65
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:17,430
and the solution tree on the left
from a case study in Vietnam

66
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,306
described in Oxfam's practitioner guide

67
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:24,300
to A Participatory Capacity
and Vulnerability Analysis.

68
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,863
And here you can see an example of what
the risk quadrant matrix looks like.

69
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:31,839
The higher the likelihood
of a risk occurring,

70
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,599
and the harsher the consequences,
the more the risk is considered critical.

71
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,497
Among many other factors,
I would like to mention two

72
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:45,893
that UNISDR identified as important
when developing and implementing

73
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:50,183
risk assessments and which apply
to any type of PCVA.

74
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:54,650
The first one is the need to use
the information and analyses

75
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,970
resulting from PCVAs to support
risk management and reduction.

76
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:04,847
And the second one is the need to include
multi-hazard and cascading effects

77
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,233
when conducting PCVAs.

78
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:13,973
Also, as a third factor, we do in fact
need a multi-level vulnerability analysis.

79
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:18,678
Because many determinants
of vulnerability are located outside

80
00:05:18,678 --> 00:05:24,568
of the individual and community level,
a multi-levelled approach is recommended.

81
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:29,271
This type of approach includes analysis,
discussion and advocacy

82
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:33,630
at different levels with exchange
and support among levels.

83
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,309
In this video we saw that many PCVA
guidelines and tools exist,

84
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:42,383
that these analyses have both 
benefits and drawbacks.

85
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:47,886
Also, we have seen that traditional
knowledge has an important place in PCVAs,

86
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:51,763
and that multi-hazard PCVAs
should inform risk reduction

87
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:54,623
and management strategies and plans.
