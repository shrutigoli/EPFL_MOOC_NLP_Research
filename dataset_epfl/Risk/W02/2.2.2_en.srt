Landslide Hazard Assessment

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,134
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction

3
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:07,762
Hi. This is Alessio Ferrari again.

4
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:11,034
In the next minutes we will try,
mainly using some examples,

5
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:14,751
to state the different approaches
that may be used in the context

6
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:17,440
of a landslide hazard assessment.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,390
Let's start by trying to clarify 
what we intend

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,022
for landslide hazard assessment.

9
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:27,044
Hazard analysis is a fundamental component
of risk assessment.

10
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:31,442
For a given situation, we always need 
to start with collecting data,

11
00:00:31,442 --> 00:00:34,704
in order to identify 
potential instabilities.

12
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:37,280
Each potential instability, the danger,

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,224
needs to be analyzed with specific tools.

14
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:42,312
The final aim of this operation

15
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:47,970
is to identify the susceptibility
of given areas to potential danger.

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,685
Assessing the susceptibility

17
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:53,527
is an operation which has
a qualitative focus,

18
00:00:53,527 --> 00:00:58,637
while hazard analysis is performed 
to provide a quantitative assessment

19
00:00:58,637 --> 00:01:01,027
of the possibility 
of a landslide to occur,

20
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:04,959
and to identify possible hazard scenarios.

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,339
Each potential danger 
must be characterized--

22
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:10,189
identifying
with maximum possible precision--

23
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:14,347
the phenomenon which may occur;
namely, the type of landslide it could be,

24
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:18,449
initiated or activated,
what is the extension of the phenomena,

25
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:22,479
and the area that can be 
potentially affected by it.

26
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,330
The intensity will provide an indication
on the severity of the phenomena.

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,993
All these mentioned elements,
which are part of the landslide analysis,

28
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:35,068
are fundamental ingredients
in order to assess the consequences

29
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:37,093
related to the phenomena.

30
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:39,912
In particulary, the study of 
the type of danger

31
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:42,463
and the areas that are affected
by the landslide,

32
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:46,421
will serve to identify 
the elements which are at risk.

33
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:49,763
At the same time, the intensity 
will serve as an ingredient

34
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:52,209
together with the vulnerability 
of the elements,

35
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,512
to quantify the consequences.

36
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:57,437
Even for the case of 
a simple rock block falling,

37
00:01:57,437 --> 00:02:01,674
the quantification of those ingredients
may require dedicated analysis.

38
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:04,165
In this particular case, 
we would need to know

39
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,866
the mass and positioning 
of the block that is likely to fall;

40
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:10,246
the area that can be 
affected by the fall

41
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:13,218
that will depend mainly 
on the trajectory of the block;

42
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:17,356
and so the elements 
that could be impacted can be identified.

43
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,445
The speed of the block could serve
as an indicator for the intensity,

44
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:24,686
which would let us computing
the potential damages done

45
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,258
to the infrastructures or buildings
impacted by the block.

46
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:31,100
Also the definition 
of occurrence probability

47
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,310
is part of the hazard analysis,

48
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,506
together with the quantification 
of the consequences,

49
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,617
is the key ingredient to compute the risk.

50
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:43,267
The example of the block 
that we've just discussed,

51
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:47,760
is already anticipating how complex
hazard analysis for a landslide can be.

52
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,500
Scientists and stakeholders 
often try to overcome this complexity

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,990
by using simple approaches.

54
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,339
Here, we see the example 
of a hazard analysis

55
00:02:57,339 --> 00:03:00,182
for rainfall induced landslides.

56
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:02,772
By collecting information on past events

57
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:05,860
here, in terms of rainfall
intensity and duration

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,415
from which a landslide has been produced

59
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:13,754
it appears reasonable to draw thresholds,
like those reported in the figure,

60
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:18,282
for which we can identify events 
that have produced landslides,

61
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:22,193
and events for which a landslide 
was not produced.

62
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:26,040
A threshold like this could be used 
to make a hazard assessment.

63
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,105
Interestingly, one could relate 
the occurrence probability of a landslide

64
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:33,920
to the occurrence probability 
of a rainfall event

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,371
that may produce that landslide.

66
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,839
A tool like this seems very promising,

67
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:42,946
and it is probably the very first 
type of analysis that one could do

68
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:45,273
when one's called 
to operate in a given area,

69
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:49,238
especially when no 
extended database is available.

70
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:51,815
However, several limitations apply.

71
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,470
A method like this can have
just a regional validity

72
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,748
because it can apply to just the area

73
00:03:56,748 --> 00:04:01,293
for which the rainfall and landslide
occurrence data have been collected.

74
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:03,538
There is no physics in it,

75
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:06,698
so we are not going to really see
what are the physical processes

76
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:09,373
which are triggered in the landslide.

77
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:12,599
And when you have 
no physics in the process,

78
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,939
it's very difficult to make 
any kind of forecast.

79
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:19,363
It does not require too much expertise,
it's quite a simple method,

80
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:23,109
it doesn't involve the use 
of particular instruments or software,

81
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:26,178
but needs to be updated 
as soon as new data

82
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:29,611
on landslide occurrence events 
are registered.

83
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:33,211
A different approach consists of 
performing a hazard analysis,

84
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:36,590
trying to include the most we know,
in terms of physical phenomena

85
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,971
involved in the processes.

86
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:41,460
This is the case of 
a simple deterministic approach

87
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,713
that can be used 
to analyze translational slides.

88
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:46,623
It applies to shallow soil covers,

89
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:49,282
or existing discontinuities 
parallel to the slope

90
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:51,862
when the length of the landslide body

91
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:55,304
is much higher than the thickness of it.

92
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:56,816
Translational failure mechanism

93
00:04:56,816 --> 00:04:59,034
with surface of rupture 
parallel to the slope,

94
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:02,596
can be analyzed thanks to 
the infinite slope model.

95
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:05,095
Thanks to the elongated shape 
of the landslide body,

96
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:07,914
we can make the hypothesis 
of an infinite slope.

97
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:10,786
We can isolate a portion of the slope,

98
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:14,057
and write all the forces 
which are applied on it,

99
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:16,777
starting from the weight,
considering the forces

100
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:20,008
which are coming from 
the interaction of the isolated mass

101
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:23,626
from the surrounding masses,
and the resulting forces,

102
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:26,438
which are coming from the pore water
pressure distribution

103
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:28,318
inside the landslide body.

104
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,399
The ratio between the resisting force
and the destabilizing force

105
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,799
give us the factor of safety.

106
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:40,132
The factor of safety is a very clever way
to define and to assess

107
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,119
the stability condition
of a given slope.

108
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,559
The higher this number,

109
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:48,309
it means that we are far 
from a possible failure of the slope.

110
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:51,950
In this slide, we see how 
the general formula that we've just seen

111
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,378
for the factor of safety,

112
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:56,000
can be easily adapted 
to different conditions,

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,790
by considering different scenarios
for the pore water pressure.

114
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,391
This is the case for 
a fully immersed slope underwater.

115
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:05,301
If the water is moving inside the slope,

116
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:07,708
in the particular case 
in which we have flow lines

117
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,527
which are parallel to the slope,

118
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:13,142
this is the final formula that we get
for the factor of safety.

119
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:15,923
The infinite slope model 
that we've just seen,

120
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:18,801
is a very effective way
to compute the stability

121
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:22,382
or to assess the stability 
of a given slope that can be used

122
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,712
if we are in this configuration 
that we described at the beginning.

123
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:30,253
Still many assumptions 
are included in the analysis.

124
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:34,434
It's a method that requires professional 
civil engineering knowledge.

125
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:38,711
The selection of the parameters 
that are entering into the analysis

126
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:44,452
should be done with a given experience
in dealing with this material.

127
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:48,986
So it's always better to be advised
by geotechnical engineers,

128
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:53,084
who know exactly how to compute 
the shear strength parameters

129
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:56,067
in terms of <i>c prime</i> and <i>phi prime</i>.

130
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,849
Software is not a must, but it can help,

131
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:01,448
especially if you're going to 
repeat this analysis

132
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:04,517
for different configurations.

133
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,678
Forecasts are possible.

134
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:09,721
We have seen that by changing the regime

135
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,118
of the pore water pressure into the slope,

136
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:14,830
how the water is moving 
or resting into the slope,

137
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,609
we can anticipate 
how the failure condition

138
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:19,198
can be produced or not.

139
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:22,358
And the probabilistic approach 
can also be included,

140
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,910
if we make the parameters 
that are entering in a definition

141
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,872
of the factor of safety
that are evolving,

142
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:30,847
with a given probabilistic law.

143
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:32,181
We will now see the example

144
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:35,522
of an advanced modeling 
for hazard assessment.

145
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,833
A more advanced model can be used
in enhancing the physical description

146
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,411
of the involved phenomena,

147
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:44,361
but of course, more information 
are needed as model inputs,

148
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:48,043
and a high performing tool 
for computation should be used.

149
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:50,836
This is the general outline 
that we can use

150
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,430
when we are dealing 
with more advanced modeling.

151
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,095
More advanced modeling 
offers a lot of advantages.

152
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,186
Of course there is a price to pay for it.

153
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:05,000
We are dealing with more complex analysis
that requires a lot of knowledge

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,524
about complex physics 
that you want to involve in your analysis.

155
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:13,154
Most of the assumptions are addressed
but in order to do that,

156
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:15,256
you need very high quality data.

157
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:19,375
High-end software is a must.
Usually we need quite articulated

158
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:23,700
or advanced numerical codes,
like using the finite elements,

159
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,368
in order to solve all the complexity
which we are putting in our problem.

160
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:33,015
Let's now summarize the main points
that we have discussed in this video.

161
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:35,898
Empirical models, 
they are based on past events

162
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:39,630
and they could serve as 
a simplistic model or approach

163
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,379
to deal with landslide assessment.

164
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:45,880
Physically-based models, although simple,
they provide the possibility

165
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,740
to include in the analysis
the knowledge about the slope geometry

166
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,003
and the characteristics 
of the involved materials.

167
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:59,361
Advanced models are very powerful tools
to perform a landslide hazard assessment.

168
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,730
Relevant features can be incorporated.

169
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,097
We can add as much complexity as we want,

170
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:08,001
trying to include as much of 
the physical phenomena

171
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:11,381
that we think are relevant 
for the processes that we are analyzing.

172
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:13,754
Physically-based models.

173
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,981
As simple as the infinite slope analysis,
or complex,

174
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:21,976
they offer the possibility to assess
and also design mitigation strategies.
