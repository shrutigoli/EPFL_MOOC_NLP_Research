Introduction to Chapter 2
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology for Disaster Risk Reduction
We will prepare a social map of this area, identify safe area, vulnerable points.
The land of Ward No. 7 (locality) of our village is good for settlement.
There is no risk of landslide or falling of stones from above, such safe place is in Ward No. 7.
Dear participants, welcome to chapter 2 of the MOOC,
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology for Disaster Risk Reduction.
In this chapter, we will dive into the main body of the topic of the MOOC by addressing the subjects of hazard, vulnerability, and risk assessments.
The objective of this chapter is to present tools and technologies that allow us to perform hazard, vulnerability, and risk assessments.
The main questions that we will address in this chapter are the following:
What is participatory risk and vulnerability assessment?
How are landslide hazards assessed?
How can modeling contribute to risk assessments?
We will look at geographic information systems and explain how they can help us to assess risks.
The answers to these questions will be given through video lectures by EPFL teachers, as well as by EPFL partners.
I hope you will enjoy this second chapter of this MOOC.
