00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,199
Introduction to Chapter 2

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,279
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction

3
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:12,553
We will prepare a social map of this area,
identify safe area, vulnerable points.

4
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:19,023
The land of Ward No. 7 (locality) 
of our village is good for settlement.

5
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:26,013
There is no risk of landslide 
or falling of stones from above,

6
00:00:26,013 --> 00:00:30,633
such safe place is in Ward No. 7.

7
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:35,417
Dear participants, 
welcome to chapter 2 of the MOOC,

8
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:39,830
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction.

9
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,620
In this chapter, we will dive into 
the main body of the topic of the MOOC

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,290
by addressing the subjects of hazard, 
vulnerability, and risk assessments.

11
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,828
The objective of this chapter
is to present tools and technologies

12
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:57,168
that allow us to perform hazard,
vulnerability, and risk assessments.

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,492
The main questions that we will address
in this chapter are the following:

14
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:05,240
What is participatory risk
and vulnerability assessment?

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,886
How are landslide hazards assessed?

16
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:11,768
How can modeling contribute
to risk assessments?

17
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:14,429
We will look at geographic
information systems

18
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:17,869
and explain how they can help us
to assess risks.

19
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:21,441
The answers to these questions
will be given through video lectures

20
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:25,276
by EPFL teachers,
as well as by EPFL partners.

21
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:28,486
I hope you will enjoy this second chapter
of this MOOC.
