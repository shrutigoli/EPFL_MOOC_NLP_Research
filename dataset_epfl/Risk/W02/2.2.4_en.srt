00:00:03,272 --> 00:00:05,381
for Disaster Risk Reduction
(Professeur Michael Lehning)

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:10,503
In this video I will try to tell you about
the role of numerical forecast models

4
00:00:10,503 --> 00:00:14,073
for risk management
of hydrometeorological hazards.

5
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:19,605
After a brief introduction, we will start
by looking at weather forecast modeling.

6
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:22,116
In particular, we will look
at the performance

7
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:24,236
of weather forecasting models,

8
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:27,276
and we will try to tell you
that they serve as a basis

9
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:30,816
for all other hydrometeorological
hazard models.

10
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:32,666
We would like you to understand

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,037
that the weather forecast is at the basis

12
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:39,929
for other hydrometereological
model assessments of risks.

13
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,620
So we will start by looking
at weather models in more detail.

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,880
You can easily imagine
that, for example, for a hurricane,

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,310
it's very important to know
the exact path of a hurricane

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,751
to know where it hits land and to know
how strong it is when it hits land.

17
00:00:55,211 --> 00:01:00,121
In the example on the slide you see
the path of Hurricane Katrina in 2005

18
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:03,164
that hit the United States very severely.

19
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:06,486
You can see that now the path
of this hurricane

20
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:08,416
is very well-determined

21
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:12,255
and also the strength is given
by the color of those dots.

22
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:16,628
But it took the forecast models
a great deal of effort

23
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:18,148
to get to this final result,

24
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:21,068
and we will look at that
later on some slides.

25
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:23,037
For those who watch
the weather channel regularly,

26
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:25,288
they may have realized that recently

27
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:28,229
weather forecasting
has become much more accurate.

28
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,539
In fact, over the last fifty years

29
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,029
the increase in skill
in weather forecasting

30
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:36,510
has improved steadily
and also dramatically.

31
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,622
In addition to that, not only do we get
better scores for the weather forecasting,

32
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:45,322
but also there have been
new techniques introduced

33
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:48,402
that allow the quantification
of uncertainty.

34
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:51,183
Quantification of uncertainty
is particularly important

35
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:54,254
for hazard and risk management,

36
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:56,974
hazard forecasting and risk management.

37
00:01:56,974 --> 00:02:00,575
Talking about the accuracy
of weather forecasting,

38
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:03,955
it is important to realize
that it depends critically

39
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:06,465
on the amount of observations
that are available.

40
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:09,618
In the early times of weather forecasting

41
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:12,107
there were really
only surface observations,

42
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:16,317
so, a weather station that measures
air temperature, humidity and wind speed,

43
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:17,728
for example,

44
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:22,049
and a very few balloon soundings
that give you upper air information.

45
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:27,091
With time, the situation
has improved dramatically.

46
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:30,741
Now we not only have surface observation
and much more balloon soundings,

47
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:35,726
but we also have been able to incorporate
the information from remote sensing

48
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:41,238
into the course
of weather forecasting model runs.

49
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:47,944
In particular, satellite observations,
but also the Wren radar has contributed

50
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:50,915
to improve weather forecasting
quite dramatically.

51
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:52,635
An important new technique

52
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:54,535
that has been introduced
to weather forecasting

53
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:57,196
is the use of <i>ensemble forecasts</i>.

54
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:59,137
What are ensemble forecasts?

55
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:04,167
Ensemble forecasts are obtained
by running the same numerical model

56
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,888
but with slightly different
initial conditions.

57
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:11,239
So you take as an initial condition
the observed weather

58
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,180
and you disturb it a little bit,

59
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,470
just put a little noise
on the initial conditions.

60
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,570
And that leads to the fact
that you get different model runs.

61
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,752
This emulates a little bit the situation
that the real atmosphere is doing.

62
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:30,652
Simply because, with the observations
you have on the current weather

63
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:35,474
you cannot capture the full variability
in space that is present,

64
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:41,865
this artificial disturbance that you impose
on the initialization of a weather model

65
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:47,906
will help to see what the model is
trying to do with these initial conditions:

66
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:50,196
whether it's actually
a stable development,

67
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,926
regardless of how you
disturbed the initial conditions

68
00:03:52,926 --> 00:03:56,358
you will always, maybe, end up
with the same forecast,

69
00:03:56,358 --> 00:04:01,057
or, on the opposite, a little bit of
disturbance in the initial conditions

70
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:07,030
may lead to a largely differing forecast
in the weather in a few days,

71
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,730
which is, unfortunately, the more
common case in the atmosphere

72
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,491
because it's a highly non-linear system.

73
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:18,601
On the slides here you can actually
see two examples of this.

74
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:22,943
Very importantly, as we looked already
at the tracks of Katrina,

75
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:26,842
when Katrina was not yet a hurricane
but simply a tropical storm

76
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:30,593
on August 24th of 2005,

77
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:36,224
these ensemble forecasts
gave very, very different tracks.

78
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:41,536
So for the emergency troops on land

79
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:44,536
that had to prepare
for that tropical storm,

80
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:48,487
it is very difficult, if the forecast
is as varied as it is here,

81
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,647
to take appropriate measures.

82
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:55,877
You don't want to evacuate people
from such a large portion of land.

83
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:58,218
And therefore it's very useful to see

84
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:01,720
that as we get closer
to the actual event of landfall...

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,821
So on August 27th,

86
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:07,032
all these ensemble runs, they show now

87
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:10,230
a much clearer picture
of the potential hurricane track,

88
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:16,592
and also the strength of the hurricane
can be forecast with much more accuracy.

89
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:19,732
So, in summary, we can say
that there's three factors

90
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:25,354
that have improved our basis
for hydrometereological forecasting:

91
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:33,125
one is the use of more observations,
the experts call that <i>data assimilation</i>,

92
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,025
then one is, of course, also,

93
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:37,355
and I have not talked
about that in detail,

94
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:40,456
that we have
better process representations

95
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:43,456
in the models themselves,
so the models became better,

96
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:46,477
and, because of increased computer power,

97
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:50,486
we are now able to run them
at a higher numerical resolution.

98
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:53,938
A hydrological forecasting system
that comes out of our own group

99
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,558
is called <i>Alpine3D</i>.

100
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:58,138
It has a focus on the hydrological cycle

101
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:01,499
and is particularly suited
for situations in alpine terrain

102
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,440
and therefore also for snow.

103
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,821
What you can see here on the slide

104
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:08,272
is that we can work
with a variety of input parameters,

105
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:12,111
input that comes
from automatic weather stations

106
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:16,091
or from other larger-scale weather models,

107
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:20,313
or even from remote-sensing data,
and they can all be used as input

108
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:24,454
into this modeling system
that has, in itself,

109
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:27,825
small-scale flow
and metereological simulations,

110
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:30,952
it has a complex terrain
energy balance module,

111
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:34,265
and treats drifting and blowing snow.

112
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:36,966
The core of it, however,
is this part down here

113
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:41,046
that we would call
a <i>vegetation, snow and soil module</i>,

114
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:46,287
which deals with water
and snow dynamics close to the surface.

115
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:47,628
This is a distributed model

116
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:50,628
that then feeds
into a conceptual run-off model.

117
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:53,999
The conceptual run-off model
has the task to predict

118
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,889
how the dynamics at the surface

119
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,260
actually translates into the water
that flows into the rivers.

120
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,281
This is what you're
ultimately interested in

121
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:05,372
when talking
about a hydrological model forecast.

122
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:08,543
So, in summary,
what you get from the model

123
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,913
is a variety of parameters.

124
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:14,553
And this particular model
is physics-based,

125
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:19,384
so it tries to represent all processes
with predefined parameters,

126
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:22,215
as opposed to what we're going
to look at next

127
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:26,965
that is a more conceptual model
that has a lot of tunable parameters.

128
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:35,428
A hydrological model system that is
used in operational flood forecasting

129
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,418
is the system <i>Prevah</i>.

130
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:41,909
The slide shows you a summary
of the Prevah layout

131
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,989
and the associated parameters.

132
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:46,119
You can see on the left
all these boxes,

133
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:49,409
they represent sort of linear reservoirs.

134
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,200
So water flows in, or snow comes in,

135
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,470
and then there is...
based on the level of water,

136
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,172
it will be handed on to the next level.

137
00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:04,352
This is the basic principle behind linear,
reservoir-based hydrological modeling.

138
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:07,123
So the Prevah system was implemented

139
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:10,763
and, together
with the weather forecasting,

140
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:12,964
produced the following result.

141
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:16,724
We see two parts of panels here:
the upper one and the lower one.

142
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:19,975
The forecasting happens
with three lead times:

143
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:22,915
one day, two days, and three days.

144
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:26,945
And for each of these lead times
you will get a different result.

145
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:31,417
And, of course, since the model
is run at least once a day,

146
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:37,678
you will get, again, the section
that has been forecasted,

147
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:42,329
for example, for 'lead time two days'
the day before will become,

148
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:45,639
on the next day, the 'lead time one".

149
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,239
So this is why the curves that we see here

150
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:54,160
are a little bit discontinuous as we go
from one to the next day.

151
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,391
So let's look at it
in a little bit more detail.

152
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:58,921
Now, first of all,
the easy curve is the black one.

153
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:04,972
The black one is the observed
run-off for the river Sihl.

154
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:09,263
And the colored curves give you
the forecast model result

155
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:12,304
for these different lead times
that we just talked about.

156
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:16,014
And the lead time one is the blue curve;

157
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,706
the lead time two is the red curve;

158
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:21,625
and the lead time three is the green curve.

159
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:26,956
As you can see, for example, here is
that the red curve will do a jump here,

160
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:30,427
on the transition between these two days.

161
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:34,164
That means that for this day

162
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:38,078
the lead time one would end up
with the run-off forecast

163
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,318
that has about a hundred at that scale;

164
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:43,770
and then jump back to a lower value

165
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,180
as the simulation is repeated
on the next day.

166
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,780
This is how these curves are interpreted.

167
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,984
We don't have to look in full detail
at all these curves.

168
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:58,239
But the important part is

169
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:01,239
that most of these
deterministic forecasts,

170
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:07,028
were too low, and would not
forecast the actual peaks in run-off

171
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:09,768
as shown by these two peaks here.

172
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:15,849
Except for, the second peak
was actually quite well forecasted,

173
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,971
but only with a lead time one,
so one day before,

174
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:21,462
as expressed by the blue curve here.

175
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:27,973
So you can see that the model failed
to reproduce the first run-off peak,

176
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:32,859
and it had some skill in predicting
the second run-off peak.

177
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:37,764
In summary, looking at the slide,
what we can say is

178
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:40,685
that when you also re-run the model

179
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,905
then with the observed
precipitation input,

180
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:46,186
and that's the brown curve we
have not talked about so far,

181
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:49,056
then there is a very good performance
of the model

182
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:52,157
in reconstructing the total run-off curve.

183
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:57,719
That means that the failure
of the model system

184
00:10:57,719 --> 00:11:00,279
in predicting the run-off peaks

185
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,970
was purely because of insufficient
precipitation forecasting

186
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,160
in the metereological part of the system.

187
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,821
You can show this because
when you use observed precipitation

188
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:16,582
then the model does actually
quite a convincing job

189
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:18,442
in predicting the actual run-off curve.

190
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:21,933
On the upper panel of the graph
what you can see here

191
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:24,916
is the results from ensemble forecasts.

192
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:30,915
What you see is that the interquartile
range of the ensemble forecasts

193
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:33,055
does not get those two peaks,

194
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:36,825
as we have already discussed,
for the deterministic runs.

195
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:37,825
But you can also see

196
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:40,327
that the extreme cases
of the ensemble runs

197
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:44,276
do capture the event in its full magnitude.

198
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:48,727
So the ensemble forecast
is useful also in a case

199
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:53,758
where the model in general has
not a perfect performance

200
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:56,528
because it shows you what is possible.

201
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:58,809
I hope this video has convinced you

202
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:02,671
that numerical models
are indispensable tools

203
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,971
of risk management for natural hazards.
