1
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:06,703
And now you will hear Emily Eros,

2
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:10,922
a Geographic Information Systems Officer
at the American Red Cross.

3
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:13,814
She will present the <i>Missing Maps Project</i>.

4
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:18,222
So, the <i>Missing Maps Project</i>
is a collaboration between the Red Cross

5
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:20,484
and some other humanitarian organizations,

6
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:23,565
that we started as an effort to map places

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:27,453
where vulnerable people are living
before a disaster occurs.

8
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:28,995
Missing Maps is a project

9
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,995
where we work with remote volunteers
all around the world,

10
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:34,115
community volunteers in these locations,

11
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:36,925
and we start adding data
to OpenStreetMap

12
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:39,645
so that we have this material in advance.

13
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:43,742
There are three kinds of phases
to the Missing Maps Project.

14
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,204
The first is remote mapping,

15
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:48,600
the second is working with community
members on the ground to add data,

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,684
and then the third
is making that data useful.

17
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,602
The goal of the Missing Maps Project

18
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:59,162
is to put 20 million people on the map
by the beginning of 2017.

19
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:02,136
We have mapping parties
all around the world,

20
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:07,121
where anywhere between 10, 20,
60, 80 people will come;

21
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:10,020
they'll bring their computers,
we'll have food and drinks,

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,230
and they'll spend a couple of hours
just remotely tracing buildings and roads.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,053
So, we remotely trace all those buildings,

24
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:21,645
and the next step is trying to figure out
what these buildings are.

25
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:23,595
We can tell a lot from satellite imagery,

26
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:27,141
but we can't tell where are
all the hospitals, all the schools,

27
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:29,529
all the community facilities,
and things like that,

28
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:32,524
that we might really need to know about
if there were a disaster.

29
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:34,583
So, the next step is going
into these communities

30
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,623
with local volunteers.

31
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:41,241
We find ways to invite people,
we bring phones, we bring computers.

32
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:44,881
And, first of all, we'll start by doing
a training of what it is we're doing,

33
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:48,774
why is it important, how it's used,
how they can use it as well.

34
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:51,537
And then we'll train volunteers
in actually using the technology,

35
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:54,035
we'll do some practice with them,
and we'll talk about,

36
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:56,609
"Okay, these are some things
that we want to add to the map,

37
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:57,929
but what's important for you?

38
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:01,254
What are your needs, and what would
be useful for people to know?"

39
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,801
Then we go into communities with them,

40
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:07,714
and we spend at least a couple of weeks,
and sometimes much longer

41
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:09,153
doing detailed mapping.

42
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:12,313
And then, finally,
it's making this data useful.

43
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:15,581
So, in Washington, our team
will create maps and products

44
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:18,765
that we give to the communities,
to the Red Cross,

45
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,855
for projects that they're doing.

46
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:25,390
The data is openly available online,
and we're still trying to work on

47
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,478
who are other partners locally
that might need to know about this,

48
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:29,859
so they could use it as well.

49
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,900
Because we don't just want data
for humanitarian purposes,

50
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,569
we want other people to be able
to know, contribute, and access it.

51
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,177
In terms of differences
between remote and field mapping:

52
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:45,558
remote mapping is very good for using
a very large group of people remotely

53
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:48,056
to do some tracing and create a base map,

54
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:53,228
whereas on-the-ground mapping
is a more limited resource.

55
00:02:53,228 --> 00:02:56,568
You'll only have so many volunteers
that you can train, and so many phones,

56
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:59,707
and so you really want to use them
for the maximum benefit.

57
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:00,898
You want them adding things

58
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:03,898
that you can't tell
from a satellite image.

59
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:08,248
So, things like hospitals, things like
what the different lands are used for,

60
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:10,997
that's what we really want to focus on
for on-the-ground mapping.

61
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:15,236
So, all types of people
are involved with this.

62
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:19,168
And then locally, on the ground,
it tends to be younger people

63
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,377
who are more comfortable using technology.

64
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:25,559
But I've also had women over 50
who are mothers, grandmothers,

65
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:28,539
coming to say, "Hey, this seems
really interesting,

66
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,783
I'd like to know how to use a phone,

67
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:33,559
maybe this is a way
I could get some training."

68
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:37,349
So, in general, we use
various different pieces of technology.

69
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,559
We think of ourselves as omnivores,

70
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:44,328
where whatever technology we can find
that works where we're operating,

71
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:46,427
we would love to use and try that out.

72
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:51,287
So, for mapathons, we use
some different websites

73
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:54,745
that can take an area,
divide it into a grid,

74
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:56,778
and then people can select
a grid square and say,

75
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,979
"I'm going to map this."

76
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,889
So, it makes a big area more manageable,

77
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,418
and that's called the HOT Tasking Manager.

78
00:04:03,218 --> 00:04:07,771
For the tracing, there's some different
online tools that people can use.

79
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:10,570
The one that we use the most
is called iD Editor,

80
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,721
it's a very user-friendly interface
for just drawing in buildings and roads.

81
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:18,782
And then we also have created
a tracking tool and website

82
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:21,933
that keeps track of people's username
and what they've mapped.

83
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:26,389
It gives badges, it tries to make it
a little bit more of a game,

84
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,841
and that we designed as a tool

85
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,401
for keeping people engaged
between disasters.

86
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:35,253
It's very easy to think, "Why should
I care about this and why should I come

87
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:37,342
when there's been no recent earthquake?"

88
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:41,113
But we really want
to engage people between disasters.

89
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:45,674
In terms of community mapping,
it really depends on the area,

90
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:47,394
so we have some paper-based tools

91
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:49,733
that we can use without
any technology whatsoever.

92
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:52,021
We use something called FieldPapers,

93
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:55,491
where we input the area
that we want to map.

94
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:57,591
Again, it divides it into a little grid,

95
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:59,971
and then it prints an atlas
where each page

96
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:02,703
is a different street on a local area.

97
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,852
Volunteers will take this
into the community,

98
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:08,611
they'll write down the address numbers,
or whatever it is they're trying to map,

99
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:11,310
and then there's a little QR code,
so they take a photo,

100
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,943
it comes up online and they can see
where all that is in real space,

101
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:16,842
and add that to the map.

102
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:21,098
So, that's FieldPapers, and we use that
if it's not safe to be using phones,

103
00:05:21,098 --> 00:05:23,379
like in a slum area we might use that.

104
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:26,752
If for some reason our plan A failed,
that's our backup.

105
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:30,832
And then everything that we can do
with mobile phones, we do,

106
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,059
because it makes data input a lot easier

107
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,639
and it's just a little bit faster
on the ground.

108
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,421
There is an app called the Open Data Kit,

109
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,091
which is, you can create a survey
that someone can flip through,

110
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:46,591
and we've used that for years for doing
damage assessments, or things like that.

111
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:50,501
We modified that into an app
we call Open Map Kit,

112
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:53,223
where you pull up
the phone and you can see

113
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:54,993
all that base map that we've created.

114
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:57,502
You can tap on the building
in front of you,

115
00:05:57,502 --> 00:05:59,864
and then it'll ask a series
of questions about that,

116
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:01,662
and you can just tap your way through

117
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:05,522
and then it inputs all of that
into the map in a very easy format.

118
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:08,454
And then, finally,
what we've been working on last

119
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:10,734
is a portable offline server.

120
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:15,041
Humanitarians are increasingly
using technology really well,

121
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,832
but we're also working
in really remote areas.

122
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:22,061
And, while mobile phones
and other tools work offline,

123
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,522
creating surveys and preparing things,

124
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:28,010
and the advance work usually needs
an Internet connection.

125
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,294
So, with that,

126
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:34,754
in the past, we've had to go back
to an area with Internet connection

127
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:38,232
at least every couple
of days to keep going,

128
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,495
and if we have a problem,
we need to go to a plan B.

129
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:44,972
So, as we're doing bigger projects
in more remote areas,

130
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,174
we've created some portable
offline servers which we call POSM.

131
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,633
It's a little box about this big,

132
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:55,171
and we download a bunch of material to it
before we go to this country at all,

133
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:58,463
and then every time
we connect to its Wi-Fi,

134
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:00,894
it's basically as though
we had an Internet connection.

135
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:03,094
So, all these tools
that I've just mentioned,

136
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:05,134
they need Internet to get them ready.

137
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,925
With these POSM boxes,
we can go months at a time

138
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:11,405
without needing electricity
or Internet connectivity.

139
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:13,555
If the power goes out,
if the Internet fails,

140
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:15,455
if any of these things happen,

141
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,514
we don't have to change our schedule,
we don't have to work around it,

142
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:20,633
we can just keep going.

143
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:24,694
Everything that we use
is free open source and available online.

144
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,129
Anything that we develop is available.

145
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,443
In terms of hardware, like the server,

146
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:34,133
I think the components cost about US$ 300,

147
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,245
but everything that you need
to install in there,

148
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:38,675
we've made available
on our GitHub webpage.

149
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:41,105
And so we're very excited
to be working with developers,

150
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:44,943
working with other people in this space
to continue to make these tools better.
