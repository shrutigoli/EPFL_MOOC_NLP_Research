1
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,727
In the context of hydrological modeling,

2
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:10,844
in particular in mid latitudes,
the snow model is very important.

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,149
So let's take a look
at snow models in particular.

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:17,399
Snow models are useful
for hydrological modeling,

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,091
but also for assessing
the avalanche danger,

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:25,444
and they are an important part
of climate models as well.

7
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:28,113
The numerical SNOWPACK model

8
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,738
that has been developed at SLF in Davos,

9
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:34,671
is a detailed snow model
that is used worldwide

10
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:37,344
for a variety of purposes.

11
00:00:37,344 --> 00:00:42,190
It is used for snow cover simulations,
for avalanche warning,

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,509
but it's also used in the context, again,
of hydrological predictions.

13
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:50,721
It contains representation
of the following processes:

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,880
The core of the model treats
a layered snowpack.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,494
The layered snowpack comes into existence
by individual precipitation events.

16
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,590
If there is vegetation present,

17
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,621
then vegetation that may be
below the snow,

18
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:08,001
but there may also be trees,

19
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,470
also this is treated by the model.

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,959
The layered snowpack resides on a module

21
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,498
that treats permafrost or in general soil.

22
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,390
Water that is produced within the snow

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,729
by melt processes can run into the soil,

24
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,186
but also the snow itself
may undergo metamorphosis,

25
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:30,903
and change its texture and its structure.

26
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:35,355
The model treats incoming radiation,

27
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:37,661
and allows to simulate in how far

28
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:40,830
the shortwave radiation
penetrates into the snow.

29
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:44,843
The formulation of sensible
and latent heat transfer

30
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:48,416
at the snow surface allows
for the generation of surface hoar,

31
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:53,402
which may then become a weak layer
once buried by new snow layers.

32
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:59,297
The model has also modules
for treating more spatial effects,

33
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:01,037
such as drifting and blowing snow,

34
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:05,088
or the redistribution of snow
once on the ground.

35
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:08,040
The SNOWPACK model gives you
a very detailed assessment

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,596
of individual layers in the snow cover.

37
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:13,680
What you can see on this graph
is the time development

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,325
between the 15th of February, 1999,
to the 15th of April, 1999,

39
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:23,619
of the snow cover at the Alpine site
Weissfluhjoch, in Davos.

40
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,914
You can see major precipation events.

41
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:29,626
You can see that
as the snow cover increases here,

42
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:34,019
and then later on this snow develops
into different types of snow.

43
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:38,355
We don't have the time to go through
the individual grain types here,

44
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:41,905
but it's important to realize
that there's many different grain types

45
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:43,651
represented in the snow profiles.

46
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,156
There is crusty snow here.

47
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:48,711
There is surface hoar snow.

48
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:52,394
There are facets and depth hoar crystals
in the simulations.

49
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:57,473
And all of these, they also occur
in comparison to an observed profile,

50
00:02:57,473 --> 00:03:00,266
which you can see in the column
on the right-hand side.

51
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:04,881
The profile here corresponds
to the simulated profile at this location,

52
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:07,192
where you can see the black vertical line.

53
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:09,481
So by comparison, you can judge

54
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:13,221
how well the model actually
represents the observations.

55
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,688
How is SNOWPACK used
for avalanche forecasting?

56
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,331
Well the link between
a particular structure in snow

57
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:24,419
to an avalanche danger
is not a trivial one.

58
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,223
So what is often attempted
is to use a statistical link,

59
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:31,734
and to use the simulated profile
as an input,

60
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:33,813
and then a variety of statistical methods

61
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,311
to come up with a danger estimation.

62
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:40,433
In Switzerland, and in all
of the European mountains,

63
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:44,316
the five-degree danger scale is used.

64
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:49,868
But also, for flood forecasting,
the snow model details are of use.

65
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:53,608
What you see here is a devastating flood

66
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,394
that happened in October, 2011,
in Switzerland,

67
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:00,308
where warm rain was falling
on a snow cover

68
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:02,922
that had just been dumped
the days before.

69
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:08,167
What the graph shows you
is the total water produced,

70
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,453
and the snow height, in grey here.

71
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:14,759
The black curve
and the grey shadow here

72
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,980
gives you the variability of snow depths
within the area investigated.

73
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,029
What you can also see is, then,

74
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,796
the water that would have been
produced by rain only, in blue.

75
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:29,019
This is the blue part, here.

76
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,909
And then the cumulative runoff
that has been produced

77
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:37,857
by the combined effect of snow melt
and of this rain input.

78
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:41,395
First of all, it is important to realize
that if rain falls into snow cover,

79
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:44,971
the snow cover will first
retain some of the water.

80
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:48,889
But as time goes on,
and as melt becomes more vigorous,

81
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,110
the total water released by the snow cover

82
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,548
may exceed the particular rain amounts.

83
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,146
And this has happened in this event.

84
00:04:58,146 --> 00:05:03,770
That is seen, that this green band
is actually exceeding

85
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,571
the amount of rain that fell
within that period.

86
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:11,870
Cumulative melt part
is shown in red, here.

87
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,102
So all together, the full-time dynamics

88
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:19,050
of the combined rain input and snow melt

89
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,385
determines how severe
a flooding event may become,

90
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:26,274
in the case of this particular situation,

91
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:29,164
where you have rain
on a pre-existing snow cover.

92
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:33,195
In discussions about climate change,
you often hear the argument,

93
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:36,161
"How can you predict
the climate change over centuries,

94
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,545
when you can't do
a reliable weather forecast

95
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,348
that extends over a week?"

96
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,394
This is an argument
that can be better understood

97
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:49,098
if you look at the particular situation
of a boiling pot of water.

98
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:53,053
While you cannot predict
where the next bubble will come up

99
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,001
from this boiling pot,
you can well predict

100
00:05:56,001 --> 00:06:01,280
that if you add heat to water,
it will start boiling at some point,

101
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,630
and this is exactly what happens
with the climate system.

102
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,106
We cannot predict the weather
over centuries,

103
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:13,032
but we can predict in general
that the world will be getting warmer,

104
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:15,114
that the weather will be more extreme,

105
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:16,993
that the sea level will rise,

106
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:20,882
and that, as a result of all of this,
risks will change,

107
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,146
and in many cases increase.

108
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:27,241
Let's return to the question
how numerical models are used

109
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:30,443
in the context
of climate change prediction.

110
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:33,912
What you can see here
is a panel of graphs

111
00:06:33,912 --> 00:06:36,506
that has been produced
in particular for Switzerland,

112
00:06:36,506 --> 00:06:39,819
and shows you the changes
in temperature, on the upper row,

113
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:44,191
and precipitation, on the lower row,
for Switzerland,

114
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:49,837
as forecasted by a variety
of climate models.

115
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:53,454
This is now different
from the ensemble runs

116
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,256
in weather forecasting that we've looked at,

117
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:58,746
but you could sort of also see that
as an ensemble simulation.

118
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:01,396
Here, the spread in the individual curves

119
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:03,316
comes more from the individual models,

120
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:05,152
from the differences in the models,

121
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:08,679
than from disturbed initial conditions.

122
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:13,162
So it also allows you to estimate
a little bit the uncertainty

123
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:16,576
of these climate change
scenario simulations.

124
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:20,334
On the upper panel, you can see
that despite the fact

125
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:23,428
that the spread between
the individual models

126
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:27,575
is quite significant,
in all these forecasting periods--

127
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:31,908
the first column is for 2035,

128
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:34,767
the second column for 2060,

129
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:37,871
and the third column for 2085--

130
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:41,190
despite the fact that the <i>Delta T</i>,

131
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,590
the forecasted difference
in temperatures is quite significant,

132
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,687
and the spread
between the model simulations

133
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:51,924
is much, much larger than the mean effect.

134
00:07:51,924 --> 00:07:56,859
So the world gets warmer.
In that result, all of these models agree.

135
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,474
With precipitation, the situation
is a little bit different,

136
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:05,965
so the percentage change
that is displayed in the lower row here

137
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:10,674
is not quite as certain
as it is for temperature.

138
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:13,043
In fact, what you could say is,

139
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:17,165
from looking at the spread in the models,
and with respect to zero,

140
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:20,811
that precipitation changes
are highly uncertain,

141
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:26,718
and it's not clear whether
the general trend that is observed--

142
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:31,229
with a little bit more precipitation
in the winter,

143
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:33,774
and a little bit less precipitation
in summer--

144
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,549
will actually become true.

145
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:40,400
So it remains to be seen
in how far these predictions

146
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,428
will actually become true.

147
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:47,725
Nonetheless, we can use
those climate model predictions

148
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:53,315
to see what it actually means
with respect to processes

149
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,561
at the earth's surface.

150
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:57,858
The climate models,
because of their simplifications,

151
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:01,388
are quite reliable with respect to saying

152
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:04,818
what the mean temperature
in Switzerland will do,

153
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:09,325
but they will not be able
to tell you in detail how the snow cover,

154
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:10,950
for example, in an alpine resort,

155
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,170
will evolve,
or will look like in the future.

156
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,102
Therefore, we again combine now

157
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:21,871
the climate model result
with our snow models

158
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:25,141
to predict what the snow cover
will look like in the future.

159
00:09:25,768 --> 00:09:27,585
On this slide what you can see is

160
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:30,273
for two selected stations
in the Swiss Alps,

161
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:32,996
one is Davos and one is Engelberg,

162
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:36,571
how we predict
that the snow will diminish.

163
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:39,930
In particular what we look at here
is the changes

164
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,166
in days that have
a snow cover of 5 cm or more.

165
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:48,603
Why is this an important parameter?
This is an important parameter

166
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:52,750
because a 5 cm snow cover
will make the landscape look white.

167
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,550
It is also important
for snow removal, for example,

168
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,637
and starts slowly to become important
for the tourism industry.

169
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:05,847
So this is why the snow days
with a snow cover of more than 5 cm

170
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:08,103
is a suitable index

171
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:11,895
of how the snow climate
will change in the future.

172
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:15,985
On these two panels what you see
is that, in general,

173
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:20,448
the number of these snow days
decreases significantly

174
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:22,484
at both locations.

175
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:25,270
What you also see is the spread,

176
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,213
or the variability that is forecasted,

177
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:32,207
and in this particular picture,

178
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:35,720
a nice way to visualize the spread

179
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,110
is that the spread
between the model runs,

180
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,788
that we saw also in the previous slide,

181
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:44,712
is given by this grey area here
in the forecasts--

182
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:49,091
again, the forecasts are done
for the times of 2035,

183
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:52,994
2060 and 2085--

184
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:58,069
and the variability that comes
from the model, again,

185
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:00,204
is contained in this grey bar,

186
00:11:00,204 --> 00:11:05,108
and is compared to the variability
that is inherent

187
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:08,139
in the time series at the locations.

188
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:13,584
And the inherent time variability
from year to year, for example,

189
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:19,530
is represented for the present,
in this first box plot--

190
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:26,358
it is the correct technical term
for this way to visualize the result--

191
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:30,305
and it gets quite larger for the future,

192
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:34,238
but is, in principle,
in the same order of magnitude

193
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:37,889
than the uncertainty
that comes from the models.

194
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:43,552
What you can read here
is that snow will decrease markedly

195
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:46,290
in the future,

196
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,957
and as a result of that,
you can easily imagine

197
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:54,070
when you have less snowfall in the winter,

198
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,414
but the same amount
of total precipitation,

199
00:11:56,414 --> 00:12:00,143
then much more of the precipitation
will fall as rain,

200
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:02,802
which increases
the risk of winter flooding.

201
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:05,959
It will also mean that, for example,

202
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:11,342
the risk of avalanches will decrease
in some of the areas we looked at,

203
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:14,843
and the cost for snow removal
will decrease.

204
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:19,887
I hope this video has convinced you
that numerical models

205
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:24,949
are indispensable tools
of risk management for natural hazards.

206
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:29,836
On the basis of weather models,
natural hazards such as floods,

207
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:34,126
but also landslides and avalanches,
can be predicted.

208
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,587
With respect to climate change scenarios,
and the changing risks

209
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:43,970
in many of these natural hazards,
we do completely rely

210
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,564
on numerical weather forecasts,
numerical climate forecasts,

211
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:50,560
because we don't have
any other tool to help us

212
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,312
in assessing these changes and risks.
