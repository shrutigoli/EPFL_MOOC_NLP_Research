00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,191
Introduction to Chapter 1

2
00:00:01,191 --> 00:00:03,562
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction

3
00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:06,304
(interviewer speaking foreign language)

4
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:15,458
Well, I was going down towards Kalikasthan

5
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:19,009
and in Shanti Bazaar 
I was distracted for a while

6
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,422
Then on the way, near the Chinese Bridge,

7
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,272
there is an electric pole
(for electric supply)

8
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:26,759
which you might have noticed.

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,192
Suddenly, I was caught by the earthquake
at this place.

10
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,772
At that time, I knew nothing about 
what was happening.

11
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:38,333
The sound of Gandaki (river); ...
vibrations of the ground...

12
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,944
vibrations due to the earthquake

13
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:44,135
Suddenly, the road tore apart, 
stones were falling from uphill

14
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:45,915
and the debris covered the road

15
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:49,424
I managed to run... but got injured

16
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,024
one friend died

17
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:58,274
we were three, 
I was injured but I survived.

18
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:06,268
The other friend was behind
and got less injured.

19
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:11,748
Dear participants, 
Welcome to chapter 1 of the MOOC,

20
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:16,388
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction.

21
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:21,620
Unfortunately, natural hazards 
such as the 2015 earthquake in Nepal,

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,645
or more recently in Italy,
can cause large losses.

23
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:27,831
A first step to reduce the risks

24
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:31,561
is to know the characteristics 
of these phenomena.

25
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,581
Therefore, in this first chapter,

26
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:37,803
EPFL lecturers will walk you through
the characteristics of earthquakes,

27
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:40,221
as well as floods and landslides,

28
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:44,032
the three natural hazards
on which this MOOC will focus.

29
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:47,482
Furthermore, the basic concepts 
of Disaster Risk Reduction

30
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,272
will be explained.

31
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:53,256
Science and technology will be defined 
in the context of this MOOC,

32
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:55,446
and the week will end with an interview

33
00:01:55,446 --> 00:02:00,177
with UNISDR Secretary-General,
Dr. Glasser.

34
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:02,854
The questions addressed 
by this first MOOC chapter,

35
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:04,150
are the following:

36
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,945
What are natural disasters, 
especially landslides,

37
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:08,377
floods and earthquakes?

38
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,967
How do we define hazard, disaster, risk,

39
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:15,759
vulnerability and disaster risk reduction?

40
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,228
A central aspect of this MOOC,
is its focus on science and technology.

41
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:23,317
So we need to know what we mean
by science and technology,

42
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,230
and why they are important for DRR.

43
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,818
The entire team of the MOOC,

44
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:31,894
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction,

45
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:36,248
welcomes you to the first chapter,
and we hope that you will enjoy it.
