1
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:06,676
As this course 
is about science and technology

2
00:00:06,676 --> 00:00:08,584
for disaster risk reduction,

3
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:13,008
in this video I will present definitions
for science and technology,

4
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:16,355
general types of science and technologies,

5
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:19,367
and an overview 
of their specific relevance

6
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,215
for disaster risk reduction.

7
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:24,990
According to the Oxford Dictionaries,
science can be defined

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,617
as "the intellectual 
and practical activity

9
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:31,134
encompassing the systematic study
of the structure and behavior

10
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:35,775
of the physical and natural world
through observation and experiment."

11
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:37,599
Science can also be defined

12
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:40,550
as "a systematically organized 
body of knowledge

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,530
on a particular subject."

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,639
There are many different types of science.

15
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:48,855
For instance, formal science, 
life science or social sciences.

16
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:52,151
This diagram shows
the different branches of science,

17
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,213
the level on which they focus,

18
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:57,190
and the level of complexity 
and integration.

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,113
For example, physical science 
and earth and space science

20
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:04,931
are combined and integrated 
into geoscience.

21
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,152
Let me now define technology,

22
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,701
which is "the application 
of scientific knowledge

23
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:12,664
for practical purposes, 
especially in industry;"

24
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:15,597
"machinery and devices 
developed from scientific knowledge;"

25
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:18,243
or "the branch of knowledge
dealing with engineering

26
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:20,104
or applied sciences."

27
00:01:20,104 --> 00:01:23,832
As with science, there are many ways
to define technology,

28
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:27,052
and there are entire papers 
destined to the description,

29
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:30,273
study and analysis of these definitions.

30
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:34,335
Therefore, to have a better idea
of what we mean by technology,

31
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:37,769
I will present some examples 
of the types of technologies

32
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:40,217
we might see throughout the course.

33
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:43,553
For this, I will use the work 
of Alexander Laszlo,

34
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:46,636
who published 
<i>The Evolutionary Challenge for Technology,</i>

35
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:49,276
in 2003, and other sources.

36
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:54,558
Alexander Laszlo defines low-tech
as the small-scale technologies

37
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:57,448
which do not require 
complex infrastructure,

38
00:01:57,448 --> 00:02:01,908
are relatively simple to use, 
cost little to construct or obtain,

39
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:03,819
and next to nothing to operate.

40
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,509
Here are some examples:

41
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:08,359
weaving produced on non-automated looms,

42
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:10,744
folk music played on acoustic instruments,

43
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:14,270
organic farming, milling, 
glassblowing, et cetera.

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,639
And by high-tech, 
we mean sophisticated technologies,

45
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,040
which require complex infrastructure,

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,912
technical expertise 
to construct and to use,

47
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:27,270
and are often costly 
to obtain and to operate.

48
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,861
Let's now look at the difference
between hard and soft technology.

49
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:35,821
Hard technology includes the tools, 
machines, devices and equipment,

50
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:40,141
that are the physical embodiment
of technology and/or technological process

51
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:43,663
based on engineering techniques 
and principles,

52
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,183
what we call the "know how."

53
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:49,573
In contrast, soft technology 
is the scaffolding.

54
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:52,838
For instance, support systems, 
group process techniques,

55
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:55,946
design methodologies, 
decision-making processes

56
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:59,745
for individual 
and collective self-determination.

57
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:03,505
It is what we call the "know why,"
or the "know what for,"

58
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:05,256
and the "care why."

59
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:09,848
By alternative technology, 
we mean equipment or organizational forms

60
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:14,649
that represent viable alternatives
to existing mainstream technologies.

61
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:17,531
For example, small-scale organic farming,

62
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,287
instead of large-scale energy

63
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:22,007
and chemical-intensive
cultivation techniques.

64
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:24,777
There are also 
so called intermediate technologies.

65
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:28,470
These are technologies 
that stand halfway between traditional

66
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,240
and modern technology.

67
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,629
The ox-drawn plow can be described
as an intermediate technology.

68
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,211
More sophisticated 
than the traditional hoe,

69
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:39,281
but less complex than the tractor.

70
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:43,281
Another intermediate technology
is the human-powered treadle pump,

71
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:46,962
as opposed to the fully automated
large-scale irrigation system.

72
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:49,709
An important question 
we have to ask ourselves,

73
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,392
is what is an appropriate technology?

74
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:55,802
There are several ways 
of defining appropriate technology.

75
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:59,622
I define appropriate technologies
as "technologies that contribute

76
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:02,563
to sustainable development
at the global level.

77
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:05,781
They are robust, 
socio-culturally adequate,

78
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:08,610
financially sustainable, scalable,

79
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,454
and have a minimum impact
on the environment."

80
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:13,871
The sustainability 
of the technology itself

81
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,858
also matters substantially.

82
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:18,812
It should be produced
with minimal impact on the environment,

83
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:21,524
and under fair socio-economic conditions.

84
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:25,373
In short, appropriate technologies 
are energy efficient,

85
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:29,826
accessible to all, and environmentally
and financially sustainable

86
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:31,634
in the long term.

87
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:34,524
Technologies in the Global South,
need to furthermore

88
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,916
to be based on the needs 
of the intended users,

89
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,135
and be co-developed with them.

90
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:42,141
Technologies 
need to be low-cost and robust,

91
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:44,936
regarding sudden changes 
in electric current,

92
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:47,876
dust, heat and moisture.

93
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,097
One example of an appropriate technology

94
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:54,639
is the development of an X-ray machine,
such as GlobalDiagnostiX,

95
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,567
which is a project 
of the EssentialTech program

96
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:01,307
of the Cooperation and Development Center
at EPFL.

97
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:03,524
Another really interesting question

98
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:05,790
that is increasingly 
gaining in importance,

99
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,739
is what we understand 
by frugal technology.

100
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:13,480
For Srikanth Kumar Darapu,
frugal technology or innovation

101
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,310
involves the process 
of reducing the complexity

102
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,780
of the manufacturing process of a product,

103
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,628
and increasing the durability 
with better and cheaper services.

104
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:27,390
Initially, it was thought to be specific
to developing countries.

105
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,871
But developed countries 
have quickly realized

106
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,232
that this kind of innovation
is not region-specific.

107
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,004
For instance, a 3D printer 
that has been made

108
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:39,462
out of electronic waste
was developed in the Global South.

109
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:42,794
Technology can also be classified
by the type of activity,

110
00:05:42,794 --> 00:05:45,064
or objective it hopes to achieve.

111
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:49,155
For example, communication, 
space or medical technologies.

112
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:52,060
After this introduction,
let me present some examples

113
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,146
of science and technology
for disaster risk reduction.

114
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,965
Disaster risk reducion science 
has been developed rather recently,

115
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,934
and it is still evolving.

116
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:04,176
Different sciences 
contribute to disaster risk reduction.

117
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:07,877
These include applied sciences,
for instance seismology,

118
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:10,097
meteorology, geography,

119
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:13,007
or social sciences, 
for instance sociology,

120
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,162
anthropology, ethics.

121
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:17,878
These sciences integrate

122
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,786
and form what is called 
the integrative sciences.

123
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:25,456
For instance, environmental sciences, 
health sciences, risk management,

124
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:29,888
geospatial science, natural resources, 
coastal management,

125
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,888
and public administration.

126
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:35,047
Examples of technologies 
for disaster risk reduction

127
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:39,279
include, for instance, mapping technology,
communication technology,

128
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,089
post-disaster and emergency technologies--

129
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:46,619
for instance, unmanned aerial vehicles,
that are also known as drones--

130
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:51,161
ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction,
and health technology.

131
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:55,270
Science and technology can help reduce
the consequences of disasters.

132
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,621
and most importantly, prevent disasters,

133
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:01,531
and by doing so,
lead to more sustainable development.

134
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:05,701
I invite you to look at the additional 
material section of this video,

135
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:08,580
where we include a non-exhaustive overview

136
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,943
with examples of science and technology
for disaster risk reduction.

137
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:17,323
According to Dr. Reid Basher, 
both natural sciences, technology,

138
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:21,661
and social sciences
are important in disaster risk reduction.

139
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:24,307
For example, 
natural science and technology

140
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:27,425
permitted the development 
of technological approaches,

141
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:30,065
such as specific early warning systems,

142
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:33,775
protection structures such as dikes,
and building codes.

143
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:37,234
It is important to point out
that certain technical approaches

144
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:40,085
are effective in certain contexts.

145
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:44,700
In addition, the chosen approaches
tend to be driven by supply,

146
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,717
depend on specialists, 
and require many resources.

147
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:52,155
These are some of the factors 
that could make such technology

148
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,777
less apt for implementation.

149
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:58,542
Social sciences 
can help us to frame research issues,

150
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:01,288
and develop risk reduction strategies.

151
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:02,888
Through social science approaches,

152
00:08:02,888 --> 00:08:05,758
we can gain knowledge
on vulnerability, for example,

153
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:07,943
and its links with poverty.

154
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:11,779
Therefore, there is a need to integrate
the input of natural science,

155
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,245
technology, social sciences
and other sciences,

156
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,917
to generate knowledge, approaches,

157
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:22,249
and tools for effective management
and reduction of risk.

158
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:25,989
Let me now come back to the main points
discussed in this video.

159
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:30,291
First, we looked at different definitions
for science and for technology.

160
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,223
Then we saw how 
many different branches of science

161
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:36,656
and types of technologies 
contribute to disaster risk reduction,

162
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:40,030
and that in fact, 
disaster risk reduction science

163
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,665
has been developed only recently.

164
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:47,146
Finally, we learned that it is important 
to integrate science and technology,

165
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:51,612
in order to effectively reduce the risks
related to disasters.
