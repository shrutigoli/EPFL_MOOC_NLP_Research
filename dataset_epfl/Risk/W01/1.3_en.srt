1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,252
In this video, I will define vulnerability
in relation to disaster risk reduction.

2
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:12,553
I will present vulnerability 
of communities and assets,

3
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:16,537
and through examples,
the general vulnerability factors.

4
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:20,479
Later, I will talk about vulnerability
and hazard parameters

5
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:24,655
and the root causes of,
and progression towards, vulnerability.

6
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:27,941
Lastly, I will present 
a definition of exposure

7
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:31,001
and how exposure relates to vulnerability.

8
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,743
What is vulnerability?

9
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:34,488
<i>Vulnerability</i> can be defined

10
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:40,230
as the characteristics and circumstances
of a community, system, or asset

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,734
that make it susceptible 
to the damaging effects of a hazard.

12
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:47,474
This definition identifies vulnerability

13
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:50,335
as a characteristic 
of the element of interest,

14
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:53,477
a community, a system or asset,

15
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:56,293
which is independent of its exposure.

16
00:00:56,293 --> 00:01:00,865
However, the word "vulnerability"
is often used more broadly

17
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:03,161
to include the element's exposure.

18
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:08,677
Currently, a new version of the UNISDR 
definition is being discussed.

19
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:11,375
Draft documents include 
the following definition

20
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:15,632
quoted in the Sendai Framework 
adopted in Japan in 2015:

21
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:21,187
"Vulnerability is the conditions 
determined by physical, social, economic,

22
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:24,191
and environmental factors or processes

23
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:29,177
which increase the susceptibility 
of a community to the impact of hazards."

24
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:32,577
Let's now look 
at the different factors of vulnerability.

25
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:35,149
Vulnerability is not natural.

26
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:37,515
It is the human dimension of disasters,

27
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:42,277
and the entire range of physical, social, 
cultural, institutional, political,

28
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:46,145
economic, psychological, 
and environmental factors

29
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:50,588
that shape people's lives 
and create the environment they live in.

30
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:53,987
Vulnerability is usually 
associated with poverty.

31
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:57,629
However, it can also arise 
when people are isolated,

32
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:00,023
defenseless, or facing stress.

33
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:02,753
Examples of physical vulnerability

34
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:06,208
may include poor design 
and weak construction of buildings,

35
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,656
unstable locations, 
close proximity to hazards,

36
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:12,324
and fragile, unprotected houses.

37
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,579
Social and institutional vulnerability

38
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:18,739
may include lack 
of public awareness and information,

39
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,909
inadequate preparedness measures,

40
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,438
low status in society,
unequal gender relations,

41
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:26,632
fewer decision-making possibilities,

42
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:30,004
oppressive formal and informal
institutional structures,

43
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:33,497
and political, economic,
and social hierarchies.

44
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:35,959
When we talk about economic vulnerability,

45
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,088
we mean, for instance,
the absence of productive assets,

46
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:41,259
limited income-earning opportunities,

47
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:46,270
poor pay, single-income revenue,
no savings, and insurance.

48
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,188
And, as you can see on these images,
vulnerability can also increase

49
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:53,565
through the disregard 
for adequate environmental management.

50
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,991
So, what are the parameters 
that influence vulnerability?

51
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:01,232
Vulnerability varies significantly
within the community,

52
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:04,113
country, or region, 
and over time,

53
00:03:04,113 --> 00:03:06,919
so there are many
vulnerability parameters.

54
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,512
Some are hazard-independent

55
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:13,172
and should be considered 
in relation to any natural hazards.

56
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:15,392
Others, are hazard-dependent

57
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:18,682
and should be considered
for a single natural hazard,

58
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:20,505
or several hazards.

59
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:23,198
Moreover, those parameters 
are not the same

60
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:26,112
if we consider individuals and households,

61
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:31,244
administrative communities, countries,
regions, or cultural communities.

62
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,979
All these parameters help us 
to determine vulnerability.

63
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,212
Let's look at some of the individual 
and household-level parameters.

64
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:41,014
For instance, age.

65
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:44,382
Older people might have difficulty
running down the stairs

66
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:46,023
in case of disaster.

67
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:48,863
Or, let's think about 
neighborhood networks.

68
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:53,112
Neighbors can help you 
before, during, and after disaster.

69
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:56,963
And lastly, and very importantly,
access to information.

70
00:03:57,713 --> 00:03:59,947
At the administrative community level,

71
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:03,991
some of the parameters include 
infrastructure and accessibility.

72
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:07,253
For instance, the lack of shelters
makes people more vulnerable

73
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:10,335
as they have less choices
to protect themselves.

74
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:13,265
The presence and quality 
of civil protection.

75
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:17,103
For instance, the lack of fire departments
and civil protection agencies

76
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:20,942
that could help before, 
during, and after an event.

77
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,736
Disaster preparedness,
the degree of autonomy,

78
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,483
participation in decision-making,

79
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:28,324
and finally, 
access to resources.

80
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:32,712
There is a significant number 
of hazard-independent parameters.

81
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:35,395
At the country level,
these include, among others,

82
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:38,392
the regulatory environment
or armed conflicts.

83
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:40,926
For instance, the number
and intensity of conflicts,

84
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:42,518
the population structure,

85
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:44,946
looking at the number 
of internally-displaced people 

86
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:46,359
or refugees.

87
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:49,258
But also, the level 
of national disaster planning.

88
00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:52,718
For instance, the lack of a plan
or inappropriate guidelines that,

89
00:04:52,718 --> 00:04:56,642
instead of decreasing the vulnerability,
may actually increase it.

90
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:58,608
At the regional level,

91
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:01,236
hazard-independent 
vulnerability parameters

92
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:05,037
include the climate
and the regional political stability.

93
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:07,227
At the level of the cultural community,

94
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:09,977
parameters include 
the status of communities,

95
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,503
gender inequality,

96
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:14,441
risk perception and approach 
towards emergencies,

97
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,481
and coping strategies.

98
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:20,751
Now, we're coming to the hazard-dependent 
vulnerability parameters.

99
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:24,241
For example, at the individual 
and household level,

100
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,722
the quality and age of a building
are important parameters.

101
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:31,846
For example, if the materials
used in the building are of good quality,

102
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:34,286
the building can, therefore, 
better support movement

103
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:35,931
during an earthquake.

104
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:38,492
Or, the location 
of a dwelling is also key.

105
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:39,422
For example,

106
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,082
if a house is close to a mountain
with high landslide risk

107
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,732
or in a flooding zone,

108
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:46,659
these are important 
vulnerability parameters.

109
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:49,240
And at the administrative community level,

110
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,615
legal regulations are important parameters

111
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:54,673
because in the context 
of a disaster risk reduction,

112
00:05:54,673 --> 00:05:57,575
we need to know 
whether building codes exist

113
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:59,901
and whether they are applied 
and monitored.

114
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,450
At the level of a country,

115
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,750
environmental degradation can result
from cutting down trees,

116
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,539
which leads to soil erosion 
and potential landslides.

117
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,189
At the level of a region,

118
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:14,141
land use and the slope elevation--
the so-called relief--

119
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,731
can be a hazard-dependent parameter.

120
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:18,989
And when we look at cultural communities,

121
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:23,464
the level of preparedness will be
an important hazard-dependent parameter.

122
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:28,230
Let's now look at the root causes 
and progression of vulnerability.

123
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,703
This model explains the causal chain,

124
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:36,050
which is the progression of vulnerability
developed by B. Wisner in 2003.

125
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,629
The diagram shows how unsafe conditions,

126
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:41,403
for example
dangerous physical environments,

127
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,657
are created by dynamic pressures,

128
00:06:43,657 --> 00:06:45,960
for instance by rapid urbanization

129
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,442
that stem from root causes 
of vulnerability,

130
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:52,121
such as poverty, discrimination,
poor governance,

131
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,876
and inadequate access to resources.

132
00:06:55,986 --> 00:07:00,686
Let's now look at the specific example:
how vulnerability can progress.

133
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:04,692
Limited access to resources 
to invest in training

134
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,252
leads to a lack 
of skilled and trained people

135
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:10,090
on building back better techniques.

136
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,669
This contributes to unstable houses
and unsafe living conditions,

137
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:17,116
putting local livelihoods at risk.

138
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:22,628
Tackling those root causes
and dynamic pressures is imperative 

139
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:26,787
in order to create safer conditions 
and reduce vulnerability.

140
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:30,418
Now, I will define the term <i>exposure</i>

141
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:35,214
and explain how exposure 
and vulnerability are connected.

142
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:39,819
The term <i>exposure</i> refers to people,
property, systems,

143
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:42,260
or other elements present in hazard zones

144
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,309
that are thereby 
subject to potential losses.

145
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:47,103
What do you think?

146
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:50,001
Are all exposed elements 
equally vulnerable?

147
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:54,452
No. Because it is possible 
to be exposed, but not vulnerable.

148
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,671
For example, by living in a flood plain,

149
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,690
but having sufficient means to modify 
the building structure of the house

150
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,866
to mitigate potential loss.

151
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:06,292
However, to be vulnerable 
to an extreme event,

152
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:09,446
it is necessary to also be exposed.

153
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:12,246
For example, 
both houses in the picture

154
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:15,489
may be exposed 
to storm surge and strong winds.

155
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:19,210
However, the vulnerability 
of each house, and each household,

156
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,721
may be different.

157
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:25,074
One house looks sturdier
and is built with high-quality materials,

158
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:27,157
and may, therefore, 
be less vulnerable.

159
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:31,064
I invite you to look 
at the additional materials for this video

00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:33,148
where you will find the link to an article

161
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:35,726
presenting exposure variations 
to earthquake

162
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:38,835
between day and night in Lisbon, Portugal.

163
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:40,705
In the aftermath of a disaster,

164
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:44,047
many people may suffer 
a downward spiral of vulnerabilities

165
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:47,166
where new vulnerabilities 
add to previous ones.

166
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,905
As you can see in this video
of a Nepalese village

167
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:53,482
in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake,

168
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:57,144
the main house was destroyed
and a shelter is being built.

169
00:08:57,144 --> 00:09:00,193
This shelter may be 
of lower quality than the house,

170
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:02,518
or repairs to the shelter
may be inadequate,

171
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:05,946
making the family 
more vulnerable to other events.

172
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:09,506
In this video, we have defined 
vulnerability and exposure.

173
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:11,707
Let me recall the main points.

174
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:15,936
We learned that vulnerability 
is the human dimension of disasters,

175
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,996
that vulnerability varies 
significantly over time

176
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:22,134
and within a community, 
country, or region.

177
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:24,905
We also learned that a number 
of different factors

178
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,477
influence vulnerability,

179
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:31,426
and that vulnerability can be 
hazard-dependent or independent.

180
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:32,903
And, very importantly,

181
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:36,422
not all exposed elements 
are equally vulnerable.
