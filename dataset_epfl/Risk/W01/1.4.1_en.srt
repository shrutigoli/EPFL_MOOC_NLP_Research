00:00:05,186 --> 00:00:07,218
Hello. My name is Anthony Davison,

2
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:09,758
I'm Professor of Statistics here at EPFL,

3
00:00:09,758 --> 00:00:12,327
the École polytechnique 
fédérale de Lausanne,

4
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:14,665
and I have a particular interest 
in trying to estimate

5
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:17,589
the probabilities of rare events.

6
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:21,212
The purpose of this brief video,

7
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:24,370
is to give an introduction
to the idea of risk,

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,590
to the idea of a probability model,

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,136
which involves the idea
of a random experiment,

10
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:32,527
and then to discuss briefly
how we use probability models,

11
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:37,718
and some idea of losses,
to estimate potential risks.

12
00:00:37,718 --> 00:00:42,332
Let's begin by looking
at a tragic case study.

13
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:46,010
The state of Vargas is a state
on the northern coast of Venezuela,

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,180
which you can see here in the map.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,516
And it's got a very mountainous terrain,

16
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:54,043
as you can see in the picture
here on the right.

17
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:58,898
When it rains heavily here, 
it's very rapid runoff,

18
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:00,963
and that can lead to landslides.

19
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:05,775
This graph shows data 
on daily rainfall amounts,

20
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:10,643
from the beginning of 1961
up to almost the end of 1999,

21
00:01:10,643 --> 00:01:15,025
at Maiquetia, the airport near Caracas.

22
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:16,613
You can see there's a lot of variation,

23
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:19,391
as there always is in daily rainfall data,

24
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:22,653
with the largest value over that period,

25
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:27,257
being about 150 millimeters 
in a given day.

26
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:32,273
The month of December, 1999,
had some quite heavy rainfall.

27
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:37,175
And then in the middle of the month,
14th, 15th and 16th,

28
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:39,513
massive amounts of rainfall fell,

29
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:42,807
about 90 centimeters over the three days.

30
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:46,569
And that led to enormous flooding,

31
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:52,019
runoff and landslides and mudflows.

32
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,412
What you see in the picture here,
is the result of a landslide

33
00:01:56,412 --> 00:02:01,185
on what was a bustling town,
and you can see it's been devastated.

34
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:04,206
No one knows 
how many people lost their lives.

35
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:08,628
Estimates range from 10,000 to 30,000,
but no one really knows,

36
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,740
because there was no
population census of any sort.

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,041
So what do we mean by risk?

38
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,667
The definition of risk 
is the expected loss

39
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:19,781
due to an undesirable outcome
in a random experiment.

40
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:21,673
And there, there are three key words:

41
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:25,518
random experiment, 
outcome and expected loss.

42
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:29,575
So let's think what we might mean
by a simple random experiment,

43
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:33,543
where I take this die and throw it once.

44
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:38,511
There are six possible outcomes, 
one up to six.

45
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:41,193
And if we suppose that the die was fair,

46
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:46,119
then their respective probabilities
would be 1/6 each,

47
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,955
and then we would have this table here,

48
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:51,206
of outcomes 
with the corresponding probabilities.

49
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:56,369
The total probability is 1, 
because exactly one of those outcomes

50
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:59,486
must occur 
when the probability's performed.

51
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:02,486
We can then use 
that table of probabilities,

52
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:06,909
to work out the probabilities 
of more complicated events,

53
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,869
such as the event that the outcome is odd,

54
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:14,287
which corresponds to observing
a one, a three or a five,

55
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:16,524
and because those different outcomes

56
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:19,709
are disjoint, none of them
can occur together,

57
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,657
the total probability 
is the sum of the individual probabilities

58
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:27,489
for the three outcomes,
namely 1/6 plus 1/6 plus 1/6,

59
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,403
and that gives us 1/2.

60
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:32,618
Now, let's imagine 
that in a moment of madness,

61
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:36,999
I agree to pay you 6 dollars
if the die gives a 6,

62
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,970
and nothing otherwise.

63
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,561
Then we get this table here,

64
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,868
which gives us the outcomes, 
the probabilities

65
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:46,920
and the potential losses.

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,066
The outcome 6 occurs with probability 1/6,

67
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:56,883
so on average 
it occurs <i>only</i> once every 6 throws,

68
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:58,483
and so the expected loss

69
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:02,000
due to the particular 
undesirable outcome 1,

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,890
of getting a 6--

71
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,303
undesirable for me, of course,

72
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:09,291
highly desirable for the person 
I'm playing the game with--

73
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,300
is the probability of a 6, 
times the loss when that's observed,

74
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,376
which is 1/6 times 6, which is 1 dollar.

75
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:20,726
So that's my expected loss 
when we play this game.

76
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:25,085
We can also imagine 
a more expensive game for me,

77
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:29,408
in which I give you the amount in dollars
shown on the face of the die.

78
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:33,014
So in this case, that would be 4, 
for example, or 6,

79
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:35,746
or whatever comes up 
when the die is thrown.

80
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:42,339
In that case, my potential losses 
are from 1 up to 6,

81
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:44,569
with the corresponding probabilities.

82
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:51,027
And we can compute the expected loss
using the formula given here,

83
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:55,970
I lose 1 if the outcome is 1,

84
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,070
the probability is 1/6,

85
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,068
2 if the outcome is 2, 
with probability of 1/6, and so on.

86
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:07,108
That gives me 
an expected loss of 3.5 dollars,

87
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,238
every time we throw the die.

88
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:14,293
So that gives us an idea how, 
in a particular application,

89
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,258
we can estimate risk.

90
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:17,777
The die example, of course,

91
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:21,571
is almost the simplest example
we could think of.

92
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,917
In general we have to do things
slightly differently,

93
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:27,691
but the same basic steps apply.

94
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:29,995
We have to construct a probability model,

95
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:34,120
we have to define the random experiment,
define the outcomes

96
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,194
and somehow assign probabilities 
to each outcome.

97
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:41,933
We express the loss for each outcome 
in a loss function,

98
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:46,366
and then we can compute the expected loss,
which is the sum over outcomes,

99
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:51,735
of the loss due to each outcome, 
times the probability of that outcome.

100
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:56,434
The histogram here, 
shows the daily rainfall amounts

101
00:05:56,434 --> 00:06:01,539
up to the beginning of December, 1999.

102
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:07,356
You can see that the largest value 
is about 14.5 or so,

103
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:10,903
and the question arises,
how could we use those values

104
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:15,088
to estimate the probabilities 
of the later events of that month?

105
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:21,386
It's clearly not enough
to use these data on themselves,

106
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:25,105
because there's no value larger than 14.5

107
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:27,608
and therefore 
we couldn't just predict one.

108
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:31,328
Also, there are values 
that there are holes, as you can see,

109
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:35,424
we wouldn't be able to predict a value
between say 11 and 12,

110
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:39,390
because no previous value
has been observed in that range.

111
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,858
So what we have to do, 
is to replace the data

112
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:46,448
by a theoretical construct 
that's supposed to represent them.

113
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:53,200
Here's a picture showing 
what such a construct might look like.

114
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,481
What I've done is to fit
a probability model to the data.

115
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:59,461
You can see 
that it's not a very good model,

116
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,202
because it underestimates 
the probability of very small values,

117
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:06,304
and then overestimates 
the probabilities of values

118
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:10,495
up to about 2.5 or so,

119
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:14,942
because the red line that represents 
the theoretical probability model,

120
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:18,054
is higher than the observed values there.

121
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:21,283
And of course, 
because the total probability is 1,

122
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:24,287
that will mean 
that it will be underestimating

123
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:27,853
the probabilities of larger events.

124
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:30,548
But the particular line here 
isn't important,

125
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:35,358
because what I'm trying
to explain is the idea

126
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:38,497
of replacing the data
with a probability model.

127
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:39,876
In applications, of course,

128
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,945
we would try and choose 
a suitable class of probability models,

129
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:46,776
that represent rare events appropriately,

130
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:51,146
and that means thinking hard 
about the construction of such models.

131
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:55,856
There is an extensive statistical 
and probabilistic literature on that.

132
00:07:56,906 --> 00:08:01,737
In addition to a fitted probability model,
we also need a loss function.

133
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:07,306
What this picture here shows
is an example of such a loss function,

134
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:11,721
where I arbitrarily suppose 
that the loss is 0 up to 10,

135
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:15,222
and then it jumps
and rises linearly thereafter.

136
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:17,615
But this is just an example.

137
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:21,268
What one would do in an application,

138
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:24,200
is to construct a realistic loss function,

139
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,248
estimated based on 
potential damage to property,

140
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:30,282
or individuals, or infrastructure,

141
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:34,445
which we would then combine
with the fitted probability model,

142
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:37,390
using the formulae 
that I gave you earlier.

143
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,952
So for each outcome 
there's going to be a probability

144
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,833
and a potential loss,

145
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:46,872
which we combine to calculate
the overall expected risk.

146
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:52,021
When thinking 
about a statistical problem like this,

147
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:55,551
it's useful to distinguish between 
two different ideas,

148
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,559
the ideas of variation and uncertainty.

149
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,202
There's always variation present 
in a probability model,

150
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:04,439
because even if 
we knew the model perfectly,

151
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:08,257
which of course we don't,
the outcome is not pre-determined.

152
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:11,994
There's no deterministic mechanism

153
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:15,677
to tell us what the rainfall will be
on any given day.

154
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:20,923
Uncertainty is a different concept.
It's going to be present,

155
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:24,165
because in any application 
we're going to have to estimate

156
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:27,438
our probability model from limited data,

157
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:29,426
and therefore we're going to be unsure

158
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:33,669
about whether the probability model
is really a good one,

159
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:36,908
whether it's an adequate
representation of the data.

160
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:40,298
And in applications, 
we need to quantify both the variation

161
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:42,968
coming from 
the underlying probability model,

162
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:46,236
and the uncertainty that arises 
because we're not sure

163
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:51,290
what the probability model is,
or what it should be, as much as possible.

164
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,899
So to go over the main points again,

165
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:00,571
what we do when we try and estimate risk,
is to estimate our data

166
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:03,742
by an underlying probability model,
which we're then going to use

167
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:08,441
to estimate the probabilities 
of different potential outcomes.

168
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,303
We estimate risk by combining 
the model probabilities

169
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:15,561
for the different outcomes,
with the corresponding estimated losses.

170
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:21,131
So there are some important limitations 
of what I've just described.

171
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:26,896
The data are always limited,
and are often compromised in some way.

172
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:30,154
We may not be sure how reliable they are.

173
00:10:30,794 --> 00:10:33,064
The probability model 
will rest on assumptions

174
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:38,174
that may not be exactly true, 
and whose consequences may be unclear.

175
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:41,016
And of course, the losses are estimated.

176
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:44,647
And then finally, there may be
so called "black swan" events,

177
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:48,614
that one could not have anticipated
within the given model.

178
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,618
Nevertheless, we have to do our best,
as scientists and engineers,

179
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,515
to try and estimate risks,

180
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:58,700
because accurate estimation
is key to mitigating them subsequently.

181
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,441
Thank you.
