00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,723
Hi. My name is Alessio Ferrari.

2
00:00:06,723 --> 00:00:11,909
I'm a Research Associate at the Laboratory
of Soil Mechanics here at the EPFL.

3
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:14,339
I'm a lecturer for the course
of Slope Stability,

4
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:17,864
and landslides are among
my main research interests.

5
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:20,486
In this video we will talk
about landslide hazard.

6
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:24,075
In particular we will discuss
about what a landslide is.

7
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:26,430
We will discuss the main features,

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,379
briefly mention
the impacts of landslides,

9
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:32,466
and finally we will summarize
the main points.

10
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,964
Many definitions exist
for the concept of a landslide.

11
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:38,988
Here we will refer to the definition
proposed by Cruden,

12
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:44,250
which defines a landslide as,
"the movement of a mass of rock,

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,200
debris or earth down a slope."

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,218
Mass movements occur
mainly under gravitational forces,

15
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,688
in some cases also under a dynamic input.

16
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,854
And the movement, of course,
as a consequence of a failure,

17
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:00,114
usually it's a sheer failure,

18
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:03,815
at the boundary
between the mass which moves

19
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:06,650
and the material which remains in place.

20
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:12,348
This generic definition includes
a large variety of phenomena.

21
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:15,550
From the fall of a single rock block,
with punctual,

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,437
even if potentially dramatic consequences,

23
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:22,050
to a complete failure of an entire hill

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,607
with very serious, dramatic consequences.

25
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:29,881
Each landslide phenomenon
has its peculiar features,

26
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,114
that are mainly controlled
by factors like geology,

27
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:36,223
hydrogeology, topography,

28
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:39,039
the geotechnical properties
of the above materials,

29
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,390
and climate.

30
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,925
Each landslide behaves very differently,

31
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:46,981
both during the failure phase
and the post-failure phase.

32
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,617
This variety of phenomenon behaviors
yields from one side

33
00:01:50,617 --> 00:01:52,809
to the need for a proper terminology

34
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:56,939
to be used consistently
by all the persons involved,

35
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,642
especially considering
the number of different actors

36
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:03,798
involved in landslide management,
from technicians and scientists,

37
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:07,731
to politicians, stakeholders,
that have to take decisions.

38
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,274
From the other side,
this variety of phenomena

39
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:15,924
brings the need for a system
of classification on landslides

40
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:19,639
with the aims of identifying
general types of movements,

41
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,019
and synthesizing the main characteristics
of the movements,

42
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:25,878
both spatially and temporally.

43
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:29,475
In this video, we will refer
to the document produced

44
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:32,122
by the International
Geotechnical Societies'

45
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:34,908
UNESCO Working Party
for Landslide Inventory

46
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:37,458
that was produced in 1993.

47
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:42,276
In this document you will find
a comprehensive glossary

48
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:44,858
and a classification system
for landslides,

49
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:48,280
and you are all encouraged
to refer to that document

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,515
for a complete overview of the terms

51
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:52,830
for a proper description of a landslide.

52
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,971
This is an example of the terms
which define both the main features

53
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:59,306
and the dimensions of a landslide.

54
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:03,400
It refers to the particular case
of a sliding mass

55
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,002
which remains in contact
with the underneath material.

56
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,553
This is what we call a <i>rotational slide.</i>

57
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:15,238
The main features that characterize
this type of movement are:

58
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:17,448
the <i>surface of rupture</i>, which is

59
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:21,374
where the differential movements
between the moving mass

60
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:24,614
and the mass which remains
in place concentrate;

61
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:27,641
the <i>zone of accumulation,</i>

62
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:32,480
that is the zone
where the moving mass accumulates;

63
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,920
the <i>main body,</i>

64
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,399
which is representing
the entire moving mass;

65
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,378
the <i>toe,</i>

66
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:43,619
which is the most elongated part
of the main body;

67
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:45,688
and the <i>main scarp,</i>

68
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:50,039
which is the exposed part
of the surface of rupture

69
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,396
that we can see
after the movement took place.

70
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,961
The length, the depth, and the width

71
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:01,689
characterize the dimensions
of this landslide.

72
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:08,070
The rotational slide we have just seen
is one of the possible landslide types

73
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,924
that we can observe.

74
00:04:10,922 --> 00:04:13,636
This figure reports the many types,

75
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:17,272
which are mainly distinguished
considering the material involved:

76
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:21,823
rock, debris, earth, mud,
and the type of movement:

77
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:26,487
fall, topple, avalanche,
slide, flow, spread.

78
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:31,079
Certain characteristics
can be somehow anticipated

79
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,759
by looking at the type
of involved material

80
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,051
and the geometry of the system.

81
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:42,854
<i>Rotational landslides</i> will occur mainly
when we have a system

82
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:46,070
composed by a homogeneous material.

83
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:54,332
<i>Translational slides</i> occur when we have
some discontinuities in our systems.

84
00:04:56,559 --> 00:05:00,117
A <i>block slide</i> is a kind
of a translational slide

85
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:03,156
in which the material remains
in the form of a block

86
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:05,009
during the movement.

87
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:12,188
<i>Rockfalls</i> will occur when the material
is exposed to the air

88
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:13,841
in the underneath part,

89
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:17,569
and the movement will occur
predominantly through the air.

90
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:24,758
A <i>topple</i> is expected when the material
is free to rotate during the movement.

91
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:32,055
<i>Debris flow, avalanche, earthflow,</i>

92
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:35,678
are movements that can travel

93
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:39,176
for several hundred meters,
even kilometers,

94
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:42,442
and they can have
very different velocities,

95
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,890
depending on the type of material
which is involved.

96
00:05:47,543 --> 00:05:51,532
<i>Creeps</i> are movements
that are occurring, essentially,

97
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:54,851
under constant stress conditions,

98
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:58,827
and the <i>lateral spreads</i>
are lateral movements

99
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:03,115
which occur mainly
when we have a hard material

100
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:05,866
sitting on a softer material.

101
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,448
As a part of the classification
of a landslide,

102
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:13,359
it is crucial that we define
the state of activity.

103
00:06:15,238 --> 00:06:19,862
We will call <i>active</i>
a landslide which is moving

104
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:23,145
during the time in which
we are analyzing the system.

105
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:27,172
We say that the landslide is <i>suspended</i>

106
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:31,612
if it was active,
and now it is not moving,

107
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:35,255
but the movement could start again
in the near future.

108
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:40,917
A <i>reactivated</i> landslide is
a landslide that was suspended,

109
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:44,096
and now has started to move again.

110
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,669
<i>Inactive</i> landslides could be
dormant, abandoned.

111
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:53,138
They could be stabilized,
if we have done something

112
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:56,877
to prevent any further movement to occur,

113
00:06:56,877 --> 00:07:00,356
or it could be <i>relict</i>,
if some time has passed

114
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,873
that movements are not
likely to occur anymore.

115
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,343
<i>Distribution</i> is part
of the classification system

116
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,889
for a landslide.

117
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:10,666
When we talk about distribution,

118
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:14,553
we refer to the spatial evolution
of the movements.

119
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:19,135
The <i>style</i> refers to
the number of movements

120
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:22,574
that are occurring in the system
that we are analyzing.

121
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,057
If we have just one type of movement,

122
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:28,542
we will say that we have
a <i>single</i> landslide.

123
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:32,867
If this type of movement is occurring
in the same slope

124
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,829
but in different locations,

125
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,720
without sharing the surface of rupture,

126
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,799
we will say that the style
of activity is <i>successive.</i>

127
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:47,393
A <i>multiple</i> style of activity
is the case in which

128
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:50,153
the same type of movements
is happening

129
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:54,291
in different parts of the slope.

130
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:57,495
A <i>complex</i> style is the case

131
00:07:57,495 --> 00:08:01,127
in which we have different types
of movements which are happening

132
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:04,469
in the same portion
of the slope we're analyzing,

133
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:08,052
while <i>composite</i> is the case
where we have different types,

134
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:11,488
but located in different portions
of the slope.

135
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,145
Let's briefly talk about landslide impact.

136
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:20,656
It is quite obvious to think
that mountain and hilly regions

137
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:24,303
and coastlines
where we find natural slopes,

138
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,719
are the areas most exposed to landslides.

139
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:32,050
But we don't have to neglect
the risks related to man-made slopes,

140
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,103
such as dams, cuts and fills,
and tailing dams.

141
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:42,536
Depending on the objects
which are exposed to the landslides,

142
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:44,559
landslides may cause fatalities,

143
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,782
damages to infrastructures
or to properties.

144
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:52,496
Let's summarize the main points
that we have discussed in this video.

145
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:56,586
Landslides are defined as movements
of rocks, debris, or earth,

146
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:59,872
which are happening mostly
under gravitational forces,

147
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,490
but they could be also induced
by earthquakes.

148
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:07,255
Landslides are classified
according to their type,

149
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,518
state of activity,
distribution, and style.

150
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:14,573
We have discussed about the need
for a proper terminology

151
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:17,951
to describe and characterize
a given landslide.

152
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:22,250
This is mainly due to the number of actors
which are participating

153
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,892
in the management
of a problem of a landslide.

154
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:27,707
Those are very complex phenomena,

155
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:30,606
which present a large variety of features,

156
00:09:30,606 --> 00:09:33,925
and they can have really
potential destructive impact.
