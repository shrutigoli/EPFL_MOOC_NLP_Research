00:00:03,997 --> 00:00:08,779
Hello. In this video I will present 
and define risk in general terms,

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,057
disaster and disaster risk.

3
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:14,959
Then I will explain 
what we mean by disaster risk reduction.

4
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:19,379
Finally, I will present the definitions
of capacity and resilience,

5
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,140
and we will end this video

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,920
by looking at how disaster risk reduction
is related to climate change,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,411
climate change adaptation
and sustainable development.

8
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:33,048
In this course, you have seen 
the definition of hazard,

9
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:35,254
exposure and vulnerability.

10
00:00:35,254 --> 00:00:39,251
And more recently, 
how risk is defined in mathematical terms.

11
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:43,740
Now I will explain risk 
as defined by UNISDR,

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,391
and how the mathematical term of risk
relates to the one defined by UNISDR.

13
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:53,504
In mathematical terms, 
the random experiment is the context,

14
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,703
the place, the time, et cetera,
where an event may happen.

15
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:00,472
The undesirable outcome,

16
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:04,295
will be what UNISDR defines as an event.

17
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:07,994
The expected loss 
would be the potential consequences:

18
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:12,856
financial, environmental, social,
the loss of lives, et cetera.

19
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:18,056
Risk can be objectively defined 
so that two people can take the same data

20
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:20,377
and come up with a similar result.

21
00:01:21,127 --> 00:01:25,868
Risk can be expressed in many ways,
as long as it combines an event,

22
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:28,326
usually an undesirable event,

23
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:31,343
with a likelihood
and its potential consequences.

24
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,819
One can use the methods of science, 
engineering and math,

25
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,018
in order to define risks.

26
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:43,928
To calculate the total risk of <i>n</i> events 
with consequences <i>Ci</i>

27
00:01:43,928 --> 00:01:46,610
and occurrence probabilities <i>Pi,</i>

28
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,814
we need to calculate the sum of the risks
from the individual events.

29
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:56,311
With this notion of risk, 
we can now see how disaster is defined.

30
00:01:56,311 --> 00:02:00,439
According to UNISDR,
disaster is "a serious disruption

31
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,600
of the functioning of a community
or a society,

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,313
due to hazardous events interacting
with conditions of vulnerability

33
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:08,780
and exposure,

34
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,312
leading to widespread human, material,

35
00:02:11,312 --> 00:02:14,861
economic or environmental
losses and impacts."

36
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:19,875
Disasters result from the combination
of the exposure to a hazard,

37
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:23,954
the vulnerability aspects,
and the insufficient capacity

38
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:28,103
to reduce or address 
the potential negative consequences.

39
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,395
Disaster impacts may include loss of life,

40
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:34,261
injury, disease,
and other negative effects

41
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:37,658
on human physical, mental,
and social well-being,

42
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,643
together with damage to property,

43
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:42,496
destruction of assets, loss of services,

44
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:47,037
social and economic disruption, 
and environmental degradation.

45
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:52,057
These losses could be classified 
in direct or indirect losses.

46
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:54,718
Direct losses 
include damaged infrastructure,

47
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:58,228
and lost lives,
while indirect losses can consist

48
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:01,457
of lost education 
or economic opportunities.

49
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:04,070
Now that we know about risk and disaster,

50
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,067
we can move on to understand
what we mean by disaster risk.

51
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:12,267
Disaster risk is "considered to be
a function of hazard, exposure,

52
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:15,239
and vulnerability. 
It is normally expressed

53
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,721
as a probability of the loss of life,

54
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:21,321
injury, or destroyed or damaged assets,

55
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:25,644
which could occur to a system, 
society or a community

56
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:28,182
in a specific period of time."

57
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:33,372
Let us combine the different elements,
such as risk and disaster,

58
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:37,157
and look at how 
disaster risk reduction is defined.

59
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:40,390
Disaster risk reduction 
is "the policy objective

60
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,665
aimed at preventing new 
and reducing existing disaster risk

61
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:47,005
and managing residual risk,

62
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:51,125
all of which contributes
to strengthening resilience."

63
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:55,495
So the central question is
how can we reduce disaster risk?

64
00:03:56,075 --> 00:04:00,426
We reduce disaster risk through increase
in capacity and resilience.

65
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:04,136
Capacity and resilience are two terms
that go together

66
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:06,998
and are the opposite of vulnerability.

67
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:11,357
We could say that capacity and resilience
are on one side of a coin,

68
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:14,208
while vulnerability is on the other.

69
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,448
Let us first define capacity.

70
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:19,808
Capacity is "the combination 
of all the strengths,

71
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:23,709
attributes and resources available 
within a community,

72
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:28,338
society or organization,
to manage and reduce the risks

73
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:30,379
and strengthen resilience."

74
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,654
Capacity may include infrastructure
and physical means,

75
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:39,980
institutions, societal coping abilities,
as well as human knowledge,

76
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,792
skills and collective attributes,
such as social relationships,

77
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,132
leadership and management.

78
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,609
Let us now look at three important terms.

79
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:52,691
The first one is capacity development.

80
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:56,332
Capacity development 
is the process by which people,

81
00:04:56,332 --> 00:05:00,892
organizations and society, 
systematically stimulate and develop

82
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:05,240
their capacities over time,
to achieve social and economic goals,

83
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,154
through improvement of knowledge, 
skills and institutions.

84
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:12,131
Capacity building, on the other hand,

85
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:15,193
is more associated 
with technical cooperation,

86
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:18,265
suggesting that capacity 
does not yet exist,

87
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:20,325
and has to be built from scratch.

88
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:25,262
The last term, coping capacity,
is the ability of people,

89
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:30,176
organizations and systems,
using available skills and resources,

90
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:34,676
to manage adverse conditions, 
risk or disasters.

91
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:37,372
Here you see a video 
showing community members

92
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:41,040
in a village in Nepal, 
using their skills and capacities

93
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,927
as a response to the 2015 earthquake
that affected Nepal.

94
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:49,570
In the picture, we also see
how a member of an organization

95
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,830
provides public awareness and information
to a hearing-impaired girl,

96
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,230
about disaster risk reduction.

97
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,012
So what is resilience?

98
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:03,150
Resilience is "the ability of a system,
community or society

99
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,811
exposed to hazards to resist, absorb,
accommodate to and recover from

100
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:12,488
the effects of a hazard
in a timely and efficient manner,"

101
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,262
including through 
the preservation and restoration

102
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:18,642
of its essential
basic structures and functions.

103
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,502
Resilience means 
the ability to resile from,

104
00:06:23,502 --> 00:06:26,434
or bounce back from a shock.

105
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:30,602
The resilience of a community,
in respect to potential hazard events,

106
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,600
is determined by the degree

107
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,854
to which the community 
has the necessary resources

108
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,552
and it is capable of organizing itself,

109
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:41,962
both prior and during times of need.

110
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:46,106
For instance, if a community 
that lives in a hurricane-prone area

111
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,107
has established a common fund
for infrastructure damage

112
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:52,247
in case of disasters,
they are more resilient,

113
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:54,647
as they will be able 
to bounce back quickly

114
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:58,505
after a hurricane by using their funds
to repair damaged infrastructure.

115
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:02,574
Now I will talk about 
how the term resilience

116
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:04,968
connects to sustainable development.

117
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:08,799
In this course, and working on 
disaster risk reduction in general,

118
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,215
you will hear about long-term resilience.

119
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:17,099
For example, this graph 
shows the resilience level

120
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:21,700
when interventions 
to strengthen resilience

121
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,149
aim to address underlying causes 
of vulnerability,

122
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,051
in order to protect development,

123
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:31,879
reduce and mitigate 
radical drops in resilience

124
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,022
caused by disasters in crisis,

125
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:39,652
and enhance bouncing back from adversity.

126
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:43,141
So in the absence 
of a long-term resilience program,

127
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:47,495
the danger that the community 
drops below the critical resilience level,

128
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:49,039
is much higher.

129
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,294
As we saw, 
there are different levels of resilience.

130
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:56,124
A term that should be mentioned 
when discussing these different levels,

131
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:59,274
is transformational resilience.

132
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:01,446
According to Dr. Karen Sudmeier--

133
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:04,776
a specialist on ecosystem-based 
disaster risk reduction,

134
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,066
whom you will also meet in this MOOC--

135
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:10,406
we need to distinguish 
between passive resilience,

136
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,897
where the focus is on
short-term bounce back and recovery,

137
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:17,317
to a more active 
and transformational resilience,

138
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:20,095
where the focus
is on the long-term reduced risk

139
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,357
and resilience through prevention.

140
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:26,259
Root causes of vulnerability 
and risks are reduced,

141
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:28,859
and power relations are addressed.

142
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:31,665
Overall, transformational resilience

143
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:34,390
is a path towards improved livelihoods,

144
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,090
well-being, risk reduction,

145
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,247
and ultimately sustainable development.

146
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:44,598
Disaster risk reduction 
is also closely linked to climate change.

147
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:48,133
As you have seen this week,
climate change induces variations

148
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:52,880
in frequency, intensity, 
spatial extent, duration,

149
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,097
and timing of extreme weather
and climate events,

150
00:08:56,097 --> 00:08:59,612
and how these variations
impact flooding, for example.

151
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:02,982
It is predicted 
that those will be more numerous,

152
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:05,409
and therefore that it is highly likely

153
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:08,793
that there will be more
weather-related disasters.

154
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:13,094
Consequently, disaster risk reduction
needs to take into account

155
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,424
climate change and its effects.

156
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:19,302
It should also be coherent 
with climate change adaptation strategies,

157
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:20,896
and activities.

158
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:23,565
Moreover, disaster risk reduction,

159
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:26,757
is directly linked 
to sustainable development.

160
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:32,206
Disasters increase poverty, 
economic inequality and social exclusion,

161
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,874
and are thus an obstacle to development.

162
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,623
Therefore, reducing disaster risks,

163
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:41,119
is an opportunity 
for sustainable development.

164
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,435
In conclusion, the take-home 
main points of this video include:

165
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:50,479
risks can be expressed in many ways,
so long as it combines an event

166
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:53,704
with a likelihood 
and potential consequences;

167
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:58,597
DRR is the concept and practice 
of reducing disaster risks;

168
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:02,210
capacity and resilience 
are the opposite of vulnerability;

169
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,930
and DRR is directly linked
to sustainable development.
