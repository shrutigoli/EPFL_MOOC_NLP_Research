00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:08,111
Hello. In this video I will present
a general overview

2
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:11,001
of funding for science 
and technology for DRR,

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,032
some elements that need to be in place

4
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:17,211
to make progress towards effective 
funding schemes for DRR research,

5
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:21,272
science and technology, 
and some examples of funding sources.

6
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:26,603
According to a 2015 publication
of the Overseas Development Institute,

7
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:30,943
between 1991 and 2010, 
only a small part

8
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:34,715
of the development assistance
was dedicated to DRR.

9
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:39,516
Concerning specifically funding
for science and technology for DRR,

10
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:41,246
there are global differences

11
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:45,286
in the way research 
and resources are aligned.

12
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:49,007
According to Reid Basher's
publication of 2013,

13
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,718
the funding for DRR science and technology

14
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,968
is mostly undertaken by national,
publicly funded institutions.

15
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:59,197
For instance, universities 
and government agencies.

16
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:01,787
The focus of the research and funding

17
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:05,319
is often concentrating
on the most frequent hazards.

18
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:10,809
Integrated DRR, complex hazards,
and future risk lack sponsorship.

19
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:14,167
There is more natural science
than social science

20
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:17,370
on vulnerability 
or multidisciplinary research.

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,681
There appear to be limited resources
to investigate risk and resilience.

22
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:25,960
On the other hand, government aid agencies

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,301
may limit their research 
to applied research

24
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,900
to fulfil their mandates.

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,653
The Sendai Framework 2015-2030
calls for more effectiveness

26
00:01:35,653 --> 00:01:39,033
of funding investments 
to support DRR innovation,

27
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:40,843
identify research gaps,

28
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:44,020
and prioritize 
research areas appropriately.

29
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,325
It also identifies the need
to optimize national

30
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,284
and international cooperation

31
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:51,664
in relation to resourcing research,

32
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:53,772
and facilitating its uptake.

33
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:57,417
In the next slides, 
I will present a few examples

34
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,486
of research funding resources.

35
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:02,386
Although we cannot include 
all funding opportunities

36
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:05,387
for science and technology 
for DRR in this video,

37
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:09,018
and many of you know these
and other research funding sources,

38
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:13,299
we thought it important to show you
some of the existing opportunities.

39
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:18,377
According to the publication 
by Aitsi-Selmi et al. in 2016,

40
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:22,108
several platforms have been 
developed to encourage national,

41
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,139
international, or transectorial research.

42
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,600
These platforms connect 
research providers and research users.

43
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,760
We can name, for example, IRDR,
Future Earth, the Belmont Forum,

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,248
and the Newton Fund.

45
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:40,480
There are also other resources,
funds, and partnerships that exist.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,741
For example, AXA, 
a French insurance company

47
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,202
manages a research funding instrument.

48
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:50,326
Also, the Global Resilience Partnership
that aims to accelerate

49
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:54,523
promising technologies and ideas
to build resilience of families,

50
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:57,464
communities, countries, and regions.

51
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:02,094
In 2014, the European Commission
funding opportunities

52
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:05,406
launched a call for research 
on disaster resilience,

53
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:08,095
safeguarding and securing society,

54
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,277
including adapting to climate change.

55
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:13,815
The need for a more strategic 
coordination of investments

56
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:16,715
was also discussed during the UNISDR

57
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:19,888
Science and Technology Conference in 2016.

58
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:23,959
Specifically, participants contemplated
tools and mechanisms

59
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,327
for coordinating funders and their role
in increasing research capacity

60
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:31,732
in countries with more limited
research infrastructure.

61
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:36,098
During the conference, a participant
emphasized the need to think

62
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:40,732
about <i>investing</i> in research for DRR
instead of funding research for DRR.

63
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:44,609
Investing in research for DRR
strengthens the message

64
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,570
that DRR is essential

65
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,879
because it is closely linked to a broader,
sustainable development agenda.

66
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:54,719
In this video we saw that there is
relatively little investment

67
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,089
towards research for DRR in general,

68
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,951
and risk and resilience in particular.

69
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:04,542
And that we need to start thinking
about investing in research for DRR

70
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:08,803
in order to bring a broader sustainable
development agenda forward.
