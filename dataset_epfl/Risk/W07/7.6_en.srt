1
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:08,768
Hello. In this video I will talk about
the fact that risk can also be

2
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:11,257
an engine for sustainable development.

3
00:00:11,257 --> 00:00:13,477
I will explain how we need both.

4
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:16,056
A development perspective on risk,

5
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:18,938
and a risk perspective on development.

6
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:22,043
This will lead us to the need 
of integrating DRR

7
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:25,789
into development initiatives,
in order to develop a common agenda,

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,200
and identify trade-offs.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,820
Ultimately, DRR is an opportunity
towards transformative resilience,

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,261
helping communities 
to become more sustainable,

11
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:39,809
and more resilient in the future.

12
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:44,451
Disasters strike both developed
and developing countries.

13
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:48,120
Furthermore, the globalization 
of the economy can also mean

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,491
that disasters can have
far-reaching consequences.

15
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:55,549
For example, the 2011 flooding in Thailand

16
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,699
inundated several industrial zones,

17
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:00,664
and affected global supply chains.

18
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:03,150
The damage from natural disasters

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,514
is often higher in developed countries

20
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:09,403
where infrastructure is more costly
to rebuild and repair.

21
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:13,219
However, compared to the usually lower
gross national product,

22
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:17,835
the economic impact is often
much larger in developing countries.

23
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:21,236
Development can increase risk
in the long-term--

24
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:24,286
for instance, by increasing 
greenhouse gas emissions

25
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:25,916
that drive climate change.

26
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,958
Climate change can contribute
to the intensity of rainstorms,

27
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,547
which can lead to 
a higher risk of landslides.

28
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:36,717
Disasters can even 
set back entire populations,

29
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:40,824
and reverse the benefits 
of development achieved in the past.

30
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:46,839
In August of 2010, floods occurred
across a large part of Ladakh,

31
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,799
a region in northern India,

32
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,630
damaging 71 towns and villages,

33
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,350
among them the Marka valley,

34
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,229
which you can see on your right.

35
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:58,738
DRR and development are closely related,

36
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:02,071
and we need to understand
how risks are created,

37
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:04,121
and how they can be reduced.

38
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:09,741
It is very important to integrate DRR
with equitable, sustainable,

39
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:11,621
and resilient development.

40
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:15,516
We need to find out how 
development can be transformed

41
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:17,646
from a root cause of disaster risk

42
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:20,324
to an opportunity for reducing risk.

43
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:24,305
Despite the fact that 
we have made much progress

44
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:27,781
in understanding disaster risk,
the basic dilemma

45
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,303
between development 
and disaster risk remains unchanged.

46
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:35,896
We could almost say that we need 
a development perspective on risk,

47
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:38,504
and a risk perspective on development.

48
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:42,096
We need to articulate a dual perspective,

49
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:46,770
and diagnose how disaster risk 
in development can be understood,

50
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,247
and acted upon, and how risk reduction
can be included in development.

51
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,437
The different impacts 
of the earthquakes in 2010

52
00:02:56,437 --> 00:03:00,078
that happened almost simultaneously 
in Chile and Haiti,

53
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:02,780
illustrate how development 
can offer opportunities

54
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,618
for disaster risk reduction.

55
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:09,228
Whereas there were more than 
200,000 fatalities in Haiti,

56
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:12,100
there were about 500 fatalities in Chile,

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,678
despite the fact that 
the earthquake in Chile

58
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:16,469
was significantly stronger.

59
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:20,311
The main reason behind this,
is that Chile decided to invest

60
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:23,850
in better preparation, 
and enforce strict building codes

61
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,822
that make buildings 
more robust to ground tremors.

62
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:31,410
Let me illustrate how DRR 
can be integrated with development,

63
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,921
with another example.

64
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,472
In DRR, as in all development projects,

65
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:38,250
it is crucial that 
different ministries collaborate.

66
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,951
For example, the ministry for energy,
the ministry for environment,

67
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:47,543
and the ministry for disaster management 
and relief work, need to work together

68
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:51,418
in order to integrate DRR measures
in their development activities.

69
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:56,685
This means that key policy processes
need to be structured in a way

70
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:58,613
to facilitate this integration.

71
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:02,581
For instance, each environmental 
impact assessment

72
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:06,675
required for development projects
should contain a specific part

73
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:10,207
on reducing risk that requires 
the consultation

74
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:12,295
of the other concerned ministries.

75
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:15,880
Development is a key factor 
in reducing vulnerability

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,677
and building resilience.

77
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:21,996
For example, by increasing income
or increasing literacy levels.

78
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:24,959
Through a better education 
people have more

79
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,194
revenue-generating opportunities,

80
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:29,029
which makes them more resilient.

81
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:34,319
Furthermore, literate populations
can better understand evacuation

82
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,429
and early warning information,
and easier access post-disaster aid.

83
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:43,230
Science and technology 
have a crucial role to play

84
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,590
in supporting how DRR can be 
mainstreamed into development projects.

85
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,811
For instance, satellite images 
can help us identify

86
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:54,252
where flash floods are likely to occur,

87
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:58,211
and with the right technology
we can construct appropriate floodways

88
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,762
in the right locations.

89
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:02,603
Information and communication technology

90
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:05,163
is essential in many development projects

91
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,163
as well as in early warning systems.

92
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:11,804
For instance, by allowing the large-scale
and simultaneous distribution

93
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:14,834
of warning information 
through mobile phones.

94
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:18,144
In this table, I am giving you 
a few examples

95
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:20,208
of the importance of science.

96
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,214
Firstly, we need science-based monitoring

97
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:25,874
and evaluation frameworks and indicators.

98
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:31,006
Secondly, DRR is part of 
climate change adaptation,

99
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:33,327
where science has 
an important role to play

100
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:37,097
in the development of policies
that lead to co-benefits.

101
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:40,537
For example, reforestation projects

102
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:43,826
aimed at stabilizing areas
affected by landslides,

103
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:47,256
will directly contribute 
to climate change adaptation.

104
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:50,841
Lastly, science allows us 
to bring together

105
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:53,220
the most promising 
technological innovations

106
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,057
with a social understanding.

107
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:58,790
For example, we need both computing power

108
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,140
as well as anthropological awareness

109
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,929
in order to develop 
early warning systems that are effective.

110
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:09,879
DRR research needs also to focus
on decision-making processes

111
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,501
in order to understand the rationale 
of development decisions,

112
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:17,711
and its relation to risk, 
and the trade-offs that need to be made.

113
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:22,312
Building resilience requires 
relationships across all stakeholders,

114
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:24,753
and science can drive these relationships.

115
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:29,963
Science can provide us a strong foundation
for trust-based platforms

116
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:33,313
that can support collaborations
among many communities.

117
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:35,984
For instance, in New Zealand,

118
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:41,334
following the 2011 earthquake 
in Christchurch killing 185 people,

119
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,574
the government adopted 
a new integrated approach

120
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:48,445
and a number of innovations
in early warning, land-use planning,

121
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:52,875
and experiments in local democracy,
economic and social development.

122
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:57,766
This illustrates how DRR can be 
an engine for sustainable development

123
00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:59,636
leading to more resilience.

124
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:04,327
Christchurch is now one of 
the Rockefeller 100 Resilient Cities.

125
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:08,237
The Integrated Watershed 
Management project in Tajikistan,

126
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:10,248
lead by Caritas and funded by

127
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:13,717
the Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation, SDC,

128
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:16,808
aims for DRR through sustainable 
land management,

129
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:18,478
and improved governance.

130
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:22,820
It tries to reduce risks
related to floods, mudflows,

131
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,030
landslides, and declining 
land productivity.

132
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,460
The project has been quite successful

133
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,650
due to its emphasis 
on inclusive decision-making.

134
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,180
This has strengthened 
institutional capacities

135
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,700
because the Watershed Action Plans
have become a mechanism

136
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,591
to establish good governance
of natural resources.

137
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,631
Through DRR, the sense 
of ownership has increased,

138
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,541
and planning and budgetary capacities
of the local stakeholders

139
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,120
have been strengthened,

140
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,773
contributing to the sustainable 
development of this region.

141
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:57,533
Building transformative resilience

142
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:01,073
means that a community 
not only bounces back from a disaster

143
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:02,964
but can bounce forward.

144
00:08:02,964 --> 00:08:06,354
By forward, we mean 
in a more sustainable direction

145
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:09,364
contributing to long-term capacity.

146
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,445
However, we need to know
how to get key stakeholders

147
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:15,515
to develop a shared vision
of both the risks that exist

148
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:17,465
in their particular contexts,

149
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:20,197
and what action to take
in the short- and long-term.

150
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:25,557
Resilience helps us to think about
and foster development in a new way.

151
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:29,104
The NGO Practical Action
developed this framework

152
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:33,602
which can help us analyze the transitions
from vulnerability to resilience.

153
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:38,167
This framework shows the complexity
of a systems approach to resilience

154
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,769
in a simple diagram.

155
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,749
It highlights the relationship

156
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:44,618
between the various factors
to be taken into account

157
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:46,400
in strengthening resilience.

158
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,127
It illustrates the interrelationships
between communities' well-being

159
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:55,168
and local drivers of risk, 
national and global trends--

160
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,230
which contribute to uncertainty--

161
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,149
and the influence of
the governance environment.

162
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:03,890
Its purpose is to aid practical analysis

163
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,142
in order to identify key issues
and priorities to be addressed

164
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:10,350
in order to strengthen resilience.

165
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,583
Measuring resilience is important
for tracking performance,

166
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,221
and understanding impacts.

167
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:20,281
Tools to measure resilience
are still in their early stages,

168
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:23,703
and there is currently 
little consensus on best practice.

169
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:27,493
The main reason is the complexity
of a systems approach

170
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:30,177
that leads to a large number 
of diverse elements

171
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:32,163
that lead to a number of questions.

172
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,225
At what stage is measurement appropriate?

173
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:39,895
Do we measure resilience before,
or only when a disaster occurs?

174
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:44,556
Practical Action and the Zurich 
Global Flood Resilience Program

175
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:46,435
use an approach to measure resilience

176
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:49,165
based on the five capitals of a community.

177
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:54,876
Namely, the human, social, natural,
physical, and financial capital.

178
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:58,225
This is an example 
of a spider web diagram

179
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:01,277
of two communities 
scored on the five capitals.

180
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:04,407
It remains challenging 
to quantify these scores,

181
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,754
as each capital embraces
a wide range of elements.

182
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,620
Furthermore, it will be important 
to understand the interactions

183
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,200
between the different elements.

184
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,811
For example, how do social assets
influence access to specific resources?

185
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:23,449
It is hoped that ultimately
through this standardized approach,

186
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:26,189
we will understand how capitals interact,

187
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:29,439
and how this knowledge 
can be used to enhance resilience.

188
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:33,972
Another organization that has developed
concrete how-to guidelines,

189
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:38,302
is the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, OECD.

190
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:43,332
OECD has published the <i>Guidelines
for Resilience Systems Analysis:</i>

191
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:46,794
<i>How to analyze risk 
and build a roadmap to resilience,</i>

192
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:51,143
that contains a specific methodology
towards building resilience.

193
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:54,483
You can find it in the additional 
materials section.

194
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,743
Some challenges remain.

195
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:59,414
For instance, we are only 
in the beginning of knowing

196
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:01,655
how to effectively measure resilience.

197
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:06,095
Furthermore, we systematically 
require disaggregated data

198
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:10,045
on gender, social norms, 
and levels of asset ownership,

199
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,917
in order to build resilience 
from the most vulnerable upwards.

200
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:18,257
Finally, we need more knowledge 
on decision-making mechanisms

201
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:22,025
as it can be very difficult 
to make the right trade-offs.

202
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:25,613
In this video we have seen
that DRR can be an engine

203
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:27,397
for sustainable development.

204
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:32,417
DRR and development are closely related,
and we need to integrate DRR

205
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:36,357
with equitable, sustainable,
and resilient development.

206
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:39,919
We need to find out how development
can be transformed

207
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,509
from a root cause of disaster risk
to an opportunity for reducing risk.

208
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:48,368
Practical Action has developed 
an analytical framework

209
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:51,930
that can help us to adopt approaches
that can support the transition

210
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,270
from vulnerability to resilience,

211
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,721
and ultimately lead to 
more resilient communities,

212
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:59,900
and a more resilient future.
