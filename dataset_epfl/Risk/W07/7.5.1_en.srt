Hi, in this video Emily Eros
from the American Red Cross

2
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:11,634
is talking about the ways to make
the use of technology more sustainable

3
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:16,034
in the context of the Missing Map Project
that you saw in Chapter 2.

4
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:18,944
So, we go to different countries,
we train people,

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,843
we leave technology behind,

6
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:26,048
but when there's not a continued presence,
and say we just did a two week trip,

7
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:31,000
it's hard to expect people to keep mapping
and keep engaged after the fact.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,377
So right now we're doing our biggest
project to date in the border areas

9
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:37,086
of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

10
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:39,923
We're mapping all the communities
within 15 kilometers

11
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:41,566
of that international border,

12
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:44,520
and that works out to be an area
about the size of Switzerland,

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,278
so there's thousands of communities,

14
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:48,860
we have over a hundred
volunteers traveling into them,

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,740
and because it's such a large project
we wanted to think about

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,833
how we can provide some more
support to that locally.

17
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:58,583
And also how can we try to do something
more sustainable than just coming in,

18
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,867
bringing technology, doing mapping,
and then leaving again.

19
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:04,847
So we've built what we call a hub,
in GuÃ©ckÃ©dou, Guinea,

20
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:09,219
and it's a physical office space,
staffed with three local staff,

21
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:11,902
five actually, local staff, 
and an expat,

22
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:16,222
and they do community presentations,
they do basic computer skills training,

23
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:19,703
and other ways that they can use
technology to really just give back,

24
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:24,203
and they're also our basis that we use
to operate the mapping project.

25
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:28,188
So this is an attempt for us
to kind of have a local presence

26
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,718
where we can engage with the community
in a longer term kind of way,

27
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:35,349
and also engage with other organizations
and the government on the ground

28
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:39,609
so that we can have a two-way dialogue
and try to make the data more useful.

29
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,804
Focusing on making
the data more useful.

30
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:46,239
So we do produce maps, 
we do share them with the Red Cross,

31
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,851
but we want to look for other local
partners who are able to make use of data

32
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:52,081
and make sure that they know it exists.
