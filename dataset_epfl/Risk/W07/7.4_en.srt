00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:06,565
Hello. In this video I will talk

2
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:09,557
about the need for gender equality in DRR.

3
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:13,404
Gender equality is 
an international legal obligation

4
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,147
anchored in human rights.

5
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:18,465
Women are especially 
hard-hit by disasters,

6
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:22,147
and gender equality 
and strengthening the role of women

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:26,468
are crucial in DRR, and for sustainable 
development in general.

8
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:29,678
In this video we will focus on the need

9
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,467
to use a gender lens 
in all aspects of DRR,

10
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,969
from governance, to early warning systems,

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,209
to post-disaster reconstruction.

12
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:42,891
Unfortunately, women are more at risk
of being affected by disasters

13
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:44,389
and their effects.

14
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:48,570
For example, during the 1991 
cyclone in Bangladesh,

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,540
within the age group of 20 to 44 years,

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,342
the female death rate was 71 per 1,000

17
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:58,361
compared to 15 per 1,000 for men.

18
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:03,534
In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami
killed four times more women than men.

19
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:07,274
We need to foster initiatives 
that support women and girls'

20
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:10,774
access to and use 
of science and technology in DRR.

21
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:14,383
The Sendai framework states
in paragraph 35 a:

22
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:18,456
"Women and their participation
are critical to effectively manage

23
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:22,183
disaster risk and designing, resourcing

24
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:26,496
and implementing gender-sensitive 
disaster risk reduction policies..."

25
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:28,757
The Sendai framework further states

26
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:31,528
that "adequate capacity building measures

27
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:35,160
need to be taken to empower women
for preparedness

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,347
as well as to build their capacity 
to secure alternate means of livelihood

29
00:01:40,347 --> 00:01:42,487
in post-disaster situations."

30
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:45,621
We need to make sure that women and girls

31
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:49,068
in disaster affected communities
are adequately served

32
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:52,059
by developments
within science and technology,

33
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:55,270
in order to increase 
their awareness of disaster risks,

34
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,963
and therefore reduce the risks 
associated with disasters.

35
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:02,431
This basically means that if our intention

36
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:06,751
is to save lives and reduce 
material damage to DRR,

37
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:11,093
then women need to be 
key stakeholders in any DRR activity.

38
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,754
All too often, the views 
and priorities of women and girls

39
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:18,892
are not included in science 
and technology policy.

40
00:02:18,892 --> 00:02:22,934
This is due to a number of factors
including education levels,

41
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:27,004
cultural issues, poverty, 
and political hurdles.

42
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:29,567
Women face many discriminations.

43
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,827
For instance, in education, 
healthcare, employment,

44
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:35,216
and control of land and property.

45
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,577
These are key underlying drivers
that make women more vulnerable

46
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,837
in crisis and post-disaster situations.

47
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:47,786
Women and girls are more likely
to suffer from increased poverty,

48
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:50,168
higher rates of sexual violence,

49
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:53,969
and lack adequate housing
in the aftermath of a disaster.

50
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,269
For effective disaster risk reduction,

51
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,230
we need to ensure that women and girls

52
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,820
are involved in disaster risk reduction
science and research.

53
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,141
For instance, in DRR research

54
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:08,639
we need data that is 
gender-differentiated,

55
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,240
in order to identify effective solutions.

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,360
Robust information on the gender dimension

57
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,892
at <i>every</i> stage of disaster risk reduction,

58
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:21,513
will allow for gender-specific 
DRR measures that are more effective.

59
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:24,692
Women are affected 
differently by disasters.

60
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:27,095
For instance, the education level of women

61
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:29,855
can affect them 
at several stages of a disaster.

62
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:32,764
They might not be able to read information

63
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:36,462
regarding early warning systems,
or how to access aid,

64
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:39,806
or aid might be tied to land titles,

65
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:42,234
which are usually 
in the name of their husbands.

66
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:44,715
Women are also often in the house,

67
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,765
and therefore, they are more affected

68
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:49,558
when a disaster, such as 
an earthquake, happens.

69
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:53,750
On the positive side, women might 
be able to take on stronger roles

70
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,377
during reconstruction phases,
and address their own needs.

71
00:03:58,017 --> 00:04:00,098
Reconstruction after disasters

72
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:02,906
can also offer 
other opportunities for women.

73
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:07,288
For instance, Nepal has a very high 
rate of male out-migration.

74
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:11,209
The absence of husbands, 
or other male family members,

75
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,418
can lead to more autonomy 
and decision-making power for women.

76
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:20,190
Reconstruction can also offer
income-generating activities for women.

77
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,134
For instance, building back better
with a gender perspective

78
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:26,540
can mean not only 
more robust construction,

79
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,429
but also building houses 
that reduce the drudgery of women.

80
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:33,744
For instance, by integrating 
water storage facilities,

81
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,783
or more efficient cook stoves.

82
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:39,504
This in turn can free up time
for girls to attend school.

83
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:42,703
However, in order for this to happen,

84
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:44,744
it is crucial that women have access

85
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:48,345
to financial, social, 
and technical resources.

86
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:53,559
DRR research needs to pay
particular attention to what women need.

87
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:57,344
For instance, access to water 
close to the house,

88
00:04:57,344 --> 00:05:00,796
a common safe shelter,
or lighting through solar power.

89
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:04,479
In order to mainstream gender
in DRR activities,

90
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,040
we need a systematic approach

91
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,098
to capture contexts 
from a gender perspective,

92
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:13,306
and to align DRR technology
with the aim to use interventions

93
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:15,448
to promote gender equality,

94
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,640
or at least to avoid exacerbating
existing asymmetries.

95
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,709
Mainstreaming gender is a strategy
to achieve gender equality.

96
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,860
It means recognizing that women and men

97
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,360
often have different needs and priorities,

98
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,231
face different constraints,

99
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,851
and contribute differently to development.

100
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,452
Practical actions to be taken
can include the development

101
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:41,321
of a curriculum in an education initiative

102
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:43,063
that is gender conscious,

103
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:46,582
and makes sure that training courses
are organized at a time

104
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:48,452
that allows women to attend.

105
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:51,671
It is crucial to enable women
to influence the direction

106
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:54,415
of scientific and technological 
breakthroughs.

107
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:59,596
Therefore, we need research that focuses
on drivers of gender inequality,

108
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:03,976
and identifying mitigation measures
that ensure equal access

109
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:07,776
and control rights to resources
in disaster contexts.

110
00:06:08,396 --> 00:06:12,308
In this video we have seen 
that women and girls are more at risk

111
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:14,437
of being affected by disasters.

112
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:16,646
We need to foster initiatives

113
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,768
that increase the participation
of women in DRR,

114
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:24,196
in order to achieve DRR targets
at the national and global levels.

115
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:29,069
Gender mainstreaming implies
that DRR actors and institutions

116
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:32,138
incorporate a gender equality perspective

117
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:35,800
in the way they work, 
as well as in all their policies,

118
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,971
programs, and technologies.

119
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:42,941
We have seen that DRR can also provide
opportunities for women

120
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:47,361
to take on leadership roles,
and thereby increase gender equality.
