00:00:04,191 --> 00:00:06,801
Hi. Ambassador Manuel Bessler,

2
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:09,671
Vice Director, delegate 
for humanitarian aid,

3
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:12,981
and head of the Swiss
Humanitarian Aid Unit.

4
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:16,932
During his career, Ambassador Bessler
worked for the ICRC,

5
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:19,282
the United Nations Protection Force,

6
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:22,422
and the Office for the Coordination
of Humanitarian Affairs

7
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,471
of the United Nations.

8
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:26,113
During this interview,

9
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,742
Ambassador Bessler will tell us

10
00:00:27,742 --> 00:00:31,933
about why DRR
is an essential requirement for SDC

11
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,943
and what types of cooperation
Switzerland has

12
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:38,082
in the field of science 
and technology for DRR.

13
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:47,434
For the Swiss humanitarian aid,

14
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:50,544
it is very important to prepare...

15
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:52,844
to prepare for what is coming,

16
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,855
to prepare for disasters
because we will have a next earthquake,

17
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:59,873
we will have a next drought or flooding.

18
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:05,084
And we even know where most probably
this next disaster will happen,

19
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:06,866
so why don't we prepare?

20
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,676
Why don't we build the dams 
higher or stronger

21
00:01:09,676 --> 00:01:12,618
or the building resistant to earthquake?

22
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:16,397
In this sense, it's not only cheaper

23
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:19,292
to invest in disaster risk reduction,

24
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:21,533
it's also the right thing to do.

25
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:39,316
Well, we do invest about one-sixth
of our budget in prevention

26
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:44,236
and this goes 
from very technical cooperation

27
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:46,615
to strategic projects.

28
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:51,756
Disaster risk reduction
has a technical component,

29
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:55,884
be it radar alarm system,

30
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:57,906
be it satellite imagery,

31
00:01:57,906 --> 00:02:01,475
be it telecommunication.

32
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:05,687
In order to limit the impact of disaster, 
you have to know them,

33
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:07,386
you have to know the risks,

34
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:10,606
you have to know 
where flooding will strike,

35
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:14,006
or where are the fault lines
for a potential earthquake.

36
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:20,258
So risk mapping is something 
very essential to an effective DRR.

37
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:24,718
In this sense, you need technology.

38
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:28,911
For this you have to know 
where are the weak points,

39
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:32,939
and there, we have very concrete examples.

40
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:36,978
For instance, the sensoring 
of water levels of rivers--

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,950
that they can then give 
the alert to downstream communities

42
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,471
to evacuate in order to prevent disaster.

43
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:50,411
We have risk maps of avalanches,

44
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:52,781
of potential landslides.

45
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:55,881
For instance, in Armenia we had

46
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:59,042
very successful cooperation
with the authorities

47
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:03,862
in order to prevent residential buildings

48
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:08,654
in landslide-exposed areas.

49
00:03:09,654 --> 00:03:12,503
So there, technology is key.

50
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:16,697
And there, obviously, 
we have to reach out to partners.

51
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:20,895
We need the expertise 
and the experience from universities,

52
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:25,643
from Center of Competences 
to help us in order to prepare.

53
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:40,584
Look, the main thing is disaster,
destroy, development gains

54
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:46,877
and with DRR you protect development.

55
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:51,703
In this sense, you help reach
sustainable development goals

56
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:54,197
so DRR and SDGs are very closely linked.

57
00:03:55,197 --> 00:04:00,887
And to improve this, to protect this link,

58
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:03,570
we have to invest more and more in DRR.
