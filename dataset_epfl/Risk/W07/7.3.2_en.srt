00:00:04,887 --> 00:00:08,288
Hi. We interviewed Silvia Peppoloni,

2
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:12,670
Research geologist at the Italian Institute
of Geophysics and Volcanology,

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,689
and furthermore,
she is Secretary-General

4
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:19,570
of the International Association
for Promoting Geoethics.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,626
In addition to defining geoethics,

6
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:24,661
she will talk about
the role and responsibility

7
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,971
of the risk specialist towards society.

8
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:31,632
Furthermore, she will talk about
the role citizens can play

9
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,783
in science and technology
for disaster risk reduction.

10
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:39,064
Geoethics consists
of research and reflection

11
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:43,014
on the values which underpin
appropriate behaviors and practices

12
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:47,415
wherever human activities interact
with the geosphere.

13
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:51,475
It deals with the ethical, social
and cultural implications

14
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:56,596
of using earth sciences
for societal benefit.

15
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:59,537
On the one hand,
it represents an opportunity

16
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:02,957
for geoscientists
to reconsider their activities

17
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:05,287
in an ethical perspective.

18
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:07,888
On the other hand, it is a tool

19
00:01:07,888 --> 00:01:11,588
for increasing the awareness
of our society as a whole

20
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:17,641
on problems regarding georesearch,
geoenvironment, and geohazards.

21
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:20,761
Among the fundamental issues
of geoethics,

22
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:23,781
there are problems related 
to the management

23
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:26,781
and mitigation of georisks,

24
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:30,403
and to the information
provided to the public.

25
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:33,741
In the field 
of the disaster risk reduction,

26
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:38,623
geoethics fosters the proper
and correct dissemination

27
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:41,794
of the results of scientific studies,

28
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:47,046
develops and promotes
geoeducational tools for the population,

29
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:50,206
aims to improve the relationships

30
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:54,365
between the scientific community
and the other components

31
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,827
of the society during
all the different phases

32
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:00,977
that characterize the disaster cycle.

33
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:07,026
The values of reference are many:

34
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,763
ability, individual
and joint responsibility,

35
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,754
collaborative attitude,

36
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:16,100
reliability, transparency, solidarity,

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,370
non-discrimination,
impartiality, and so on.

38
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,881
These are values able to allow scientists

39
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:27,072
to develop a good science.

40
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:31,343
And making good science
is the prerequisite

41
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:36,293
in the strategy for an effective
disaster risk reduction.

42
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:38,353
But it is not sufficient.

43
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:42,394
In order to increase the resilience
of the community

44
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:46,615
scientists have to work
so that other values

45
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:51,747
such as prevention, safety,
sustainability, education,

46
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:54,932
take root into society.

47
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:57,227
The culture of emergency

48
00:02:57,227 --> 00:03:01,447
must be replaced
with a culture of prevention.

49
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:06,379
And this should happen
not only in view of cost-savings,

50
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,229
not only in economic terms.

51
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:12,270
Prevention must be intended mainly

52
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,996
as a social and cultural attitude

53
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:22,153
that gives its fruits in a short-, medium-
and long-term perspective.

54
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:25,673
Not investing in prevention

55
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:28,702
means to transfer irresponsibly

56
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:32,143
the social and economic costs of disaster

57
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:35,684
on the shoulders of future generations.

58
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:39,754
In this perspective, geoethics
for disaster risk reduction

59
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:44,016
may be the foundation
on which to establish

60
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,725
a new and profitable relationship

61
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:50,616
between science and society

62
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:54,257
by recalling geoscientists
to their duties

63
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:58,197
of increasing
their scientific preparedness,

64
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:02,355
and following ethical principles
in their activities.

65
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:07,019
The responsibility of the risk experts
towards society are many.

66
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,320
The defense against natural risks
involves many actors,

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,860
not only geoscientists
but also the decision-makers,

68
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,211
local authorities, government agencies,

69
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,351
mass media, citizens.

70
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:25,502
All these actors form a defense system

71
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:28,214
that have to act with a common goal

72
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:30,494
and in the same direction.

73
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:34,664
Each of them with a specific role
and responsibility

74
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:37,855
in relation to an impending risk.

75
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:40,164
A proper georisk management

76
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:45,075
requires that each role
is well-defined and governed

77
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:48,396
by shared operational protocols,

78
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:51,397
especially during the emergency phase,

79
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:54,787
so that overlapping and misunderstanding

80
00:04:54,787 --> 00:05:00,768
don't jeopardize population safety
and economic activities.

81
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:05,549
Taking into consideration
geoethical aspects related to georisks,

82
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:09,541
can be helpful
to make geoscientists more aware

83
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:13,276
of their responsibilities towards society

84
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:16,250
and to clarify the role they can play

85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,241
in the interaction with other actors,

86
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:25,648
aiming at more effective actions
for georisks mitigation.

87
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:29,062
Unfortunately, often we as geoscientists

88
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,413
do not pay sufficient attention
to the science communication

89
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:38,614
and we don't succeed in making
the population able to understand

90
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:42,705
the scientific and technical language.

91
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:46,635
It is also important that models we use

92
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:49,397
for studying risk scenarios,

93
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:53,917
are well-grounded on observational data,

94
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:58,669
including clear indications
of their uncertainties.

95
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,508
And before releasing,

96
00:06:00,508 --> 00:06:05,759
these models should be discussed
within the scientific community.

97
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,490
This can bring also to strengthen
the social credibility of scientists.

98
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,372
Roles and fields of action

99
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:17,432
of all these actors

100
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:21,893
should be based
on clear protocols and procedures

101
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:25,213
to be followed in risk management

102
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:30,004
in order to improve
the relationships among them.

103
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:35,203
Experts can support society
in the defense against georisks

104
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:38,585
by developing educational strategies,

105
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:41,314
by disseminating scientific knowledge,

106
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:45,907
by transferring appropriate
and timely information

107
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:51,138
on risk scenarios 
and consequences of unpreparedness.

108
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:54,997
Disasters always scare the population.

109
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,149
The fear cannot be eliminated,

110
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:00,609
but the proper dissemination
of scientific knowledge

111
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:03,549
and the adequate preparedness

112
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:08,680
can help to better
face the fear of the disaster,

113
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,621
and to better react
for minimizing damages.

114
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:16,662
Geoscientists possess the proper knowledge

115
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:20,332
for bringing science closer to society.

116
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:24,084
It's their task to make society aware

117
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:28,663
that science cannot be the solution
to all our problems,

118
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:32,484
but it can give us helpful tools

119
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,575
to defend our lives

120
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:40,295
although it is accompanied
by a certain level of uncertainty.

121
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:47,228
In fact, the value of science exists also
in the awareness of its limits.

122
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:53,309
For sure, experts should make the results
of their studies public,

123
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,938
open-access and user-friendly,

124
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:59,970
with explanatory information
targeted to the population,

125
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,411
with a clear distinction

126
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:07,161
between observations
and working hypotheses.

127
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:11,802
Experts should transfer
advanced knowledge and technology

128
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:15,933
to different
disaster risk reduction actors,

129
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:19,143
such as industry and authorities.

130
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:20,904
They should participate

131
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:23,904
in educational campaigns 
for the population,

132
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:27,804
paying attention to simplify concepts

133
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:31,146
without making them banal.

134
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:33,826
They should increase the synergy

135
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:37,636
with government agency
and local administrations

136
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:41,047
through the development
of operational protocols,

137
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:44,808
and the definition
of an encoded stream of information

138
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:48,608
from the scientific community
to the authorities.

139
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:54,839
Experts should assure
their ongoing professional training.

140
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:57,868
They should collaborate

141
00:08:57,868 --> 00:09:02,358
in the training of the skills
of technicians and professionals.

142
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:05,161
They should conduct their studies,

143
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,261
verifying source of information,

144
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:12,193
adherence of results to observations,

145
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:15,313
and related uncertainties and errors.

146
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:19,053
They should accept a fair debate

147
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:23,124
with hypotheses 
and theories that disagree,

148
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:27,544
without being overconfident
in their own results.

149
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:31,286
And, finally, they have to develop

150
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:35,868
a multidisciplinary approach
to the problems.

151
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,469
Citizens have the legitimate right

152
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:42,200
to demand actions
in defense of their safety

153
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,101
and to be properly informed about risks.

154
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:50,501
In fact, in general,
they are poorly prepared in science,

155
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:55,120
especially regarding
the concept of probability, for example.

156
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,432
But in general they are considered
as passive actors in a risk scenario.

157
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:05,273
While they can play a key role,

158
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:09,234
certainly they have 
to be put in the condition

159
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,834
to contribute constructively
to their own safety.

160
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:18,969
The activities relative 
to the new concept of citizen science

161
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:22,009
are developed with this goal:

162
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,382
to improve the resilience of a community.

163
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:31,874
Starting from the idea that the knowledge 
is not a one-way road,

164
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:34,104
there is a new attention

165
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:38,645
to the contribution that citizens
can also give to scientists,

166
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:42,195
providing them with precious insights

167
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:46,027
that would otherwise have been overlooked.

168
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:50,658
Often scientific projects
involve volunteers

169
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:55,579
for observations, measurements,
computation, and so on.

170
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,752
Just as an example,
regarding the seismic events,

171
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:02,630
some tools have been carried out

172
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,791
for involving citizens

173
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:09,643
and using them 
as a primary source of information.

174
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:14,492
There are online macro-seismic
questionnaires for citizens

175
00:11:14,492 --> 00:11:16,892
available in different languages,

176
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:20,694
through which it is possible
to collect information

177
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,943
on an occurred earthquake.

178
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:26,081
And this is helpful for the scientists

179
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:30,576
to better develop actions
for the risk management,

180
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:34,616
and even to obtain valuable testimonies

181
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:37,656
on the earthquakes in themselves,

182
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:42,648
especially for those events
that are, by nature, transitory.

183
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:49,308
When they occur, usually no scientist 
is on the spot, ready to record them,

184
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,103
but local people are there

185
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:56,660
and so can have the ability
to help in this direction.

186
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,839
These examples clearly illustrate

187
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,749
the ethical aspects mentioned before,

188
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:06,561
such as the collaborative attitude,

189
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:09,151
and the joint responsibility.

190
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:13,482
Moreover, they bring the discussion
on elements such as transparency,

191
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:18,231
ownership, reliability,
and management of data.

192
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:23,137
If society is not sufficiently involved
in the scientific knowledge,

193
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:27,297
we could have two main
negative consequences.

194
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:32,188
The first is the cultural 
and social marginalization of scientists

195
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:35,458
with the loss of a sense
of the role they can play

196
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,852
in protecting society
from natural hazards.

197
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:42,522
And the second one
is the tendency of people

198
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:45,523
to lose confidence in science.

199
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:48,534
Without a society scientifically prepared,

200
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:53,344
it is not possible, in my opinion,
to develop risk reduction tools

201
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:56,646
really effective and widespread,

202
00:12:56,646 --> 00:12:59,955
and as a consequence,
to obtain an improvement

203
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:03,685
of the resilience of a human community.

204
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:07,217
These improvements can be surely fostered

205
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:12,687
by including geoethics in the strategies
for disaster risk reduction.
