00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:08,384
Hello. In this video,
we will present the general principles

2
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:11,134
on ethics and disaster 
risk reduction.

3
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:14,311
We will look at ethics 
during different DRR phases,

4
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:19,000
and finally, the ethical use 
of science and technology in DRR.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,474
Ethics entails that decisions are taken
to foster the well-being

6
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:25,671
of people, communities 
and the environment

7
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:27,978
as well as to reduce risks.

8
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:31,087
The respect of human rights 
is at the center of ethics

9
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:32,605
in the field of DRR.

10
00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:36,606
Other general ethical principles 
in disaster risk reduction

11
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:41,218
include that people and countries 
should be united in solidarity

12
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:45,023
to share the costs of disasters
but also the advantages

13
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:46,975
of reduction measures.

14
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:50,846
All parties including authorities,
private sector,

15
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:55,584
NGOs and individuals, and media
also share the responsibility

16
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:58,282
to prevent and respond
to disasters.

17
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:02,526
Prevention, preparedness, 
response and recovery

18
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:05,607
should be implemented 
without discrimination.

19
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,177
Principles of humanity--
that is to say,

20
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:11,159
respect, tolerance and compassion--

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,845
should be applied
in any disaster situation.

22
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,337
Likewise, impartiality,
and avoidance of favoritism

23
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:21,573
should be respected 
at any stages of DRR.

24
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:23,909
Neutrality is also important.

25
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,895
Political, racial, religious 
or ideological debates

26
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:30,474
should not take place in DRR activities.

27
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:34,966
Resilience is also a matter 
of cooperation between nations.

28
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:38,467
They must protect the local communities, 
but also the foreigners

29
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:42,094
that are present on their territory 
when a disaster occurs.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,194
As we mentioned before, 
ethics should be applied

31
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:48,206
at any stage of DRR.

32
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:52,586
Prior to disasters, people have,
for example, the right to be informed,

33
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:56,157
to express themselves freely,
and most importantly,

34
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,364
to participate in decision making.

35
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:03,264
Specific measures aimed at supporting 
the most vulnerable communities

36
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:06,394
and people, 
should be implemented as well.

37
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:10,196
During disasters, 
participation in decision making

38
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:14,868
remains a key ethical principle 
as it is at any stage of DRR.

39
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:19,664
Furthermore, anyone should be able 
to benefit from humanitarian assistance

40
00:02:19,664 --> 00:02:21,336
in the respect of dignity.

41
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:27,406
After disasters, an ethical approach means
that reconstruction should be quick,

42
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:30,504
but not to the detriment
of the environment and safety.

43
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:34,285
During this phase, 
the protection of economic,

44
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:39,999
social, cultural, but also civil 
and political rights, must be ensured.

45
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,557
Throughout this course, 
we have seen the importance

46
00:02:43,557 --> 00:02:46,713
of science and technology 
for DRR, however,

47
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:49,839
Technology has also created
a number of new,

48
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:52,572
or has widened existing inequalities,

49
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,925
and I think that's something 
that we need to take

50
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,551
very much into consideration
when we start thinking

51
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:59,530
and when we use technologies
for disaster response

52
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,903
and disaster management.

53
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:04,325
One example of reducing 
technology-related inequalities

54
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:05,879
is digital inclusion.

55
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:11,246
Digital inclusion is a term
that is now used more and more often

56
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:16,230
to say that it's very important 
that people living

57
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,270
in areas where they have no access 
to digital technologies,

58
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,687
that they should be included.

59
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:26,857
That they get access
to digital technologies,

60
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,902
so that there is, for example, 
mobile coverage

61
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:30,673
or that they can buy a mobile phone,

62
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:34,373
but it goes beyond
just having access to the technologies.

63
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:37,560
It goes also into the direction 
of that people

64
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,339
understand how to use 
this technology.

65
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:43,078
That they know what type 
of mobile services are available to them

66
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:45,069
and that they can afford it.

67
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:49,182
So if all those aspects are covered 
then we can say

68
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:52,451
a community is really 
digitally included.

69
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:56,524
And then they can benefit 
from those digital technologies.

70
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:59,413
In addition to inequalities, 
science and technology

71
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:02,291
can cause physical harm 
and have negative effects

72
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,558
on rights, dignity 
and relationships.

73
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:08,713
The use of science
and technology for DRR,

74
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:11,541
needs to be evaluated 
in the light of ethics

75
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,693
and the risk assessment 
should be conducted

76
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:17,513
to ensure the do-no-harm principle.

77
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:21,238
One way to ensure this
is to develop codes of conducts.

78
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,999
These are sets of rules 
that should be followed

79
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,248
regarding the use of technology.

80
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:30,263
Andrew Shroeder explains this 
in the context of UAVs.

81
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:33,613
Countries throughout the world 
have been attempting

82
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:38,552
to create rule structures 
for what counts as an appropriate

83
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:43,327
and legal use of UAV technology 
and they are usually based

84
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:46,142
on the flight rules 
of commercial aircrafts

85
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:49,079
but UAVs obviously 
have special conditions.

86
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,606
They're smaller, 
they do not have a pilot aboard,

87
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:56,374
they can be piloted 
by any number of people.

88
00:04:56,374 --> 00:05:01,560
As they get more automated,
they are getting out into the hands

89
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,719
of people that have no previous 
experience with flight,

90
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:12,870
and so that means that those rule systems
are being constantly adapted and changed.

91
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:18,710
We, at UAViators helped develop 
a code of conduct in consultation

92
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,809
with agencies throughout the UN system, 
NGOs and a number of other people

93
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:30,509
that work in humanitarian response,
to be able to identify

94
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:34,522
the key regulatory challenges, 
the key ethical challenges,

95
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:35,967
the key safety challenges,

96
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:41,277
that are faced by people operating UAVs
in emergency contexts.

97
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:47,573
UAVs are getting to be so easy to operate 
that people no longer think of them

98
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:50,807
as dangerous tools.

99
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:55,305
They think of them as either, 
you know, like your laptop,

100
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:57,595
like a computer that anybody 
can operate.

101
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:04,031
And this is a benefit because it expands, 
it democratizes, the reach,

102
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,047
it also means that people forget
that it's something

103
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:12,257
that you can really hurt someone with
if it's operated incorrectly.

104
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:14,814
If things go wrong, 
how do you respond to it.

105
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,760
So that becomes quite important 
to think through.

106
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,427
In addition to develop 
and follow codes of conduct in scientific

107
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:25,494
and technological applications
for DRR,

108
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:29,491
other principles, summarized by UNESCO,
should also be followed.

109
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,026
Integrity and responsibility 
in research and innovation

110
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:38,209
means that honesty and accountability 
have to be respected

111
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:42,064
as well as the fairness 
in working with others.

112
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:45,752
As science and technology have impacts 
on human well-being,

113
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:48,957
the participation of all segments 
of society,

114
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:51,311
as well as their consultation 
in the conduct

115
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,725
of science and technology development,
should be pursued.

116
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,970
Science and technology 
should not threaten local,

117
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,257
indigenous, 
and traditional knowledge.

118
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:06,024
Moreover, fully open access
science and technology

119
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:09,008
should be favored 
for the benefit of all.

120
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:12,171
In this video, we have seen 
that many ethical principles

121
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:15,416
should be used in the conduct
of disaster risk reduction.

122
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,191
We have seen 
that science and technology for DRR

123
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,808
should cause no harm,

124
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,789
and the codes of conduct 
should be followed.

125
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:28,350
We have to base our actions and decisions 
on general ethical principles

126
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,736
for science and technology 
in order to ensure this.
