00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,064
Hi. In this video 
Professor David Bresch from ETH-Z

2
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:10,635
will talk about insurance and reinsurance

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,667
in the context of disaster risk reduction.

4
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:18,955
So insurance, in essence, 
puts a price tag on risk.

5
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:21,861
It means it does bring risk transparencies

6
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:25,534
so with that it helps people
better understand the risk

7
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:28,420
and it also helps them, obviously,
to share some of that risk.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,190
That's what the insurance market 
is all about.

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,709
Insurance therefore builds very strongly
on the concept of trust,

10
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:39,313
of mutual trust, of those 
who pay a premium now

11
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:43,319
in order to be indemnified 
in case of a large catastrophe

12
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:45,313
some time in the future.

13
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:50,552
Or if luck prevails, 
they never have to get compensated

14
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:52,974
and that's why the premium 
is normally quite low

15
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:56,640
compared to other means of dealing with
natural catastrophes,

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,180
especially compared to 
waiting until things happen

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,883
and then try to sort it all out.

18
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:05,673
But honestly, insurance 
doesn't operate in a vacuum.

19
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:10,066
So if risks are too high,
if they're too frequently happening

20
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,843
people are not prepared at all

21
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:16,904
and if the consequence of a catastrophe 
hitting a place is tremendous,

22
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:19,361
insurance comes to its limits, obviously.

23
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:21,530
This price tag mechanism,

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,723
in the sense that if prevention 
to a right level is in place

25
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:29,916
then it lowers the price for insurance
and at the same time

26
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,998
then insurance is a very effective means

27
00:01:31,998 --> 00:01:36,977
to cope with the financial consequences
of natural catastrophes, for example.

28
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:39,176
It does not help in other dimensions.

29
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:42,784
So it doesn't protect people 
from being affected.

30
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:46,080
It also doesn't protect directly
their livelihoods.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,974
It only helps them 
getting back on their feet

32
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:52,266
after an event 
on the financial dimension of things.

33
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:55,080
And that's very important 
to keep that in mind

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,581
and only see 
that insurance has a role to play

35
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:00,337
but it doesn't play this role in isolation.

36
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:06,069
So insurance as a mechanism
builds on the concept of insurability.

37
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,389
One I mentioned already--

38
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:11,699
there need to be many 
similarly exposed risks

39
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,062
such that the law
of large numbers is playing

40
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:16,036
and the statistics are kind of performing

41
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:20,324
in a sense that if you want to insure
one single individual and nobody else

42
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:23,983
it's much harder to figure how that
exactly should all play out,

43
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:26,787
than if thousands of people 
similarly exposed--

44
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:30,834
say, all of them exposed 
to some extent to hurricanes,

45
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:35,030
tropical cyclone or cyclones 
depending on what part of the planet-- typhoons--

46
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,042
what part of the planet you are--

47
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:39,043
then you basically have 
that law of large numbers,

48
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:41,714
which means it's easier 
to also assess risk.

49
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:47,573
So number two in reinsurance and insurance
is the ability to quantify risk

50
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:50,383
because otherwise it's very hard 
to figure what the premium might be

51
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,612
and what the financial arrangement 
should look like

52
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:56,904
in order to deal with 
that type of a catastrophe.

53
00:02:56,904 --> 00:03:00,433
So number two 
is the assessibility of risk.

54
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,742
Can it be quantified?

55
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:04,683
Can there be ultimately 
put a price tag to things?

56
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:07,823
We use-- and we might come to that
in a second-- a lot of models

57
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:11,393
to determine this kind of the equation.

58
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:14,834
And then absolutely important,
absolutely key for insurance

59
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:19,306
is that the risk 
needs to happen by chance.

60
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:24,217
If the insured can influence the outcome,
there's no alignment of interest,

61
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:27,944
then you could basically insure 
with-- trigger, say, a fire,

62
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:31,688
the building burns down,
and he gets a cheap way to rebuild.

63
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:36,987
So you have to put measures in place
such that neither the insured

64
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:42,527
nor the insurer can influence the outcome
or trigger the insured event.

65
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:44,830
And the last one is commercial liability,

66
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,296
again, for both sides.

67
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:50,268
You can, in essence, insure things 
that happen more than once a year.

68
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:52,696
It's just very costly to do so.

69
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:56,748
And then the ability and the willingness 
to pay for the insured,

70
00:03:56,748 --> 00:03:59,939
those who are seeking insurance
might be a bit limited, so frankly

71
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,541
it's just commercially 
not attractive to do so.

72
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,671
And on the other hand,

73
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,268
if people are not willing to pay
anything for insurance

74
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:09,539
then it's very hard to operate 
for the insurance company

75
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,547
because they do need 
the commensurate means

76
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,225
in order to pay claims.

77
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:15,795
There are different forms of insurance.

78
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:20,540
You can either insure things 
once they have happened,

79
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,243
in a sense that you indemnify people
for their damages.

80
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:31,457
Or you can also not directly 
compensate them for their loss or damage,

81
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:34,571
you can also pre-arrange 
just an amount of money

82
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:37,313
you're going to pay after an event.

83
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:39,213
You often have that in life insurance

84
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,353
where there is, 
if there are calamities in life

85
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:46,174
it's a lump sum you get if, say, 
somebody in your family dies.

86
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,632
And also in the natural 
catastrophe insurance

87
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:51,574
there's what we call parametric insurance
where you would say

88
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:57,063
"We measure the intensity of a storm
and if that storm is a heavy storm

89
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:01,258
you're entitled to so many dollars 
of compensation."

90
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:05,805
It's an easier arrangement, in a sense,

91
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:10,104
you do not need to wait 
to adjust the damage, the claim,

92
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,546
to the exact location 
and how it played out

93
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,315
and people have to reconstruct.

94
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,479
In that sense, it pays more immediately.

95
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,140
Fast payment, easy in execution.

96
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,210
The problem is, it could also be 
you have bigger damage at your home

97
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,337
than what you are entitled to receive.

98
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:28,937
So what we call basis risk--
the difference then between

99
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:34,087
your amount you're entitled to get
and your incurred damage.

100
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:36,817
And so that's an element 
in parametric insurance

101
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:38,654
people should be aware of.

102
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:45,037
But often the speed to execution
and the easy arrangements around that

103
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:48,381
do play in favor of parametric insurance.

104
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,087
Not so much-- and then we come to
to who gets insured--

105
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,270
not so much for the single individual

106
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,077
because you, if you own only one home

107
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:59,367
you very likely 
would like to get compensated

108
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,030
to be able to rebuild.

109
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,502
And if then by chance, 
the hurricane wasn't that strong

110
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:08,023
at your doorstep, and you get only 
half the compensation,

111
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:11,770
in the parametric sense,
that's not very much helping you.

112
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,294
But the more you, again, aggregate risk, 
say, for a city, for a region,

113
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:21,332
for a country, a parametric cover 
is an extremely powerful tool.

114
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:24,048
That's what we've done 
especially in the Caribbean,

115
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:29,384
since, I think, 2009, with the Caribbean 
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility,

116
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:32,182
there's a mechanism 
which compensates 16 states

117
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,725
against hurricanes, 
all on a parametric basis.

118
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:36,974
So the hurricane hits the place,

119
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:40,372
scientists and 
the meteorological organizations

120
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:44,041
measure the intensity of the event
and a couple of weeks after

121
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,460
the payment is made 
to the government's balance sheet.

122
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,254
And in that sense, 
it is a very fast track mechanism

123
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:55,422
to get post-disaster finance
which are on pre-arranged terms

124
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:57,317
or pre-agreed terms.

125
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:01,345
A single individual on the ground
normally seeks insurance

126
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,979
from a local insurance company.

127
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:07,616
And the local insurance company
therefore insures thousands of people,

128
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:10,999
say, in a region, in a country, in a city.

129
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:15,035
Now if that particular city or region
is hit by a large catastrophe

130
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,897
be it an earthquake, be it a hurricane,
a large scale flood,

131
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:23,066
many of these risks will be hit 
at the same time by the same event.

132
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:27,523
So that insurance company has to pay
a lot of claims at the same time

133
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:30,107
and that will very likely stress 
the balance sheet

134
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:33,120
of the insurance company
or even exceed its capacity

135
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,278
to deal with such kind of an event.

136
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:38,817
And that's why insurance companies
do reinsure themselves

137
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:44,367
with even larger reinsurance companies
who operate on a global scale.

138
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:48,393
So while one city might be affected by, 
say, a strong hurricane,

139
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:50,691
all the other thousands of cities 
in a portfolio

140
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:53,406
of that reinsurance company,
are not affected.

141
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,280
And therefore a reinsurance company

142
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,496
does diversify risk 
of an insurance company

143
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:03,501
and provides an insurance company 
with capital at much lowered cost

144
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:06,212
than what they have to borrow locally

145
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:09,101
as even the borrowers will be in stress

146
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:10,541
if something is happening.

147
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:14,302
So in that sense, insurance 
and reinsurance play together

148
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:18,963
to absorb larger quantities 
of natural catastrophe risk.

149
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:22,963
In many places on the planet, 
also the boundary conditions,

150
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:26,007
special legal certainty 
is not so much there.

151
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,466
So people are not so sure,

152
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:31,317
this game of trust 
where they would pay premium over years

153
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:33,191
they would ever get something back.

154
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,873
Insurance is not the first option.

155
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:37,887
It's really awareness, 
early warning systems,

156
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,583
that's where you make the huge difference

157
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,707
and that's where you'll save 
the lives firsthand.

158
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:45,416
But once you've done that 
it's absolutely reasonable to think about

159
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,696
city planning, regional planning

160
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:50,607
and how you play with 
all these different constituencies

161
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:55,887
to better help them perform better, 
so to say, in the next catastrophe.

162
00:08:55,887 --> 00:09:00,316
And only once these elements are in place
then mechanisms--

163
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:02,680
be it micro or macro insurance--

164
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,000
can make a difference.

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,683
And that's what we're then also working on

166
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:09,486
to figure what kind of arrangements
would now help people,

167
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:13,929
first, getting better 
at managing risk themselves,

168
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:18,252
and then second, allowing them to share 
the remaining part of risk

169
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:20,759
with other communities, 
first within the country

170
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,125
but then also across the border.
