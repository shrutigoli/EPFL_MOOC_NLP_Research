1
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:07,487
Professor David Bresch has
a background in Physics.

2
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:11,053
More than a decade ago,
he joined Swiss Re in Reinsurance,

3
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,304
especially to work
in Natural Catastrophe Modeling.

4
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:18,084
More recently,
he became professor at ETH-Z,

5
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,524
in the context
of Weather and Climate Risk.

6
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:23,055
In this video, Professor Bresch will focus

7
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:26,504
on Catastrophe Modeling related to storms.

8
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:34,662
Natural catastrophe modeling has
many sources where it started from.

9
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:40,004
One was just the willingness
to understand things better.

10
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:43,354
That's more the scientific part
of the story, where people say,

11
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:46,043
"We would like to understand
how these things come about,

12
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:48,883
and what might be a consequence
of something happening."

13
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,975
So it's almost the scientific element
of natural catastrophe modeling.

14
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:57,066
And then you have, on the other side,
you could say those impacted,

15
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:59,415
be it on the ground or being
those who help them,

16
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:00,465
who are impacted,

17
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:05,447
for example, those who provide
financial relief, namely insurers,

18
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:07,815
and they wanted to better understand

19
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:11,967
what could all happen,
basically, to our clients,

20
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:16,102
and how can we better help them
to cope with the situation.

21
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:18,595
And what we normally do

22
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:22,102
in the natural catastrophe modeling
community, you might say,

23
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:24,335
is really to quantify hazard--

24
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:28,395
how often, and how strong
things can hit you?

25
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:32,426
Second, where are you?
What are your interests,

26
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,486
your livelihoods,
what matters to you,

27
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,811
be it your life, be it your belongings?

28
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:41,236
and then also to quantify vulnerability.

29
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:43,476
And then we play it all
through in a model

30
00:01:43,476 --> 00:01:46,696
by basically simulating artificial storms,

31
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:49,661
so storms that haven't yet happened,
but could happen,

32
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:52,126
and hit such a place, and then figure,

33
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:53,843
"Aha, that would be the wind speed

34
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:56,337
a scientist tells me
could happen in this place.

35
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:59,207
That could be the damageability
of a building,

36
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:04,037
or that could be the necessity
for people to move out temporarily,

37
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:05,545
and come back after the storm,"

38
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:08,656
and you can quantify risk
using all these tools.

39
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:13,097
So what you see
on this short animation is,

40
00:02:13,097 --> 00:02:18,056
first, a layout of exposed assets

41
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:21,296
in Bangladesh, in a map,

42
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:25,955
colored from blue to green,
basically where people are,

43
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:30,325
and then basically you see
a tropical cyclone coming across,

44
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:33,046
hitting from the coast all these assets,

45
00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:36,748
and where the dots turn
from yellowish to red,

46
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:39,815
that's where the things are hit
by the tropical cyclone.

47
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:43,488
And that's what's in the center
of such a natural catastrophe model.

48
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:46,197
It now simulates
not only one single cyclone--

49
00:02:46,197 --> 00:02:48,575
this was Sidr, in fact, in Bangladesh--

50
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:54,163
it simulates all kinds
of possible cyclones hitting exposure,

51
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:58,787
for example, such as on this picture,
and then with that type of an approach,

52
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:04,028
you can quantify risk much more precisely
and spatially explicit.

53
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:06,047
Then you can basically use that model

54
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:10,347
to think about what would happen
if people would build differently.

55
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:13,926
So you change
the vulnerability of buildings.

56
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:16,854
Or what would happen
if people were better warned,

57
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:20,087
warned earlier,
and could basically evacuate?

58
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:23,697
You can use these models
to quantify these consequences.

59
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:26,777
On the building side, probably more
on the damage in dollar terms,

60
00:03:26,777 --> 00:03:30,945
but when it comes to people,
in the evacuation and emergency planning,

61
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:34,587
also how many people,
how many lives could be saved

62
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:36,978
in such cases, such a kind of event.

63
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:39,265
And so you can use
this engine to help you

64
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:42,628
identify the kinds of risk mitigation options
that you might have,

65
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:45,407
and then figure what would be
a reasonable basket,

66
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:48,546
or a reasonable group of things
you should implement,

67
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:51,050
in order to strengthen
your local resiliency

68
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,927
against, for example, tropical cyclones.

69
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,518
Then, interestingly,
you can also use that model

70
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:57,931
not only for risk today,

71
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:00,006
you can also put in the model
your development plan,

72
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,760
and say, over time there will be
more people in that place.

73
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,376
Now, if you don't change anything else,
so caeteris paribus:

74
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:11,486
more people, same hazard,
it will still be more risk,

75
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:14,258
and so you can also put
in a model climate change.

76
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,148
You can also say the storms
are going to change

77
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:20,949
in intensity and frequency, and also
that if that's going to increase,

78
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,948
then obviously there is more risk,

79
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:25,927
so the model can show you
how much more risk there is.

80
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:28,689
But, interestingly, it will also
tell you that you shape,

81
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,756
and people, local communities
shape their future.

82
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:34,962
So if they develop in another direction,
take another pathway,

83
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:38,968
it could be, there will be more people,
but they will not be more vulnerable.

84
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,848
They might build in a different style.

85
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:45,310
They may be better informed,
better managed on a governance level,

86
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,149
and therefore risk can be maintained
or even reduced in these places.

87
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:53,268
And so you can also then use these models
to look at the impact side,

88
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:55,939
"What's the benefit
of a specific intervention?"

89
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,568
and you can also use the same model
to cost that intervention,

90
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:02,486
and say, "How much
would it cost me to do so?"

91
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:06,909
So we use this kind of facts, also,
to help local decisionmakers

92
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:11,598
to build an adaptation strategy,
and underpin this strategy

93
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:15,548
with an adaptation roadmap:
ultimately, a funding plan.

94
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:21,188
The contribution of science to that
was to really very well understand

95
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,019
the hazard part of the story.

96
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:26,195
We're still learning a lot
about the other components of the model.

97
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:29,760
Especially the vulnerability part
is not so well understood.

98
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,599
It's also much more difficult because
it has a lot to do with social science.

99
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,699
It's culturally extremely different,

100
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,249
so there are societies
which react differently.

101
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:41,479
The same speed of wind
at the same level of flood,

102
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:42,940
there are different reactions

103
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,448
by different communities
and constituencies,

104
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:48,459
and that's absolutely fine,
it just needs to be understood.

105
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:51,222
And so there is this element of,
on the social science side,

106
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:54,214
to understand how do communities react

107
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:58,039
to these kind of exogenous shocks
to their economies and livelihoods.

108
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,309
And then, obviously, the contribution

109
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:02,809
from the financial services sector,
you could say,

110
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,809
or from the reinsurance
and insurance in particular

111
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:08,209
is that they added
a certain rigor to these models

112
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:12,327
to really be able to use these models
as decision tools.

113
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:16,540
Not all cultures value the present,
the future, and the past

114
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,380
with the same relevance, or weight.

115
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,031
So some cultures
are more rooted in the past,

116
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,040
some more in the present,

117
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,285
and for some,
the future matters more.

118
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:28,509
And these models bring that
very much on the table.

119
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:31,729
So for some constituencies,

120
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:36,530
the emphasis we put
on the future situation, say 2030--

121
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,470
What would climate change
look like by then?

122
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,729
What would your livelihoods
look like by then?

123
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,685
Some people they're not
so much interested in that.

124
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:48,836
Ten, twenty years down the road
was too long a time scale.

125
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:51,559
It mattered more
what's currently happening.

126
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:56,399
And let's be honest,
most OECD-country companies

127
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,669
also operate on, when they say 'strategy,'
they mean five years.

128
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,923
So it's pretty human
to rather look at the present,

129
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,990
and then build it from there.

130
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,543
And let's be honest, many are
at least as much guided

131
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,800
by the past,
rather than by their foresight.

132
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,359
And I think that what we should try,

133
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:15,990
what the modeling community
tries to bring to the table,

134
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,982
is make better use
of all the things we know already.

135
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:26,241
So in that sense, often we do not need
even deeper science,

136
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:29,671
in one of these specific areas,
you could also say silos.

137
00:07:29,671 --> 00:07:31,815
What we really need
is to connect these things.

138
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:34,530
The model needs to have a purpose,

139
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,284
and a model is not, per se, good or bad.

140
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:42,601
The question is only is my model
fit for the specific purpose?

141
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:45,963
Now, you could say a model
that can accommodate

142
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:49,043
more than one purpose, or a wider purpose,

143
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:52,951
is probably a bit more powerful model.
But still, good or bad

144
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:57,481
is too much a normative
kind of a question in that context.

145
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:59,843
It's more is it fit for purpose?

146
00:07:59,843 --> 00:08:04,134
For example, a global circulation model
in a climate space is fit for purpose

147
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:09,598
to determine the climate sensitivity
of that weather and climate system.

148
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:13,722
You ask questions or answer questions,
"Is there human influence,

149
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:15,319
and how could that play out?"

150
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,781
Now, a natural catastrophe impact model
is much more on the ground,

151
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:24,732
it's much more specific to say
<i>if</i> a quake is happening,

152
00:08:24,732 --> 00:08:26,179
<i>if</i> a hurricane is happening,

153
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:28,692
what's the physical consequence?

154
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:31,777
What's the environmental,
social consequence?

155
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,720
What's ultimately the economic
consequence of things?

156
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,742
And you can always ask
what kind of complexity you really need

157
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:42,941
in order to tackle your question.

158
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:45,746
And then there is probably at this point

159
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:48,696
the simplest model

160
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:52,771
that is fit for purpose
has definitely an advantage,

161
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:55,381
just because it's simple
to operate, to use,

162
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,010
and not least, simple to communicate.

163
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,341
And so that's also an element.

164
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:02,701
I've often seen too many
bells and whistles in these models.

165
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,828
You might get a bit better,
a notch better still,

166
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:08,721
but if you engage in community dialogue,

167
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:12,651
and you want models
to be embraced by a community,

168
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:15,371
you better err on the simpler side,

169
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:17,958
because that's where there's
a higher buy-in,

170
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,146
and then over time you can still increase,

171
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:25,313
in specificity or in precision of models.

172
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:28,701
And, let's be honest, it's quite often
also mock precision,

173
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,702
because it's not so easy
for some of these models

174
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:32,402
to measure their performance,

175
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:36,300
because luckily in many places
you haven't seen so many catastrophes,

176
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,232
and so these models are used
to play possible outcomes through,

177
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:45,194
and they should not so much
be used as predictive tools

178
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:47,778
to say that's exactly
how it's going to be,

179
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:50,615
it's more to say it helps us understand

180
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:54,322
what we can do
about natural catastrophes.

181
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:56,921
What's really made, I would say,

182
00:09:56,921 --> 00:10:00,754
a tremendous change to that endeavor
in the past decade or so

183
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:05,163
is that more and more of that data
is openly accessible,

184
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:09,162
so a lot of the hazard information
you can get for free.

185
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:13,542
The only thing you need is have
the skills to digest that information.

186
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:15,543
And then also the cat modeling,

187
00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:20,682
so the engine which puts hazard,
exposure, and vulnerability together,

188
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:23,829
exists now more and more
in the open space.

189
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,802
One thing to mention
is what I've developed,

190
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:29,474
since five, six years now, is Climada,

191
00:10:29,474 --> 00:10:32,662
a natural catastrophe
risk assessment model

192
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:35,993
which builds on a wealth
of openly accessible data,

193
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:39,962
for example worldwide, all hurricanes,
tropical cyclone events,

194
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,853
as called in other places,

195
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:45,574
then also, on the earthquake side,
the volcano side.

196
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:47,893
And basically it provides--

197
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:50,912
to model natural catastrophes
in quite high resolution,

198
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:54,741
normally higher resolution
than a kilometer,

199
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:56,915
almost all over the planet.

200
00:10:56,915 --> 00:11:00,313
What then users have to put in
is their own exposure,

201
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:03,522
so they have to figure where they are
and what matters to them.

202
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:06,059
That's something
you cannot impose on people.

203
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,213
So these models need to be open
also in the sense

204
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:10,593
to digest additional information

205
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:13,607
that comes from different sources
and constituencies.

206
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:18,133
And again, important is not only
that the engine is an open piece,

207
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:22,101
also the interfaces to it are open,
and can easily be changed.

208
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:24,493
That's why this thing
is developed in MATLAB,

209
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:26,222
which is an engineering software,

210
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:29,244
which luckily also has
an open-source version to it.

211
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:33,434
So those who are not in a position
to pay a MATLAB license,

212
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:34,641
they can use Octave,

213
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:37,861
and Octave is
an open-source clone of MATLAB.

214
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:42,402
So basically anybody who has a laptop
can download all of it for free

215
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,589
from the internet,
and get started, so to say.

216
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:49,675
But I mentioned, it does need skills,
so it's definitely something

217
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:54,924
where people with training
in engineering, natural science,

218
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,144
and also social science,
for the impact side,

219
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:59,264
have an edge, and an advantage.

220
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:01,929
And I think for those people,

221
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,404
what such a model provides
is in essence a platform,

222
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,954
a platform to bring
all these different components together

223
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:09,021
to really quantify risk.

224
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,333
How will natural catastrophe models
further develop?

225
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:16,622
One avenue is clear:
still more comprehensive coverage,

226
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:20,404
so more perils,
combined perils, for example.

227
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:24,797
Our models, they do combine
tropical cyclone wind, and surge,

228
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:30,440
and the heavy downpour,
the excess, the torrential rain,

229
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,094
and you can basically look
at the combined impact of these things.

230
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:36,726
One thing you also see
is people like to look

231
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:40,464
at consequential events,
so series of events.

232
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:44,034
These models do capture them.
You can make them capture them.

233
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:47,340
But the question is
if a community has been hit once,

234
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,363
it will not be the same afterwards.

235
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:52,249
And if it's hit three times,
it starts to adapt.

236
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:56,694
So an interesting avenue would be
agent-based approaches to cat modeling,

237
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:59,318
to say, hey, these people
being hit by a storm,

238
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:01,227
they will not sit and wait
for the next one.

239
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:02,566
They act.

240
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:04,455
Nowadays, the models
do not incorporate that.

241
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:06,598
You basically would play it once,
and it would say,

242
00:13:06,598 --> 00:13:09,081
"Aha! That's why people
do something differently,"

243
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,635
but then you would basically

244
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:14,604
not bring that back to the model.
But that would be an interesting avenue.

245
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:16,992
So one is definitely the resolution game.

246
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:19,561
Still, it's not over,
because still it can get better,

247
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:24,148
going for city, even street resolution;
you do learn something from doing that.

248
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:26,305
It depends, again,
what you want to do with the model.

249
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,069
So if the model is built,
or should be built,

250
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:33,247
for the purpose to advise city planners,
then there is ample ground

251
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:36,965
to improve the quality
with that goal in mind.

252
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:39,995
But if it's more to say
how can these models help us

253
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:43,945
better understand
how our development pathways,

254
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:46,735
in a pretty turbulent world,
could shape out,

255
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:50,425
then probably this other avenue
of bringing more, you could say,

256
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:53,705
the socio-economic piece
more actively into the modeling,

257
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:56,460
is something I see a lot of potential.

258
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,704
Also, linking it up
with economic growth trajectories,

259
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,446
development trajectories,

260
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:03,796
and how people shape
their own risk landscape,

261
00:14:03,796 --> 00:14:07,254
because currently the models
are pretty static in that sense.

262
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:10,738
That's a place where I do think
we will see a lot of change

263
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:12,885
in the next decades or so.
