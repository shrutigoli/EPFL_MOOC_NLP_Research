00:00:02,051 --> 00:00:05,261
A Resilient future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction.

3
00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:11,619
Hello, this lesson which is a case study

4
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:14,443
shows how to use GIS

5
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:17,843
to map flood prone areas,

6
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:21,402
in order to make decisions
for land-use planning.

7
00:00:21,764 --> 00:00:27,237
This lesson is based on the analysis
of hydro-meteorological processes

8
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,353
and human settlements.

9
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:33,503
But this study does not allow
to address in all its facets

10
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:35,395
the problem of flooding in Niamey.

11
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:39,214
However, it helps to provide
the competent authorities

12
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,403
with mapping tools

13
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:45,246
to guide them towards better
flood risk management.

14
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:51,676
To begin, we must first remember
that Niamey is the capital of Niger.

15
00:00:53,747 --> 00:00:56,784
Niamey, located in the far west
of the country,

16
00:00:57,664 --> 00:01:01,356
with about 1.3 million inhabitants in 2011,

17
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:05,208
spreads over an area of ​​240 km²,

18
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:08,853
with an elevation ranging from 180 to 250 meters.

19
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:12,906
It is bisected by the River Niger,

20
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:14,426
what has shaped moreover

21
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:17,056
the development of urban
and suburban areas.

22
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:23,447
We distinguish that the left bank is
more developed than the right bank.

23
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:28,259
The left bank, which shelters
four municipal districts,

24
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:33,498
is a plateau above the river
at an average altitude of 220 meters

25
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,828
and notched with many talwegs,

26
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:40,759
of which the most important
is that of Gountou Yena,

27
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,657
with north-south direction.

28
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,570
As for the right bank, where
the fifth municipal district is located,

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,488
it is an alluvial plain with an average
altitude of 200 meters.

30
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:53,559
Physiographic features of the city of Niamey

31
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:56,591
and various associated human and economic
issues 

32
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,561
show that floods are, for the most part,

33
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:03,310
clearly linked to the strong
urban growth over the last thirty years.

34
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:05,863
Indeed, population growth

35
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,662
and the development of
socio-economic activities

36
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:12,201
led the city to extend in flood prone areas.

37
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:15,881
Thus, since the beginning of the seventies,

38
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:19,802
Niamey has grown on the right bank
of the river,

39
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:23,102
and the urbanization of
this particularly exposed area

40
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,799
is ongoing.

41
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:30,202
On the left bank, the very vulnerable
old quarters of Goudel and Saga, 

42
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:33,993
densify and extend through
the allotment of new plots.

43
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:37,302
The spatial assessment of flood risk

44
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:40,961
by intersecting hazard and
vulnerability issues

45
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,302
allows mapping of flood risk areas

46
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:45,724
in the city of Niamey.

47
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,334
Floodings in the Sahel

48
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:51,345
have become more and more recurrent,

49
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,936
and Niger is not on the sidelines.

50
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:55,024
During these last few years,

51
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,676
Niger experienced excess rainfall,

52
00:02:57,676 --> 00:03:01,481
with heavy rains causing
unprecedented flooding,

53
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:05,684
practically in all regions of the country,
including the capital Niamey.

54
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:09,014
The protective dikes in Niamey

55
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:12,118
with a height of 5 meters,
on the right bank,

56
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:17,235
were completely submerged during
the last flood.

57
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:20,796
These floods caused many deaths,

58
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:23,735
population displacements and relocations,

59
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:26,477
destruction of homes and farms.

60
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:31,457
The hydrology of the Niger River
in Niamey is well known,

61
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:33,777
thanks to the measuring station in Niamey,

62
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:38,587
installed since 1928 and regularly
used since 1944.

63
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,185
The hydrological regime has two floods.

64
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,178
The "Malian" floods, which take place
from December to January,

65
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,669
from the top of the basin,

66
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:54,099
and local flooding that occurs
during the rainy season.

67
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,919
Over the last years,

68
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,450
the local flood has become
increasingly important,

69
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,179
as we see in the image

70
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:06,949
and is the cause of frequent flooding
during the rainy season.

71
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:10,711
Local floods are usually caused

72
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:12,991
by the exceptional peaks of rainfall.

73
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:17,901
In August 2012, the daily peak of
121 mm caused 28 deaths,

74
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,276
more than 51 000 victims,

75
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:22,061
more than 4 500 damaged homes,

76
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,121
and more than 250 hectares
of destroyed farms.

77
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:28,842
The analysis of daily rainfall peaks
in Niamey

78
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,251
reveals a high amplitude

79
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:36,080
in the variability of the maximum
daily peaks in July and August

80
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:41,401
from 7 to 121 mm, with peaks
of 50 mm per day

81
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:44,221
met or exceeded almost every year
since 2000.

82
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:48,102
What are the factors aggravating
these floods?

83
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:53,219
We will focus on the factors caused by humans.

84
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:57,392
These include soil sealing and soil degradation,

85
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:02,542
particularly in connection with
deforestation and urbanization,

86
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:07,325
which results in less infiltration
and more runoff.

87
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:11,234
More important is the spread of Niamey city,

88
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:13,715
in the main river bed,

89
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:16,125
which increases the vulnerability
of the city.

90
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:21,954
You should also add the
maintenance of watercourses,

91
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,506
which induces sedimentation.

92
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:28,746
We must remember that the concept of risk
is perceived as the possible occurrence

93
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,155
of a hazard on potentially
vulnerable elements.

94
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:34,845
The study of flood risk is based on
two main points.

95
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:37,275
First, analysis of hazards,

96
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:39,676
based on knowledge of natural phenomena

97
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,355
causing damage,

98
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:43,976
their processes and operations.

99
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:47,816
In this case, it is important
to analyze the morphological,

100
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:51,946
topographical, geological, soil and water

101
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:53,887
features concerning the phenomenon.

102
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,959
Second, the mapping

103
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,679
and assessment of vulnerabilities
of the major elements.

104
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,849
This is to integrate data

105
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,696
on human and socio-economic activities

106
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,807
in the assessment of flood risk,

107
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,298
knowing that flood risk

108
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,726
is at first a social issue.

109
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:13,454
These two maps,

110
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:15,944
that is to say, the hazard map 
and the elements at risk map,

111
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:20,218
are combined to determine
the flood prone and flooded areas map,

112
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:25,970
that is a decision support tool for land-use planning.

113
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:29,829
Mapping of flood hazard

114
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:33,119
is based on the analysis
of natural factors,

115
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:38,389
including morphology, topography,
geology, soil science,

116
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:41,301
that influence the development
and extent of the flood,

117
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,140
as we said earlier.

118
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:46,831
Based on the available data,
in the case of this study,

119
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:48,301
the most relevant hazards

120
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:51,584
include defining exposure to overflow of
the Niger River

121
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:55,363
and exposure to the accumulation of runoff waters,

122
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,060
following a downpour.

123
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:01,960
Thus the hazard of direct overflow
of the river is determined

124
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,643
from the analysis of a series
of historical data

125
00:07:04,643 --> 00:07:07,082
of the Niger flow in Niamey

126
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:10,112
allowing to define the 100-year flood.

127
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:14,051
That is to say, a flood that comes
on average every hundred years.

128
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:17,463
The 100-year flood is often
used as the reference event

129
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:20,852
for the implementation of
flood risk prevention plans.

130
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,392
The radius of influence of such floods

131
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:26,719
helps determine the exposure
to overflow of the Niger.

132
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:30,623
In this study, it is defined within 400 meters.

133
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:34,724
The linear distance of each
unit relative to the riverbed

134
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:37,274
determines its level of exposure

135
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:40,872
and is presented by a buffer zone
on both sides of the river.

136
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:44,414
The closer the entity is
to the river route,

137
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:46,848
the stronger its exposure
to overflow.

138
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:50,535
Regarding the accumulation of water,

139
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:52,636
the most representative variable here

140
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:54,946
is the topographic index or Beven index.

141
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:59,486
It is calculated from the DTM obtained
from the ASTER DEM data.

142
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:02,846
This is the natural logarithm
of the ratio of the area

143
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:05,205
at a given point on the slope.

144
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:07,505
This index provides information
on the spatial distribution of

145
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:11,517
the accumulation level
of runoff water of each entity.

146
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:14,027
Other factors are considered constant

147
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:18,485
and have no notable effects
on the flood phenomena.

148
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:21,268
They will not be taken into account
in this study.

149
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,397
Once the two maps,

150
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:28,667
that is to say the overflow hazard
and the accumulation hazard,

151
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:33,129
are determined, we will build
the map of flood prone areas.

152
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:37,129
For this, according to the floodability:
low, medium or high,

153
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:40,908
we will conduct a reclassification
of images,

154
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:45,128
using the three criteria,

155
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:49,498
including the factors aggravating the flood,

156
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:52,411
taking into account
the topographic,

157
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:55,300
hydrological and hydrogeological elements.

158
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,540
The combination of these two maps,

159
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,410
therefore, determines the Niamey flood prone areas.

160
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:09,640
One of the most important elements
is the map of elements at risk.

161
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,721
This map was produced

162
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:16,101
by mapping the dynamics of land use

163
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:20,381
between 1998 and 2013,

164
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:25,531
using Landsat TM images of 1998
and Landsat OLI images of 2013.

165
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:30,441
The goal here is to show that
the settlements have evolved over the years,

166
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:33,692
thus showing a particular
interesting aspect of this study,

167
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:36,170
where populations have become vulnerable

168
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,932
because of urban growth.

169
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:40,292
The supervised classification of images,

170
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:42,742
followed by a validation by field missions,

171
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:47,893
made it possible to establish
the land use dynamics.

172
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:51,742
Then we digitalised buildings

173
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,574
to produce the map of elements at risk.

174
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:59,523
This map, superimposed
to the digital elevation model,

175
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:06,046
clearly shows that one part of the city
is on the bed of the River Niger.

176
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:12,965
The challenges therefore concern
economic and socio-economic activities.

177
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:17,225
How do we characterize these activities

178
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,594
to determine the map of elements at risk?

179
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:24,156
Here we have not included
a specific criteria

180
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:26,585
for government buildings

181
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:30,046
public and private companies, and homes.

182
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,317
We have considered
the same level of vulnerability.

183
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:39,197
Even if the vulnerability of the buildings
is considered to be the same,

184
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:45,367
we can still map the elements at risk,

185
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:48,677
that will be coupled to the hazards thereafter

186
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:54,347
to help us make decisions about land-use planning.

187
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:58,977
One of the most important
findings of this study,

188
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:00,997
is the flood risk map.

189
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:04,605
Given the topography, hydrography,

190
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:07,259
the climate and the Niger River system,

191
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,859
Niamey city is obviously at risk of flooding,

192
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,969
in light of the analysis of this map.

193
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:17,799
This map is an example of a decision map.

194
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:20,770
It was established in a very simple way,

195
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:25,426
but it has the advantage of locating
the flood prone areas of Niamey.

196
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:27,480
It may serve as a basis

197
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,625
in future land use/plot allocations

198
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,380
in areas along the river,

199
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,569
while avoiding the dangerous areas.

200
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,076
What can we learn from this case study?

201
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:43,131
We used GIS

202
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:48,623
for mapping flood prone areas
in Niamey, Niger.

203
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:52,511
We also observed that

204
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,953
there is strong urban growth along the river,

205
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:56,601
over recent years.

206
00:11:56,601 --> 00:12:00,302
This has accentuated land
and population vulnerability.

207
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:05,311
This document can be made
available to policymakers,

208
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:09,402
and this simple map shows
the areas vulnerable to flooding,

209
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:13,274
in order to take preventive measures against floods,

210
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:16,872
which is a natural hazard

211
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:19,732
that affects all countries of the world.

212
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:24,114
Even Niger, a Sahelian country,
is affected by floods

213
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:28,475
near the main bed of River Niger,

214
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:33,944
and because of uncontrolled
urbanization in these areas.
