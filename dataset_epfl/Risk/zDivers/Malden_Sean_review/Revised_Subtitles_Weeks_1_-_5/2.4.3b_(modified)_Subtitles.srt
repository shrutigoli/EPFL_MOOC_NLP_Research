00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:08,835
Hi, in this additional material video,
Professor David Bresch will explain

4
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:12,803
the difference between deterministic
and probabilistic modeling.

5
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:16,862
Yeah-- when we talk about
natural catastrophe modeling

6
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:20,058
That's an extremely fuzzy thing.

7
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:24,898
I often say, as soon as you take the back of
an envelope and put a number down,

8
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:26,482
that's a model.

9
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:31,300
It starts even earlier, when I talk about
risk, I try to build

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,843
a shared mental model
with the audience to say,

11
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:37,767
think about hurricanes,
think about people on the ground.

12
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:40,290
Think about how they might react to it.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,129
That's your idea model of how a hurricane
hits an exposed coastal population.

14
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:47,646
And now what you do in modeling
is basically,

15
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:49,930
just making that more rigorous.

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,192
Instead of saying,
think about the hurricane,

17
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:54,994
you put down a footprint
on a hurricane, on a map.

18
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:57,483
And instead of thinking about people
being somewhere,

19
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:00,466
you say, 'That's exactly the coordinate,
where these houses are.

20
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:02,953
That's exactly the coordinate
of the school building.

21
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:05,668
That's exactly the coordinate
of the road connecting them.'

22
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:13,291
So you build the model by basically
putting things more precisely in context.

23
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,796
And so you can use these models
in a deterministic sense,

24
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:19,928
that you could use them as they're often
used, for example,

25
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:25,856
in warning application,
that you would take a protected path

26
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:28,459
of a hurricane,
put it in such a model

27
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:32,712
and say, 'Ah-ha! If the storm
comes along that way,

28
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:34,935
these are the people that will be affected

29
00:01:34,935 --> 00:01:36,257
and that's how strongly
they will be affected.'

30
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:39,649
So that's a deterministic way of using
such a model is by putting

31
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,388
one single event in.

32
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:44,789
It can also be a historic event,
you can also replay say

33
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:48,097
Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh
and see what would happen

34
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:51,460
if that historic storm
happened again today.

35
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,796
That would still be a deterministic
application of a model.

36
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:58,623
Now, since luckily we haven't seen
all the bad things happening,

37
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:01,183
but we should be better prepared,
very likely.

38
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:03,779
We can use these models also
in a probabilistic sense.

39
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:09,562
Probabilistic in the sense to say,
What else could happen to a place?

40
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:13,245
Do we really exactly understand
where people are?

41
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:16,588
Do we exactly understand how they fare
in case of an event?

42
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:19,684
And you can start to play
with the parameters in your model.

43
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:22,748
And you can also ask the question,
What would happen if the storm

44
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:24,458
comes from another direction?

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,747
And so you can build a probabilistic
set of storms;

46
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:33,271
you can build a lot of artificial storms--
these are physically consistent events,

47
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,836
so they're not impossible to happen
but luckily we haven't seen them--

48
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:40,724
and you can play it all through,
but now not for a historic event

49
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:47,066
or for single event, for many thousandths
of possible manifestations of nature

50
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,115
you could say.

51
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:52,120
And therefore, you can test all your risk
management options,

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,803
not only against the past or against
a specific single prediction,

53
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:59,931
you can also test your specific options,
for example,

54
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:05,929
is it worth to, for example,
evacuate earlier, five days early,

55
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,526
is that better or worse?

56
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:09,994
Hard to say if you only compare
with one event.

57
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:13,939
But in such a model, you can play through
all the thousands of possible storms

58
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,862
that could hit that coastal stretch.

59
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:19,343
You probably would learn, 'Ah-ha,
if you're able to warn a day earlier,

60
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:21,646
you can save so many more lives.'

61
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:24,790
And so you can use these probabilistic
models to, in essence,

62
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:31,309
play through many kind of possible
future outcomes

63
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:35,274
and therefore you have an ability
to play through your options

64
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:38,917
and therefore you have the option
to get better at understanding

65
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,947
your options, and ultimately,
it can help you in decision-making:

66
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:45,221
in a sense, Should I now really
implement that option or not?

67
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,627
Because I would know cost and benefit
much better that way.

68
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:54,392
In order to illustrate the difference between
a deterministic and a probabilistic model,

69
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:58,406
the easiest way is to look at the
situation in the North Indian Ocean,

70
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:04,096
where you have only a few storms
recorded in consistent way

71
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:08,696
in the past-- these few red lines
there and that's good enough

72
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:10,259
to get the first impression.

73
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,480
It's good enough to figure
where there might be people at risk.

74
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,450
But it's not good enough to do
a proper modeling of risk

75
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,005
in a higher spatial
and temporal resolution.

76
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,821
And that's why when you then build
a probabilistic model,

77
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:26,270
you try to generate artificial storms

78
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,263
that are physically consistent,
and these are all the black spaghettis

79
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:33,376
or dark blue spaghettis,
which fill all the gaps.

80
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:37,486
And they basically happen over a timescale

81
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,702
of over five thousand years.

82
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:42,704
Not in the future, but more to say,
would we repeat next year,

83
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:47,256
five thousand times, then if we would put
it all on the same map,

84
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:49,045
it would look that dark blue.

85
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:53,836
So it's not to say the probabilistic storm
has more frequency than an historic storm.

86
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:58,298
It's more one way to render the--
you could say the coverage

87
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,713
of a probabilistic model
on a single slide.
