Seismic Hazard

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,980
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,890
Hello, my name is João Almeida.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,310
I am a researcher at

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,110
the Earthquake Engineering and
Structural Dynamics Laboratories of EPFL.

6
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:13,361
I am your lecturer for this video

7
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:16,521
in which I will talk about seismic hazard.

8
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:19,911
I will first start by recalling 
how earthquakes usually occur

9
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:22,121
and their waves propagate.

10
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:24,591
I'll then define 
seismic hazard and discuss

11
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,151
how we can measure 
the size of an earthquake,

12
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:30,221
namely in terms 
of magnitude and intensity.

13
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:32,651
There are different types of earthquakes.

14
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:37,001
They can be due to volcanic activity, 
collapse of underground cavities,

15
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:40,229
or even produced by blasts or explosions.

16
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:43,579
However, the major source 
of large earthquakes

17
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,399
is definitely the rupture 
of the Earth's crust,

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,399
namely in the so-called 
<i>interplate earthquakes</i>.

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,489
The next few slides 
will bring back to memory

20
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,529
what you most probably learned
in primary school.

21
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:59,299
The Earth is divided in four major layers:

22
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:03,939
the inner and outer core, 
the mantle and the crust.

23
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,726
The 'skin' or the hard outer layer 
of our planet is called the <i>lithosphere</i>

24
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:12,196
and it's made up of the crust
and the cool, dense

25
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:14,976
and rigid upper part of the mantle.

26
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:19,146
However, our planet's skin 
is not all in one piece.

27
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:22,896
It is composed of many pieces 
covering the surface of the Earth,

28
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:25,276
called <i>tectonic plates</i>.

29
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:28,456
These tectonic plates are not immobile.

30
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:32,456
In fact, the difference in temperature 
between the core and the crust,

31
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:35,966
creates convection currents 
that force these plates

32
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:39,296
to keep slowly moving around 
in different directions

33
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:42,356
at different speeds, 
sliding past one another

34
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:44,476
and bumping into each other.

35
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:48,276
The edges of these plates
are called <i>plate boundaries</i>.

36
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:51,046
The boundaries are made up of many faults

37
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:53,876
and most of the largest earthquakes 
around the world,

38
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:56,306
occur on these faults.

39
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:58,656
Since the edges of the plate are rough,

40
00:01:58,656 --> 00:02:02,316
they get stuck while 
the rest of the plate keeps moving.

41
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:05,376
When the plate has moved far enough,

42
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,486
a rupture stress is reached at the point

43
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:12,276
the two mass blocks
on either side of the fault unstick

44
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:15,336
and slide along the surface of the fault,

45
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:19,336
with an instantaneous release 
of the elastic strain energy.

46
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:23,591
The point within the Earth 
where an earthquake rupture starts

47
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:26,341
is called <i>hypocenter</i> or <i>focus</i>.

48
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:29,669
If its depth is up to 60 kilometers,

49
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:32,709
we say that it is 
a superficial earthquake,

50
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:38,259
while deep ones have hypocenters 
between 300 to 700 kilometers.

51
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:43,303
The epicenter is the point 
directly above the hypocenter

52
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:45,213
at the surface of the Earth.

53
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,293
The energy released in an earthquake

54
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,743
is transmitted 
in the form of seismic waves.

55
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:52,713
Such as, the faster compressional waves P

56
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:55,743
and the slower transverse waves S,

57
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:59,303
which propagate inside the Earth,
in a radial direction

58
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:03,303
undergoing phenomena 
of reflection and refraction.

59
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:07,198
Until now, I've recalled 
how earthquakes originate

60
00:03:07,198 --> 00:03:09,788
and their waves propagate.

61
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:14,028
Seismic hazard refers 
to all the physical phenomenon

62
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,648
caused by earthquakes
that may be potentially damaging.

63
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:20,968
Either directly for human life,
for physical assets,

64
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:25,988
or in any other social, economic
or even environmental dimension.

65
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,670
They include:
ground shaking,

66
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,500
which can make difficult for us
to stay on our feet--

67
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,010
or more importantly,
make structures collapse.

68
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,723
But also, surface rupture for those cases

69
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:41,253
where the fault does not remain 
buried or hidden

70
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:44,313
under the uppermost layers 
of rock in the crust;

71
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,560
tsunamis, and you may recall
that in the Indian Ocean,

72
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,000
in 2004, as shown in this picture,

73
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,510
or after the recent 
Japanese earthquake of 2011;

74
00:03:55,496 --> 00:04:00,396
liquefaction, when a water-saturated soil 
temporarily loses its strength

75
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:05,146
and behaves as a fluid;
or even landslides and rock falls.

76
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:08,949
Instruments that characterize 
the ground motion

77
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,449
have been developed since ancient times.

78
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:14,709
As Zhang's seismoscope--
where a bronze bowl

79
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,949
drops from one of the eight dragon heads
to the toad's mouth

80
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:21,899
to indicate the earthquake direction.

81
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,129
In more classical seismographs, 
as represented in this sketch,

82
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:28,079
when an earthquake causes 
the ground to shake,

83
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,809
the base of the device shakes too,
but the hanging weight does not.

84
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,159
The relative displacement between 
the shaking part of the seismograph

85
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:40,839
and the motionless part
is what is recorded.

86
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,159
Modern seismometers based on analog
and digital technologies

87
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,989
allow not only to register
the displacements

88
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:50,519
associated to ground shaking,

89
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,239
but also, ground motion records 
of acceleration and velocity.

90
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,677
Besides, these records can be measured

91
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:01,337
along any two perpendicular
horizontal directions

92
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:04,017
or even along the vertical axis.

93
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:07,574
Using the existing 
networks of seismometers,

94
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:12,594
scientists can then determine exactly 
where the earthquake was,

95
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:16,454
based on the speed difference 
between the P and S waves,

96
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:19,934
and by using the method 
called <i>triangulation.</i>

97
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:22,624
When it comes to measuring 
the size of an earthquake,

98
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,884
there are basically two measures 
that can be employed:

99
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:28,414
magnitude and intensity.

100
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:31,724
Magnitude quantifies 
the global energy released

101
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:33,774
by an earthquake,

102
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:37,084
while intensity expresses 
the local earthquake effects,

103
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:39,694
this is, at a specific site.

104
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:42,264
It is therefore easy to understand

105
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:46,264
that for each earthquake,
there is only one magnitude value.

106
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:50,264
Instead, many parameters can be used 
to measure the intensity.

107
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:54,813
With respect to magnitude 
there are several scales.

108
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,243
Although the Richter scale 
developed in the 1930s

109
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:00,283
is perhaps the most famous,

110
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:03,083
the one which is commonly used 
for official purposes

111
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:07,083
is the moment magnitude, 
developed in the 1970s.

112
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:10,131
It is based on the seismic moment 
of the earthquake,

113
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,941
which is proportional 
to the average displacement

114
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:16,421
along the fault 
and the size of the area that slipped.

115
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:20,108
Just to give you a rough estimate 
of the amount of released energy,

116
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,908
consider that a magnitude for earthquake

117
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:26,908
is approximately similar 
to the explosion of a small atomic bomb,

118
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:29,448
within the radius of 100 kilometers.

119
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:33,086
An increase of one step 
on this logarithmic scale,

120
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:36,086
corresponds to approximately 
32 times increase

121
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:38,676
in terms of the amount of energy.

122
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:42,346
Which means that, for instance, 
a magnitude 7 earthquake

123
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:46,946
is around 100 times bigger 
than a magnitude 5 earthquake.

124
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:49,696
This should put things 
in perspective if I tell you

125
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:53,246
that a few earthquakes 
with a magnitude larger than 9

126
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,776
have been measured over the past 70 years.

127
00:06:56,776 --> 00:07:00,326
The maximum magnitude 
registered until today

128
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:05,776
was approximately of 9.5 in Chile in 1960.

129
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:10,558
Seismic hazard is, however, 
typically expressed

130
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:13,578
through the intensity 
of ground shaking from an earthquake

131
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:15,088
at a given site,

132
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:17,698
which can be measured 
using a number of parameters,

133
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,288
as stated before.

134
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:22,258
These can be categorized into two types:

135
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:25,464
Intensity that is assigned
based on observations,

136
00:07:25,464 --> 00:07:28,224
also known as <i>macroseismic intensity</i>,

137
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:30,944
and intensity that is measured 
from instruments

138
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:34,944
such as accelerographs, commonly known 
as <i>ground motion parameters</i>.

139
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:39,561
The conversion between observational 
and instrumental intensity,

140
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,641
involves much uncertainty.

141
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:44,251
Let's see why, 
by looking in more detail

142
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:46,241
into each of these categories.

143
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,836
Following the definition of Bolt, 
observational intensity

144
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,556
"is a measure of ground shaking

145
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:54,886
obtained from damage done 
to the structures built by humans,

146
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:58,886
changes in the Earth's surface,
and felt reports."

147
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:02,388
It is an indirect measure 
for ground shaking,

148
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:05,928
being particularly useful
for historical earthquakes--

149
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:09,928
this is, where no records 
of the ground motions are available,

150
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,920
or for recent earthquakes 
in regions where no accelerometers

151
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,520
were installed.

152
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,050
The most famous scale is probably
the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI).

153
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,670
However, there are others.

154
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,670
For example, this table 
presents the short form

155
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,280
of the European Microseismic Scale, EMS-98

156
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,710
which is a twelve-point scale.

157
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,710
Roman numerals are used 
to emphasize the fact

158
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,710
that these scales 
are neither continuous, nor linear.

159
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:45,662
The Level III corresponds 
to the level of human perceivability,

160
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:49,662
while damaging structures 
initiate in Level VII.

161
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:53,662
The top two degrees 
are rarely attained, if ever.

162
00:08:53,662 --> 00:08:55,972
This figure on the right 
shows the application

163
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:59,972
of a macroseismic intensity scale 
to the Chile earthquake of 2010.

164
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,499
Note that due to local side effects,

165
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:08,519
the maximum intensity does not 
necessarily occur at the epicenter.

166
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:12,451
Further, one can also observe 
the iso-intensity lines

167
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,151
which bound in an approximate manner

168
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,166
a region with one predominant intensity.

169
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:22,936
For what concerns ground shaking 
as recorded by seismic instruments,

170
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:26,286
a large number of parameters 
can be considered.

171
00:09:26,286 --> 00:09:30,006
One can, for instance, take 
the maximum absolute value

172
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:34,356
of the ground acceleration 
during an entire earthquake record,

173
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:37,708
the so-called 
<i>peak ground acceleration</i> or PGA,

174
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,448
or any other ground motion parameter,

175
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:42,978
such as the Peak Ground Velocity

176
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:47,598
or the Arias Intensity which measures 
the energy within the record.

177
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,879
Seismic hazard, however, 
is not only characterized

178
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,879
by location and intensity.

179
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,489
Its frequency or probability of occurrence

180
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:58,249
is also required.

181
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:02,249
This can be expressed 
by the return period T of an earthquake,

182
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:06,729
which is the mean time 
between the occurrence of two earthquakes

183
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:10,949
with a magnitude equal or larger 
than the specified value.

184
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:15,491
Finally, seismic hazard can be expressed 
in the form of hazard maps,

185
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:18,151
which show the levels of ground motion

186
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:22,651
with a given probability of exceedance
over a period of time.

187
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:26,201
This example, for instance, 
displays the peak ground acceleration

188
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:30,201
for a 10 percent exceedance
probability in 50 years,

189
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:34,201
as obtained for Europe 
by the program SHARE.

190
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,721
In a nutshell, 
in this video, we have seen

191
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:40,011
how earthquakes generate 
and their waves propagate,

192
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:43,541
how we can record them, 
and how we can measure their size,

193
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,671
namely in terms of
magnitude and intensity.

194
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:50,671
Many different intensity measures 
can be used to express seismic hazard

195
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:54,411
due to ground shaking 
at a given site or region.

196
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:58,351
Besides, seismic hazard 
due to natural earthquakes

197
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:01,241
can be characterized probabilistically

198
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:04,391
and it is approximately constant in time.

199
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:08,391
In other words, the seismic hazard 
here in Lausanne, where I live,

200
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:11,481
is expected to be approximately 
the same today

201
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:14,231
or in one hundred years time.

202
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,590
Does this mean 
that the seismic risk of this region,

203
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,590
or any other region,
will also be the same in 100 years?

204
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:25,741
The answer is no, 
and the reason is that seismic hazard

205
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:30,191
is only one of the components 
that influence seismic risk.

206
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:34,392
I'll explain this in more details
in the video of week 2.

207
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:35,842
See you there!
