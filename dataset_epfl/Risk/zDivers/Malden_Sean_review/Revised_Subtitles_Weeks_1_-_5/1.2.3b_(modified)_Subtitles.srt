00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:05,971
Hello, my name is Michael Lehning.

2
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:09,367
I'm a professor here at EPFL
of Cryospheric Sciences,

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:12,037
and I'm also leading the research units
now on Permafrost

4
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:17,228
at the WSL Davos,
in fact the SLF in Davos,

5
00:00:17,228 --> 00:00:20,373
and this video will be on floods

6
00:00:20,373 --> 00:00:23,242
and other hydrometeorological
natural hazards.

7
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:27,337
So in this video we will give you
an introduction to flooding,

8
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:31,192
then give you a definition
of what flooding is about.

9
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:34,902
We will quickly talk about
the historic context of flooding,

10
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:40,176
and then go on to explain
the mechanisms of flood formation.

11
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:43,728
Consequences of flood
will be touched upon,

12
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:45,331
and then we will talk about floods

13
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,842
in comparison to other natural hazards,

14
00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:51,054
give you two comparative
examples of flooding,

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,496
and then end up
with other hydrological hazards,

16
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:59,172
cascading hazard events,
and sum up with the main points.

17
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:03,097
So floods are the most common
of all natural hazards,

18
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:07,144
and they have affected humans
throughout history.

19
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:10,947
A formal definition of flood is
the "overflowing by water

20
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:14,805
of the normal confines of a stream
or other body of water,

21
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:16,826
or the accumulation of water by drainage

22
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,763
over areas which are not
normally submerged."

23
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:23,420
In simple words
that means you have water,

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,760
and you have abundant water
where you should not have water.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,544
The previous slide gave you the definition
of flood in a narrow context,

26
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:35,920
but floods are a sort
of hydrometeorological hazard,

27
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,852
and therefore I would also like
to give you a more ample definition

28
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:41,772
of hydrometeorological hazards.

29
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:44,541
What you can see here is
why the flood definition

30
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:49,142
was more in terms of
a physical quantity: abundant water.

31
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:53,900
The hydrometeorological hazard also includes
the aspect of consequences,

32
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,902
so damage or a disruption to culture,
human lives, or similar.

33
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:04,492
Let's take a quick look back
at the historical dimension of flooding.

34
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:08,324
Flood has always kept
the minds of people busy,

35
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:12,977
and it has always been an event
that was discussed in culture.

36
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:18,127
The most common reason for flooding
is a high rain intensity,

37
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:23,296
or the duration of precipitation
exceeding absorption capacity

38
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:25,668
of soils and surface waters.

39
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:29,592
But it can also be caused
by storm surges at the coast.

40
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:34,192
Blocking of rivers is another mechanism
that can cause flooding.

41
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:38,902
So you don't necessarily have to have
an abundant input of water;

42
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:42,382
it is also a common cause of flooding

43
00:02:42,382 --> 00:02:45,954
that something blocks
the drainage of water in rivers.

44
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:50,163
One interesting example
for a cause of flooding is a tsunami,

45
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:55,923
because the origin is the earthquake
that generates the wave.

46
00:02:55,923 --> 00:02:59,332
But when the wave hits the land,
it causes large flooding.

47
00:02:59,332 --> 00:03:03,623
So sometimes tsunamis are seen
as a hydrological event,

48
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:07,503
and sometimes they are also seen
as a geophysical event.

49
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:12,798
Another man-made disaster
related to flooding

50
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:15,494
are dam overflows and dam failures.

51
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:18,418
As introduced, an important mechanism

52
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:21,429
of flood formation is heavy precipitation.

53
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:25,908
Here we look at an example
from the 2005 flood in Switzerland.

54
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:28,539
You see here the rain intensity,

55
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:32,108
or the total accumulated rain
over four days.

56
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:38,267
We get the values
up to 300 mm in these areas,

57
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,105
maximum precipitation over four days.

58
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:46,584
When you compare this to typical values

59
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:49,394
of yearly precipitation in Switzerland,

60
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:53,304
that range between 500 and 2000 mm,

61
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:58,250
you can see how extreme
this event was with respect

62
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,289
to generating a lot of water
in a very short amount of time.

63
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:07,515
The disposition of the soils
in the catchment is very important,

64
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,830
something that is not often looked at.

65
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,496
We see here an example
of a small catchment in Switzerland

66
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:17,748
that was analyzed in detail
to show how much water

67
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:21,996
the soils could store away
before producing runoff.

68
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:25,462
This was before the 2005 event.

69
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:28,727
What we see here 
are areas that can only hold

70
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:33,523
as much as 40 mm of rain input,
while next to it,

71
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:39,069
there's also soils that can hold
much more water, up to 200 mm.

72
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,929
So depending on the distribution,
and the relative distribution

73
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:47,546
of soils with a lot
of water-holding capacity,

74
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:51,403
and those 
with a low water-holding capacity,

75
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:54,541
the same precipitation event may cause

76
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,964
a completely different response
of the catchment,

77
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,663
and this is important
to take into consideration.

78
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:04,411
What also sometimes happens is
that this is a function not only

79
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:09,201
of the previous precipitation,
but also of previous dryness.

80
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:14,744
Very often it is observed
that very dry soils will not be able

81
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:19,887
to absorb a lot
of heavy precipitation initially

82
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:23,760
because they need to be wet first
for the rain to infiltrate.

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,103
So it can happen that very dry soils

84
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:29,945
produce runoff from precipitation
immediately.

85
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:33,344
We distinguish between damages

86
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:36,988
and actually beneficial
consequences of flooding.

87
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:39,756
Within the damages,
we can talk about direct damages,

88
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,797
such as drowning
or infrastructure failures.

89
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:47,307
Just imagine a flood hitting a house,
and the house collapses.

90
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:48,805
Then you can easily imagine

91
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:52,342
that the collapsing house
will cause fatalities.

92
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:57,046
Other direct consequences
include infrastructure failure

93
00:05:57,046 --> 00:06:01,757
on a larger scale, such as bridges
which then inhibit also

94
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:06,235
the teams to come in and to help people.

95
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:10,118
Indirect consequences or damages are often

96
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:12,903
even more important
than the direct damages,

97
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:16,808
in particular, because
heavy flooding often damages

98
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:20,343
the drinking water and sewage systems.

99
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:22,497
As a consequence of that,
waterborne diseases,

100
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:25,702
such as cholera and typhus,
may spread more easily,

101
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:30,833
and as a long-term consequence,
flooding may lead to famines.

102
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:35,190
On the other hand, you also have
significant benefits from flooding,

103
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,464
in particular, during ancient times.

104
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,773
The fertilization that was caused
through regular flooding

105
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:45,358
in the Nile, Euphrates, Ganges,
or Yellow River catchments

106
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:49,102
has been very important
for their respective cultures to develop.

107
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:51,797
Talking about consequences of flooding,

108
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:57,255
it's worth mentioning the worst
flooding event in known history.

109
00:06:57,255 --> 00:07:02,990
That happened in China, in 1931,
and killed approximately 3 million people.

110
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:08,467
This shows you how devastating
an individual flood can be.

111
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:12,997
But it's also worth mentioning
that floods occur very regularly

112
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:15,920
and affect large numbers of people.

113
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,060
In the next few slides,
we will see concrete numbers

114
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,910
of how flooding, in comparison
to other natural hazards, affects people.

115
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:29,062
The numbers, they are not always
consistent between each other,

116
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:33,485
because there are differences
in how individual organizations

117
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,039
count consequences of flooding.

118
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,896
Sometimes an event
is attributed to flooding,

119
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:44,265
or to a hydrometeorological event
such as a storm,

120
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:47,698
and therefore sometimes
different statistics result from that.

121
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:49,937
But the main message is quite clear,

122
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:54,047
that a lot of people are regularly
affected by flooding.

123
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:58,993
So in this slide we see a statistics
of flooding comparison

124
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:00,978
to other natural hazards.

125
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:05,455
it is important to realize
that the purple color

126
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:09,225
is the average between 2001 and 2010,

127
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:12,682
while the pink color is
an individual year 2010,

128
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:16,367
which happens to be, in fact,
quite close to the average,

129
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,384
which is not always the case.

130
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,964
What this graph shows you is
that we have flood here, in the middle,

131
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:29,307
that the total number of affected people
is always very large for flooding,

132
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:32,559
when compared to other natural hazards.

133
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,639
The only two that generate
comparable numbers

134
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:40,714
are drought and storms, and, again,

135
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:44,536
sometimes storms are also counted
as floods and vice versa,

136
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:49,812
because very often the consequence
of the storm is a flood.

137
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:56,140
On the other hand, if we see
on the right-hand side of this graph,

138
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,558
the total number of fatalities
is typically not as large

139
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:04,308
for flooding events
than for geophysical events

140
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:07,837
such as earthquakes and tsunamis.

141
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:11,983
For Switzerland, we have
very good statistics with the years

142
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:17,538
that allow you to distinguish
within hydrological natural hazards

143
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:20,795
between floods, debris flows, landslides,

144
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:23,957
and then rock fall, apart from that.

145
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:27,095
You can see in this graph that flooding

146
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:30,043
is occurring quite regularly
in Switzerland,

147
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:33,994
and that it dominates
economic loss in that country.

148
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:37,220
Now I would like to talk
about two examples,

149
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,633
two particular events, that occured--

150
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:42,444
one in Switzerland, and one in Pakistan,

151
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:45,527
and compare those two events
to each other.

152
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:48,128
For the Switzerland case,
we have already looked

153
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:52,249
at the rain input,
it was the flooding of 2005,

154
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:56,639
which was a 100-year event,
approximately.

155
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,831
What does that mean?

156
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,893
A 100-year event means that it has

157
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:04,220
an approximate return period
of 100 years.

158
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,573
So that means that, on average,

159
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,816
you expect a flood of similar magnitude

160
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:12,985
to occur every 100 years.

161
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:15,658
Of course you can have
two or three centuries in a row

162
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,189
where you don't have such a flood,

163
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:19,859
and then you can get
two or three of these floods

164
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:21,328
within one decade.

165
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:25,265
So this 100-year flooding in 2005

166
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:29,702
in Switzerland caused six fatalities

167
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:35,278
and a total damage of three billion
Swiss francs in economic loss.

168
00:10:36,275 --> 00:10:38,153
This is significant.

169
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:41,843
But now let's look
at the Pakistan example.

170
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,268
As you can see from the map,

171
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:48,576
the flood in Pakistan was larger
in terms of the area

172
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:51,008
that was affected by the flooding.

173
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:52,946
But it wasn't that much larger,

174
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:57,563
so you can see a scale of 500 km.
in the bottom of the slide,

175
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:00,611
and you can compare to Switzerland,

176
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:06,291
which has an extension of
about 200 km across the Alps.

177
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:11,872
Now, if you compare these two floods,
in terms of their return period,

178
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,942
then they are comparable.

179
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:19,462
Both of them had a precipitation input
that you expect to occur

180
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:22,322
once in about 100 years.

181
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:27,656
And that translates also
to runoff magnitudes

182
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:32,446
that you expect to occur
with a same return period,

183
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:35,144
so about once in a 100 years.

184
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:39,088
When we now look
at the 2010 flooding event

185
00:11:39,088 --> 00:11:41,613
in the Indus Basin, in Pakistan,

186
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:45,377
which extended to neighboring areas
such as China,

187
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:49,325
then we have a total number
of fatalities of 6,000 people,

188
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:53,814
and we have 50 billion
US dollar damage.

189
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:57,110
This is almost three
orders of magnitude more.

190
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:59,917
So far we have been
concentrating on flooding,

191
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:02,330
because on a global scale this is

192
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,570
the most important
hydrological natural hazard,

193
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,754
but on a local scale,

194
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:11,147
there are other natural hazards
that are quite important.

195
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,558
What is important
to consider with all types

196
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:16,988
of hydrometeorological natural hazards

197
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:22,035
is that they may experience an increase
in the context of climate change,

198
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:25,820
and therefore they need
to be looked at in quite some detail.

199
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,658
Towards the end of this video,

200
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:31,060
I would like to talk
about cascading hazard events.

201
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,273
What is a cascading hazard event?

202
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:37,190
It is when one natural hazard
triggers another one

203
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,014
with potentially even larger damage.

204
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:44,442
So you could talk about it
as if that was a more extreme event.

205
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:48,909
A very famous example is Fukushima, 2011,

206
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:53,563
when a subsea earthquake caused a tsunami,
and that led, at the end,

207
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:57,096
to the breakdown
of nuclear infrastructure in Japan,

208
00:12:57,096 --> 00:13:00,256
with well-known catastrophic consequences.

209
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:03,783
An important feature
of these cascading hazard events

210
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,098
is that they are
very difficult to forecast,

211
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:10,824
simply because the exact
mechanistic understanding

212
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:14,798
of how they are connected to each other
is very often not available.

213
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:16,443
At the end of this video

214
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:19,761
I would like to summarize
four important points.

215
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:23,093
Point one: Floods have always been, are,

216
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,011
and will in the future be
major disruptive events,

217
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:30,131
that can kill people,

218
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:33,608
that can disrupt
the functioning of a culture,

219
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:39,314
but they can also have
potential positive consequences.

220
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:43,911
Floods, avalanches, and debris flows
are all hydrometeorological hazards

221
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:47,998
that occur because
of an excess in water input.

222
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:51,841
We learned about different mechanisms,
how they can be formed,

223
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:55,747
and said that it's not always
only an excess input of water.

224
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:59,511
But remember, too much water
at a place where it should not be

225
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:01,557
is the cause for flooding.

226
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:06,550
Floods typically occur
on quite short time scales,

227
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,061
but the consequences,
they can last for a long time.

228
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:13,923
They can last a whole season,
or even a whole year.

229
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:15,942
As you all know, our climate is changing,

230
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:19,708
and those changes are rapid
in some areas of the world.

231
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:24,291
Therefore, with the potential
of hydrological natural hazards

232
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:28,012
being heavily impacted
by those climatic changes,

233
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:30,107
we need to study them carefully.
