Seismic Risk: Overview and Calculation Models

2
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,927
Hello. This is João Almeida again.

3
00:00:07,927 --> 00:00:10,792
In one past video, 
I told you about seismic hazard

4
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:15,954
and how it could be expressed
by using different intensity parameters.

5
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:18,534
Additionally, I mentioned 
that seismic hazard

6
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:22,505
was one of the components
required to compute seismic risk.

7
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:26,723
In this video, I will tell you about
the other components,

8
00:00:26,723 --> 00:00:29,525
namely, exposure and vulnerability,

9
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:32,145
and briefly explain 
how they all come together

10
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:34,806
to obtain a measure of seismic risk.

11
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:38,409
I will also give you some examples 
of databases and tools

12
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:43,105
that are currently available to compute
components and risk in general.

13
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:47,577
Seismic risk can be defined as
"the probability of losses

14
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:51,413
of different types, due to earthquakes
in a particular region

15
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:54,112
over a future time period."

16
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:57,059
Ultimately we are interested
in developing models

17
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,177
that help us estimate 
the probability of loss

18
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:04,039
due to a seismic event 
that has not yet occurred.

19
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:06,860
To do so, we need to identify and assess,

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,771
individually, each of the components
that together make up seismic risk.

21
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:14,782
These components are:

22
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:19,772
the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.

23
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:24,111
The seismic hazard 
was discussed in detail in week one.

24
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:28,861
For what concerns exposure, 
these two photos illustrate the concept.

25
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,392
They were taken from the same area.

26
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,694
On the left, back in 1930,
and on the right, more recently in 2005.

27
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:39,808
It is apparent that unlike seismic hazard,

28
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,734
exposure can be highly variable in time.

29
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:47,533
Measures of exposure can include 
the number of people, GDP,

30
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,345
buildings or others.

31
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:50,755
And they are described by groups

32
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:55,155
according to their geographical location,
taxonomy, and value.

33
00:01:55,775 --> 00:02:00,313
Exposure models are based on 
global population distribution databases

34
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:04,364
that consider both urban and rural areas.

35
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:07,368
The data sources are censuses and surveys

36
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:11,234
gathered at political
or administrative units level.

37
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:15,644
Various georeferenced 
global databases exist.

38
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:19,344
They are generated with different methods.

39
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:23,055
The project, Gridded Population
of the World (GPW),

40
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,457
was the first main effort to create

41
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:29,038
a global georeferenced 
population data set.

42
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:34,458
Available population data at the lowest 
sub-national administrative unit,

43
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:38,658
is assigned uniformly 
across all the grid cells of the unit,

44
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:43,490
without consideration of the type of area,
urban or rural.

45
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,499
By contrast, the LandScan
Global Population Database

46
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:51,774
distributes national populations 
following a model that takes into account

47
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:56,501
different coefficients of population
depending on the type of land cover.

48
00:02:56,501 --> 00:03:01,102
The use of aerial photography
and high resolution satellite imagery

49
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:03,821
helps to improve the collected data.

50
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:07,552
This database also considers 
the average movement of individuals

51
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:11,922
over 24 hours,
the so-called <i>ambient population</i>.

52
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:16,727
Finally, the Global Rural-Urban 
Mapping Project (GRUMP)

53
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:20,374
combines the GPW
with census and satellite data

54
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:24,237
in order to build higher resolution
gridded population data

55
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,636
of urban and rural areas.

56
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:32,236
Exposure can also be expressed 
in terms of the gross domestic product.

57
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:36,208
The World Bank created 
a global gridded distribution of GDP

58
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:40,199
using GRUMP high resolution 
population data.

59
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,838
It includes the sub-national 
gross regional product, where available.

60
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:48,385
Finally, building exposure models
should take into account

61
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:51,556
not only the different 
characteristic building typologies

62
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:55,965
that can be found around the world,
but also at the local scale,

63
00:03:55,965 --> 00:04:00,008
as these photos taken from
the same city illustrate.

64
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:04,241
The United States Geological Survey
PAGER system,

65
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,757
to which I will come back 
later in this video,

66
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:08,620
provides a building inventory

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,379
with residential buildings' 
top distributions

68
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:14,339
available for different countries.

69
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:18,710
It uses a variety of sources
such as UN-HABITAT,

70
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:23,277
housing census, published literature, 
expert opinion, and so on.

71
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:26,418
Finally, reference should also be made

72
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:30,378
to the Global Exposure Database
of the Global Earthquake Model,

73
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:33,177
which I will also introduce in this video.

74
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:36,376
The database structure is made 
for accommodating buildings

75
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:41,322
and people data from the country level,
to the individual building level.

76
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,963
In the first version, the information
on people and the number,

77
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:46,986
built area and reconstruction cost

78
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,743
of residential
and non-residential buildings,

79
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:53,235
is aggregated 
at the one kilometer resolution.

80
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:57,262
Data on single buildings 
are accessible for some areas.

81
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:00,745
This availability 
will become greater with time.

82
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:05,024
In a nutshell, exposure expresses 
the locations, characteristics,

83
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:08,589
and the value, count, or area of the assets.

84
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:11,836
We can now address 
the last component required

85
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:15,466
to compute seismic risk:
vulnerability.

86
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:19,868
Vulnerability can be quantified
by a vulnerability function,

87
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:25,070
which describes the distribution of loss,
such as fatalities or repair costs,

88
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,287
with increasing intensity measure levels.

89
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,073
I recall that such intensity 
measure levels

90
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:35,371
express the seismic hazard,
as discussed in week one.

91
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:39,969
When sufficient data is available,
vulnerability can be further

92
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:44,522
desegregated into fragility,
and consequence functions.

93
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:48,068
Fragility expresses the distribution
of physical damage,

94
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:50,770
given an intensity measure level.

95
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,060
This graph illustrates this point.

96
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,815
For any value of observational intensity

97
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,591
in the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale,

98
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:02,721
one can obtain the fraction of buildings
that are expected to show

99
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:07,950
one of the five physical damage states
indicated in the horizontal axis,

100
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,103
which range from negligible to collapse.

101
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:15,632
Given one such damage state,
a consequence function,

102
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:19,319
as exemplified in this figure,
can then be used to obtain

103
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,524
the distribution of loss,
herein expressed, for instance,

104
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:26,364
in terms of repair to replacement cost.

105
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:30,350
On the right we can see another example
of a consequence function,

106
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,665
where the number of buildings 
heavily damaged

107
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:36,375
are related to the number of fatalities.

108
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:40,545
In other words, vulnerability 
can be assessed directly

109
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:44,807
as an independent component,
or then as the aggregation

110
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:47,988
of these two sub-components.

111
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:51,588
The approach to be followed will depend on
the availability of data

112
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:54,348
for the particular region under study.

113
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,077
There are roughly three categories

114
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:58,828
of methods to develop
the corresponding models:

115
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:03,648
empirical, analytical, 
or those based on expert opinion.

116
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:08,481
When assessed independently, 
vulnerability is typically based

117
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:12,699
on expert opinion
or on an empirical method.

118
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,379
One can think of an example
of expert opinion as the best estimates

119
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,090
given by a group of similar 
earthquake engineering specialists,

120
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,601
on the ratio of repair cost 
to replacement cost,

121
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:27,010
for different building typologies.

122
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,705
Their weighted mean,
based on the experience

123
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:32,452
and confidence levels
for each building class,

124
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,052
is an expedite way 
to obtain vulnerability functions,

125
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:41,066
that can be used in situations 
when damage data is not available.

126
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:44,384
However, its reliability 
in terms of producing

127
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:48,622
realistic estimates of loss,
is necessarily debatable.

128
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:53,814
On the other hand, this figure illustrates
a very simple empirical method

129
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,982
to determine vulnerability.

130
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:59,784
It estimates losses, 
shown in terms of number of deaths,

131
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:02,744
with magnitude from past observations.

132
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:07,235
The drawbacks of this approach are evident
as it doesn't take into account

133
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:10,716
the different levels of shaking
across the affected region,

134
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:13,825
or the associated 
distribution of population.

135
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,625
Let us now consider the case

136
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,812
where each sub-component
of the vulnerability is evaluated.

137
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:22,373
Expert opinion fragility,

138
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:27,086
which, again, relates an intensity
measure level with a damage state,

139
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:32,491
has a questionable reliability,
but provides damage probability matrices

140
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:35,016
with minimal effort.

141
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:39,353
Empirical fragility is based 
on the observed damage data,

142
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,980
which is then related 
to observed ground shaking.

143
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,469
Ideal sources of data should include
all of the buildings in a given area,

144
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:50,699
including the non-damaged ones.

145
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:55,950
Finally, analytical fragility resorts 
to the application of numerical models

146
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,051
to estimate the response 
and performance of buildings

147
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:01,921
under increasing levels
of seismic action.

148
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:07,811
Consequence functions are generally 
expert opinion-based or empirical.

149
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:10,772
And they are used 
to convert damage to loss,

150
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:15,343
either in terms of repair 
or replacement cost, or fatalities.

151
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:19,903
In summary, vulnerability expresses
the damage and losses

152
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:23,745
conditional on a given level 
of ground motion intensity,

153
00:09:23,745 --> 00:09:25,572
for certain assets.

154
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:29,351
Finally, the three components,
which we addressed separately,

155
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,313
can then be combined to calculate
the seismic risk.

156
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:36,266
This is the probability of losses 
due to earthquakes.

157
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:40,730
This probability can be obtained
by calculating the probability

158
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,464
of levels of ground motion
(that is, the seismic hazard)

159
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:48,006
to which populations 
or buildings are subjected

160
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:51,424
(defined and classified 
within the exposure model),

161
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,268
and multiplying this 
by the probability of loss,

162
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:59,938
given a level of ground motion
(that is, the physical vulnerability).

163
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:04,888
Social, economic, or political factors
that influence vulnerability

164
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:07,380
should also be taken into account.

165
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,799
One of the most relevant 
global collaborative efforts

166
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,948
of the recent years, 
in terms of providing tools and resources

167
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,519
for the assessment of earthquake risk 
anywhere in the world,

168
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,358
is the Global Earthquake Model, or GEM.

169
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:26,278
OpenQuake is the GEM suite 
of open-source software

170
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,132
for seismic hazard and risk modeling.

171
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:32,612
It comprises the platform 
which allows users to visualize,

172
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:37,434
explore and share GEM's data sets;
tools and models;

173
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:40,711
the engine (which is GEM's
state-of-the-art software

174
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:43,292
for seismic hazard and risk assessment);

175
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:46,421
and a great variety of modeling tools.

176
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:52,362
OpenQuake allows to assess losses
not only for single deterministic events

177
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:55,325
(that is, for specific
earthquake scenarios)

178
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:58,502
but also considering all probable events,

179
00:10:58,502 --> 00:11:02,715
including classical probabilistic 
seismic hazard-based,

180
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:06,955
and probabilistic event-based,
risk assessment.

181
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:09,855
The USGS PAGER, which I mentioned earlier

182
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:12,366
in the context of building inventories,

183
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:17,717
is an automated system that takes in
seismic data from remote sensors

184
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:20,715
following significant earthquakes 
worldwide,

185
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:25,057
and provides fatality 
and economic loss impact estimates

186
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:29,648
within 20 to 30 minutes 
of the earthquake's occurrence.

187
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:34,918
That is well in advance 
of in situ observations or news accounts,

188
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:38,681
and that can hence play
a primary alerting role.

189
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:41,679
Users can also sign up 
for earthquake alerts,

190
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,419
for custom geographic regions,
and magnitude ranges

191
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:50,390
through the USGS 
earthquake notification service.

192
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,395
Other seismic risk tools include

193
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:56,687
the Earthquake Loss Assessment
for Response and Mitigation (QLARM)

194
00:11:56,687 --> 00:12:00,568
which provides loss estimates 
for scenario earthquakes

195
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:03,473
(that is, which are likely 
to occur in the future)

196
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:07,577
and loss estimates for earthquakes
just hours after they happen

197
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,814
anywhere on the planet.

198
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:13,152
Another tool is 
the Earthquake Loss Estimation Routine,

199
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:18,003
developed as part of a European project,
which provides rapid estimation

200
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:23,284
of earthquake shaking and losses
in the Euro-Mediterranean region.

201
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:27,834
In short, what are the main points
that we can take from this video?

202
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:32,705
Firstly, that the seismic risk 
is the aggregation of three components,

203
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:37,834
namely, the seismic hazard, 
the exposure and the vulnerability.

204
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:40,963
The seismic hazard,
as we discussed in a past video,

205
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:43,085
is constant in time.

206
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:44,545
The seismic vulnerability,

207
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:49,586
which is the only factor that as humans
we can actually try to control,

208
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,536
tends to reduce as, fortunately,

209
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:56,324
new structures
are usually safer than old ones.

210
00:12:56,324 --> 00:13:00,259
However, since the exposure 
or the amount of assets

211
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:05,501
present in hazard regions can increase
very significantly over time,

212
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:08,561
the resulting seismic risk can also grow,

213
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:12,882
overshadowing desirable reductions
on the vulnerability.

214
00:13:12,882 --> 00:13:16,901
Finally, we briefly overviewed 
some of the existing software and tools

215
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:21,342
to model and compute seismic risk
or each of its components

216
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,275
which greatly vary 
in complexity and accuracy.

217
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:28,673
The earthquake engineering community
worldwide, has been

218
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:32,132
and will continue
to resolutely work on these models,

219
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:35,313
and on making them 
available to the public.

220
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,253
The reduction of seismic vulnerability

221
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:40,329
must be one common goal of our society.

222
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:42,551
