00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:05,467
Hello!

2
00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:10,009
In this video, we will be discussing
the topic of early warning systems.

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:14,199
After some definitions, we will address
the need for people-centered

4
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:15,699
early warning systems.

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,930
Doctor Holger Frey
from the University of Zurich

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,117
will share his views
on early warning systems

7
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:26,539
in terms of what [their] role, complexity
and crucial elements [are].

8
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,002
Finally, some of the remaining challenges
regarding improvement

9
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:34,140
of early warning systems
will be addressed.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,519
An early warning system
can be defined

11
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:39,939
as the set of capacities
needed to generate

12
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:45,420
and disseminate timely and meaningful
warning information to enable individuals,

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,266
communities and organizations
threatened by a hazard to prepare

14
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:53,680
and to act appropriately
and in sufficient time

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,490
to reduce the possibility of harm or loss.

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,398
Following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami

17
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:03,528
and after the third International
Conference on Early Warning

18
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:05,715
that took place in 2006,

19
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:11,006
early warning systems are considered
effective if they are people-centered.

20
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:16,319
This means that people should be able
to easily understand and access them

21
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,688
in a timely manner.

22
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:22,730
Very importantly, early warning systems
also need to be tied

23
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,719
to specific response actions.

24
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:28,929
Early warning systems 
should be end to end,

25
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:32,647
that is to say, 
encompassing a complete process

26
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:37,282
starting at the hazard assessment
and finishing at the community response.

27
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:42,021
People-centered early warning systems
are composed of four elements:

28
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:46,042
risk knowledge, monitoring 
and warning service,

29
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:49,612
dissemination and communication,
and response capability.

30
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:55,321
Risk knowledge can be built, for example,
by conducting applied research,

31
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:59,534
compiling historical databases,
and performing risk assessments.

32
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,374
Timely early warning systems
are based on forecasts.

33
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:09,535
Those require observational data
and monitoring, modeling,

34
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:11,315
and situational awareness.

35
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:15,357
Additionally, effective 
early warning systems

36
00:02:15,357 --> 00:02:18,677
are those that are embedded
in the risk management plan,

37
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:22,164
specifying the institutional 
and operational arrangements.

38
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,735
The dissemination
and communication elements

39
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:28,784
of a people-centered early warning system

40
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:33,216
refer to the way the warnings are issued,
presented and communicated.

41
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:37,610
The effectiveness also depends
on the content of the message

42
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,831
and the consideration

43
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:41,674
of the target audience
characteristics and needs.

44
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:45,859
Finally, the response capability
of a community

45
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:50,250
depends on the risk perception 
and education of the people

46
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,033
as well as existence of response plans.

47
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:57,014
Many technologies can be used
in early warning systems.

48
00:02:57,824 --> 00:02:59,561
These can be based, for example,

49
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:03,814
on sensors, satellite data 
and GIS, crowd-sourcing and models.

50
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:08,795
Mobile technology allows us 
to warn people through text messages

51
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:12,736
and alarm appliances can allow people
and systems to take actions

52
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:15,547
to protect life and property
from destruction.

53
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:19,337
Even a few minutes of warning
can enable protective actions,

54
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:21,678
such as moving to safe locations,

55
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:25,418
automated systems that ensure
elevator doors to remain open,

56
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:27,988
and power infrastructures to be protected.

57
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,557
With advanced warning,
emergency personnel

58
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:35,360
can start to prepare and prioritize
the response decisions.

59
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:41,081
Moreover, communication sciences,
social sciences, or management sciences

60
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:45,147
can help us to enhance the effectiveness
of early warning systems.

61
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:48,578
And now you will hear Dr. Holger Frey
presenting his view

62
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:50,402
on early warning systems.

63
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:52,952
Dr. Frey is a research associate

64
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:56,751
at the department of Geography
at University of Zürich in Switzerland.

65
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:00,951
One of his research focuses
is on early warning systems

66
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,417
for different mass movement processes

67
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:07,807
in mountain regions
in the Andes, Himalayas, and central Asia.

68
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:12,142
I see early warning system
as a very good opportunity, actually,

69
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:18,421
to complement existing
hazard risk reduction

70
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:20,671
or disaster risk reduction measures.

71
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:24,541
In the past, at least in the field
of high mountain hazards,

72
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:28,070
we had a lot of efforts going towards
the physical mitigations,

73
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,181
<i>structural measures, 
bridges or walls that were built,</i>

74
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:35,002
and early warning system
is really a different kind of system

75
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:37,739
that tries to lower the exposure
and the vulnerability

76
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:40,019
of the exposed population.

77
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,931
Early warning system consists of such
a wide variety of different systems.

78
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:47,013
The most simple system is a person
standing somewhere

79
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:50,331
and observing something with 
a communication device in his hands,

80
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,942
and on the other end of the spectrum
we have really global early warning system

81
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:57,671
for instance, considering tsunamis,
really involving different countries,

82
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,077
different continents,
these are really complex systems.

83
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:02,349
Early warning systems
are highly complex systems

84
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:05,179
because they involve
not only technical components

85
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:09,239
but also institutional,
legal and social aspects.

86
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,019
So if we talk about early warning systems,

87
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,527
very often, we only think
about the technical devices,

88
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:17,557
but actually, it's very important
for successful implementation

89
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:20,022
to also consider 
the institutional context,

90
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:21,672
the legal framework of the place

91
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:25,064
where it is implemented
and also the social aspects,

92
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:27,261
the social components are very critical

93
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:31,189
to finally achieve a positive
and effective response in the end.

94
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:34,770
And because it's so interdisciplinary,
that makes early warning systems

95
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,261
very complex systems.

96
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,929
A fundamental aspect
of every early warning system,

97
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:44,418
basically a prerequirement for having
a successful implementation

98
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:47,129
is a detailed understanding 
of the process,

99
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:49,750
a detailed understanding 
of the hazard situation,

100
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,583
of the risk, of the vulnerability,

101
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,520
so really a good process understanding.

102
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,508
And this is where we need science
and models to understand the system

103
00:05:57,508 --> 00:06:01,563
and also to be able to design, in the end,
successful early warning systems.

104
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,279
On the technological side,
every early warning system

105
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,216
includes measurement sensor

106
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:12,066
that measure any particular value, 
parameter of the environment.

107
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,780
This depends of the type of the system

108
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,820
and typically this involves
not only one sensor

109
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,261
but a bunch of sensor
also to have a redundancy

110
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,401
that are placed somewhere,

111
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:25,101
distributed wherever it is appropriate
to measure environmental parameters.

112
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:27,875
Then we have communication technology.

113
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,967
This means we need communication networks.

114
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:34,307
This can be independent, 
autonomous radio communication,

115
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:36,268
can be satellite communication,

116
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:40,019
can be public communicaiton networks,
as our cell phones, internet, whatever

117
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,891
this depends as well on the system.

118
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:45,380
Then every early warning system
has a center, a data center,

119
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,068
where all the information is collected,
stored, maybe processed,

120
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:53,476
made available to the stakeholders,
to the authorities, to the actors

121
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:57,215
and finally this also the place where 
normally alerts or alarms are emitted

122
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:59,014
or decisions are taken.

123
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:03,353
And in the end, most of the systems
also involve an alert

124
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:05,281
or an alarm network system.

125
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:08,824
This could be sirens, this could be mass 
communication devices, mobile phones,

126
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:11,132
radio, TV, whatever,
this depends on the system,

127
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:15,833
but a certain network to communicate,
or disseminate the alerts or alarms.

128
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,414
And what is crucial and applies
to all these components,

129
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:21,510
these hardware technical components,

130
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,940
is the energy supply because very critical
for early warning system

131
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,487
is that we have at any moment,
under any circumstances

132
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:30,706
sufficient energy to run 
the system, actually.

133
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:34,449
And this is also must be true
on the conditions of a blackout,

134
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:38,369
on the conditions of long-term 
bad weather situations

135
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:41,930
where we don't have much energy available
for solar radiation.

136
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,780
These are crucial
for a successful implementation.

137
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:48,653
Considering the variety of early warning
systems that are available,

138
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:52,490
it's probably not possible
to give an average number of years

139
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,824
that an early warning system can operate.

140
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:58,550
Actually, it is also not even
the need for each early warning system

141
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,904
to have a long-term perspective,
consider situations like a landslide

142
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:06,374
or rockfall situation, 
where it's probably important

143
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,423
that for an imminent case
to have an early warning system

144
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:12,170
but few weeks, few months later
the event happens,

145
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,240
and afterwards, the early warning system
is not needed anymore,

146
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,069
So, there are situations where
it's not really an aim or a requirement

147
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:22,939
of the system to be long-term.

148
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,554
On the other hand, there are of course
systems which really need to have

149
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:30,735
a long-term perspective
and to achieve a long-term perspective,

150
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:34,616
it's important to first
have sustainable financing,

151
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:37,266
also regarding
the maintenance of the system,

152
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,038
second to also really work
with the system, so the authorities

153
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,504
need to constantly use the system, 
to train and also to know what to do

154
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:47,114
in case of an event.

155
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:50,140
And third one is very important
is also to regularly check

156
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,600
whether the system is still adequate, 
whether the hazard situation has changed,

157
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,655
whether the vulnerability,
exposure situation has changed,

158
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:58,403
and if all these reconditions 
are considered,

159
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:01,333
early warning systems
can consist for many years.

160
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,797
In my view, very critical and probably
most critical component is to achieve

161
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:08,705
an effective response by the population.

162
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:13,175
And to achieve such an effective,
positive and good response

163
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:16,909
really involves strong involvement,
strong collaboration

164
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:19,389
with the potentially affected population.

165
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:22,842
So it's not sufficient to only collaborate
with the authorities,

166
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:25,109
this is required as well,
the institutional side,

167
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:28,285
but really, we need to get
in touch with the local population,

168
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:29,595
the local communities.

169
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,127
Especially in many contexts,

170
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:33,790
we are working in contexts
where local population

171
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,741
has low confidence to the authorities,
low confidence to the government

172
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:41,190
and this is where we really need
to inform them, work with them,

173
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,945
train them to achieve a positive repsonse,
also that they see the benefit

174
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:49,951
of the early warning system
for themself and this is really critical

175
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:54,588
and very demanding
and critical aspect of early warning.

176
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,546
Indeed, improving this last mile
of early warning systems

177
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:04,466
was identified by the DRR community
as one of the major gaps to focus on.

178
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:09,306
You will see in the next video 
an initiative aiming to close that gap.

179
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:14,196
In addition to improving the four elements
of people-centered early warning systems,

180
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:18,586
the use of science and technology
should help to take into account

181
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:21,067
the interrelated effects of disasters

182
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:24,641
that occur simultaneously
or accumulate over time

183
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:28,221
through multi-hazards early warning systems.

184
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:31,310
In ths video, we have seen
that early warning systems

185
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,770
should be people-centered

186
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,370
and that they are complex
and interdisciplinary.

187
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,569
Improving the response of communities
through their early involvement is key.

188
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,332
Science and technology
has an important role to play

189
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:46,519
to improve early warning systems

190
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,106
and, in particular, to develop
multi-hazards early warning systems.
