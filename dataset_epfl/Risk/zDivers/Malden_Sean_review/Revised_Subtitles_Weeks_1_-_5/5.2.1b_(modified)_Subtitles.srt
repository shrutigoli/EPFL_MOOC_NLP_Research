1
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:09,536
I am Max Wyss, I started my career
in Switzerland

2
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:14,320
In Zürich, I got a diploma from
the Federal Institute of Technology

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,729
and later became a seismologist.

4
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:21,775
Now I'm retired and I would like
to give back a little bit of my expert

5
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:23,923
knowledge to society.

6
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:29,063
The way I do this is by estimating losses

7
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:32,030
immediately after earthquakes.

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,930
What does immediately mean?

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,959
It means in 30 minutes I make an estimate

10
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:43,471
of how many people are dead,
how many people are injured.

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,180
And that is transmitted
to first responders

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,610
who then can get fast onto the scene.

13
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:55,223
Very first thing that happens is,
the earthquake itself.

14
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:58,873
Houses collapse,
people are hurt, endangered,

15
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:02,578
but in the world,
nobody knows anything about this.

16
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:08,953
Now I get a message by SMS,
I have telephones here, two,

17
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:13,713
so in case one is failing
then the other is still reporting,

18
00:01:13,713 --> 00:01:17,630
and I calculate how many dead,
how many injured,

19
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,653
approximately, that's my estimate.

20
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:25,703
And I transmit this to anyone
who wants to receive this message.

21
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:31,225
The important thing of course is
that first responders look at my message,

22
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,438
what is my message?

23
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:34,189
Look at this slide now.

24
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:37,775
On the left top is the input,

25
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:41,395
epicenter, depth, magnitude,

26
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:44,797
I need to know that to calculate
what's on the top right.

27
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,890
The number of fatalities,
the number of injured

28
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,363
as I think it is and in the middle
we have a map of mean damage

29
00:01:56,363 --> 00:02:00,265
for every settlement in my dataset.

30
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:04,630
The damage to houses is important,
because it's buildings that collapse

31
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,047
that kill people,
the earthquake itself does not.

32
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:11,951
In order to make this calculation,
we have to have information

33
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:14,082
for the whole world.

34
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:18,286
This slide simply shows a black dot
for every settlement that

35
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:19,681
we have in the dataset,

36
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,341
and these are nearly
two million settlements.

37
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,270
What do we know for settlement?

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:31,465
Coordinates, name, number of people
and a model for the buildings

39
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:33,517
present in the settlement.

40
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:37,247
Now I want to tell you quickly
what actually happens.

41
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:43,238
First you see an earthquake happens,
waves are travelling through the earth,

42
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:45,542
and they have to arrive at stations.

43
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,573
That takes a few minutes,
once they arrive,

44
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:53,025
international locations like,
the US geological survey

45
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:58,527
or the center in Germany in Potsdam,

46
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:00,337
calculates the episode,

47
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:03,948
and this is <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>
is latitude, longitude,

48
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,788
<i>Z</i> is depth, <i>M</i> is magnitude.

49
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:11,420
Now we have a first model
of the earthquake itself,

50
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,765
a simple model,
just a point source <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>.

51
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,314
Next now I get that information,
next I have to consider

52
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:22,986
the transmission of seismic waves
through the earth.

53
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:26,978
Sometimes in some places
the transmission is good,

54
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:30,143
in other places less good
and if I know that

55
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,606
I can build that in my program,
it's programmed and I can choose

56
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:38,295
different attenuation, one calls this,
transmission properties.

57
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:43,602
From this I calculate the impact
on the buildings

58
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:50,072
and that is the most important thing
because the impact on the buildings

59
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:55,260
is what make damage to the buildings
if the building collapses it kills people,

60
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,175
its not the earthquake itself.

61
00:03:57,175 --> 00:04:00,473
So I have to know how many people
so the next thing is,

62
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:05,324
the impact on the people
and I calculate the probablity

63
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:07,695
how many are dead,
how many injured

64
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:12,290
and so then, our result are,
building damage

65
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,535
and fatalities and injured.

66
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:21,729
That's the QLARM job and I framed it here
so that you see clearly what the QLARM job

67
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:26,789
is. At the very top is the input I get,
now I framed the part that I do,

68
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,604
and at the bottom you see
the response. It is out of my hands,

69
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:36,754
I then hope that the first responders
and the government, the authorities

70
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:41,470
in the countries affected make the right
decision to the ultimate aim

71
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,913
at the bottom right,
you see, helping the people

72
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:48,817
who have been impacted by this earthquake.

73
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:55,654
So here we have a model of a big city,
big cities are always the top concern

74
00:04:55,654 --> 00:05:00,722
for some people because of course,
big cities are where most people live,

75
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:03,740
big cities are where the greatest
casualties occur.

76
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,165
And it's also a point where one
can go to and say,

77
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,884
"that is the worst case
in this earthquake,"

78
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:13,114
and this is just an example to show you.

79
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:17,803
This case Lima, Peru,
it is close to an earthquake belt

80
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:22,244
so we make a model for a magnitude
8.5 and what do we calculate?

81
00:05:22,743 --> 00:05:28,186
We calculate the mortality,
in each district of the city.

82
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:29,465
What is a district?

83
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:35,696
It's a predefined area of administration.

84
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:40,894
So actually it's not geology,
you would like to have predefined volume

85
00:05:40,894 --> 00:05:45,501
of bad soil or good soil or different
building properties,

86
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:49,038
the villa district is different
from the industrial district,

87
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,128
which is different from downtown
a mixture of buildings,

88
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:55,796
but we don't have that information,
that's what we would like,

89
00:05:55,796 --> 00:06:01,773
so here I just showed you,
how is the mortality to be expected

90
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:05,400
in different administrative districts.

91
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,013
In Mexico, we know, 
everybody knows

92
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:12,829
that there is a trench offshore

93
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:18,776
the western coast of Mexico,
that produces large earthquakes.

94
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:22,696
Historically there has been
a really large earthquake

95
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:27,274
about 500 kilometers in rupture length.

96
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:32,163
So I model an earthquake
that you see here in,

97
00:06:32,163 --> 00:06:38,012
as a rupture of 500 kilometers
and give it a magnitude

98
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:40,106
of approximately nine,

99
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:45,020
magnitude nine is a pretty much
at the upper level, the maximum

100
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,350
that we can expect.

101
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:53,615
And here is a map of mean damage,
red of course terrible situation,

102
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:55,722
blue is minor.

103
00:06:56,494 --> 00:07:00,361
Now I think the value
of a map like this is,

104
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:07,337
that we have an idea
of what should first responders,

105
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:11,863
what should medical people,
hospitals expect to happen,

106
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,733
what should they be ready for?

107
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:18,927
It is also clear that we don't have enough
information to do the best job we could do

108
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:22,841
we could do a much better job
if we had more information.

109
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:28,845
And especially we would like
to calculate losses in hospitals

110
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:33,097
so that the first responders
are not transporting all the injured

111
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:34,626
to the wrong hospital,

112
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:39,369
we would like to calculate
the damage in schools,

113
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:44,111
because the children
are the most precious part of society.

114
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:49,002
And so we think that,
we need better data,

115
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:53,449
and we need support
from the population in getting that,

116
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:59,252
and if we do then we have
very good estimates of future losses

117
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:02,335
of earthquakes that are likely to happen.

118
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:07,135
And we would like the population
and the governments to pay attention,

119
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:13,445
and improve their building structures,
in those places where we expect

120
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:17,212
great damaging earthquakes in the future.
