00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:08,625
Hi, Jacobo Quintanilla is 
the Community Engagement Advisor

2
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,916
at the International Committee
of the Red Cross.

3
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,895
In this video, he will talk 
about ICT innovations

4
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:17,077
for emergency response.

5
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:20,774
Talking about technologies 
for disaster response management,

6
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:25,532
I think we need to start looking
into, first and foremost, how communities

7
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:29,151
use technology and what technology
is in the hands of communities today.

8
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:32,254
Obviously, this question
cannot be answered

9
00:00:32,254 --> 00:00:36,224
without talking about
the role of mobile technology

10
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:38,824
and how mobile technology
has revolutionized

11
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:41,493
the way we understand the world
and the way we communicate,

12
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:44,484
the way people are able
to coordinate around response,

13
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:47,538
share information and start
organizing their own response.

14
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:51,754
There are more mobile phones
than people today.

15
00:00:51,754 --> 00:00:55,364
And I think mobile phones
have helped people tremendously

16
00:00:55,364 --> 00:01:00,584
to share information that is critical
before a disaster happens,

17
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:04,505
and also start organizing
and coordinating their own response.

18
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:08,636
Mobile technology is also enabling people
to demand greater accountability

19
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:11,444
and participation,
not just from their own governments

20
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:14,113
but also from the media
and from humanitarian responders

21
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:16,545
like the International Committee
of the Red Cross.

22
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:21,126
One of the most interesting features
when talking about technology,

23
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:24,326
including mobile technology,
is who has and who has not access

24
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:25,935
to technology.

25
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:29,446
We said there are more mobile phones
than people around the world.

26
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:32,403
That does not mean that every single human
has access to a mobile phone.

27
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:35,765
What happens to those 
who do not have access to technology,

28
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:38,373
particularly mobile phones?
And we can think of the most

29
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:41,763
underprivileged and probably 
most need of assistance

30
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:43,711
who are those who don't have
access to technology.

31
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,421
Think of women, think of younger groups.

32
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:48,870
Think of the elderly,
think of the disabled.

33
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,361
We cannot assume because mobile phone
is pretty much ubiquitous,

34
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:56,560
that that actually affects
and people have access equally.

35
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,491
When we talk about technologies
for disaster response

36
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:02,893
and disaster management,
I think one of the first things

37
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:06,853
that we need to take into consideration
from my community's perspective is

38
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:11,412
how people are able to access energy
and how to reconnect

39
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:12,950
within their own communities.

40
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,452
Something that has emerged
as a big issue, finally,

41
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:19,731
within the humanitarian sector is the role
of energy and connectivity

42
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:22,183
as form of aid in their own right.

43
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:25,582
So we can talk as much as we want
about access to mobile technology,

44
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:28,047
about smartphones,
the internet of things,

45
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,857
but if people, at the time
when they need it the most,

46
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:34,376
cannot trust the mobile phones--
they cannot connect to the outside world--

47
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:37,147
I think we are certainly 
missing a big important point.

48
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:39,400
We need to increasingly,
more and more,

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,708
look into the role of energy connectivity 
and how we can provide energy

50
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:47,579
and connectivity as an enabling factor
for people to be able to coordinate,

51
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,287
to start organizing their response,
to communicate with the outside world.

52
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:55,612
When we look at technologies
for disaster response

53
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:57,684
and disaster management,

54
00:02:57,684 --> 00:03:02,003
we are looking into
the latest emerging technology,

55
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:04,404
we are looking about
the Internet of things,

56
00:03:04,404 --> 00:03:08,233
we are looking at interconnected devices
that are able to transfer data.

57
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:14,244
I think we still need to really
make a strong point

58
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:17,734
for so-called traditional technology
such as radio.

59
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:22,395
Being FM radio or shortwave radio,
in many countries around the world

60
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:25,214
is still the technology
that has proved to work the best

61
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:28,979
for disaster response and to a
certain degree disaster management


62
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,640
in terms of sharing life saving,
useful and actionable information

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,499
for disaster affected communities.

64
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:38,018
This also helps create spaces
for dialogue between local communities

65
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,088
and responders.

66
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:45,588
Being a government and also international
and local humanitarian organizations.

67
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:49,456
And the beauty of radio
is that you don't need to be literate,

68
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:54,068
you don't need to be able
to necessarily own an expensive device.

69
00:03:54,068 --> 00:04:00,267
And this provides the space
for dialogue and conversation.

70
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:03,439
It's not just about we telling them
what they need to know.

71
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,476
It's also about creating
a two-way communication

72
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:09,459
between local communities
and disaster responders.

73
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:15,187
I think we need to
put at the center of anything we do,

74
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:16,879
local communities themselves.

75
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,569
One of the interesting turns
of events in recent years

76
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:27,939
is to reinvigorate the discussion
about the role of local communities

77
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:30,072
as disaster responders,

78
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:32,852
as communities who always respond first.

79
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:38,765
It is interesting that we are calling
attention to this particular issue

80
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:41,285
because it has always been like that.

81
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:45,561
As an interesting part 
that technology brings

82
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:49,402
into this equation is that
finally it seems that we are

83
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:53,124
paying more attention to all the different
questions and capacities

84
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:54,262
that people always had.

85
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:57,292
The difference is that 40 or 50 years ago
in Biafra, people didn't have

86
00:04:57,292 --> 00:05:00,870
the opportunities to make
their voices heard that they have today--

87
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,658
in places like Burundi,
in places like the Philippines,

88
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:06,170
in places like Yemen.

89
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:13,070
There's been a-- particularly since Haiti,
even though people getting online

90
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,742
and collaborating is not something
that happened just from Haiti--

91
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:23,218
but since the earthquake in Haiti
in 2010, we saw an emerging group

92
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:30,280
of volunteer and technical communities
that crafted this new way of working,

93
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,831
what is known as crowd sourcing.

94
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:38,232
So communities online 
that put themselves to tasks

95
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:42,172
to try to really help communities
in need of assistance.

96
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:46,200
Social media is transforming-- 
has transformed-- the world.

97
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,611
Network collaboration,
which is the backbone of the internet,

98
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:53,730
is really transforming the way 
we communicate across the globe,

99
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,419
the way we are able to access knowledge,
the way we are able to share our opinions,

100
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,540
the way we are able to prepare,
respond and recover

101
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,439
from natural disasters
and conflict situations.

102
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:09,799
I think the question is still,
when it gets to social media,

103
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:13,264
is the amount of data 
which is circulating every single day

104
00:06:13,264 --> 00:06:14,613
all around the world,

105
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:17,003
in terms of Tweets,
in terms of Instagram posts,

106
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:19,393
in terms of Facebook messages,
in terms of everything.

107
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:22,804
From disaster preparedness
and disaster management perspective,

108
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:27,343
I think the challenge for communities
is to actually go through

109
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:29,734
what is good from what is accurate.

110
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:35,869
One of the most important factors
to take into consideration is that, yes,

111
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:37,935
the world is a much more 
interconnected place,

112
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:40,105
but do we know better,
do we know more?

113
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:44,628
So it is important to look into 
connectivity and access to social media,

114
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:49,104
not just as a good in it's own right,
the question is the content.

115
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:51,675
What is the water
that goes through the pipes?

116
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:55,255
We have an incredible network
around the world,

117
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:58,065
but what is the content 
that people need to know

118
00:06:58,065 --> 00:07:03,084
at a time when knowing
the right answer to some questions

119
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:05,656
can be the difference 
between life and death.

120
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:08,117
Is there an alternative to social media?

121
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:09,885
That's a very interesting question.

122
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:12,878
We always try to answer in one way.

123
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:15,078
Whatever works in the field.

124
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:17,959
First and foremost,
I think we should not assume

125
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,249
that we understand how people communicate

126
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:22,949
and what questions
they are looking answers for.

127
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:27,068
The most important thing is to go
to the source, to the experts

128
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:29,759
and figure out what works for them
and what doesn't work for them.

129
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,048
And there's not going 
to be a silver bullet.

130
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:33,768
There's not going to be a "killer app",

131
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:35,884
there's not going to be
one solution that fits all.

132
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:38,478
There's always going to be 
a multi-platform, multi-tiered approach

133
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,500
that enables communities 
to communicate and reconnect from within,

134
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,051
to communicate
with humanitarian responders

135
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:48,049
and try to figure out what are
the best solutions.

136
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:51,163
Alternatives to social media--
I think we've seen there's nothing

137
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:54,151
that can replace face-to-face
human interaction.

138
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:57,111
The question is in many emergencies
around the world--

139
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:59,752
and this is less of an issue
in natural disasters--

140
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:03,191
when we are talking about
armed conflicts, face-to-face

141
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,402
it can become a luxury
because of security,

142
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:10,823
because of a many number
of issues with regard to access

143
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,162
doesn't enable us to spend
as much time as we would like

144
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:17,093
to be in close proximity
with disaster efforts

145
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:18,292
in communities.

146
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:25,783
So the question is how we can also
build proximity 2.0

147
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:28,274
using whatever technology may work.

148
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,462
But knowing that technology
is not going to accommodate everybody.

149
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:34,143
It is important that we 
understand how people use

150
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:36,583
technologies and what technologies 
they use and what technologies

151
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,708
they trust.

152
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,574
We just cannot assume 
that in this country,

153
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:43,788
this is going to be the most 
used technology.

154
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:46,664
I think we can assume,
but it is important that we understand

155
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:48,302
as well some of those nuances.

156
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:52,293
Particularly the social cultural 
implications of using modern technologies

157
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:55,003
and who falls and who doesn't fall
through the digital cracks

158
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:57,773
through the gender divide 
and so on and so forth.


159
00:08:57,773 --> 00:09:00,324
I think there's an interesting role
for academia.

160
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:03,891
We're looking at social scientists as well,
looking into helping us understand as well

161
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:10,173
some of these anthropological issues
with regard to how people use technology

162
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:13,193
and how people understand information
and how they communicate.

163
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:15,303
The future of social media?

164
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:18,765
I think we are entering an era
of profound connectivity.

165
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,539
I think-- again, the numbers are
only going in one direction.

166
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:25,870
Everything at some point 
is going to be integrated.

167
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,449
You have the Internet of things,
you have wearable devices,

168
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:32,419
you have anything that you can imagine
is going to be producing data

169
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:39,082
and leaving data trails,
which means that everything

170
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:43,020
is going to be available to people 
to analyze, to visualize it, to share it.

171
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,449
The future is a much more 
integrated place.

172
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:50,149
The numbers are only going 
into one direction.

173
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:54,968
I think there may be as well,
according to different analysts,

174
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:59,409
a cry for greater privacy
and greater opportunity to actually

175
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:03,390
take and extract your data 
and be private.

176
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:06,932
The question is when you look 
at developing countries,

177
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:09,874
do people have the opportunity
to actually raise the concerns

178
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:12,585
with regard to data protection
on data browsing?

179
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:15,346
Do actually people have 
the opportunity to accept

180
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:18,663
or not consent on how 
we extract information from them?

181
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:22,686
And I think that's going to be
one of the most important debates

182
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:23,966
going forward.

183
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:27,666
I think the issue of digital literacy
is also critical.

184
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:32,067
I would stress once again
that it is not about connectivity

185
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,757
and connectivity only.

186
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,296
It's the question: What sort of content
do you create today,

187
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:40,179
and what sort of content people need
to make decisions that affect their lives

188
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:43,197
and to be able to raise 
their voice and concern.

189
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:48,466
In case if someone switches the button

190
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:50,426
and energy and connectivity
goes down--

191
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:52,776
I think we've seen that
in many different places.

192
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:56,105
I think it's a phenomenon
to see how creative and generous

193
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:58,075
communities around the world are.

194
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:02,884
And I think we've seen examples
of different ways where people have

195
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:07,093
really turned situations upside down
by looking into communicating

196
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:08,254
in different ways.

197
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:11,104
People will resort to pen and paper.

198
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:16,175
I remember in the aftermath 
of the triple disaster in Japan in 2011,

199
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,152
if you look at the demographics 
of those who were caught up

200
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:21,296
in the coastal areas,

201
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:24,046
they were people like our parents
and our grandparents,

202
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:26,795
people who do not necessarily
have access to mobile phones.

203
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:29,962
People who don't necessarily 
know how to function

204
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:33,247
a mobile phone or connect to Twitter
or Facebook and so on and so forth.

205
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,616
People resorted in some of those shelters
to basically printing wall papers

206
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,027
and pasting them on the walls.

207
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:43,777
That's the way that people 
access information.

208
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,586
That's the way announcements were made.

209
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:51,276
So let's not just think that technology
is just the silver bullet.

210
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:54,496
It is-- don't get me wrong--
it is certainly transforming

211
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:57,637
and has transformed the world 
in unpredictable ways,

212
00:11:57,637 --> 00:12:00,869
but when the electricity 
and connectivity goes down

213
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:05,689
or a party decides to switch it off,
people will resort to communicating

214
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:09,411
in the most locally relevant ways,
from face-to-face to different messages

215
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:12,607
to motor bikes with messengers,
you name it.

216
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,897
When we talk about technology 
for disaster response

217
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:16,816
and disaster management,
I think it's important as well

218
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,325
that we do not forget language.

219
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:22,407
Most of the technologies 
are written in language,

220
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,707
first and foremost.

221
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:26,937
Those are languages 
that are not for everybody

222
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:28,879
at the same time everywhere.

223
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,057
There's also an issue of how we relate
with local committees and services

224
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:35,086
and how language in many
different locations--

225
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:38,579
of course it becomes a barrier
because we don't understand each other.

226
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,752
There is an interesting development
that has been explored over the last

227
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:48,693
few years but is gaining momentum 
now with regard to machine translation.

228
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:53,914
And companies which are developing
ear piece translators that enable us--

229
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:58,443
you know, you're speaking Russian
and I'm speaking Swahili--

230
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:01,515
to actually be able to communicate
with each other in real time.

231
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:05,993
That can be a fascinating development
in the humanitarian world

232
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,653
because it can somehow help us
to bridge the gap between people

233
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:11,964
who don't speak and understand
the same language.

234
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:17,354
My take on this whole conversation,
very simple, put communities first.

235
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:21,184
Technology is just a fraction 
of what the solution can be.

236
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:24,375
The most important thing
is to understand how communities

237
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,114
themselves are looking 
at trying to erase the problems

238
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:30,756
that we have been facing 
before we arrive and after we leave.

239
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:36,460
For most of the problems that we have,
the technology already exists.

240
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:40,138
The question is the human component 
and what the organizations

241
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:42,549
and communities themselves
do with that technology.

242
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:48,529
It is also important to emphasize
the fact that technology

243
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:52,297
is not accessible to everybody
at the same time everywhere,

244
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,638
that technology is also increasing

245
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:57,308
gaps and inequalities... 
and creating new ones,

246
00:13:57,308 --> 00:14:01,987
and as we mentioned,
I think the most important thing

247
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:05,720
is to try to understand 
and have a more humble

248
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,678
and empathetic take 
on how we look at technology,

249
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:11,878
how we look at communities,
first and foremost,

250
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:15,372
because they are first responders
and they are experts themselves.
