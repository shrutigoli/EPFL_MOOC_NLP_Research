00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,501
Geographic Information Systems

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,521
A Resilient Future: 
Science and Technology

3
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:04,961
for Disaster Risk Reduction

4
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:07,808
This lecture covers 
the most fundamental aspects

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,368
of geographic information systems

6
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:13,806
and actually provides a 
sort of very short summary

7
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:16,861
of another of our online courses

8
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:20,521
called an Introduction
to Geographic Information Systems,

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,641
which is for the time being 
only available in French.

10
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:27,644
We would like to recommend you 
to refer to this online course,

11
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:30,802
if at some point you would like 
to dig further into these matters.

12
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:34,185
I will present the two first parts 
of the lecture

13
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:37,675
on the digitazation 
of the geographical space

14
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:41,645
and the storage of the obtained 
geographical information,

15
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:44,279
whereas my colleague,
Stephane, will then continue

16
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:49,359
with the use of geographical information 
in spatial analysis and visualization.

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,993
The digitization 
of the geographical space

18
00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:56,453
can be seen as a contolled reduction
and simplification process

19
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:59,865
that turns a complex
three-dimensional reality

20
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:03,125
into a flat, north-oriented
representation.

21
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:07,581
This is basically a map only showing 
a limited set of selected features,

22
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:10,561
such as the ski lifts in this example.

23
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:15,595
This means that this process 
depends very much on the thematic content

24
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,437
of the expected result

25
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:20,044
since the features and processes 
to be accounted for

26
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:22,064
need to be chosen adequately.

27
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:27,112
The words "features" and "processes"
drive us very naturally

28
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:31,242
to the two main elements 
of geographical information:

29
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:33,991
on one side,
the crisp, homogeneous features

30
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,171
with a well-defined geometry,

31
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:38,540
such as points, lines or polygons,

32
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,050
which define actually 
the vector or object world,

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,597
and, on the other side, 
processes or phenomena

34
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:48,797
with values that are continuously 
changing over space

35
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:52,567
and are therefore 
best described by grids and values

36
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:55,627
which define the raster or image world.

37
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:58,477
In both cases--vector and raster data--

38
00:01:58,477 --> 00:02:00,757
we need to link 
the descriptive information

39
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:02,817
to a position in space

40
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:06,794
either in the form of the coordinates 
of the vertices of a geometry

41
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,874
or the coordinates of the cells 
forming the grid.

42
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:14,254
These coordinates are defined 
within a projection system

43
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:17,594
that describes 
the mathematical transformation

44
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,555
of the three spherical coordinates

45
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:23,875
(latitude, longitude and distance 
to the center of Earth)

46
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,698
to the two coordinates, 
easting and northing,

47
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:28,828
of the two-dimensional space.

48
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:33,668
Unfortunately the rules of geometry 
show that this transformation

49
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:36,898
cannot be achieved
without loss of information.

50
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:39,096
Any given projection system

51
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:42,936
will only preserve 
simultaneously directions, areas

52
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:46,913
and distances in a narrow, 
6 degree-wide band.

53
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:49,223
This is why each country has its own

54
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:52,223
or several own projection systems.

55
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:53,787
And in turn this explains

56
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:58,757
why GIS software need to be able 
to handle all kinds of projection systems

57
00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:02,107
and convert coordinates 
from one system to another.

58
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,785
The aquisition of position data

59
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:08,925
is fundamentally based 
on traditional land surveying techniques

60
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:13,095
nowadays complemented by the use 
of global positioning systems.

61
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:17,752
The aquisition of thematic data 
can be achieved by direct measurements

62
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:20,940
or by all kinds of airborne techniques

63
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,030
ranging from remote sensing 
to drone surveys.

64
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,780
The provided images 
may need geo-referencing

65
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,120
to fit them at the right place 
and are often used as a support

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,896
to digitize the vectorial
objects of interest.

67
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:40,948
Numerical information on objects 
or phenomena linked to spatial position

68
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:43,520
need to be stored in computer files

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,210
from which the information 
will then be retrieved later on.

70
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:52,425
Geographical information may be stored 
in simple, sometimes semistructured, files

71
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:54,877
with a broad range of file formats

72
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:57,167
both in the vector 
and in the raster world.

73
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:00,149
The most commonly used 
vector file format

74
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:03,719
is probably the set of files 
of the shapefile system

75
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,782
with the <i>.shp</i> files storing 
the spatial information,

76
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:15,287
the <i>.dbf</i> storing the thematic information 
and the shape index <i>.shx</i> file.

77
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:17,015
In the raster world

78
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:20,805
the most widespread format 
is probably the <i>.tiff</i> image format,

79
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:24,039
either with its spatial 
positioning information

80
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,879
embedded in the header of the file

81
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,319
(the so-called <i>GeoTIFF</i> format) or stored 
in a separate file, the world file.

82
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,745
As compared to simple files,

83
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:39,615
a database has the advantage 
of providing a data management system

84
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:41,349
that includes powerful tools

85
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:44,759
to facilitate manipulation 
and querying of the data set.

86
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,878
Databases are also supported 
by software engineering tools

87
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:52,788
used to design and implement 
the sometimes complex data structures.

88
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:58,470
Finally, their major interest is perhaps 
to be well suited to deliver data services

89
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,027
in a client-server architecture

90
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:05,047
when simultaneous and concurrent 
addition processes need to be handled.

91
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:10,237
This is it, and I will now give the floor 
to my colleague Stephane.

92
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,032
The first part of this lecture 
allows to describe the properties

93
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:18,502
of phenomena occurring 
on the surface of the Earth,

94
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:21,508
The spatial distribution
of these phenomena

95
00:05:21,508 --> 00:05:24,438
can be either discrete or continuous

96
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:29,438
and this distinction structures 
spatial analysis into fields.

97
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:32,015
The first one is about object models

98
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:35,885
used to represent and analyze 
discrete spatial distributions.

99
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:40,268
And the second one is about the modeling 
of continuous surfaces

100
00:05:40,268 --> 00:05:44,492
used to represent phenomena 
defined at any position in space,

101
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:47,942
such as altitude or temperature.

102
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,349
Discrete geographic variables

103
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,629
are used to represent 
discrete spatial phenomena.

104
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:57,249
This is the case when the distribution 
of the thematic properties

105
00:05:57,249 --> 00:05:58,899
of a given phenomenon

106
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,809
are discontinuous in the geographic space.

107
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,586
The three types of spacial entities

108
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:06,906
that can represent 
discontinuous phenomena

109
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:11,426
are points, lines, or polylines, 
and polygons.

110
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:14,946
It should be noted 
that the same object may be represented

111
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:18,070
with different primitives, 
according to the scale.

112
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:21,087
The main type of spatial analysis

113
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:23,647
carried out on discrete 
geographic variables

114
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:26,537
is the measure of spatial dependence.

115
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:31,592
In 1970 Waldo Tobler 
proposed the first law of geography

116
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,982
stating that everything 
is related to everything else,

117
00:06:34,982 --> 00:06:38,632
but near things are more related 
than distant things.

118
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:42,945
This law is the foundation 
of the fundamental concepts

119
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:47,265
of spatial dependence 
and spatial autocorrelation.

120
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:50,202
Typical measures 
of spatial autocorrelation

121
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:54,252
include Moran's I, 
Geary's C or Ripley's K.

122
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,927
On the territory these indices

123
00:06:56,927 --> 00:07:00,307
characterize the spatial arrangement 
of geographic units

124
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:03,467
according to the value 
of a given attribute.

125
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,599
Here with the LISA index, for instance,

126
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:09,579
red dots representing 
soil sampling stations

127
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:12,779
with high values 
of potassium concentration

128
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:18,095
significantly resemble each other 
within a spatial lag of 10 km.

129
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:22,717
A phenomenon is continuous 
when it is defined at every point

130
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:24,667
of the geographical space

131
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:28,947
and its properties vary locally 
in a gradual and structured way.

132
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,293
Examples include altitude 
or soil moisture,

133
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:35,673
as illustrated on this map.

134
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:39,243
This type of data 
must be acquired by sampling.

135
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:45,553
Sampling can be random, regular, 
carried out according to a regular grid,

136
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,707
along the transact,
or along the pre-existing network.

137
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:51,322
Once samples are collected,

138
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:54,418
it is necessary to use inference 
and interpolation

139
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:58,648
to extend the values of point data
to the entire area studied.

140
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,578
Among interpolation methods 
are the nearest neighbors,

141
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:06,457
the triangle network, B-spline function,

142
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:09,127
or kriging, for example.

143
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:13,476
The most common 
continuous variable is altitude.

144
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,466
The term <i>altitude</i> is commonly used

145
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:18,616
to mean the height 
above sea level of a location,

146
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:22,176
but in geography the term <i>elevation</i>
is often preferred.

147
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:26,426
The elevation of the geographic location 
is its height

148
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:33,316
above or below a fixed reference point, 
most commonly a reference geoid.

149
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:36,497
A digital file 
containing elevation measures

150
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:39,406
characterizing 
the geo-reference nodes,

151
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:41,736
or cells, of a regular grid

152
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:44,396
constitutes a <i>digital elevation model</i>.

153
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:49,052
There are different ways 
to acquire elevation data.

154
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:54,833
The most common are leveling, 
photogrammetry and laser scanning.

155
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,148
More information about these methods

156
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:01,588
can be found in the MOOC 
"Éléments de Géomatique".

157
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:04,262
Digital elevation models are useful

158
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:07,122
to provide quantitative measures 
of topography.

159
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:13,252
Global indices can be computed 
to characterize a relief in given areas,

160
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:19,109
like mean elevation, mean slope, distance 
between summits of different classes.

161
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:23,346
And specific algorithms
based on different window sizes

162
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,536
are able to locally measure

163
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:27,927
the horizontal 
and the vertical curvature,

164
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:30,817
the slope, or the orientation.

165
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:35,067
All of these indicators 
can be represented on maps.

166
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,514
Digital elevation models 
also make it possible

167
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:42,955
to calculate visible areas
from a given location in the landscape,

168
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:47,415
to carry out shade analysis, 
to calculate solar radiation,

169
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:51,976
to identify drain systems, 
to delimit catchment areas

170
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:54,619
and many other 
terrain analytical functions.

171
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:57,742
After the analytical phase

172
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:01,752
geographic data and derived indices 
must be represented on maps.

173
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:05,467
This representation 
is controlled by rules

174
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:07,968
most of which have been defined 
by Jacques Bertin

175
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:11,448
in the context of the semiology 
of graphics in the seventies.

176
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:14,949
The main goal of the rules 
defined by this semiology

177
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,616
is to build graphical signals 
as effective as possible

178
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:20,646
to communicate information.

179
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:25,386
The main tools of the semiology of
of graphics are a system of signs,

180
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:29,116
on one hand, and visual variables,
on the other hand.

181
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:33,698
This system of signs is composed 
of four visual structures,

182
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:37,351
which are points, lines, 
surfaces and volumes,

183
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:39,571
and whose properties can vary.

184
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:43,039
Then, there are eight visual variables

185
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,449
that can be used 
to differentiate objects in a map.

186
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,840
The use of these variables is limited 
by the ability of the human eye

187
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,690
to see differences.

188
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:57,894
Size differences must be
sufficiently large for map users

189
00:10:57,894 --> 00:11:00,589
to identify high and low values.

190
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:04,979
Not all the variables 
are appropriate for every kind of data.

191
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:09,849
In particular, only size and location 
are truly appropriate

192
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:12,009
for depicting quantities.

193
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,879
Visual structures and visual variables

194
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:18,811
are then supported 
by different components on the map--

195
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:23,785
like a title, a cartographic scale,
a commentary and so on--

196
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:26,955
to improve the transmission of information

197
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:30,072
and participate in the production 
of new knowledge.

198
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:35,494
We have here a few examples to show 
how information on natural hazards

199
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:42,094
is stored and made available in national 
or local regional infrastructures.

200
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:44,857
This example shows the portal

201
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:48,707
to the Swiss geographical 
information infrastructure

202
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:54,837
hosting all kinds of detailed layers
on various sorts of natural hazards.

203
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:01,340
If we look a bit closer to the area 
of Martigny in the Rhône river valley,

204
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:05,378
we can have a closer look 
at the flood-prone areas

205
00:12:05,378 --> 00:12:07,298
with a return period of 50 years--

206
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:10,678
the same thing with a return period 
of 100 years,

207
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:15,077
over bank sedimentation-prone areas, 
debris flow areas,

208
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:19,067
areas that are prone to snow avalanches,

209
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:25,067
rock-fall-prone areas, 
landslide-prone areas, etc., etc.

210
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:31,827
Another example here 
with the canton-wide portal

211
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:37,348
with specific thematic entrances 
showing the danger maps again--

212
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:43,298
danger maps for flooding, 
debris flow, landslides, etc.

213
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:49,370
Here in the area of Lausanne, 
there are basically along the rivers

214
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,540
the most threatened areas.

215
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:58,823
The same thing in the canton of Neuchâtel

216
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:04,143
with thematic entrances to danger maps.

217
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:09,235
The interest of all those danger maps 
being to share the same symbology

218
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:14,615
with a given set of colors 
to describe the different danger levels.
