00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:06,352
Hi.

2
00:00:06,352 --> 00:00:09,045
Cristiano Giovando
is a Technical Project Manager

3
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:12,037
at the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team.

4
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:16,029
In this video, he will talk about
the OpenStreetMap initiative.

5
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:19,710
So, Volunteered
Geographic Information, or VGI,

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,270
is what we like to call community mapping
or crowdsource mapping.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,851
It's basically the community participation
to create the geographic information

8
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:32,350
and create a map.

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,978
We use VGI and crowdsource mapping

10
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:39,888
in different moments
of the disaster response cycle.

11
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:45,280
Community mapping, or VGI, was used
by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,760
in Nepal during the 2015 earthquake,

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,949
to create an open map that then was used
by responders on the ground.

14
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:59,250
Before that, and during
the years before 2015,

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,330
the community in Nepal
started learning about OpenStreetMap,

16
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,635
and produced tools and capacity

17
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:13,235
to build around OpenStreetMap.

18
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:16,516
And so when the disaster happened in 2015

19
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:19,292
they actually had already the knowledge

20
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:24,248
of how to apply OpenStreetMap
for rapid disaster mapping.

21
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:28,684
Recently, in April of 2016,

22
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:31,424
we had the strong earthquake in Ecuador,

23
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:35,021
and 2,000 volunteers
from the OpenStreetMap community

24
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:37,973
came together in just less than a week,

25
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:42,793
and they mapped 95%
of all the affected areas

26
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:44,683
with OpenStreetMap.

27
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:49,422
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team
applies the concept of open source

28
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:52,582
and OpenStreetMap
to humanitarian response.

29
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:56,992
We develop tools that are open source,
like the Export tools,

30
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,179
or the Tasking Manager,
or open area map,

31
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:06,282
which all support different sets
in the cycle of disaster response.

32
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:08,843
The Tasking Manager
is another open source tool

33
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:11,513
developed by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap,

34
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:15,783
and it allows to coordinate
thousands of volunteers that come online,

35
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:21,076
and they try to map areas of the world
in a coordinated way.

36
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:22,844
It's open source.

37
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:27,124
We believe that open source
is the most sustainable way

38
00:02:27,124 --> 00:02:32,686
for communities to participate and to make
disaster response more effective.

39
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:36,456
OpenStreetMap, as someone called it,
the "Wikipedia of maps,"

40
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,386
is an open geographic
database of the world.

41
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:43,037
Anyone can contribute to OpenStreetMap,

42
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:47,196
and contributors might be volunteers,

43
00:02:47,196 --> 00:02:50,066
or at the same time
might be paid surveyors,

44
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:55,166
might be employees
of navigation companies

45
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,940
that want to improve
the database that they all use.

46
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,075
So, OpenStreetMap is different from VGI

47
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:06,435
in the fact that it doesn't just employ

48
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:11,311
or it doesn't use volunteer data,
volunteer contributor data,

49
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:14,351
but it also works with governments

50
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,881
that want to use
OpenStreetMap as a platform,

51
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:23,152
and so they use it as a way to contribute

52
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:25,972
through their different departments,
different surveyors,

53
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:31,892
that see OpenStreetMap as a way
to maintain their maps updated.

54
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:37,932
We have seen several instances
of OpenStreetMap being used

55
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:41,872
as a platform for doing research,

56
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:46,072
and also to support
some citizen science projects.

57
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:49,671
A good example of this is Wheelmap.

58
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:55,269
Wheelmap is a project that allows
to explore any area in the world

59
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,097
and understand what are
the barriers to accessibility,

60
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:03,563
and what are, for example,

61
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:07,445
areas that are, in fact,
more accessible than others.

62
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:12,163
OpenStreetMap is an open database,

63
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:15,434
it fosters the concept of open data,

64
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:19,172
and we believe that open data

65
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:22,702
is more sustainable
for several of the projects

66
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:26,222
that Humanitarian
OpenStreetMap carries out.

67
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:30,603
We believe that open data
brings many benefits

68
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,003
to the communities that use it.

69
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:36,659
For example, it makes
the process of collecting data,

70
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:40,749
and using the data, more transparent.

71
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:46,593
So, when communities
are engaged in collecting data

72
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:48,783
through an OpenStreetMap project,

73
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:51,372
for example, they also feel
more empowered.

74
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:55,932
So, having open data
gives them the opportunity

75
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:58,632
to own the data set, to own the map,

76
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,013
that then they see being made
for their community.

77
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:04,432
Another thing the open data provides

78
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:08,192
is an easy way for innovators,
for companies,

79
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:13,733
to use data sets that might
otherwise be inaccessible,

80
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,673
and create innovation
based on these open data sources.

81
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:21,783
The other great aspect of open data,
and, in particular, of OpenStreetMap,

82
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:25,483
is the fact that the data can be updated

83
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:29,313
and kept fresh by the volunteers
and by the community.

84
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:33,122
Things that, if you're looking
at a closed data set,

85
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:36,939
it might take years
before that department goes through

86
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,569
and updates that same data set.

87
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:44,279
And with OpenStreetMap,
anyone today can go and update the map,

88
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,062
anywhere in the world.

89
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:51,482
Not necessarily open data is free
and open for anyone to use.

90
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:54,914
There are some different types of licenses

91
00:05:54,914 --> 00:06:00,084
that govern the way
of how open data can be used,

92
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,533
and this is really important.

93
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:05,613
There are some open data licenses
that are completely free and open,

94
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:10,195
which means anyone can use
the data for any reason,

95
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:14,124
and the most common one,
the most famous one

96
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:19,014
is the Public Domain,
or CC0, Creative Commons Zero License.

97
00:06:19,014 --> 00:06:21,124
Other open data licenses,

98
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:27,034
for example, like the CC BY,
the Creative Common Attribution,

99
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:30,806
requires that, whoever uses
the data for any application

100
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:34,896
provides an attribution
of the source of the data.

101
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:39,544
Licensing is definitely an aspect

102
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:42,424
that, in some ways,
constrains the use of open data,

103
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:47,643
or at least it provides a framework
for how to use open data correctly.

104
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:52,625
The other way that we can
use open data more efficiently

105
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,967
is through international standards
for interpretability.

106
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,265
And so when data is made open,

107
00:06:58,265 --> 00:07:03,845
it's also more effective if it's actually
used and shared through these standards,

108
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:08,153
otherwise it might be
put somewhere on a web server

109
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:11,153
through a closed zip file,

110
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:17,737
and then it might be hard to access
or get fresh updates of that data set.

111
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,326
Some data in open data set

112
00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:25,076
might carry some sensitivity
and security implications.

113
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:30,308
OpenStreetMap, for example, maps sites
that are considered sensitive,

114
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:34,500
for military aspects,

115
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:37,073
or, for example, during disaster response,

116
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:43,230
it's important that high level of details
of certain areas may be protected

117
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,788
and not exposed through a public data set.

118
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:52,040
The good thing of OpenStreetMap
in this regards is that it's a community.

119
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,169
So, when we work with a community,
for example, during disaster response,

120
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,481
we also try to understand
what are the needs,

121
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:04,129
and, at the same time,
what are the levels of details

122
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:06,729
that we can, and we should map

123
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,828
through a community response effort.

124
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:12,141
So, we always work with the community,
with the local community,

125
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:17,102
and try to understand that, in order
to protect the privacy and security

126
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:19,752
of the people on the ground.

127
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:21,392
With Humanitarian OpenStreetMap,

128
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:24,962
we actually want to make sure
that the data that we produce

129
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,923
is used on the ground
or by disaster responders

130
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:30,933
using GIS and mapping tools.

131
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:37,601
So, we created facilitating tools
for making this process easier.

132
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,923
One of these projects
is called Export Tools,

133
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:45,511
and it allows anyone to define
an area on the map,

134
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:48,581
select the features
that they want to download

135
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:51,632
and convert into a shapefile, or a KML,

136
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,772
or any familiar GIS format,

137
00:08:53,772 --> 00:09:00,341
and easily download it,
and that data set is updated hourly,

138
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:06,302
so that data is fresh as it gets updated
by the volunteers in OpenStreetMap.

139
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:09,063
OpenStreetMap is a critical tool

140
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:12,563
to disaster response
and disaster preparedness.

141
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:14,412
It actually allows to create maps

142
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:19,248
that otherwise would take
a long time, maybe years to create.

143
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:22,722
By harnessing the power
of the online community

144
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:24,012
and the local community,

145
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:27,842
we're able to combine
a massive amount of data

146
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:31,062
that is created through
satellite image interpretation

147
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,262
with the local knowledge.

148
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:38,283
For example, to add
the conditions of the buildings,

149
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:44,155
or street names,
or anything that cannot be extracted

150
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:47,482
by analyzing satellite information.

151
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:51,293
One of the challenges
that OpenStreetMap is facing right now

152
00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:55,123
is also a consequence of its size,

153
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:58,952
in that there's a lot of data
inside OpenStreetMap;

154
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:03,293
there are over 50 gigabytes of data
currently in the OpenStreetMap database,

155
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:08,801
almost 200 million buildings
being created everywhere in the world.

156
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:12,632
So, one challenge is to really
visualize and understand

157
00:10:12,632 --> 00:10:16,392
what is the impact of the OpenStreetMap
community around the world.

158
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:18,934
We recently created a tool

159
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:25,624
that is able to quickly scale
and bring to a web browser

160
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:29,214
these visuals of the impact
of the OpenStreetMap community.

161
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:31,183
It's called OpenStreetMap Analytics,

162
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:35,043
and it's available online now
as a beta platform,

163
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:40,783
but it really allows you, and anyone,
even without the OpenStreetMap knowledge,

164
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:44,024
to understand the impact
of the OpenStreetMap community

165
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:46,594
anywhere in the world, over time.

166
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:48,550
Another challenge and innovation

167
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,070
that we see possible
for the OpenStreetMap community

168
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,856
is to enrich the availability of imagery

169
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,806
through which the map is being created.

170
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:05,397
We rely a lot on satellite imagery,
and now on our own imagery,

171
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:09,740
to trace that information
and add it to OpenStreetMap.

172
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:16,434
Unfortunately, not much
of the satellite data is being made public

173
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,906
and openly available for anyone to trace.

174
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:23,966
That normally happens
during disaster response operations.

175
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:29,006
But we believe that also
with the new revolution

176
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:33,127
in earth observation
provided by drone mapping,

177
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:38,238
we believe that there's going to be
a need for coordinating the collection

178
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:43,087
and in sharing of imagery
that is becoming more and more available.

179
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:47,476
So, we built an open aerial map,
which is an online repository

180
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:51,365
of open source
and openly licensed imagery,

181
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:53,916
where everyone
in the OpenStreetMap community

182
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:58,418
can go and understand what images
are available for a certain area,

183
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,186
and be able to use it
for tracing and mapping.

184
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:06,866
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team
is a US-based organization

185
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:12,583
which started after the response
to the Haiti earthquake in 2010.

186
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:17,496
After the earthquake, we realized
that the OpenStreetMap community

187
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:22,666
needed a way to coordinate
the mapping response that we provided,

188
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:28,333
and that resulted really useful
on the ground for responders

189
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,505
to understand the impact of that disaster,

190
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:35,656
and also to have a reference base map
for navigating and moving around.

191
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:40,767
After 2010, the Humanitarian
OpenStreetMap Team was born,

192
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:45,366
and right now we have several
staff members all over the world,

193
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:48,157
and we are a distributed organization.

194
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:52,379
And most importantly, Humanitarian
OpenStreetMap is a community,

195
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:55,930
a community of thousands of volunteers
from anywhere in the world,

196
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,627
and they participate
in different local projects,

197
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:02,274
community mapping projects,

198
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:08,408
and when needed they come together
online and build maps quickly.
