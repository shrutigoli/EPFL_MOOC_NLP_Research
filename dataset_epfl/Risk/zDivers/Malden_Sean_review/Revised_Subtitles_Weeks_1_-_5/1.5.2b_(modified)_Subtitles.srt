1
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:08,547
We are at the United Nations in Geneva,
to interview Dr. Robert Glasser,

2
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:11,626
Special Representative 
of the UN Secretary-General

3
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:13,827
for Disaster Risk Reduction.

4
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:17,095
Dr. Glasser is heading 
the United Nations Office

5
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:20,375
for Disaster Risk Reduction, UNISDR.

6
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:24,638
UNISDR is the focal point in the UN system

7
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:27,479
coordinating disaster
reduction activities,

8
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:30,750
and ensuring synergies 
with regional organizations

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,941
in the field of socio-economic development
and humanitarian action.

10
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:38,511
So UNISDR is a UN organization

11
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:43,481
that focuses on supporting
the reduction of disaster risk.

12
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:46,991
And it uses, as its foundation,
an international agreement

13
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:49,760
called the Sendai Framework 
for Disaster Risk [Reduction],

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,554
which countries signed in 2015,

15
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,934


16
00:00:57,914 --> 00:01:02,013
So with that as the basis,
the scope of work involved

17
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:05,623
in implementing the Sendai Framework
to reduce disaster risk is enormous.

18
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:10,115
It ranges from early warning 
and preparedness,

19
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:12,891
and even work within disasters,

20
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:17,491
to incorporating risk reduction measures

21
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,576
as part of core economic 
planning and investment.

22
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:25,095
It focuses on large-scale 
sudden-onset disasters,

23
00:01:25,095 --> 00:01:28,966
protracted disasters, 
slow-onset disasters.

24
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:33,757
It focuses on large-scale, national scale,
sub-national scale,

25
00:01:33,757 --> 00:01:38,518
and it focuses on multiple hazards,
like pandemics,

26
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:41,417
or radiological nuclear reactor meltdowns,

27
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:45,679
or climate change, earthquakes, and so on.

28
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:50,629
So it is such a broad agenda
and in every single one of those areas

29
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:54,525
there are significant needs 
for science and technology.

30
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:57,691
To give you a few examples:
climate change.

31
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:01,808
Climate change is projected as actually 
already having an impact

32
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:04,478
on extreme weather events,
a major hazard,

33
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,061
particularly in developing countries
but in wealthy countries as well.

34
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:12,531
We need to understand better
how climate is going to change,

35
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:13,810
what patterns it will take,

36
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,250
what impacts the release of CO2,

37
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,061
of greenhouse gas emissions, will have
on tipping points in the climate system.

38
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:28,463
We need to understand 
what impact global warming will have

39
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:32,434
on the frequency and severity,
or patterns of El Niño, La Niña events,

40
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:37,822
which are the key source 
of weather variability around the world.

41
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:42,402
So if you just focus on climate change,

42
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:44,103
understanding those dynamics

43
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:47,383
are an enormous challenge for science
as we've seen.

44
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:51,013
If you look at other levels of detail,
if you focus on, say,

45
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:55,215
the impacts of extreme weather, 
like drought,

46
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:57,214
then there are a whole range 
of other issues about

47
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:59,206
"Okay, well how is drought changing?"

48
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:02,974
We understand modeling at a global level,
what about a regional level?

49
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,407
What about a sub-regional level?

50
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:07,194
We can talk about science in terms of

51
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:12,354
"Okay, these places are now going to
experience more droughts more often."

52
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:14,528
How do people adapt to that?

53
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:19,229
Are there different varieties of crops?
Are there water harvesting techniques?

54
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:22,713
What sorts of technologies and approaches
can be brought to bear?

55
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:26,208
And science to be underpinning them,
to be brought to bear,

56
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,729
to help people cope with those things.

57
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,088
If we look at sea level ri--

58
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:34,629
I mean you can go through 
every single hazard that you can imagine,

59
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,573
many of which are exacerbated 
by climate change--

60
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:39,670
including the emergence of new disease,

61
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,661
or re-emergence of old disease,
or pandemics--

62
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:43,673
and there are a range

63
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:47,791
of scientific and technological challenges
that need to be addressed.

64
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,661
The Paris Agreement on Climate Change,

65
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:54,546
the SDG, Agenda 2030 agreement
and the Sendai Framework--

66
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:58,566
all of them have explicit roles
for science and technology.

67
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:01,953
If you look at the SDGs, 
there's a section on technology

68
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:04,822
and science and technology, 
a unique section.

69
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:09,293
Also within many of the development goals,
the Sustainable Development Goals--

70
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:15,427
whether it's energy, ecosystems, 
anywhere, climate change-- you see that.

71
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:20,786
Similarly the COP, 
of course the whole IPCC process

72
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:23,345
is fundamentally integrated with science

73
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:26,514
in terms of some of the isssues 
we discussed a moment ago:

74
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:29,366
modeling climate at sub-regional scale,

75
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:32,516
the impacts on ecosystems
and human settlements,

76
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:34,627
these sorts of issues.

77
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:36,347
And with Sendai as well

78
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:40,339
there's actually a specific objective
on technological cooperation

79
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:42,688
and the role of science is really key.

80
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:45,777
There's a reference to the need
as part of this agreement

81
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:48,647
to bring together 
the science and technology community

82
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:54,000
to develop innovative solutions
to address these issues.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,982
So number one, science and technology 
underpins all three.

84
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:01,978
A practical-- this is maybe more 
at a level of detail--

85
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:04,139
but a practical integration 
between the three

86
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,369
is that the SDGs, 
there's a process under way now

87
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:11,381
to develop indicators 
for each of those goals.

88
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:13,630
And for the Sendai agreement, 
there's a similar

89
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,932
inter-governmental process 
to development indicators.

90
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:20,340
And ISDR is ensuring 
that we don't duplicate,

91
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,039
that the indicators we're developing 
for disaster risk can plug in

92
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,373
to those that are linked to climate change
or the SDGs, particular SDGs.

93
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:31,693
So there's a lot of effort under way--
at least within the UN system--

94
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:35,935
to make the process,
to integrate that as much as possible.

95
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:41,934
If I look at Sendai, I would have to say
that if there is one

96
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:46,455
fundamental risk treatment
to reduce disaster risk

97
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:50,317
it is to reduce greenhouse gases
as quickly as possible.

98
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:55,776
Just because climate change 
will have such an existential impact

99
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,404
on everything else, even conflict.

100
00:05:58,404 --> 00:06:03,757
We've seen in the case of the Middle East,
an unprecedented period of drought,

101
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:07,273
which of course you can't necessarily link
any one event to climate change,

102
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:09,940
but it's what you'd expect 
from climate change.

103
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,367
It triggered a mass migration of hundreds 
of thousands of people into cities.

104
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,179
It wasn't the cause of the Syrian crisis,

105
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:19,686
but it was certainly 
a contributing cause of even conflict.

106
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:23,990
So for me, that absolutely 
has to be integrated

107
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,611
and so when we talk 
about disaster risk reduction,

108
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:28,171
we're very much talking about

109
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:31,139
climate change mitigation
as a risk treatment,

110
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,632
and mitigation, 
addressing loss and damage,

111
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:36,000
adaptation to climate change.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,582
And all of those have fundamental science
and technology issues associated with them.

113
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:45,183
What are your key messages to researchers
on science and technology for DRR?

114
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:48,805
The first message 
is that what they're doing,

115
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:53,464
the development of science and technology
on this issue is <i>really</i> important

116
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:57,512
and urgent because when we talk 
about disaster risk,

117
00:06:57,512 --> 00:07:00,313
it's a nice, cold-sounding term,

118
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:03,804
but it means hundreds
of thousands of deaths.

119
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:06,814
It means increases in poverty.

120
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:10,104
It means huge economic losses.

121
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:14,356
Over 350 billion a year,
which is money that could be spent

122
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:19,025
on teaching and medicines,
and economic development.

123
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:22,436
The second message is that

124
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:26,506
this is not an issue 
that you solve in a silo.

125
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:33,048
Disaster risk, it's multi-hazard risk
and it's social science,

126
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:36,857
it's physical sci-- 
it's physicists, it's geologists,

127
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:41,170
it's psychologists, 
it's political scientists.

128
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,099
The only solutions that are going to work

129
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:48,129
are going to be multidisciplinary,
interdisciplinary.

130
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:52,701
I was in California-- I'm Australian
but was in California recently--

131
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:56,211
northern California 
having lunch in a restaurant,

132
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:58,992
and suddenly all the cell phones 
went off at once.

133
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:01,763
And when we looked, 
everyone stopped and read their phone.

134
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:06,461
My phone said, "Tornado heading your way.
Take cover immediately."

135
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:08,572
And there was a lot of talking

136
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,311
and then everyone 
just went back to eating.

137
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:14,228
I got up and went outside and looked,
and I could see the cloud was moving

138
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,763
in the other direction,
the storm cloud.

139
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,764
But the reason everyone ignored that

140
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:23,192
was because there had never been a tornado
in that place before,

141
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:27,493
at least in people's memories,
so they just assumed it must be a mistake.

142
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:31,600
In this case, it was okay, 
but the lesson they learned was

143
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,834
number one, you can ignore warning
even of the highest technology,

144
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:39,966
the most efficient sort of warning 
you could imagine;

145
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:43,976
and number two, probably next time
they'll do the same thing,

146
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:45,836
and next time they mightn't be lucky.

147
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:49,357
So it just highlighted for me
that that element of the psychology,

148
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:51,928
and the training and the awareness raising

149
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:54,839
has to go hand in hand with technologies

150
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,199
and other solutions
involving technology and science,

151
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,478
in order for it to be effective.

152
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:02,705
And if one is missing 
then you might as well

153
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:05,176
not even have the other
because it won't work.

154
