1
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:08,184
Hi again, science and technology
can be used to increase

2
00:00:08,184 --> 00:00:11,754
disaster risk reduction knowledge 
which is a prior step

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,998
to the development 
and implementation of structural

4
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:17,543
and non-structural measures
to mitigate risk.

5
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:22,162
In this video I will give an example
on the use of tools and technologies

6
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:24,304
within the context of seismic risk.

7
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:29,115
I will mainly focus on the application
of experimental testing,

8
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:31,765
which ideally should be combined 
with appropriate

9
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,024
numerical simulation techniques.

10
00:00:34,024 --> 00:00:37,058
The pacific ring of fire 
is a long stretch of area

11
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:40,378
along which most of the world's 
largest earthquakes

12
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:43,202
and volcanic activities take place.

13
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:45,500
Colombia is located in this region

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,661
and it is therefore 
a seismically active country.

15
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:52,011
In its long history of earthquakes, 
the first seismic event

16
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,625
that we know of
dates back to 1541.

17
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:59,285
Since then, there have been 
many large magnitude earthquakes

18
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:02,935
hitting the country, 
among which the one of 1906,

19
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:07,477
with an estimated magnitude 
of around 8.8, ranks high

20
00:01:07,477 --> 00:01:10,806
within the list 
of strongest earthquakes ever.

21
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:14,036
More recently, the Armenia earthquake
of 1999

22
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:19,617
with a magnitude of 6.2 
set a death toll of almost 2000 people.

23
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:24,328
This figure shows the epicentral location
of earthquakes in Colombia

24
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:28,129
taken from a catalog 
containing 9000 seismic events

25
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,029
with magnitude above three.

26
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:34,630
The seismic zonation map included 
in the Colombian construction code

27
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,800
reflects this historical epicentral
location of earthquakes.

28
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:41,641
The country is divided
into three main regions,

29
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:46,392
with low, intermediate, 
and high levels of seismic hazard.

30
00:01:46,392 --> 00:01:49,822
Although major cities 
are fortunately located in regions

31
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:54,783
of low to medium seismic hazard, 
almost 40% of the population lives

32
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:57,194
in areas of high seismicity.

33
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:59,965
In these areas, the building code 
requires engineers

34
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:03,174
to design the structures 
such that they can resist

35
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:07,946
to horizontal forces equal to half 
of their own total weight.

36
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:11,516
This is the case of the city of Cali, 
the third largest in Colombia,

37
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:14,178
from where the next photos 
were taken.

38
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:18,590
Over the last 10 to 15 years
the increasing demand of housing

39
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,208
for low income population in Colombia
associated to the significant increase

40
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,549
of cost of land 
has prompted construction companies

41
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,809
to massively build medium to high rise 
reinforced concrete wall buildings.

42
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,602
These structures are made of concrete
and reinforcing steel

43
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:41,036
and require a relatively non-specialized
and cheap labor.

44
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,893
Comparatively, the cost of materials 
is high and has pushed

45
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:48,161
to the development and application 
of construction techniques

46
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,032
that minimize its use.

47
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:55,163
It is therefore not surprising that most
of these new residential buildings

48
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:58,694
have been constructed with walls 
that have thicknesses

49
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:00,805
as low as 80 millimeters.

50
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:07,471
Besides, there are typically only lightly 
reinforced often with just a single layer

51
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:10,580
of steel rebars 
instead of the more common

52
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,700
two rebar configuration.

53
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,992
The end result are walls 
with very large ratios

54
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:18,924
between their height 
and their thickness

55
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:22,683
raising concerns regarding 
the possible development of instability

56
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:25,042
when the earthquake strikes.

57
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:27,605
That is, 
to say seismic loading.

58
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:31,368
It is a bit like holding a playing card 
in between your fingers

59
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:32,863
and compressing it.

60
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:36,544
Since the card is quite thin
and very elongated,

61
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:41,668
it will buckle or bend in direction 
perpendicular to it's own plane.

62
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:45,346
Something similar can happen 
with thin reinforced concrete walls

63
00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:48,076
but we will see more about it soon.

64
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:51,029
This failure mode 
was observed in the recent earthquakes

65
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:55,369
of Chile in 2010 
and of New Zealand in 2011,

66
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:59,875
which caused significant damage to some 
modern reinforced concrete walls.

67
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:04,223
These pictures show examples 
of buckled structural walls

68
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:08,071
after the ground shaking 
suggesting stability problems.

69
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:12,007
In Colombia, since the walls 
are significantly thinner

70
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:14,810
than those used in Chile 
or in New Zealand,

71
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,634
it is legitimate to fear that similar, 
out-of-plane deformations,

72
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,530
and even failure could occur 
during a future earthquake.

73
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,841
Additionally, the use of a single layer
of reinforcement

74
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:31,513
in some of these Colombian buildings 
may increase the vulnerability

75
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:34,071
to out-of-plane instability.

76
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:36,743
So, how does out-of-plane 
instability occur?

77
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:40,683
When the earthquake pushes the wall
in one direction,

78
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:44,994
nearly horizontal cracks form 
in the bottom-edge region

79
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:48,053
due to the large tensile strains
that are imposed.

80
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:51,226
As these cracks open,
the vertical steel rebars

81
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:54,043
inside the concrete
yield in tension.

82
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:57,501
When the ground shaking 
pulls back the wall,

83
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:00,452
the plastic tensile strains accumulated 
in the rebars

84
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:05,474
during the prior push phase
prevent the cracks from closing.

85
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:08,957
This means that the compression
force in that part of the wall

86
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:14,285
is resisted solely by the rebars 
and not by the concrete.

87
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:18,186
As this compression force increases, 
the rebar may yield,

88
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:21,941
leading to an abrupt reduction
in out-of-plane stiffness

89
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,629
and the consequent increase 
in the corresponding

90
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:28,738
out-of-plane displacements,
which can potentially lead to failure.

91
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:33,451
This was a very simplified explanation
of the instability phenomenon,

92
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:37,631
which unfortunately has been 
insufficiently studied in the past.

93
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:40,892
Therefore, many aspects 
are still not clear,

94
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:44,053
which we should strive to understand,
but how?

95
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:49,918
The most obvious answer, 
perhaps the best is, experimental testing.

96
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,967
These tests can be carried out 
in walls or in a cheaper and simpler way,

97
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,926
in actually loaded columns 
that are equivalent

98
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:00,250
to the boundary element 
of the wall.

99
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:04,371
This is where tools and technologies
step in.

100
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:07,891
The Earthquake Engineering 
and Structural Dynamics Laboratory of EPFL

101
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:11,380
has teamed up with a few different 
Colombian universities

102
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,080
to address this issue in two projects

103
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,446
financed by the Cooperation &amp; Development 
Centre of EPFL, CODEV.

104
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:22,088
In the first project
a thin reinforced concrete wall

105
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:27,023
was tested using the test setup
that one can see in this sketch

106
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:29,848
and in the picture on the right.

107
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,698
The test unit represents
the portion of the wall

108
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:35,797
on the ground story 
of a multi-story building,

109
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:39,039
and therefore the applied 
boundary conditions and loading

110
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,157
should reproduce those 
in the real building as much as possible.

111
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:47,868
To do so, the test unit
is loaded with three actuators.

112
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:52,589
Two vertical ones, which simulate 
the weight of the stories above

113
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:56,252
and, in a way, how they rotate 
during the ground shaking,

114
00:06:56,252 --> 00:07:00,714
and a horizontal one, which applies
a cyclic displacement history

115
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:05,344
of increasing amplitude that simulates 
the earthquake's loading effects.

116
00:07:06,114 --> 00:07:10,683
The wall was designed and built
such that its geometrical dimensions,

117
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:14,438
the material properties and the detailing 
of the reinforcement

118
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:19,031
are similar to what we could find 
in a recent Colombian building.

119
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:23,470
Note the low thickness of the wall, 
only eight centimeters,

120
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,482
the use of a single layer of vertical
and horizontal rebars

121
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:31,340
and the presence of a flange
in one of the extremities.

122
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,562
In terms of measurements, 
these small dots in the figure

123
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:38,551
represent a dense grid of optical 
light emitting diodes

124
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:42,839
that monitor the evolution 
of the 3D displacement field

125
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,831
throughout the loading.

126
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,721
After the experiment has been conducted,
we can post-process the data

127
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:53,260
obtained with these LEDs
and obtain plots such as this one.

128
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,912
It shows, on the horizontal axis, 
the value

129
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:59,848
of the imposed horizontal displacement 
at the top of the wall.

130
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:03,113
To the left, when we're pulling 
towards the wall side

131
00:08:03,113 --> 00:08:07,533
that does not have the flange,
which is when instability can occur,

132
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,468
and to the right, when we are pushing
towards the flange.

133
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:14,551
The vertical axis displays 
the out-of-plane displacement

134
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:18,194
at the height where maximum
out-of-plane displacement was measured.

135
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:21,984
It can be observed that the maximum 
out-of-plane displacement

136
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:27,026
was higher than 45 millimeters, 
that is, more than half

137
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:28,638
of the wall thickness.

138
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:34,419
In addition, this plot shows that,
for each cycle of increasing amplitude,

139
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,441
the maximum out-of-plane displacement 
is attained approximately

140
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:45,134
at 0% in-plane-drift,
after which the wall straightens up again.

141
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:48,225
The next time-lapse 
shows this structural behaviour

142
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:51,940
during one half-cycle, 
over which, the wall is pulled

143
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,602
towards the side 
that does not have the flange.

144
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,106
The out-of-plane displacement 
progressively increases

145
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:00,955
up to a maximum value 
reducing after.

146
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:05,993
At the end of that half cycle, 
we can also see some concrete crushing

147
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:10,266
and spalling at the base of the wall
which was partially triggered

148
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:14,388
by the large, out-of-plane 
deformations previously attained.

149
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:18,800
Finally, all these information
and data that we manage to gather

150
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,422
from experiments can be used to develop
and calibrate numerical models.

151
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,655
They range in their complexity 
from shell finite elements

152
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:30,430
with advanced
nonlinear material models

153
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,825
to beams, where the cross section 
of the member

154
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:37,460
is discretized into fibres 
among other even simpler approaches.

155
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:41,187
Our studies have shown 
that many of these models

156
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:44,978
do a pretty good job 
in simulating wall instability,

157
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:49,561
which means that they can be used 
by practicing engineers to design

158
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:53,911
and access the vulnerability 
of walls and buildings.

159
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:58,803
To sum up, in this video 
we saw how thin reinforced concrete walls

160
00:09:58,803 --> 00:10:02,579
with a single layer of reinforcement
are extensively used

161
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:05,159
in modern construction 
in Colombia.

162
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,092
They can be prone 
to out-of-plane instability

163
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:11,266
with unknown and possibly 
serious consequences

164
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:14,418
on the seismic vulnerability 
of buildings.

165
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:17,489
Science and technology can 
and should be used

166
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:20,450
to better understand the behavior
of thin walls,

167
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,787
combining experimental tests 
using new instrumentation techniques

168
00:10:24,787 --> 00:10:28,519
that provide detailed information
on the local member response

169
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,091
with advanced 
numerical simulation models.

170
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:36,440
If needed, structural measures 
such as seismic retrofit

171
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,526
or nonstructural measures 
including changes to the design codes

172
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:43,937
or the development of new tools 
for design engineers,

173
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:46,086
should be implemented.

174
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:50,896
Overall, technologies can greatly improve
seismic risk reduction knowledge

175
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:56,006
which helps defining long-term strategies
for the prevention or mitigation

176
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:58,498
of the adverse effects
of earthquakes.

177
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:00,693
