00:00:05,343 --> 00:00:08,597
Hi. Marco Albertini
is one of the coordinators

2
00:00:08,597 --> 00:00:10,956
for the WatHab Engineering Department

3
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:13,867
of the International Committee
of the Red Cross.

4
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:15,041
In this video,

5
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:18,490
he will present the case
of "Build Back Better" Shelters

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,745
after Typhoon Haiyan.

7
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:25,996
The response was launched
just a few days after the typhoon

8
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:29,026
hit the central region of the Philippines

9
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:33,072
as a continuation of
an earlier emergency response

10
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:35,797
based on immediate food needs,

11
00:00:35,797 --> 00:00:38,417
healthcare and assistance.

12
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:41,071
And it followed just after a few weeks,

13
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:44,912
as soon as people could
start coming back to their life.

14
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:48,903
At that point, the most
immediate need was shelter,

15
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:51,794
and we decided to start our program.

16
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:54,943
In an area like Samar
in central Philippines,

17
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:58,626
where typhoons and strong natural hazards

18
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:02,158
are of natural frequent recurrence,

19
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:05,340
it was necessary to offer a solution

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,108
to the beneficiaries that would last
more than the single event.

21
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:12,165
They were trapped in a cycle of poverty,

22
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:14,663
and so poor means of reconstruction,

23
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:18,190
and again, destruction
brought by following events.

24
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,601
In order to try to break this,

25
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:25,096
we wanted and it was necessary
to "build back better".

26
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:27,624
And this included giving them the means

27
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:32,156
to have something that was stronger
than before the typhoon,

28
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:35,754
in order to increase their resilience
to the next event.

29
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:40,804
The scale of the typhoon was so big

30
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:45,047
that many, tens of agencies
and organizations

31
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:47,227
came into the country suddenly,

32
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:50,900
each of them bringing
a different set of knowledge,

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,042
expertise, skills,
and also practical means

34
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,095
to rebuild houses.

35
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:58,984
In order to standardize the response,

36
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:03,220
the Department of Social Welfare and
Development of the Philippine government

37
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,463
issued technical guidelines

38
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:09,147
that all partners involved
in shelter reconstruction

39
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:11,190
should respect.

40
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,326
The three key messages were at the core
of these guidelines:

41
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:23,549
Appropriateness-- it stood for giving
an answer of the proper size

42
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,545
according to the number of components
of each family;

43
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:32,539
something that would be adequate
as well to the condition, to the climate;

44
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:35,938
and also something that would look at
accessibility of services.

45
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:38,371
It was necessary to yes,
rebuild the house,

46
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:44,592
but the house should have access
in proximity to education opportunities,

47
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:46,323
to livelihood opportunities,

48
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:50,307
and to healthcare facilities as well as
water supply and sanitation.

49
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:56,871
The main idea of building a storm
resilient house

50
00:02:56,871 --> 00:03:00,525
was to have a core structure of the house

51
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:04,673
that would be able
to withstand any future events,

52
00:03:04,673 --> 00:03:07,912
up to strong events of
250 kilometers an hour,

53
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:09,948
as well as small earthquakes.

54
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:12,046
Besides these core structures

55
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:15,105
it was then possible
to add additional elements--

56
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:17,441
like a veranda, like a kitchen--

57
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:19,239
additional external elements

58
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,983
that could be potentially destroyed

59
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:23,489
and easily rebuilt.

60
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,103
But the core structure remains intact.

61
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:29,086
And that's exactly where our program
focuses,

62
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:32,421
in offering immediately
the construction of the core structure.

63
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:37,021
How to reach the target
of such a resistance--

64
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:42,608
this was made through bringing
technical elements,

65
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:47,897
in particular focusing on the foundations,
on the roof, on the bracing,

66
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:51,362
on the tie down,
and on other practical devices

67
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:53,780
like a hurricane strap.

68
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,926
All of them bringing the house
to be one element,

69
00:03:56,926 --> 00:04:02,432
and this unique element
to be solidly anchored to the ground.

70
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,912
Besides the technical elements,

71
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:10,044
two other factors improved
the storm resilience of the house

72
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:12,277
and they were the choice of the location,

73
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:14,842
as the house would
have to be in a safe zone,

74
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:19,391
safe at a certain distance
from riverbanks or from the seashore,

75
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,013
and from potential landslide;

76
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,389
as well as the choice of material--

77
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,912
this second element
was also very important,

78
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:29,455
as we needed to find good material

79
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:31,874
but still affordable;

80
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:34,831
so the right balance
between quality of material, cost,

81
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:37,354
and affordability by the beneficiaries.

82
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:39,934
The model of shelter was chosen

83
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:44,113
learning from our recent experience
from Typhoon Bopha

84
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:50,044
that hit another region of the country
just 18 months earlier than Haiyan.

85
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:54,217
The model was later proposed
to the beneficiaries,

86
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:55,683
prior to the construction,

87
00:04:55,683 --> 00:05:00,583
and all the main input coming from
the communities were, as much as possible,

88
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,880
included in the new design.

89
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,968
On top of this,
our engineers brought up also

90
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:09,390
new advice in terms of additional elements

91
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,832
that would still reinforce further
the wind resistance.

92
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:15,633
The other main challenge of this response

93
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:17,681
was on the technical side in terms of

94
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:22,358
finding the right model and
designing the right model of house.

95
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:28,352
There were equivalent
management challenges

96
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:31,695
for a program that had set
very ambitious targets

97
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:36,065
of delivering 4500 houses in 18 months

98
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:40,660
in an area that was totally devastated
by the typhoon,

99
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,003
where many infrastructures were disrupted,

100
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,836
where even the means of communication
were very limited.

101
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:48,332
To do this, it was necessary to set

102
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:51,579
structure that would just work on this

103
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:55,154
and they included more than 100 people,

104
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,510
specifically hired for this program,

105
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,292
on top of more than 1000 carpenters,

106
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:03,468
trained and involved
in the construction of the houses.

107
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:06,123
All these had to be perfectly synchronized

108
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:09,033
on the logistic side,
on the financial aspects,

109
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,879
and on the reporting
and communication side

110
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,922
there were many departments involved
for a common purpose over the 18 months.

111
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:22,119
These management challenges
were as difficult as the technical side.

112
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:24,188
On the technical side,

113
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:27,996
the validation of the chosen design
happened at different levels--

114
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:32,671
if inputs from the communities
were taken in the design,

115
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:35,273
engineers validated them several times

116
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:38,809
up to coming at level
of headquarters of the ICRC

117
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:43,960
so that all the design
and the proposed ideas

118
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,452
would match with the standards
set by the Philippine government,

119
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:50,117
but also with the standards
set internally

120
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:52,645
in the Red Cross and Red Crescent
Movement response.

121
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:57,656
Additionally, several laboratory tests
were carried out

122
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:03,493
by the Shelter Research Unit of the
International Federation of the Red Cross

123
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:07,655
that was deployed specifically
for the period of time on the field

124
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:13,275
to monitor the quality of CGI,
corrugated iron sheet and nails.

125
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:18,826
The choice of materials was
an essential element in the process,

126
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:23,757
as these would directly affect
the feasibility of the construction,

127
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:27,538
but also immediately impact
on the cost of the operation

128
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:30,742
and on the affordability
for the beneficiaries

129
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,841
of all necessary maintenance
in the future.

130
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:36,097
For this principle, we tried to keep

131
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:39,876
local materials in the design
as much as possible.

132
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,886
and all the main elements
were made of local materials.

133
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:46,921
Amakan, the splitting bamboo,

134
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:48,583
was used for the walls.

135
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:52,569
The coconut wood was chosen
as the main element,

136
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:56,803
as more than 33 million trees
were destroyed by the typhoon

137
00:07:56,803 --> 00:08:00,286
and this was also an opportunity
to reuse the fallen trees,

138
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:03,093
to give also integrated
opportunity of livelihood,

139
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:06,390
and to free space
as well from the fallen tree

140
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:13,435
and allow planting again of new trees
or the new farming season.

141
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:18,697
As well as CGI, the corrugated iron sheet,

142
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:22,539
were the most important
and most costly element,

143
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:28,077
and it's the one that would determine
the most, the strength of the house.

144
00:08:28,077 --> 00:08:30,498
We tried to exactly strike a balance

145
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:34,970
between quality of the chosen material
and cost,

146
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,453
as well as feasibility--
some materials locally,

147
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:41,065
some materials were imported,

148
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:45,235
but everything would have to respect
the 18 months target--

149
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,597
deadline that we had fixed
at the beginning.

150
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:52,826
We thought that keeping the model
as flexible as possible

151
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:56,265
was important
so as to allow beneficiaries

152
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:59,546
to develop the core house,
around the core house,

153
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:02,323
all the main infrastructures
that they needed

154
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:04,345
according to their own needs.

155
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:06,732
Some of them opted for a kitchen,

156
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:09,350
some of them built additional verandas,

157
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,530
others extended the space
with additional rooms.

158
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,406
But in this way,
once received the core house,

159
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:19,371
each beneficiary
could make it his own house

160
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:22,257
and so personalize,
answer to his own need,

161
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:26,421
and also increase the feeling
of ownership of the house.

162
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:30,217
Our objective, in making a house
storm resistant,

163
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:33,911
was to re-engineer
a local traditional house.

164
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:36,087
And we did this through

165
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:37,984
a few main elements.

166
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:39,431
First of all, the foundation,

167
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:42,300
as it was necessary to anchor
the house to the ground,

168
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,985
and then to tie down all the elements,

169
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,620
starting from the roof
to the foundation together,

170
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,048
as well as adding bracing,
internal bracing, short and long bracing,

171
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:57,700
as well as finding a proper slope,
wind-resistant, for the roof

172
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,195
that would also develop on four sides.

173
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:02,771
And this was different
from the traditional construction,

174
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:05,119
a simpler and cheaper construction

175
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:08,445
that many would easily afford
of two-sided roof,

176
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:10,465
but we did this through training

177
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:13,442
and through community involvement

178
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:16,175
so that they would
understand the difference

179
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:20,398
between different sizes and
different shapes of the roof.

180
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:23,466
With regards to technical materials,

181
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:26,577
it was possible to re-propose a design

182
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:30,515
that would already bring all elements
known by the beneficiaries.

183
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:33,649
Only one additional element was proposed
to the communities--

184
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,030
that was the hurricane strap.

185
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,025
But as simple as they were,

186
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:42,523
they could also be replicated locally
just using different materials.

187
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:44,810
And all communities were trained on that.

188
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,403
Hurricane straps are simple devices.

189
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:54,554
Metal straps that are used to tie down
all the elements of the house to the roof

190
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:58,795
so that it will never blow away because
it is anchored to the rest of the house

191
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:01,661
that is then anchored to the foundations
in the ground.

192
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,771
In the shelter response,

193
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:07,735
it was important to add
a component of sanitation

194
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:12,477
in line with the principle
of "building back better".

195
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:15,301
Rates of access to sanitation facilities

196
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:17,329
were very low before the typhoon

197
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:20,153
and this was indeed the opportunity
to help communities,

198
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:24,360
to answer to their ambition
of having their own sanitation facilities.

199
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,590
As soon as the program was launched
and it reached its cruising speed,

200
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,979
we then went back and built a toilet
with a septic tank for each house.

201
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:36,723
The principles that guided the response

202
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:39,528
are of general interest:

203
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:41,310
sustainability of the operation;

204
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,195
a focus on choice of materials;

205
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:47,462
attention to the cost and
the cost of future maintenance;

206
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:49,289
the involvement of the communities

207
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:51,782
as well as the training
of the beneficiaries--

208
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:55,596
all these are elements that have
a general value, in wide terms,

209
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:58,653
and are applicable to any response.

210
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:02,764
Specifically looking at
the design of the house,

211
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:08,110
this matches with the environment
of rural context in Southeast Asia,

212
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,397
so it could be chosen and modified

213
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:17,543
to respond to the specificity
of other tropical, rural contexts

214
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:19,505
in Southeast Asia.

215
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,769
It was possible to improve
flood resilience of the shelters

216
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:26,081
through two main choices:

217
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:30,020
the first one in the design was to
elevate the house on stilts,

218
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,896
so they could resist flooding,

219
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:37,046
also because they were anchored
to the ground through the foundations;

220
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:40,206
but also we need to think
of the location of the house.

221
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:44,494
So as houses in areas that were considered
not safe for reconstruction

222
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:47,345
would not be rebuilt in the same places.

223
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:50,370
Remembering that most
of the victims of the typhoon--

224
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,845
more than 6000 people--

225
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:54,006
were victims indeed of the flooding,

226
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,674
brought by the tsunami-like effect

227
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,581
after the typhoon.

228
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:01,982
The Samar region, that was
the center of the shelter response,

229
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:05,847
is recurrently hit by typhoons
during the year,

230
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:09,720
specifically, just 13 months
after Typhoon Haiyan,

231
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,453
a new typhoon of lower intensity
but still important magnitude,

232
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:19,298
hit the same area passing
almost on the same path.

233
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,379
Typhoon Hagupit was the name

234
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,368
and it gave us the opportunity to test

235
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:25,886
the houses that we had just completed.

236
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:27,984
As a result, only four of them,

237
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:31,936
out of 4461, were damaged--

238
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,789
it's below 0.1%--

239
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,984
and they were immediately reconstructed.

240
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:43,941
So as of today, all 4461 houses
are standing strong.

241
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:46,577
The technology that we chose

242
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:51,030
was a compromise
between engineering inputs,

243
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,471
advanced carpentry,
as well as local knowledge.

244
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:59,482
And we tried to have the balance
that would respect feasibility

245
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:02,469
in terms of time and cost.

246
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:05,696
The technology could improve further,
of course,

247
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:09,097
but we need to see if the limits
in terms of cost

248
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,296
and affordability by the beneficiaries

249
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:12,733
are respected.

250
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:17,511
This goes in contrast
with the tendency of bringing

251
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:20,906
other models, prefabricated models,

252
00:14:20,906 --> 00:14:23,374
in an emergency
as a response from outside,

253
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:26,417
sometimes often from different countries,

254
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:32,216
and affording, then, a long-term
sustainability of the project.

255
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:34,026
Our choice in the technology

256
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:36,599
was to have some limits in the design

257
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:41,807
but invest in long-term sustainability
in that specific context.

258
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,511
The design of the house was based,

259
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:46,967
as much as possible,
on local knowledge,

260
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,387
even if new elements came in

261
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:53,187
in terms of re-engineering
the carpentry of the construction.

262
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:57,165
Beneficiaries were consulted
and each of them had to state

263
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,129
their acceptance of the model,

264
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:01,649
and eventually also have to
bring in their inputs

265
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,329
in the face of assessment,

266
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:06,336
so prior to the construction of the house.

267
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:08,290
All beneficiaries were also trained

268
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,502
on the construction of the house

269
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:14,203
and specifically more than
a thousand carpenters in the area

270
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:18,365
were involved, trained,
and then involved in the construction,

271
00:15:18,365 --> 00:15:23,642
so as to leave a legacy of knowledge,
not only through the beneficiaries

272
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:27,206
but also through the technicians
who would then remain in the area

273
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:29,261
so as to replicate the elements

274
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,460
that were brought in
to increase and improve

275
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,031
the storm resilience of the houses.

276
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:40,600
The cost of each house
is about 1500 Swiss francs;

277
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,009
to this we need to add about 750 [francs]

278
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,552
for the construction
of the sanitation facilities,

279
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:50,346
to a total that reaches
about 2300 Swiss francs.

280
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:54,394
Even if this amount
might seem very important

281
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:56,984
for the beneficiaries in the field,

282
00:15:56,984 --> 00:16:00,731
it is much cheaper than
many other proposed interventions

283
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:03,184
that were brought from outside.

284
00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:05,607
So the idea as well to use
as much as possible

285
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:07,656
local materials and local resources

286
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:11,630
was indeed to keep also as much as possible
the cost contained

287
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,850
within a certain ceiling.

288
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,133
The ICRC and PRC,
as implementer of the program,

289
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,456
paid for the technology,

290
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:23,955
but of course many donors
and also many other members

291
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,444
of the Red Cross and
Red Crescent Movement

292
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,379
contributed to the response.

293
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:31,005
On top of this
we cannot forget the contribution

294
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:32,640
of the beneficiaries themselves

295
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,418
as they were asked
to participate to the cost,

296
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:41,415
with contribution mainly in terms of
supply and handling

297
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:43,729
of the wood component of the house.

298
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:48,212
Not all agencies
involved in the response did this,

299
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:51,277
but for us it was a specific choice.

300
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,971
It worked; it didn't leave anybody
out of the program

301
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:59,421
as in the cases where the most indigent
would not be able to contribute,

302
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:01,925
the communities themselves
would help each other

303
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:05,362
and bring the wood for the families
who could not afford it

304
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:08,188
and nobody was left, at the end,
out of the program.

305
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:14,345
The reason of the choice of asking for
a contribution from the beneficiaries

306
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:18,814
would answer to two main reasons:

307
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:22,011
first, it was an opportunity
to mobilize people

308
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:26,223
to use the wood-- as I mentioned,
there were millions of trees fallen

309
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:28,885
that would occupy all the farming land--

310
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:32,743
it was an opportunity to help people
to move on and start clearing the land;

311
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:37,909
and also, participating to the project,
involve them, enormously,

312
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:43,013
it made them feel their house,
their own house, as they worked for it.

313
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:45,697
The positive aspects of the technology

314
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:51,048
are mainly in the choice of a design

315
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:55,611
that would completely suit the environment

316
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:58,676
and immediately answer to the needs--

317
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:03,237
so being feasible in terms of
construction in a rapid time,

318
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:06,863
but as well, respect all the main elements

319
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:11,423
for that specific climate and conditions.

320
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,946
That allowed the immediate acceptance
from the beneficiaries

321
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:19,290
and of course, respecting all the input

322
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,475
of technical re-engineering of the design

323
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:28,621
increased their capacity
of resisting to the next typhoon

324
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:31,289
and so improved their resilience.

325
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:34,030
I would mention that on the negative side,

326
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,891
one limit was indeed, in the technology,

327
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:42,762
in the choice of the main material,
that was coconut wood,

328
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:47,405
because in construction coconut wood
is not an ideal material,

329
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:49,737
but this was a specific choice

330
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:53,497
due to the availability
of millions of trees

331
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:57,601
and the need of removing them and
using them as much as possible immediately.

332
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:02,285
So no need of bringing wood from outside
but using local resources,

333
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:04,352
even if not ideal.

334
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,875
The choice of using local materials,

335
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,685
as well as building a core house
that would be as simple as possible,

336
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:14,585
aimed to allow beneficiaries to afford

337
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:19,034
any future intervention for maintenance.

338
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:23,487
Indeed, we know that every few years
it will be necessary to replace the walls,

339
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:26,373
made of Amakan, local materials,

340
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,043
but this is perfectly normal

341
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:31,787
and people are used to do that already
for their traditional houses.

342
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:35,521
Other elements can also
be replaced and maintained

343
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:39,137
with periodic painting
to extend their longevity,

344
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,930
but any needed intervention

345
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,407
is, and must be,
affordable by the beneficiaries

346
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:48,283
considering their average income level.

347
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:53,820
The shelter response must be
considered within a much wider frame

348
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,714
of response of the entire Red Cross and
Red Crescent Movement in the region,

349
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:01,470
that included other components
such as water supply,

350
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,747
access to health needs,

351
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:10,591
access to food and opportunities
for restarting livelihood activities.

352
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:14,528
The ICRC was also present in the region
before the typhoon

353
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:17,406
because of its specific mandate,

354
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:21,131
carrying out activities of protection
and assistance of the population,

355
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:24,098
and will remain present within the region

356
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,873
even after the project is completed.

357
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:31,349
And that allows us for a continuous
monitoring in the coming years

358
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:35,173
of the results of the project.

359
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:39,864
Among the many positive aspects
brought by the response,

360
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,947
I think two are of particular importance:

361
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:48,398
first of all, the intervention
allowed 4400 and more families

362
00:20:48,398 --> 00:20:52,835
to have their house rebuilt
just within 18 months since the typhoon

363
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,341
and so allowed them
to restart their normal life;

364
00:20:56,341 --> 00:21:01,358
second point is that
the respect of the principle

365
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:05,120
of "building back better"
helped them to have houses

366
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,435
that were stronger than before,

367
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:09,926
and so they could break the cycle

368
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:15,681
of poor reconstruction
induced by poverty, and in this sense,

369
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:18,937
improve their resilience
to the next events.
