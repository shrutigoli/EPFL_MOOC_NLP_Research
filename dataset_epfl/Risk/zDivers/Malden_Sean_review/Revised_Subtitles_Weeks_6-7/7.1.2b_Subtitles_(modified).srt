1
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:09,169
I'm in a terrible situation now.

2
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:11,848
The relief aid money of (Nrs.) 22,000
[approximately USD 200]

3
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,088
has been already spent.

4
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:17,054
Nowadays, we are somehow surviving.

5
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:20,214
We are in a hard
and quite difficult condition.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,897
Dear participants,
Welcome to the final chapter of the MOOC:

7
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:28,267
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction

8
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:32,389
In this chapter, we will present
how science and technology capacity

9
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:36,101
can help us to become
more resilient against disasters,

10
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:40,415
and thus how risk can be an engine
for sustainable development.

11
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:44,113
We will also introduce some key
principles of science and technology

12
00:00:44,113 --> 00:00:46,804
application in the context of DRR.

13
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:50,904
Some of the key questions that will
be addressed in this chapter include:

14
00:00:50,904 --> 00:00:54,131
How can science and technology
increase resilience?

15
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:59,401
How can risk and disaster risk reduction
be considered an engine for development?

16
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:05,084
How should gender
be considered in DRR?

17
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:08,586
How can technologies be applied
in a sustainable manner?

18
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:13,506
And what are a few of the funding schemes
for science and technology for DRR?

19
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,339
This chapter starts with an interview
with Ambassador Manuel Bessler.

20
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:21,457
Several video lectures
and interviews will follow.

21
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:24,467
Welcome to the last chapter
of this MOOC.
