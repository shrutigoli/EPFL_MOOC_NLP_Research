00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:13,463
Hi, Kamilo Melo is
a postdoctoral researcher

2
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:16,609
at the Biorobotics Laboratory at EPFL.

3
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:19,454
He works with search and rescue robotics.

4
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:24,529
What is search and rescue robotics?
Well, I think it's a broad field

5
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:28,192
that now is taking
some of the robotic researchers

6
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:31,706
to try to create solutions
for this specific topic

7
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:35,803
which is going to disaster scenarios
and use robotics as tools

8
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,583
to try to solve problems

9
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:41,130
or try to help the human
rescue teams to do their job.

10
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:45,402
<i>So, about the technology that we use
in search and rescue robotics?</i>

11
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:50,044
I think that most of the people,
they believe that only flying robots

12
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:53,013
are the most used robots
in search and rescue.

13
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:57,203
Well indeed, the flying capabilities
are very, very useful in the field,

14
00:00:57,203 --> 00:01:00,252
because you can take pictures
from above, you can take video,

15
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:04,000
you can assess really
the whole area of a disaster scenario,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,333
but of course you can also
use ground robots

17
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:11,004
for actually accessing
some places of the disaster region.

18
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:16,464
Like, for example, a collapsed building--
you try to use a mobile robot

19
00:01:16,464 --> 00:01:18,733
to go inside the building,
and try to do something else

20
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:20,754
that a flying robot, perhaps, cannot do.

21
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:24,854
Also, in some scenarios you have water,
and that's very complicated,

22
00:01:24,854 --> 00:01:26,614
because a ground robot cannot go there,

23
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:29,424
a flying robot cannot go
actually under the water,

24
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:34,333
so some unmanned underwater robots
can go and assess the situation there.

25
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:37,984
For example, you can use 
robotics for forensics.

26
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:41,993
That means that you can take the robots
to assess the structural integrity

27
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:44,423
of a collapsed building, for example.

28
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:49,133
So in order that other people can,
for example, people from insurance,

29
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:54,391
people from other rescue teams,
can understand what is the situation

30
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:58,973
before going there with real human power
to try to rescue some other victims.

31
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:04,346
For example, you can also use a robot
as a surrogate for a human rescuer,

32
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:06,874
because, for example,
the situation can be very difficult--

33
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:12,094
there is fire, there is maybe
a chemical spill of a substance,

34
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:14,744
or maybe also radioactivity--
in this case you can,

35
00:02:14,744 --> 00:02:18,114
instead of bringing a human life
to rescue another human life,

36
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:20,404
or to assess the situation,
you can bring the robot,

37
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:23,207
and I think this is one
of the most important reasons

38
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:26,324
why we can use robots
in these kinds of disasters.

39
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:28,475
Another kind of mission is--

40
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:30,674
this is a little bit after the disaster--

41
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,984
is that robots can help for recovery.

42
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:35,655
That means that we can use robots
as a logistic tool--

43
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,175
for example, something to carry materials.

44
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,284
I think one of the main ideas
of using robots is--

45
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:42,716
and this is a big advantage--

46
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:46,197
is to avoid a human life
to go to a very dangerous place.

47
00:02:46,197 --> 00:02:50,075
Robots can see a little bit farther
than a human being--

48
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:51,495
for example, if you are flying.

49
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:55,744
Robots can swim farther than a human being
in one of these situations,

50
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:58,954
because they can also swim
in a little space, a confined space.

51
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:01,651
They can swim with turbid water, 
for example,

52
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:03,885
and a human diver maybe cannot do that.

53
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:06,732
So if you ask me about the strengths
and the weaknesses of robots,

54
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:11,621
I think we are, as researchers,
we are still discovering

55
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,194
these kinds of strengths
or disadvantages of the robots.

56
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:19,385
Sometimes, for example, you believe
that your robot will be sturdy enough,

57
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:21,885
but then you figure out
that there is mud, that there is water,

58
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,424
and perhaps your robot
is not going to work in that terrain.

59
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:26,982
Sometimes you believe
that your battery is enough,

60
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:31,224
or it has enough power to go somewhere,
or to have a long mission,

61
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:34,442
but at the end it happens
that your battery is not enough.

62
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:37,145
So these are a little bit of disadvantages

63
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:40,565
that you really don't know
at the beginning of the mission.

64
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:43,014
And actually,
when you are building the robot,

65
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,805
when you are actually constructing
the machine and all this,

66
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:49,375
you can kind of guess
what is going to happen then,

67
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,236
but in the real field, something
completely different can happen.

68
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:56,485
Another challenge we have
in rescue robotics is integration,

69
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:59,135
not only of the robot with the human team,

70
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:01,266
but maybe also integration
of several robots.

71
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:04,184
So that's something
that I do in my research.

72
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:08,925
We try to basically integrate
geographical information systems,

73
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:11,965
communication systems,
and robots doing different tasks,

74
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:13,736
and different types of robots, actually.

75
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:16,674
For example, you have a flying robot
who creates the map,

76
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:20,101
and the map now is processed
by the mobile robot,

77
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:21,957
who goes through the terrain,

78
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:24,866
and perhaps this mobile robot
deploys another robot,

79
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,606
in some specific case,
for example an underwater robot,

80
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:28,676
or something like that.

81
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:31,334
So this kind of integration
is also very important,

82
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:36,346
and, of course, on the human side,
to basically interact with these robots

83
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,187
is also another important aspect.

84
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:41,306
You're not just watching
the robots doing nothing,

85
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:44,236
but you're actually integrating
and commanding robots to do this, or that,

86
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:47,890
or basically reviewing all the data
that the robots are creating.

87
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:50,826
I belong to a committee that is called

88
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:54,737
the International Committee in Robotics
for Disaster Risk Reduction.

89
00:04:54,737 --> 00:04:57,361
And basically in our meetings
what we talk about

90
00:04:57,361 --> 00:05:00,966
is we need to create
this kind of standardization,

91
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:06,016
we need to provide this standardization
of methods and, basically, rules

92
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:09,966
to use robots in the field,
and also to procure that,

93
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:14,937
for example, rescue organizations
can adopt this kind of technology.

94
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:17,296
Imagine that you are a fireman,

95
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:23,057
and you, for years, had been using
your hose to spray water on the fires,

96
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:26,196
and you use your axe
to cut and break through

97
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:29,366
some difficult terrain and so on.
If you come with a robot,

98
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:31,666
and you say,
"This robot can do the same as you."

99
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,076
The first reaction:
you will say, "I don't think so."

100
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:37,045
Because, yeah, you cannot have
the same mobility as me,

101
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,594
you don't perhaps have
the same strength as me,

102
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:41,986
and, of course, I can think
while I'm in the field,

103
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:43,446
maybe a robot cannot do that.

104
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:45,557
And if you are 
tele-operating your robot,

105
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,876
maybe it's too difficult
to see through a little screen,

106
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:51,567
and to access the places, or actually
do the same as we do,

107
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,376
as a real fireman, let's say.

108
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:55,948
Of course, for them, it will be
very difficult at the beginning,

109
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:58,826
to understand this
as a replacement for them,

110
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:02,247
but we don't try to do this.
We're just trying to provide a tool.

111
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:06,076
So that means that, somehow,
a robot can help people to do that.

112
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:08,208
The security aspects of a robot--

113
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,767
of course you have
to take this into account.

114
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:15,399
Let's put an example of a robot
for a disaster inside a mine.

115
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:19,558
So when the mine collapses,
maybe there is also gas

116
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:22,047
trapped inside the mine
that you cannot fire out,

117
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:25,948
because you will blow up the whole mine,
also with the people trapped there.

118
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:29,817
So in this case, your robot needs
to fulfill some specifications

119
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:34,299
about explosion-proof and, of course,
you cannot create sparks, for example.

120
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:36,178
How to create your machines
in order to assess

121
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,448
the correct environment,
with the minimal harm.

122
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:41,178
When you are using flying robots

123
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:44,837
you need to control it by radio frequency.

124
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,238
So this is another aspect
that you have to care about,

125
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:49,648
because if you're controlling
with some specific frequencies,

126
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:53,031
maybe those frequencies,
in that specific scenario, are restricted.

127
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:56,977
I don't know, for some communications,
maybe communication has a priority

128
00:06:56,977 --> 00:07:00,539
on top of use of these radio frequencies,
for some other reasons,

129
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,758
so in this case you need to provide
your communication system

130
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,868
with another frequency.
So you need to be aware of those things.

131
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:10,637
So far, I think, as I mentioned,

132
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:13,528
it's very difficult
for some organizations to adopt robots,

133
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:15,678
either because they are expensive,

134
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:17,967
or because they need a lot of maintenance,

135
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:21,379
or because, simply, they don't believe
too much in this technology.

136
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:24,168
I think in this case
there are very, very few organizations--

137
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:27,087
I know, for example,
some fire departments in the U.S.,

138
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:31,429
they own robots, actually, but normally,

139
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:34,258
in other civilian organizations
around the world,

140
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:35,798
they still don't know robots.

141
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:39,189
Another type of organization
who can have these kinds of robots

142
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:41,328
are universities and research centers,

143
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,719
because actually
that's what we do here, for example.

144
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,491
We try to produce these robots
for assessing these situations,

145
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,997
but the problem is
that we are still in research,

146
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:51,418
that means that 
we don't have final products.

147
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:54,979
So in this case, also,
according to the mission,

148
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:57,713
maybe it's not the best way
to deploy one of our robots,

149
00:07:57,713 --> 00:07:59,621
because it's still a prototype.

150
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:03,049
<i>About research
in search and rescue robotics?</i>

151
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,079
I think, well, we are doing
a lot of great things.

152
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,929
Actually, we have
our international conference

153
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:10,359
and this thing which is called

154
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:14,719
International Symposium on Safety,
Security and Rescue Robotics,

155
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:17,409
and many researchers are trying

156
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:21,489
to basically improve their machines,
improve their methods,

157
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:26,069
and to try to come with machines
that really can go directly to industry.

158
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:29,534
So this is another part which, of course,
you need to pass through

159
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:31,949
a lot of processes in order
to bring a prototype

160
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:34,680
from research, or from academia,
directly to the industry.

161
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,519
There is no market yet
for these kinds of robots.

162
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,080
So it's very difficult for an industry

163
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,769
to start doing and producing
search and rescue robots

164
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:44,089
if you really don't know
who is going to buy this thing.

165
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,039
So that's why the pace is very slow.

166
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,870
This whole field started
by converting conventional robots

167
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,156
into a search and rescue robot.

168
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:56,860
That means that all the money
that you have to put in the robot

169
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,499
that, per se, is expensive,
is a little bit more, so at the end

170
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,420
the machine will be really,
really something very expensive.

171
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,487
But, of course, researchers now
are starting to do robots

172
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:14,890
thinking directly into being cheap
and to be real assets for a mission,

173
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,139
because the most important thing 
is that, remember,

174
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,659
you want to keep a human life,
instead of a robot.

175
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:26,528
So in this case, if you come
with a very, very expensive machine,

176
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:29,990
it's too expensive, maybe you don't
want to risk the machine,

177
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,320
so this is not good.

178
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,169
But in the other side,
if you go with a very cheap robot,

179
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:38,587
perhaps it doesn't fulfill
all the specifications,

180
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:41,688
and the robot will not really
perform very well in the situation.

181
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:44,779
But there is a meeting point,
where you can really go

182
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,594
with a good machine to do that.

183
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:50,513
And lately there is this trend
of trying to reduce,

184
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:53,250
or produce very cheap
and very simple robots

185
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,950
which are basically disposable robots,
for some specific missions.

186
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,020
I'm not talking like going
into a very difficult terrain,

187
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,190
and trying to assess a situation,

188
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,110
or trying to assess
the structural integrity of a place,

189
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,327
but maybe just to work as a radio beacon,

190
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:10,880
maybe to work as a sensor,
or something like that,

191
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,170
and you can deploy many of them,
as they are disposable,

192
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,620
you really don't care too much
about the price of these things.

193
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,111
As a researcher, we are still
in prototype phases, let's say,

194
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:25,209
but we really want
to go to a real scenario.

195
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,371
We are doing some tests,
actually here in Switzerland,

196
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:33,986
we try to do exercises, for example,
along with the Army,

197
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:37,881
to try to use real scenarios
to bring the robots

198
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:39,770
and to test the capabilities of the robots

199
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,180
in order to be, perhaps in the future,
ready for some real missions.
