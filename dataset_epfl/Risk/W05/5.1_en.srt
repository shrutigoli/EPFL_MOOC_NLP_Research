1
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:07,514
For a health post

2
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:12,654
we immediately set a tent 
at the same place where

3
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:16,803
the community camp was placed.

4
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:22,354
The health post remained there 
for some days.

5
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:26,234
Later when we received enough tents
as relief materials

6
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:30,095
small tents were given 
to the needy people.

7
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:38,695
Big tents... good quality tents
were used for the health post.

8
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:51,505
Concerning the school,
we received some funds

9
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:57,998
from the District Education Office.

10
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:08,225
We used the resources for buying
corrugated metal sheets for the school.

11
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:12,506
Most of the remaining wood
from the school

12
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:19,524
and some of the funds from other donors
were used to rebuild the school.

13
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:25,456
Dear participants,
welcome to chapter 5 of the MOOC,

14
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:30,196
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction.

15
00:01:30,196 --> 00:01:33,257
In this chapter we will present
and describe some

16
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:35,956
of the scientific and technological tools

17
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:40,696
that are used when a disaster strikes
and in its immediate aftermath.

18
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:43,117
During this chapter, 
our external partners

19
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:45,537
will answer several questions.

20
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:50,514
For example, how can losses and victims
be estimated in a very short time?

21
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:55,127
How can ICT and social media
be used in emergency crises?

22
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:59,848
And how can maps and drawboards
play a crucial role in disaster response?

23
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:03,178
I hope you will enjoy this chapter
of the MOOC.
