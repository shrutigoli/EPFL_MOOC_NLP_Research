00:00:05,794 --> 00:00:08,913
Hi. Rene Saameli is the GIS Coordinator

2
00:00:08,913 --> 00:00:11,514
of the International Committee
of the Red Cross.

3
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:15,275
In this video, he will present 
how Geographic Information Systems

4
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:17,653
can be used in emergency response.

5
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:20,267
In emergency response,

6
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:25,196
GIS can really help in getting 
a proper situation awareness.

7
00:00:25,196 --> 00:00:28,978
That means, on a map 
you can relatively simply represent

8
00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:32,486
where something has happened,
where there has been some destruction,

9
00:00:32,486 --> 00:00:35,927
and where, potentially, 
you might have to intervene

10
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:38,785
and provide support or bring in help.

11
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:45,737
That's probably the most easy way
to provide a simple summary

12
00:00:45,737 --> 00:00:48,656
of the situation post-disaster.

13
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:51,488
Then also, GIS is very useful

14
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:55,020
to start planning the response in terms 
of logistics, planning the routes--

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,305
where are we going 
to pass to bring supplies in--

16
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:04,017
or maybe to start rehabilitating 
an essential infrastructure.

17
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:07,956
Knowing the topography, 
knowing the access roads,

18
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:09,515
knowing potential obstacles--

19
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:11,827
maybe broken bridges 
and things like that.

20
00:01:13,297 --> 00:01:19,238
Again, the map is the perfect media
to convey this very detailed information.

21
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:23,528
Usually on the onset of an emergency,

22
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:26,837
there's always this systematic 
scramble for baseline data.

23
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:31,518
Sometimes there were 
no proper baseline maps--

24
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:35,019
there were not maps of the location 
of the villages, of the roads--

25
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:40,729
so this is where platforms 
like OpenStreetMap

26
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,440
make a very big difference nowadays
because through volunteers,

27
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,220
a lot of very remote areas 
have been mapped

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,729
where there were no maps in the past

29
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:54,499
because there were no mapping agencies.

30
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:58,488
Also, typically, one of the questions
that my team gets in the field

31
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:00,577
whenever there is an emergency is:

32
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:03,000
Where are the ICRC assets?

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,509
Where are our offices?

34
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:06,231
Where are the residences,

35
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:08,241
the logistics warehouses,
and things like that?

36
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:11,750
But on top of it, where are 
the essential infrastructures

37
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,490
like hospitals, like health care centers?

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,279
And this used to be a very big problem

39
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:19,450
because those datasets are, 
most of the time,

40
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,120
they are available somewhere--

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,231
hidden either in some government offices
or even sometimes online--

42
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:29,121
but not necessarily easily accessible.

43
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:33,262
Or then, sometimes they are available
but in multiple Excel sheets.

44
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,350
And when you really need those datasets,

45
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,141
it's very hard to get them 
and get proper intelligence out of them.

46
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,650
It's hard to know how accurate they are

47
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,570
and how well updated they have been.

48
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,551
This is one of the reasons we created 
this platform called healthsites.io

49
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:57,362
where we try to be better prepared--

50
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:59,952
and not just ICRC,
the whole humanitarian community

51
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:02,432
and medical community at large--

52
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:06,433
trying to better prepare 
this baseline dataset

53
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,262
of health care locations and health sites

54
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:16,362
so it is available on the onset 
of any emergency.

55
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,182
And that might sound--

56
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:21,250
I was discussing with a friend, 
recently, who was telling me

57
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,273
that he couldn't understand 
that there wasn't today, already,

58
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:26,671
some existing datasets of hospitals,

59
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:28,981
and it's true that you find 
a lot of this data,

60
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:31,774
but again, it's never easily available

61
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:37,673
and in a comparable 
and standard format, globally.

62
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:42,693
And especially 
not in disaster-prone countries

63
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:46,093
where, very often, this information
has not been made available.

64
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:50,884
When it comes to provide 
very quick situational analysis

65
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:56,963
and combining data sources 
from multiple sources

66
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:59,753
to present them to different stakeholders,

67
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,456
the map is a very good media

68
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:04,633
because then you can
put those different sources together,

69
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:09,854
represent them on a common platform,
on a common support,

70
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:13,751
and then it's a very easy way
to convey a particular message

71
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,483
on specific needs in a particular area

72
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:19,494
or let's say you are in a flood area--

73
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:22,045
there's an interest 
to be able to communicate

74
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:26,905
with a certain set of people that are 
actually within that potential flood area,

75
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:30,376
so you want to be able to direct
that message particularly to them.

76
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:33,625
And so, there again, 
geography is an important factor

77
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:40,145
to channel certain types of information
to certain people in different areas.

78
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:44,087
And I would say that's an important factor
because during emergencies,

79
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:49,086
every single set of 
information is important

80
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:53,427
and you don't want to overload people
with unnecessary information,

81
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,496
so being able to channel 
the right information

82
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:59,307
to the right population is very important.

83
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:02,197
For post-intervention monitoring,

84
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:07,867
GIS is very good to locate, first of all,
where interventions were done,

85
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:11,455
and then to keep an institutional memory

86
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:14,498
of what type of interventions 
were done where.

87
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:18,488
It also acts as a basic database

88
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:22,738
where you can have all of these 
interventions registered,

89
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:26,547
and then you can monitor them 
over time, afterwards.

90
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:32,417
GIS technology can be used 
by responders post-disasters,

91
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:37,029
but it's also designed 
for the general public.

92
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,537
So it's, at the same time,

93
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:43,467
a very advanced and scientifically 
very accurate tool,

94
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:47,289
but as well, designed to be understood--

95
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:51,837
it can be used to be understood 
by the general public.

96
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:54,709
Most of the people like maps.

97
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,139
Usually maps are very easy to understand.

98
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,879
Now, depending on how you make your map,

99
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,269
you can very much overload it 
with lots of information

100
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,220
and it becomes uncomprehensible,

101
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,369
or you can leave aside 
all the unnecessary things

102
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,818
and then pretty much everyone
is able to understand it.

103
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:15,510
It's also very interesting to see
with satellite imagery

104
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,998
that even communities that have 
never worked with the maps in the past,

105
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:22,860
very quickly they understand 
and they realize

106
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,460
what are the features 
that can be seen on the map:

107
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,199
a forest, a house, a street--

108
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:32,569
they would recognize that very quickly
on a satellite image.

109
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:37,391
A few years ago, the major challenges
when using GIS was to find data.

110
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:39,261
Finding the data 
was the most difficult thing,

111
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:42,798
especially in remote areas

112
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:47,361
where there's no mapping agencies
and things like that--

113
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,160
that was the major challenge.

114
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,561
Nowadays, finding data is easy,

115
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,741
but the bigger challenge 
is to find the right data--

116
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:56,192
knowing which data to use,

117
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:02,242
knowing how old it is, how accurate it is,

118
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:04,190
how well updated it has been.

119
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,082
And also, a few years ago,

120
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:09,513
GIS tools were technically 
relatively complicated,

121
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:14,192
but there's been a huge progress
in the user-friendliness of those tools

122
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:16,192
and it has become very much

123
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:21,382
accessible now for a large public

124
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:24,830
that you don't have to have 
a long training in GIS now

125
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,993
to start using GIS tools,

126
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:30,911
and I would say tools like Google Earth 
are a very good illustration of that.

127
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:32,951
There's also a trend now with GIS

128
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:36,332
to do more and more 
with dynamic maps and online.

129
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:42,343
It's true, these are very good platforms
to illustrate the fast-changing rate

130
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:46,304
and to update information 
that is changing frequently,

131
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:48,612
typically coming from social media.

132
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:50,923
Now, this information 
is not always easy accessible

133
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:52,683
to the population that we work with,

134
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:56,462
so sometimes we really
have to go back to the paper map

135
00:07:56,462 --> 00:08:01,253
because this is the media 
that is the most easily understandable

136
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:04,414
and that is also 
the most easily accessible.

137
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:10,694
And even if you don't have 
electricity or adverse conditions,

138
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:14,693
paper map will always be the best
and most simple media

139
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:17,824
to transfer a certain set of information.

140
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:21,735
It's true that in certain countries,
maps are still seen

141
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:27,463
as containing some potentially 
confidential or restricted information,

142
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:32,314
so dealing with maps in certain areas
can be a bit sensitive.

143
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:35,865
So it's always important 
to know beforehand

144
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:40,774
what's the attitude of authorities
regarding maps,

145
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:43,234
and also whether 
you're allowed to use GPS,

146
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:47,836
whether you're allowed to use
even cameras and making pictures

147
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:52,796
before starting collecting 
geographic data.

148
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:54,245
In terms of data formats

149
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:56,744
that are being used 
for different kinds of maps,

150
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,666
there's also been huge progress
in the last years

151
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:02,266
where most of the GIS tools
have become interoperable.

152
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:08,564
That means that there's no more
proprietary data sources--

153
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:13,526
they can all be used 
by multiple types of software

154
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:16,373
and they can be converted 
from one format to another,

155
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:18,578
which is a very important point

156
00:09:18,578 --> 00:09:21,756
because when you are doing 
coordination exercises,

157
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:23,466
maybe post-disaster,

158
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:26,216
if someone produces a dataset 
that cannot be read by the others,

159
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:31,489
it's completely useless,
so interoperability is a key element.

160
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:35,488
To find geographic information 
for humanitarian response,

161
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:38,287
there are multiple websites
that do an excellent job at that,

162
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,017
at aggregating such kind of maps.

163
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:43,688
I would say the main one 
is ReliefWeb, obviously,

164
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:48,648
that aggregates and that 
allows to publish situation maps

165
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:51,318
from whatever kind of emergency.

166
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:55,218
But then there are some more specific sites

167
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:58,977
that will do data on particular 
damage assessments

168
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:02,139
and I would say UNOSAT
is a very good reference for that

169
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,039
where, in case of floods,

170
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,849
they will rapidly analyze the areas
that have been flooded--

171
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,749
maybe count the buildings 
that are under water--

172
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:15,729
and they will publish that information
as PDF maps,

173
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:20,649
but also as web services 
so they can be used by other GIS tools

174
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,020
to be overlaid on your own 
dataset, typically.

175
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:32,381
Then there's other sources which are 
more related to baseline information.

176
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:38,651
Again, OpenStreetMap is 
a very good source of baseline maps.

177
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:43,180
In terms of the future of GIS technology
and humanitarian works, basically,

178
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,648
we see a lot 
of increase of data, at large,

179
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,731
be it geographic or non-geographic,

180
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,581
so the data management part

181
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:55,911
is becoming an increasing part
of the humanitarian work

182
00:10:55,911 --> 00:11:01,144
because we need to collect,
assess, analyze,

183
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:05,281
and interpret, basically,
bigger and bigger datasets.

184
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:10,751
Nowadays, those GIS tools 
and those data visualization tools

185
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:13,071
are becoming more and more powerful,

186
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,671
and they're becoming more easy--

187
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:20,890
they can be used by pretty much everyone
because they're so easy to use.

188
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,762
And so it's very tempting to take

189
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:26,253
any kind of dataset that we've found 
on the Internet somewhere

190
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:31,020
and render it in a very live 
and very good looking way

191
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,202
on a live dashboard.

192
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:38,393
And this can be a danger 
because when it looks nice,

193
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:42,083
it looks reliable 
and it looks trustworthy,

194
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:46,522
but the basic rule of "garbage in, 
garbage out" still applies,

195
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:49,972
and that's sometimes a bit of a threat
with those very nice rendering

196
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:53,772
that we see more and more 
on the Internet, all over.

197
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:55,731
In the humanitarian response,

198
00:11:55,731 --> 00:12:00,153
having access to not any data
but to the proper data,

199
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,402
that is well updated,
that is freely available,

200
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:07,587
is a major element

201
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:10,857
in order to provide quick response.

202
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:14,913
And very often, 
very good geographical data

203
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:17,644
is not necessarily freely available,

204
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:22,375
and I would say initiatives 
like OpenStreetMap,

205
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,764
like Missing Maps, like healthsites.io,

206
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:28,663
where there's a call to collect,

207
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:33,543
but then also make data 
open and freely available,

208
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:38,545
I would say is a major evolution
in terms of GIS and humanitarian work

209
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:44,314
and we need to really support that
in the future as well.
