For a health post we immediately set a tent at the same place where the community camp was placed.
The health post remained there for some days.
Later when we received enough tents as relief materials small tents were given to the needy people.
Big tents... good quality tents were used for the health post.
Concerning the school, we received some funds from the District Education Office.
We used the resources for buying corrugated metal sheets for the school.
Most of the remaining wood from the school and some of the funds from other donors were used to rebuild the school.
Dear participants, welcome to chapter 5 of the MOOC,
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology for Disaster Risk Reduction.
In this chapter we will present and describe some of the scientific and technological tools that are used when a disaster strikes and in its immediate aftermath.
During this chapter, our external partners will answer several questions.
For example, how can losses and victims be estimated in a very short time?
How can ICT and social media be used in emergency crises?
And how can maps and drawboards play a crucial role in disaster response?
I hope you will enjoy this chapter of the MOOC.
