00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:09,677
Hi. Yeeshu Shukla works 
for the NGO Christian Aid.

2
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:13,109
He has several years of experience 
in water and sanitation,

3
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:15,738
rural livelihoods, 
disaster risk reduction,

4
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:19,500
climate adaptation
and emergency response and recovery.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,445
In this video, he will present an example

6
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:25,310
of a community-based early warning system.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,308
It's a very interesting question,

8
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:29,491
the pilot that we are trying
in the Terai region.

9
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,526
If you look at historically, Terai region
is both on the Indian Nepalese side.

10
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:35,770
It's a highly backward region.

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,382
There are a number of rivers 
that flows through that region.

12
00:00:38,382 --> 00:00:42,069
All of these rivers basically originate
in Tibet, upstream Nepal,

13
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:46,383
and they flow through entire Nepal
and then enter the Terai region.

14
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:49,188
So this region is flat, flood-prone,

15
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:53,717
and regular floods are a common thing.

16
00:00:53,717 --> 00:00:55,655
Every year we have floods in these areas

17
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,502
and these are like flash floods
most of the times

18
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:02,043
so people do not get enough time
to basically evacuate.

19
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:05,132
And apart from the floods, 
some of this area, as I told you,

20
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,584
has other complex problems as well,

21
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,493
like it's a highly backward area.
So the lack of education,

22
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:12,461
lack of health infrastructure

23
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:15,558
and lack of access to reliable, 
trustworthy information--

24
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:18,465
which is very critical 
to any early warning--

25
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:20,723
is a common thing in that area.

26
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:24,563
So the objective was basically
to engage people, to begin with,

27
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:28,836
in their own self-analysis of risk:
the hazards and their capacities.

28
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:31,850
And that's how we basically 
brought people on board

29
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,186
because that's very important with any
early warning initiative.

30
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:37,821
Technology is obviously one aspect of it

31
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:39,627
but technology is not the only answer.

32
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:41,981
It's basically because 
from a sustainability point of view

33
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:44,544
we have to bring people on the board
right from the beginning.

34
00:01:44,544 --> 00:01:47,759
The second important thing was--
major objective was--

35
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,975
that we wanted it to be
a community to community-centered

36
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:52,979
early warning system

37
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,257
between the Indian communities
and the Nepalese communities.

38
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:58,728
So suppose if the technology fails
then what?

39
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:01,694
Then people to people exchange 
still remains.

40
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:05,568
And the third important element,
I would say, is the capacity building.

41
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:08,863
It's not only about early warning,
preparedness and evacuation.

42
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:12,396
It's also about doing other things
in terms of DRR.

43
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:18,460
DRR is a widespread field 
so early warning is only for the monsoons.

44
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,488
So what about the next remaining months?

45
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:23,206
So we will engage people. 
In the participatory analysis

46
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:25,566
they have done the risk reduction planning

47
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:29,562
and based on those plannings
they have developed action plans.

48
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:33,048
And based on the action plans
they have actually gone in

49
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:37,215
to improve their education, health
and livelihood needs.

50
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:40,256
Background preparatory activities
are more important

51
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,297
than actually introducing a technology
in the community.

52
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:47,056
So now when we are taking 
this technology to the new villages

53
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:49,358
we are doing 
a lot of preparation in advance,

54
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:53,108
which means we are trying to develop
rapport with the people,

55
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:54,704
we are trying to bring them on board,

56
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:57,185
we are trying to make them 
aware about the risk

57
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:58,979
and the need for this technology

58
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,575
and the benefits and outcomes
that lie ahead for them.

59
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:09,044
The second important aspect is 
that how do you create safeguards

60
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:14,258
in the sense that suppose if you're using
voice and text messaging

61
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:17,712
to inform people about 
the rising water levels in the rivers

62
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:20,452
and they do not work 
at the time of the disaster.

63
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:22,251
Suppose the lines are down, then what?

64
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:24,821
Then you have to introduce 
alternate means,

65
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:29,250
alternate safeguard measures.
Like we have a repository of people

66
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,826
who are connected through mobile
both on the Indian Nepalese side

67
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:35,174
so they can easily get in touch
with the Nepalese counterpart,

68
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,274
know the water levels

69
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:39,495
even if the voice 
and text messaging is not working.

70
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:42,873
Third important thing, I will again say,

71
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:47,560
is that how do you create formal
and informal communication channels?

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,936
So formal institutional structures 
are important.

73
00:03:49,936 --> 00:03:52,930
Their capacity building, bringing them
on board is really important

74
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,009
but more than the formal structures

75
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,930
what is important is to have some kind of
an informal exchange going on

76
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,792
between people to people,
also with the people and the government

77
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:05,339
and also on both side of the borders.

78
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:10,016
This system was tested for the first time
in a real world situation

79
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,270
in 2013 floods

80
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,548
and we have been very pleased 
with the results that we received.

81
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,943
In our analysis we found that people
had the information in advance,

82
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:27,446
for 88 hours in advance of the actual 
water entering their villages

83
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:30,809
so they had enough time 
to basically evacuate.

84
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:34,776
Not only evacuate but actually 
do a lot of planning-- how to evacuate,

85
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:39,162
what they need to carry along with them,
what they need to leave.

86
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:44,383
So they were able to basically 
take care of their belongings,

87
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:47,809
the food, the livestock,
everything to a safer place.

88
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:50,242
And they stayed there 
and they came back safely

89
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:53,564
so not even a single death was reported
in that disaster,

90
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:59,163
which in my view is a great outcome.
I mean if you look at--

91
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:01,852
from the saving lives perspective only.

92
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:05,622
But they were also able to save
some of their household belongings,

93
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:08,984
their livestock, which is equal 
to livelihoods in the rural community

94
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:12,519
because a lot of your livelihoods
are dependent on your livestock

95
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,340
and it's an asset, so that again, 
is both linked to lives and livelihoods.

96
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,373
That's one aspect of it.

97
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:21,218
Some of the things that we realized

98
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:24,266
that we need to give more space
to the people

99
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:28,585
because a lot of human potential
was realized during the disaster

100
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:31,847
because a lot of people came forward
and we were able to see

101
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:34,945
who are the emerging natural leaders
from the communities.

102
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:39,814
And who could be further trained
and used in similar situations,

103
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:43,948
not only from the evacuation
and the rescue point of view

104
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:48,151
but also for taking this initiative
to other villages as well.

105
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:51,381
We realized that this technology works
for the first time

106
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:54,983
in the real world situation
so this can be scaled up.

107
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:56,882
And so we are going step-by-step now.

108
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:57,913
What we are trying to do

109
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:00,358
is now we are trying to include 
more number of people

110
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:04,271
in the repository that we have
for disseminating warnings.

111
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:08,241
So there'd be more number of people
so that we'd be able to cover more areas.

112
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:12,249
And we don't want to go 
really quick on that aspect

113
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:16,107
because there is some amount 
of sensitivity that is involved

114
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:18,961
in terms of releasing warnings

115
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,160
in the Indian context 
and also in the Nepalese context.

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,101
So we want to take care 
that we go in a procedural manner

117
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:28,547
where we take the local authorities 
in confidence

118
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:30,266
before we release these warnings.

119
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,963
And so what we would certainly be--

120
00:06:32,963 --> 00:06:36,147
we are taking measures to basically
include more number of people,

121
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:38,483
thinking that this can work 
for more number of people

122
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,388
who are in the similar geography.

123
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:47,374
One of the key challenges that we face
is on sustainability and scaling up.

124
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:50,082
A potential answer 
to this particular question

125
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:52,476
on sustainability and the scaling up

126
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:57,929
could be more vigorous engagements
of community where we are basically

127
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:02,074
downsizing the dependence 
on technology per se.

128
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:07,481
And we are trying to realize 
the fullest potential of human capital.

129
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:11,666
That is only possible with the proximity
that we work with them

130
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,545
and it's not only about 
communicating from distance

131
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:18,896
but it's also about 
being physically present with them.

132
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,267
We don't what this initiative 
to be a project.

133
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:26,580
We want to make it as a process 
so it goes beyond the project life.

134
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,135
And that can only be possible 
when people take this initiative

135
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:34,337
entirely in their own hands.

136
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:36,846
Another challenge is, 
you know about the DRR,

137
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:38,644
I mean DRR everyone understands

138
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:41,264
that investing in DRR 
makes a lot of sense.

139
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:46,248
One dollar invested in DRR 
can actually save many more dollars.

140
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:51,090
But unfortunately, with donors,
with governments,

141
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,910
DRR and early warning both remains
a low priority issue.

142
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,821
Another challenge is how do you basically
create a buy-in for such a initiative,

143
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:06,929
which is so crucial to save lives
and livelihoods of people at risk.

144
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,560
So one way of doing it, 
that you do a pilot,

145
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,368
you create an evidence and you basically 
show to the policymakers

146
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,431
that this is how it works.

147
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:20,003
So that could be one way of basically 
saying that "Okay, this works.

148
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:22,831
And this doesn't require 
too much money."

149
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:25,895
It's very important to engage women
so that they are able to

150
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:28,221
basically engage more women

151
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:33,135
because women will only have access
to women in that society.

152
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:36,143
So men would rather 
not have access to women.

153
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:38,213
So how do we actually bring
that gender balance--

154
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:40,813
not only in our project teams--

155
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:44,703
so that there are more women
in our project

156
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:47,622
and they are able to talk to women
and bring them on board

157
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:51,154
and in turn, we can create 
equal participation

158
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:52,361
of both men and women.

159
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,648
So from a community perspective,
that's a major challenge

160
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:58,004
looking at the cultural aspects
and the social aspects

161
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,103
of the communities that we work in.
