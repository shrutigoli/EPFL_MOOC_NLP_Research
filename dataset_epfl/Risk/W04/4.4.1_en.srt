1
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:08,588
In this video, I will define preparedness,
talk about the cluster approach,

2
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:11,586
and present a few examples 
of science and technology

3
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:13,370
for preparedness.

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,898
As defined by UNISDR
in their proposed update

5
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:18,939
of terminology document:

6
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:22,839
preparedness is the knowledge 
and capacities developed by governments,

7
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,825
professional response 
and recovery organizations,

8
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,104
communities and individuals

9
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:32,893
to effectively anticipate,
respond to and recover from,

10
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:36,974
the impacts of likely,
imminent or current disasters.

11
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:43,613
A comprehensive analysis of disaster risks
and effective linkages to early warning

12
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:45,702
are essential to preparedness.

13
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:50,468
Preparedness activities and systems 
include arrangements for coordination

14
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,982
before, during, and after a disaster;

15
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:57,403
stockpiling of equipment
and supplies; contingency planning;

16
00:00:57,403 --> 00:00:59,503
evacuation and public information,

17
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:03,623
and associated training
and field exercises.

18
00:01:03,623 --> 00:01:07,972
Coordination and information management
are central to preparedness.

19
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,906
Good coordination means
fewer gaps and overlaps

20
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:15,973
in humanitarian and disaster
risk reduction organizations' work.

21
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:19,266
Clusters are groups 
of humanitarian organizations

22
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:22,517
working in the main sectors 
of humanitarian action;

23
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:25,593
for instance, shelter, sanitation, etc.

24
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:31,157
These clusters are created when there are
clear humanitarian needs within a sector,

25
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,594
when there are many actors
within sectors,

26
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:38,013
and when national authorities
ask for coordination support.

27
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:39,663
The aim of the cluster approach

28
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:43,703
is to strengthen system-wide preparedness
and technical capacity

29
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,243
to respond to humanitarian emergencies,

30
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:50,424
and provide clear leadership 
and accountability in the main areas

31
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:52,853
of humanitarian response.

32
00:01:53,673 --> 00:01:57,524
Here you see the coordination architecture
in the cluster approach.

33
00:01:57,524 --> 00:01:59,183
You can find further information

34
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:03,565
at the United Nations Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,

35
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:05,774
UN OCHA's website.

36
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:09,080
In addition to this coordination
system for preparedness,

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,570
there are a series of technologies
and science being used in preparedness.

38
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,550
Science and technology are also 
needed to develop more effective

39
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,481
and efficient emergency supplies
and preparedness kits.

40
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:26,278
For example, the survival blanket,
or the emergency drinking water.

41
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:29,441
Contingency planning aims
to prepare an organization

42
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:33,051
to respond efficiently
and adequately to an emergency

43
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:35,402
and its potential humanitarian impact.

44
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:39,708
The contingency planning process
can basically be broken down

45
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,771
into three simple questions.

46
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:43,940
1) What is going to happen?

47
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,151
2) What are we going to do about it?

48
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:50,119
3) What can we do
ahead of time to get prepared?

49
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:54,172
From training and drills 
to computer simulator games, for instance,

50
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:57,061
through virtualization 
and mobile technologies,

51
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:59,809
science and technology are present.

52
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:03,162
A list of simulators
and linkages to their web pages,

53
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:07,741
and other relevant resources,
is included in the additional materials.

54
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:12,684
You will hear officer Stefano Villa
who has a triple affiliation.

55
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:16,848
He is a member of the Swiss 
Humanitarian Aid Unit -- SHA,

56
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:19,771
and of Compass Coaching 
Villa and Company,

57
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:24,279
and he's also an active member 
of the Swiss Armed Forces Rescue Troops.

58
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:28,062
He will talk about evacuation drills
and associated training

59
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:29,911
and field exercises.

60
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:32,542
For drill and training,

61
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:36,662
we use different methods,

62
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:42,016
depending on the level we are training.

63
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:46,225
For example, training management people,

64
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:52,233
or leadership, or leader,
basically in the teams,

65
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:58,227
we can use theoretical methods,

66
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:02,767
and what we use is,
for example, simulators,

67
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:08,809
where we can prepare
training, or exercises,

68
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:11,089
and we simulate the situation,

69
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:16,757
and we can train the management part 
of the engagement, let's say.

70
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:24,278
Other branches, search, rescue,
medical, for example,

71
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:30,699
we train people directly in the fields,
in the rubbles, with the tools.

72
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:38,499
Also, there is a theoretical part,
but it's very small,

73
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:41,569
and we need really to get

74
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:46,949
quickly through the practical part,

75
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,377
so we work basically in the field.

76
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:54,604
During the training, 
to train the trainer;

77
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:57,828
that's why we use these methods,
we train the trainer.

78
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:01,308
The trainers they train their own units,

79
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:08,278
and then they can
respond directly in their own country.

80
00:05:08,278 --> 00:05:11,494
This is the better way,
in case of disaster,

81
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:17,705
to have on the spot
teams trained directly,

82
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:23,083
ready in order to respond
very, very quickly.

83
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:27,763
And the resources are
we need people, of course.

84
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:30,614
It doesn't matter what kind of people:

85
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:35,494
armed forces, firefighters, 
civic protection, civilian,

86
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:37,503
it doesn't matter.

87
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:42,473
And then, of course, we need
a location, training facilities,

88
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:47,074
and specific for the branch 
you have to train,

89
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:51,544
you need specific facilities.

90
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:54,825
So, for example, if you trained
people for an earthquake,

91
00:05:54,825 --> 00:06:00,851
you have to build
some training facilities, rubbles,

92
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,421
in order to train people into the rubbles,

93
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:09,230
if you prepare people 
for an earthquake engagement for example.

94
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,625
If you train people for flooding,

95
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:17,315
you have to prepare and construct

96
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:22,944
some flooding facilities to explain
and to show how to engage

97
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:24,895
after this situation.

98
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:30,486
So, the role of simulators 
or virtual classrooms

99
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:37,201
is to allow the trainers 
to get through the training,

100
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:42,897
and each time you can use simulators

101
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:45,897
during the day, during the night.

102
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:50,887
You can choose very quickly
when you want to train.

103
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:56,725
And you can choose the sequences,
which level you want to train,

104
00:06:56,725 --> 00:07:01,748
and you can also create 
a lot of different situations.

105
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:06,890
You can put on the screen, for example,
first an earthquake and flooding,

106
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,270
then a fire, and so on.

107
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:17,020
Another big advantage
using simulators and virtual methods

108
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,591
is you can train people on distance.

109
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:26,404
So, you can sit in Switzerland
and you can train people in Brazil,

110
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,881
or Indonesia.

111
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:33,401
The disadvantage is probably you don't have

112
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:38,791
any direct contact with the person,

113
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:43,271
so the interaction is limited.

114
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:49,070
And for many parts of the training,

115
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,900
you can't do it by simulator,

116
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,721
so you absolutely need to be on the spot;

117
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:59,341
for example, using tools,

118
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:03,971
if you have to use some tools
to breach the rubbles,

119
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:09,654
to cut, or to pull, and so on.

120
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:14,202
If you have to train dogs.

121
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,942
Of course, there are sequences 
or part of the training

122
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:22,382
you can do by simulators, or virtually,

123
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:26,890
but most of the training takes place

124
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,460
directly in the country with the people,

125
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,483
with the dogs, into the rubbles.

126
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:37,862
Preparing the training,
we also analyze in which country

127
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:40,012
we are going to train people.

128
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:47,534
We analyze the culture,

129
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:51,884
the religion, the methods they have

130
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:56,226
that they are still using maybe for years.

131
00:08:56,226 --> 00:09:02,298
So, we go first and we do
certain assessments.

132
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:04,123
We speak with people,

133
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:10,554
we check their equipment, their locations,
their facilities, everything,

134
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:15,814
and then we try to find a mix

135
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:21,693
between their methods,
knowledge, facilities,

136
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,714
equipment, tools, and so on,

137
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:26,854
and our system.

138
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:32,834
The goal is not to implement
the Swiss system in another country,

139
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:37,403
the goal is to bring our experience,

140
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:43,573
using their facilities,

141
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:46,683
equipment and knowledge,

142
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,223
integrating also culture, whatever,

143
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:55,553
and to find their system.

144
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,670
Other examples of technologies
and tools for preparedness

145
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,879
include data collection
applications and programs,

146
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,829
and data visualization tools.

147
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:10,533
And many other tools for monitoring
and tracking supplies, information, etc.

148
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:14,644
For example, the global mapping
of emergency stockpiles webpage.

149
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:18,514
Coordination of actors is key
during preparedness,

150
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:22,335
and, as you have seen, many 
technologies, tools, and science

151
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,554
can be used to support 
preparedness activities.
