00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:07,935
Hi, Professor Maneesha Ramesh, 
currently the director for the

2
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:11,505
Amrita Center for Wireless Networks
and Applications (AmritaWNA),

3
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:16,163
also holds a position of Dean in
the National Program of Amrita University.

4
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:20,103
In this video, she will present
an affordable system for

5
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:25,167
landslide monitoring and early warning, 
using wireless sensor network in India.

6
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:30,834
The system was developed in the context
of the European research project [Winsock]

7
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,634
initiated in 2006.

8
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:37,606
The pilots were conducted 
in 2008 and 2009.

9
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:44,206
This whole work was given to us to look
into how wireless sensor network

10
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:46,883
can be used for disaster monitoring.

11
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,939
And the deliverables were 
mainly focused on

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,760
looking into the lab setups 
and developments.

13
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:58,421
So, our Chancellor has given us 
an opportunity where she has,

14
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:01,599
she's a world renowned humanitarian 
Amma.

15
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:04,561
She has asked us that this is
the opportunity for us 

16
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:07,561
to save lives and serve humanity

17
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:10,770
and asked us to go and deploy 
a system in the field.

18
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:14,891
That's how we were able 
to deploy the system

19
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,171
in the landslide prone areas

20
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:21,060
and then work in the real time, 
real world system.

21
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:25,085
Currently, the system is working 
from 2009 onwards.

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,036
It was able to issue two times 
the warnings,

23
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:32,086
2009, 2011 and even the latest is 2013.

24
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:37,001
And the system has a multi-level 
warning system where it is able to

25
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:42,553
look into how it is progressing the slope 
instability and based on that

26
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:45,193
it is able to give the warning to either
the researchers

27
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:47,646
or the government organizations 
or the community

28
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:49,804
based on the intensity of the risk.

29
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:54,653
And the whole system consists of 150
geophysical sensors

30
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:57,653
which includes seven types of sensors

31
00:01:57,653 --> 00:02:01,284
like raingauge, moisture sensor, 
low pressure sensor,

32
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:07,865
tilt sensors, it has inclinometers, 
it has rain gauges, geophones, etc.

33
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:12,004
And these sensors have been identified
in such a manner

34
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:16,832
that we're able to capture the real time
change in the slope stability.

35
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:21,498
These sensors help us to capture
those changes and with this data

36
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:24,631
are continuously collecting and using
wireless sensor network,

37
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:26,992
sensor node which is above ground,

38
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:29,992
whereas other sensors
are deployed beneath the earth.

39
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:36,260
There are sensors which have been deployed
almost 30 meters down, and you have

40
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,273
multiple sensors at multiple layers
with different parameters

41
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:42,143
has been considered in designing

42
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:45,393
the whole deep earth probe
which consists of the sensors.

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,471
These data are collected and transmitted
to our field management center in Munnar

44
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:57,041
and from there it is transmitted to
the control center at Amrita University.

45
00:02:58,002 --> 00:03:03,883
There, the data is continuously checked
and evaluated using complex algorithms

46
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:08,263
which will help us to understand
the risk levels of the imminent landslide

47
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:13,125
and based on that, automatic warnings
are issued with the respect to

48
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,196
the risk levels which have been seen.

49
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:20,076
Now the major challenge in developing
such a system was that it needs

50
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:23,423
interdisciplinary knowledge. 
Without interdisciplinary knowledge,

51
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,282
we cannot bring an affordable solution
which is capable of working in real time.

52
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:31,665
So we need to work together with 
geologists, computer science,

53
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:34,682
mechanical engineers 
to bring out the solution.

54
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:37,906
And while we were working, 
we had to integrate

55
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:39,866
the different theories together,

56
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:42,557
knit them together, to bring out a result.

57
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:48,253
And based on that, one of the major things
which we were facing was how do

58
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:51,237
we make sure the system is functional
for a long time

59
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:54,822
because this is going to be a real time 
monitoring in a hostile region.

60
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:59,801
You cannot go there and continuously 
monitor and power the system.

61
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:05,207
So we were in a big challenge
of making sure in sustaining the energy

62
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:06,402
for the system.

63
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:10,887
This prompted us to develop
very unique algorithms, which were able

64
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:15,191
to capture the context and based on that
it was able to schedule

65
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:19,965
the different sensors to act and collect 
the data at different rates

66
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,955
based on the changing context,

67
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:28,844
and make sure that even though they change
the amount of data they have collected,

68
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:33,496
it will make sure the reliability 
of that data has not compromised

69
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:35,618
and we're able to give reliable warnings.

70
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:40,337
And once the warning is there,
the major thing there is, it was able

71
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:46,661
to communicate to the society directly
without any external, manual process.

72
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:50,864
It directly, automatically initiate
the different levels of warning.

73
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:56,062
And while building the system, one of
the major things which we have taken up

74
00:04:56,092 --> 00:05:00,133
was providing awareness to the community
about the system.

75
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:05,182
So before even we started the projects,
first we had large scale of workshops

76
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:10,842
which is conducted for the police
and armed forces, for the administration

77
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:15,033
the district administration and for
the community, the Panchayat levels.

78
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,767
Where we have told them what is
the system, why are we doing,

79
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:24,430
how is it going to benefit them, and we 
made them to participate and involve

80
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,235
in the development of the system.

81
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,672
So there were a lot of villages who have
taken part in developing

82
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:32,878
while we were developing the system
so they will help us

83
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:36,424
in maybe cutting the wood or cutting
the different materials we just needed

84
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:40,227
but by being part of it, they felt it
as their own system.

85
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:44,070
One of the major change which we
have seen in the community was

86
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:48,944
that the moment the rain comes, 
they start waiting for our decision

87
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:52,786
because before the system was there, 
what used to happen was

88
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,176
the whole set of population

89
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:59,738
used to actually evacuate themselves
during the monsoon season.

90
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:01,955
That is almost three months 
they don't have job,

91
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:04,955
their kids do not have any education

92
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:08,060
and psychologically and emotionally
is it affecting their life.

93
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:12,589
And they used to go to different places,
stay there, and when the monsoon finishes

94
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:16,328
they come back because 
they were afraid of the landslides

95
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:19,239
which can happen in the night,
which can take their life.

96
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:23,327
Because that's what happened in
the previous years in 2005 and earlier,

97
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:26,167
a lot of people have died because of that.

98
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:30,500
And after we had put in the system,
they believe in the system and even today

99
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,519
they stay in same place 
without doing the evacuation.

100
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:39,001
They wait for our warning to come in
to take any decision.

101
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:42,247
So they believe in the system 
and they have told us

102
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:44,077
that it is such a big relief for them.

103
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:48,270
Psychologically, emotionally
and economically it has helped them

104
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,120
to actually prosper in that place.

105
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:56,787
So, whenever we develop a system,
design, develop and deploy a system

106
00:06:56,818 --> 00:07:00,789
which has to be used in real time,
one of the major considerations

107
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:02,079
we have to look into

108
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,123
is the robustness of the system,
the reliability of the system,

109
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:06,713
the scalability of the system

110
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:10,784
and how do you ensure 
that these things are achievable.

111
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:15,076
So while developing this system
we have always looked into it

112
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:20,420
having redundant answers,
redundant notes which can cater to

113
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,509
the continuous data collection.

114
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:26,851
But we have brought in the redundancy
not only in sensor type,

115
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:32,682
we have even brought in redundancy
with respect to the number of data

116
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:37,026
you are going to sample and receive it
with respect to when you have

117
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:40,143
the different failures, 
the expected failures, like node failure,

118
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:46,051
link failure and propagational effects
can cause loss of connectivity.

119
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:50,119
So we have come up with protocols
which will adaptively understand

120
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:53,658
how the climate is changing
and based on that which is going to be

121
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:58,327
my best neighbor which will be able 
to capture my data

122
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:01,327
and send it with the minimum latency.

123
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:04,939
So always latency was another 
major concern which we had to look into it

124
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:07,345
because you want issue 
a real time warning.

125
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:13,133
So even though you may have thirty nodes,
you have to found out the best route

126
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,123
which will take through all the data
with minimum end to end and link delay,

127
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:21,600
with maximum reliability in the data.

128
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:28,527
And as you know that, these data had to 
be sent during the worst climate scenarios

129
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:32,027
because the landslides happen
when there is heavy rainfall.

130
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:36,210
That's when you have the maximum problem,
and you will experience

131
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,660
the maximum propogational effects
for a wireless communication.

132
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:45,567
So we had used unique algorithms
or novel algorithms

133
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:49,285
which were capable to understand
the scenario ahead of time

134
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:54,366
so that they were able to constrain
and or they were able

135
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,906
to reduce the package loss

136
00:08:56,906 --> 00:08:59,727
which may affect during such 
harsh environment

137
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:02,007
and send the data through that.

138
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:07,546
And also, since these are like 
low powered wireless sensor nodes

139
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:12,077
has been used for collecting data,
their transmission range is very less

140
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:15,286
and they get very easily affected 
by the propagation effects.

141
00:09:15,444 --> 00:09:22,216
So if you put it for a large scale area
this is going to create problems.

142
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:24,232
So what we had come up with
we came up with

143
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:28,992
a heterogeneous network architecture
where we have used zigbee Wi-Fi,

144
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:32,688
satellite network and 
the cellular network to make sure the data

145
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,788
is transmitted at different levels.

146
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,521
So, we had a probe network
which consists of all

147
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:41,871
this intelligent wireless probe 
integrated with deeper probes

148
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:45,228
consisting of all the sensors
which collects the data

149
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:49,838
and the probe gateway will transmit 
all the data through the Wi-Fi network

150
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:53,970
to the field management center, and from
the field management center, the data

151
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,305
is transmitted to our university, 
the control center

152
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,617
through satellite network and if there 
is a fault coming up,

153
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:04,757
automatically from the satellite, 
it will actually change

154
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:08,043
to cellular network
so that will be very able to make sure

155
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:10,806
that transmission is taken care of.

156
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:14,209
The other thing which we were 
also looking into

157
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:18,119
was when you have these multiple networks,

158
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:20,852
you have to make sure how the traffic
is managed.

159
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:23,673
So now each of the networks, 
the capabilities are different.

160
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:27,481
So based on that, automatically 
this traffic is catered to

161
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:32,070
and we were giving priority of the data
which is necessary with the respect

162
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,810
to the change in the context.

163
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:38,363
That was another thing which we were
building into the whole system.

164
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,549
The third thing was, 
whenever you have a data,

165
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:43,549
you have a problem of losing the data.

166
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:46,564
So, there was multi-level 
of storage system

167
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:50,644
which was making sure that even if 
we lose a link a one point,

168
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,144
whenever the link comes back

169
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:55,364
we're able to retrieve the data
which has been collected

170
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,044
and whenever a link fails, it will
automatically give the information

171
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,473
to the researcher, there
is a problem happening.

172
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:03,583
So the maintenance can be very quick.

173
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,791
And since it now has been running
for nearly now a decade,

174
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:11,922
we have learned, there was a lot of things
which we have learned in the whole process

175
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:16,996
and this helped us also looking into
how can we remotely configure the network,

176
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:19,604
how can we remotely trigger the network.

177
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:23,791
So we are able to actually control
each and every sensor in the field

178
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:27,264
when it has to sample, how much it has
to sample, what it is.

179
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:31,655
And also, the complete software system
has been developed at Amrita

180
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:36,123
and we made in such a manner that we're
able to remotely trigger the software

181
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:40,634
that means, the very time that you see 
that there is a change which is needed

182
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:45,446
in a piece of software, we're able
to send the code from our University,

183
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:48,755
which is 300 kilometers away,
and then install it

184
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:51,756
in each and every wireless sensor node
which is there.

185
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:56,636
Rather than waiting for a risk to happen
and then do the management aspect

186
00:11:56,714 --> 00:12:03,205
this is one of the system which has shown
it's capability to look into the changes

187
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:07,947
in the earth's system, understand 
the changes and based on that changes

188
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:14,486
they're able to warn the people,
leading to reduction of risk in disasters.

189
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,348
And this technology has the capability
to be used in other disaster areas,

190
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:22,820
like flood monitoring, 
avalanche, drought etc.

191
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:27,069
So we are extending this work 
into other areas of deployment

192
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:30,951
so that multi-disaster probabilities
can be looked into it

193
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:34,871
and warning can be issued to reduce
the disaster risk.
