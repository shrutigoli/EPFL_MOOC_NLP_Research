Hi. Mark van den Homberg 
is an applied researcher.

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,419
His work focuses on improving 
network organizations

3
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,259
through coordination 
and information management

4
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:18,371
for natural disasters 
and complex emergencies.

5
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,238
He consults for the NGO Cordaid 

6
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,929
and the Netherlands Organization 
for Applied Scientific Research,

7
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:27,401
TNO, among others.

8
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:29,861
Data preparedness is very important.

9
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:34,921
It should be an essential part 
of overall preparedness activities

10
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:38,972
because the more data that is collected
before a disaster hits,

11
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,022
the better you can have your response,

12
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:46,342
because the more you will have 
accurate and reliable data.

13
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:48,913
And, to reach data preparedness,

14
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:53,483
it's important to, first of all,
identify the information needs.

15
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,512
You need to know of those 
responding professionals,

16
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:58,479
but also of the responding community:

17
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,437
What do they really need 
to take well-informed decisions?

18
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:06,806
Secondly, it's important, as well,
to have standards

19
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:10,975
because you will have, always,
multiple stakeholders collecting data

20
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:16,554
so the more they have common denominators
or use a certain hashtag, for example--

21
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:20,187
like it's done in the Humanitarian 
Exchange Language--

22
00:01:20,187 --> 00:01:23,405
the more it's easy to bring
all the data together.

23
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:28,158
And, certainly, it's also important 
to have local capacity

24
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:32,570
because, right now, a lot of processes
are still paper-based,

25
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,703
it's important that local stakeholders

26
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:39,483
know how to work with digital tools

27
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:41,252
and know how to use a smartphone,

28
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:49,053
or to develop a basic literacy level 
in digital technologies.

29
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:54,043
Can I explain more about information gaps 
and information overloads?

30
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,750
But, in order to explain, it's maybe good
to identify three groups

31
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,839
that are active in the preparedness
and in the response phase:

32
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:07,209
You have the community 
that is affected by the disaster.

33
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,081
You have the people within 
the community that are responding,

34
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:12,011
so that's the responding community,

35
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:14,671
and they are, actually, usually,
the first responders.

36
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,721
And we have the professional responders,

37
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:20,003
like civil defense, 
or government professionals,

38
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:22,123
or people from NGOs.

39
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:26,443
And all these three groups,
they need data,

40
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:29,683
they need information to take decisions

41
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,040
and to do the right thing 
after a disaster hits.

42
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,264
And, actually, they often face
information overload

43
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:38,503
because there are so many actors;

44
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,843
there are many professional responders,

45
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:43,005
there are many people in the community,

46
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:47,974
and all those actors 
produce different data files,

47
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:50,575
they do different assessments.

48
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:56,095
So there's a lot 
of heterogeneous data available

49
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:58,925
and it's very hard 
to bring that data together,

50
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:01,514
so that leads to an information overload.

51
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:05,275
But, on the other hand,
we also have an information gap

52
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:09,016
because the data that is available,

53
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:12,368
is often data that is already 
a few weeks old,

54
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:16,137
or even a few years,
in case of the national census data,

55
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:19,426
for example, from a statistics office.

56
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:24,146
So the data that's really about 
the local communities that are affected,

57
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:27,257
that's really timely, 
that data's often missing.

58
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:29,978
So that's the information gap.

59
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:34,768
The information gap has a lot to do
with the fact that the last mile

60
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:36,620
is often paper-based.

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,528
What do I mean with that?

62
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,598
If you look at, for example, Bangladesh,

63
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,237
you have different 
administrative divisions:

64
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:47,769
You have the national government,
you have a division,

65
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,109
a district, a union, and a ward,

66
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,650
and often, the largest part--
so the ward or the union level--

67
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,426
their local government officials,
they collect data only paper-based,

68
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:02,700
or by phone, and they write it down,

69
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,590
and those processes are not yet digitized.

70
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,420
And, often, they collect the data,
they add the numbers up,

71
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,610
and then they go to the next 
administrative level,

72
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,554
and the granularity of the data is lost.

73
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:20,688
So there is, actually, 
kind of a data loss,

74
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:23,249
and, often, it's not digital.

75
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:25,586
And the same happens, 
actually, with NGOs.

76
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:28,988
A lot of NGOs do 
community risk assessments

77
00:04:28,988 --> 00:04:32,018
in the preparedness phase,
together with the community,

78
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:36,248
and they use big sheets of paper,
or even, just, they do it on the ground.

79
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:37,207
Together with the community,

80
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:41,877
they work on what are the hazards, 
what are the vulnerabilities,

81
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:45,249
but also, that information 
is only paper-based.

82
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:48,489
We can use science and technology 
in different ways

83
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:51,243
for addressing the information gap,

84
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:53,675
as well as the information overload.

85
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:56,907
One of the ways we can use science

86
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,046
is for making a dashboard

87
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:03,578
and using data visualization,

88
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:07,666
such, that it's easier 
for the responding professionals

89
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,858
to make sense of all the data.

90
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:12,986
You can imagine, 
if you have many data files,

91
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:16,088
that, if you put them 
in a geographic information system--

92
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:19,718
if you do that just as separate layers--

93
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:22,680
it doesn't provide you with much insight.

94
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,645
So, advances in data science

95
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:29,305
can help to fuse data sets

96
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:34,173
and to really come up with a visualization
that helps you, as a responder,

97
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:37,203
to understand better,
what's happening on the ground.

98
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,393
And the second part of data science,

99
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:41,704
which will be very useful in the future,

100
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:45,853
is using technologies to integrate

101
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:48,681
what's often called "disparate data sets."

102
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:53,160
So, if you have an Excel file, 
and a PDF file, and a Word file,

103
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,401
all kinds of files in different formats,

104
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:58,522
there is, currently, 
technology available--

105
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,650
such as data and text mining--

106
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,702
that you can use to integrate
those data sets,

107
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:09,042
and to bring together the common elements
out of those different data sets.

108
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,894
So, it becomes much easier, also, then,

109
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:14,153
to make sense out of all those data sets.

110
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:17,683
So, data and text mining, 
and data visualization,

111
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:21,233
those are two very important new advances.

112
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:25,954
Another "modern" technology we can use

113
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:28,744
to address 
the information gap, especially,

114
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:31,715
is to leverage mobile technologies.

115
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,042
In developing countries, now,
the penetration of mobile phones

116
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:41,450
has reached, also, often 90%,
or even close to 100%,

117
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,702
so a lot of people have mobile telephones.

118
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:45,970
And we can easily use those,

119
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,613
of course, to collect the data 
directly on the ground.

120
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:54,893
With low-tech mobile phones,
we can use text messaging

121
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:57,782
to collect, for example, 
local water levels.

122
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:02,693
And, with smartphones,
we can use an app and a survey

123
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:05,873
to address many questions.
