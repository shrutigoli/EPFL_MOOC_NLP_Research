1
00:00:05,502 --> 00:00:08,084
...amount of precipitation we can measure.

2
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:11,935
Then if the precipitation measurement 
exceeds a certain limit

3
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:14,936
then there might be a risk of landslide

4
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:18,865
and in that way we can issue some 
early warning system.

5
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:21,477
We can tell the community people

6
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:26,038
then make some arrangement
regarding the early warning system

7
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:29,527
so that they can inform other communities

8
00:00:29,527 --> 00:00:33,929
that, "Oh, there is a chance of landslide
so we should prepare."

9
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,488
Dear participants, welcome 
to chapter 4 of the MOOC

10
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:41,730
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction.

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,531
In this chapter, we will present 
how science and technology

12
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:48,341
are used for early warning 
and preparedness.

13
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:50,040
And through the online forum

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,970
we will exchange information and knowledge

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,611
about appropriate technologies
for prevention and preparedness.

16
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,302
Some of the questions 
that will be addressed are the following:

17
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:03,443
How can science and technology 
help people to be better prepared?

18
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:06,712
How are science and technology 
used for risk communication?

19
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:08,802
What are early warning systems?

20
00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:13,374
The topics of this chapter are presented 
through lectures and interviews.

21
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,484
Many of the interviews 
were carried out during

22
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:18,701
the UNESCO Technologies 
for Development Conference:

23
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,766
From Innovation to Social Impact

24
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:24,507
that took place at EPFL in May, 2016.

25
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:28,117
After watching the videos, 
we invite you to participate

26
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:31,547
in the first discussion forum
of this MOOC on science and technology

27
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:33,771
for prevention and preparedness.

28
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:37,027
We would like to invite you 
to share and exchange your experience

29
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:39,517
with us and the other participants,

30
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:43,507
as this will help all of us to increase 
and further disseminate

31
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:45,357
knowledge on DRR.
