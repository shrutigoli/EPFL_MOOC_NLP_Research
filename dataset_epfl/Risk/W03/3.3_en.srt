00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:06,471
Hi, my name is Karen Sudmeier-Rieux.

2
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:09,529
I'm a senior researcher
at the University of Lausanne

3
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:11,605
and a training and education consultant

4
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:13,625
with the United Nations
Environment Programme.

5
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,291
This video will be about the importance

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,881
of ecosystem-based
disasters reduction and adaptation.

7
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:24,889
We'll then go over a case study
related to Nepal and Eco-DRR,

8
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:27,539
or Ecosystem-based
Disaster Risk Reduction.

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,369
We'll then look at the science
and technology and Eco-DRR linkages,

10
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:34,613
and incorporating
local knowledge with Eco-DRR.

11
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,650
And, finally, we'll conclude
with main points.

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,150
Let me start with an example

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,635
on the importance
of ecosystem-based disasters reduction,

14
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:43,225
with an example
from tropical storm Jeanne

15
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:47,057
which hit the island
of Hispaniola in 2004.

16
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:50,615
This island is split between Haiti
and the Dominican Republic.

17
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:56,427
Haiti, unfortunately, lost over
6,000 people during this tropical storm,

18
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:59,893
whereas in the Dominican Republic,
18 people lost their lives.

19
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,086
There were over US$ 7 billion in damages.

20
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:06,852
This slide shows the border
between Haiti on your left,

21
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:09,352
and the Dominican Republic on the right.

22
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:12,117
This also explains why so many
more people lost their lives

23
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:16,017
during the tropical storm Jeanne
than in the Dominican Republic,

24
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:18,618
mainly due to debris flow and flooding.

25
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:21,646
Most of the 18 people who lost
their lives in the Dominican Republic

26
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:24,866
are actually living on the border
between both countries.

27
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:27,349
So, as we can see,
ecosystem-based approaches

28
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:30,529
are extremely important
for reducing disaster risk.

29
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:34,327
This slide shows Yala National Park,

30
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:37,937
which was hit by the Indian Ocean
tsunami in 2004.

31
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:40,586
In the red circle, you see
an ecotourism resort

32
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:44,456
which is naturally nestled
behind the sand dunes.

33
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:48,806
During the tsunami, only five centimeters
of water entered the ecotourism resort,

34
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:50,979
and there were no casualties.

35
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,578
This slide shows the Yala Safari Resort,

36
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:56,938
where they cut down the sand dunes
for better sea views.

37
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,458
Unfortunately, during the tsunami,
27 people lost their lives

38
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:04,067
after a seven-meter
high wave hit the resort.

39
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,829
It also really demonstrates
the importance of sand dunes

40
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,279
as natural buffers against tsunamis.

41
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,299
This slide shows
the importance of vegetation

42
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,299
as a protection against coastal hazards.

43
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:16,395
This image is from Senegal,
and shows mangroves

44
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:20,595
that are protecting the coast
against erosion and sea surges.

45
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:22,248
This image from southern France

46
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:25,768
demonstrates how wetlands
can act as buffers against flooding,

47
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:28,358
as it offers space for excess rainwater.

48
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:31,070
Here we see how forest can reduce
occurrence of mountain hazards.

49
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,958
This is a protection forest
in Davos, Switzerland

50
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:38,041
which protects the town
from avalanches, rockfall and landslides.

51
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,378
So, we can say that ecosystems
are one of the few approaches

52
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:44,398
that address all three components
of the risk equation.

53
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:49,936
Hazards, we just saw several examples
how ecosystems can act as natural buffers

54
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,298
for reducing or mitigating hazards.

55
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:57,038
Ecosystems provide many services,
such as food and fiber

56
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:59,868
and can reduce
the vulnerability of populations

57
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:02,950
before, during and after disasters.

58
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,477
So, ecosystems can reduce exposure
by functioning as natural buffers

59
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,877
with elements at risk.

60
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:09,698
This slide shows a forest

61
00:03:09,698 --> 00:03:14,318
that was planted
on a steep slope in Afghanistan.

62
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,139
So, it acts both to stabilize the slope,

63
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:20,639
but also when you have trees
in an area that's very dangerous

64
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,200
people do not actually live there,

65
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,451
so it reduces their exposure
in this way as well.

66
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,580
So, how do we define Eco-DRR?

67
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,179
Eco-DRR is the sustainable management,
conservation and restoration of ecosystems

68
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,800
to reduce disaster risk

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,910
with the aim of achieving
sustainable and resilient development.

70
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,342
Very similar is the concept
of ecosystem-based adaptation, or EbA,

71
00:03:41,342 --> 00:03:44,562
which involves the use
of biodiversity and ecosystem services

72
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:46,132
through sustainable management,

73
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:48,582
conservation and restoration
of ecosystems,

74
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:52,165
to help people adapt
to the adverse effects of climate change.

75
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:56,774
This diagram explains the benefits
of various types of approaches

76
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,724
to disaster risk reduction.

77
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:03,301
Eco-DRR and EbA provide
disaster prevention and recovery.

78
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:05,851
In addition, they provide
hazard mitigation,

79
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:07,802
climate change adaptation,

80
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:12,332
water, soil, and air purification,
livelihoods benefits, biodiversity,

81
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:15,161
CO2 sequestration, recreation.

82
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:19,231
As compared to more classical engineering,
or grey approaches

83
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:21,792
to hazard mitigation
and disaster prevention,

84
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:24,232
which mainly focus on these two goals.

85
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:30,365
Hybrid approaches combine both,
offer maximum protection in many cases.

86
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:32,774
An example would be
combining protection forests

87
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:35,524
with paravalanche barriers.

88
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:39,512
We also know that Eco-DRR approaches
are often more cost-effective

89
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:44,283
and increase in strength over time,
such as soil bioengineering

90
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:47,223
which combines small
civil engineering structures

91
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:50,554
with deep-rooted plant species.

92
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:53,825
Now, these may take longer
to be established

93
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:56,515
but they require much less
maintenance over the long run,

94
00:04:56,515 --> 00:05:01,355
as compared to purely civil engineering
approaches to hazard mitigation.

95
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:04,365
We will see a case study in soil
bioengineering in Nepal

96
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:06,095
later in this video.

97
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:08,951
Let me give some examples
of Eco-DRR approaches,

98
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:11,656
which include integrated
coastal zone management,

99
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:14,045
integrated water resource management,

100
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:17,495
protected area management,
integrated fire management

101
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:19,566
and sustainable land management.

102
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:22,726
These are all natural resource
management approaches

103
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:24,675
that have been around for decades,

104
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:29,685
yet which are only recently beginning
to incorporate disaster risk reduction.

105
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:32,147
For example, integrated
coastal zone management

106
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:36,287
is mainly about managing coastal resources
with multiple stakeholders,

107
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:41,387
and can and should include early warning
and evacuation provisions.

108
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:45,278
And finally, community-based
natural resource and risk management,

109
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,978
as well as gender issues,

110
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:51,019
are cross-cutting to all
of these Eco-DRR approaches.

111
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,387
Now I would like to introduce
a case study on Eco-DRR in Nepal,

112
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:59,201
where we look in more detail on soil
bioengineering for stabilizing slopes.

113
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:02,305
I would like to introduce
the case study which covers the project:

114
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:06,545
Ecosystems Protecting Infrastructure
and Communities, or EPIC,

115
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:09,750
which is a five-year project
in six countries seeking to understand

116
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,201
the role of ecosystems
in reducing disaster risk.

117
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:17,830
It is managed by the International Union
for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN,

118
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,793
together with the University of Lausanne,

119
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:22,003
with funding from
the government of Germany.

120
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:25,703
In Nepal, the project's objectives
are to enhance local knowledge

121
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:29,390
and national uptake
of bioengineering or eco-safe roads;

122
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,201
build capacity of local
and national actors--

123
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:34,831
development, environment and DRR actors--

124
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:37,446
with regards to Eco-DRR
and bioengineering;

125
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:42,231
and finally, to mainstream Eco-DRR
into local, nation and global policies.

126
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:45,619
Let's watch this short video clip
which explains the context

127
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:48,389
for why we're working
on this topic in Nepal.

128
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,879
One of the main priorities
of the government of Nepal

129
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,203
for the past decade has been
the construction of rural roads

130
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:57,721
connecting villages to towns and cities.

131
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:00,960
Having a road is extremely
important for villages;

132
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,220
it gives them access
to markets, to education,

133
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,337
healthcare, especially employment.

134
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:10,351
However, one of the issues
with rural roads

135
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:16,381
is that many of them have been funded
and constructed by communities themselves,

136
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:20,062
such as this rural road that you see
on the hilltop behind us.

137
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:23,853
This rural road was constructed
about five years ago

138
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:26,333
and unfortunately triggered
an old landslide,

139
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:31,237
and is causing a very dangerous situation
to the villages below it.

140
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:33,180
It's also creating a lot of debris flow

141
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,589
and has buried several hectares
of productive agricultural land,

142
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:43,300
creating economic losses
and also high risk to the population.

143
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,989
These types of landslides
that are triggered by roads

144
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:51,530
are actually one of the main triggers
of shallow landslides,

145
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,019
and one of the greatest sources

146
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,269
of environmental degradation
in Nepal today.

147
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:00,861
This diagram illustrates in more detail
what we saw in the video clip.

148
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:03,850
We see a new road
that has triggered an old landslide.

149
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,354
This landslide is creating debris
which is being transported downslope

150
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:11,371
to the bottom of the mountain

151
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:15,392
where a huge deposition zone
is now burying agricultural lands.

152
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:20,211
So, the EPIC project established
three demonstration sites in Western Nepal

153
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:22,054
near the Pokhara area,

154
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:25,252
in which one of the villages
had highly degraded slopes,

155
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:26,788
partly due to grazing pressure,

156
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:28,878
but especially due
to poor water management

157
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,268
along a locally constructed road.

158
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,773
The image on the right
shows the same site two years later,

159
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:38,382
after we had installed small drainage
structures along the road

160
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:40,654
and employed various
bioengineering techniques,

161
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:45,553
involving the plantation of various
bamboo species to stabilize the gullies.

162
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:49,552
All this was undertaken
in collaboration with the local community

163
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,675
which continues to monitor the site,

164
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:55,553
and is now interested in expanding
the bioengineering works

165
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:58,734
to other heavily-degraded slopes.

166
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:01,014
This road is now open during the monsoon

167
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:04,385
and provides fodder grasses
for the community livestock.

168
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:09,516
Another activity has included
a so-called rhizotron,

169
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,947
where we planted eight different species
of grasses with deep roots

170
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:14,717
that were selected by the community

171
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:18,547
as the most appropriate
plant species for bioengineering.

172
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:23,359
We also installed a micro weather
station at the three sites,

173
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:26,311
which are being cared for
by the local communities.

174
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:30,931
And, finally, we're quantifying
ecosystem services at each site,

175
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:34,899
or the extent to which the vegetation
is reducing erosion rates.

176
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:39,200
We are doing this using
state-of-the-art technology called LIDAR

177
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,250
which uses laser light
to measure distance with high accuracy.

178
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,160
For more information on this case study,

179
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,690
see the video clip
from my colleague Sanjay Devkota,

180
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,630
who was a Nepali civil engineer
and specialized in bioengineering.

181
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,260
Basically we are using
the grasses species

182
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,190
and some other species
to stabilize shallow landslide,

183
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:05,572
and also to improve
the degraded land slope.

184
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:11,762
The area here is basically
open grazing land area

185
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:14,803
where people used to graze their animals,

186
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:18,803
and when we visited
this area two years ago

187
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:23,813
we found it a very nice place
to establish a demonstration site.

188
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:28,335
I tried to reach to the community people
and we started talking with the people

189
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:33,595
and asking them to give this area
for the demonstration site.

190
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,544
We visited it a couple
of times, at that time.

191
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:41,157
People were not very convinced
at the beginning.

192
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:45,698
We took support from the District Soil
Conservation Office,

193
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:48,698
IUCN and also UNIL,

194
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:53,076
and after a couple of meetings
the people agreed

195
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:56,739
to give a part of this area

196
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,339
to establish the bioengineering
demonstration site.

197
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:04,596
This is the area where we implement
our resources technique;

198
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,926
it's all about soil bioengineering,

199
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:13,377
where we implement the low-cost
technique of bioengineering

200
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:15,476
in consultation with the local people.

201
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:21,676
We also try to apply the simple
civil engineering component

202
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:26,369
to stabilize these gullies.

203
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:30,940
Where we can see the different plants,
we applied this broom grass technique

204
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,394
it's a live fencing technique,

205
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:36,524
and we also applied
some other species

206
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:40,588
that's really very good
for protecting the soil slope.

207
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:44,392
We also established a test plot

208
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:49,702
where we're monitoring the root system
of different plant species.

209
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:53,510
We are looking for a root architect,

210
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,150
and the drought-resistance species

211
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,232
that may be very good
for the bioengineering technique.

212
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:07,232
Altogether here we planted
eight different species,

213
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:12,244
not only in this plot
but also in this gully protection

214
00:12:12,244 --> 00:12:15,994
and all the roadside
slope stabilization works.

215
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:18,014
I'd like to wrap up this video

216
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:20,901
by commenting on the importance
of science and technology

217
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:21,988
at various levels,

218
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:26,906
to better understand how ecosystems
can contribute to disaster risk reduction,

219
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:29,626
from state-of-the-art LIDAR technology

220
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:33,451
to using local knowledge
in establishing plant test plots.

221
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:36,675
Finally, it is by combining
local knowledge with formal science

222
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:39,716
that we have been able
to achieve promising results,

223
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,836
which are now being multiplied
at the local level

224
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:45,568
and are also being communicated
to national policymakers,

225
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:49,788
to affect more sustainable
road construction practices in Nepal.

226
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:52,918
I'd like to wrap up this video
with some main points.

227
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:56,228
The first is that Eco-DRR
can offer many additional benefits

228
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:59,778
over traditional
disaster managing practices.

229
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:04,611
Second is that they can often be
more cost-effective over the long run.

230
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,690
However, we need to recognize

231
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,690
that ecosystems often have
some limitations

232
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,071
and can be beneficial in combination

233
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:15,071
with more traditional
engineering approaches.

234
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:18,954
And finally, by combining
local knowledge with formal science,

235
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:23,883
this can be an effective and empowering
approach to disaster risk reduction.
