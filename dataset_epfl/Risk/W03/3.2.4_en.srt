1
00:00:04,643 --> 00:00:08,643
When dealing with mitigation of risk
related to natural hazards,

2
00:00:08,643 --> 00:00:12,575
specialists have to face the reality
of the land-use planners.

3
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:18,385
Land-use planners are in charge 
of guiding the development of a territory;

4
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:23,256
considering optimal solutions;
stakeholder's interest;

5
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:28,186
geographical, social, economic,
and ecological constraints;

6
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:31,964
and, of course,
the legislative framework.

7
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,886
Within this video,
I would like to introduce you

8
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:38,811
to the main definition 
of land-use planning

9
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:42,231
and show you different approaches
to land-use planning processes.

10
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:45,034
Finally, I will explain to you

11
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:47,986
the generic approach 
applied in Switzerland.

12
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,427
Here is the definition 
of land-use planning

13
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:53,587
according to UNISDR.

14
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:56,456
What should be highlighted 
in this definition

15
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:00,038
are the economic, social,
and environmental aspects,

16
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:01,618
as well as the involvement

17
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:05,726
of different communities
and interest groups in the process.

18
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:09,228
The Swiss approach 
places land-use planning

19
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:13,468
above a technical flow stream
of hazard mitigation.

20
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:17,218
What I mean by this is that
specialists and engineers

21
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:21,022
that deal with these technical aspects 
in the main flow stream--

22
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:22,758
as you can see here,

23
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:25,840
where you find hazard mapping,
risk assessment,

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,010
structural measures, et cetera--

25
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,968
will have to discuss 
with different stakeholders

26
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:33,130
at planning level.

27
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,150
This is the level where

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,549
balancing of interest
between stakeholders will happen.

29
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:41,161
In comparison with the Swiss approach,

30
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,661
the French approach 
considers land-use planning

31
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:45,701
as an individual step.

32
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:48,052
I will now present the Swiss approach.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,461
As showed in the previous flow streams,

34
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:54,461
the first step is always hazard mapping.

35
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:58,830
The necessary working steps 
to establish a hazard map are:

36
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,841
data collection,
field preparation and field work,

37
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:06,211
and data transcription and analysis.

38
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:11,262
A map of phenomena and an intensity map
are needed to generate a hazard map.

39
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:15,152
The work starts in the office
by collecting data

40
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:19,448
and defining scientific and product 
management procedures to be used.

41
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,292
According to my experience,

42
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:25,742
the exchange with other colleagues
is not to be underestimated.

43
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:30,225
Their experience often brings
a significant added value.

44
00:02:31,323 --> 00:02:33,532
Before starting the data collection,

45
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:37,244
you have to be clear 
about which data you specifically need.

46
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:40,253
You should then ask yourself what quality,

47
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:44,514
what resolution, and at what frequency
the data should be updated.

48
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:48,754
In most cases, you will 
have to use what is available,

49
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:52,664
but be careful, not everything 
that is available is useful.

50
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:55,729
By the way, do you all know 
what data on natural hazards

51
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:57,619
are available in your country?

52
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,929
Why don't you check 
and write it in our forum.

53
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,410
It would help us 
understand your situation.

54
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,849
Before going to the field 
and having in mind

55
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,390
which data are needed,

56
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,380
it is also important 
to establish procedures

57
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,470
in order to be sure 
that the collected data

58
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,491
can later be analyzed.

59
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:16,931
Field work should be 
organized beforehand.

60
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,841
What should be considered?

61
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:23,362
The organization and logistics 
that it entails,

62
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:25,712
the site accessibility,

63
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:29,342
the environmental context 
and seasonal variations,

64
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,713
as well as weather conditions 
and vegetation cover.

65
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:36,323
Do not underestimate the field conditions.

66
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:40,094
These pictures show 
the conditions you could find:

67
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:44,885
steep slopes, dangerous and challenging 
environment with unstable terrain,

68
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:46,964
or strong water flows.

69
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:51,005
Do not forget that hazard mapping
can be a risk in itself.

70
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,933
Think about the security procedures
when going to the field.

71
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:59,063
Back to the office, 
the data treatment begins.

72
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:03,053
Specific hazard maps 
are layered in a GIS program:

73
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:07,545
one layer for landslide,
one for floods, et cetera.

74
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:10,126
The hazard mapping is now completed.

75
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,016
We can now present the results

76
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:16,416
and discuss land-use planning 
implementation with stakeholders

77
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,126
and/or start assessing the risk.

78
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:23,114
You have here, 
the Swiss definition of risk.

79
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:26,354
Based on hazard mapping,
the risk can be calculated

80
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:29,286
as the monetary value
of the damage,

81
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:31,447
or the number of fatalities.

82
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:36,936
This is a function of the event's potential
times the damage's potential.

83
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:40,838
This value can come from 
insurance policies, for example.

84
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:46,143
Once the risk is known,
you have to decide how to manage the risk.

85
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:50,443
The Swiss strategy entails that risks
are part of the land-use management

86
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:53,910
through the maintenance 
of the recommended level of security

87
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,445
for all natural hazards.

88
00:04:56,445 --> 00:05:00,015
Here is a sketch 
that illustrates this strategy.

89
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:02,913
Protection goals need to be defined.

90
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:05,265
This is where the interests 
of stakeholders

91
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:09,545
will be weighted against each other
to define the protection goal level.

92
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:12,866
I will talk more about this further.

93
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:15,674
If the risk is higher 
than the protection goals,

94
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:17,438
as shown in the picture,

95
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:20,486
actions are taken to lower the risk.

96
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,896
The achieved security level is now the one

97
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:26,735
you want to maintain
and guarantee over the long term.

98
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:30,373
Note that after 
the integrated action planning,

99
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,237
the achieved security level

100
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:35,758
is always the same 
or below protection goals.

101
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:39,677
Stakeholders, that is to say,
authorities, owners,

102
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:42,100
site managers, site operators,

103
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,267
urban planners,
natural hazard specialists

104
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:46,745
should be involved to define

105
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:49,331
the best adapted 
land-use planning solution.

106
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:52,258
To what extent should decision makers

107
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:56,175
engage in the avoidance 
and reduction of risk?

108
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:59,675
Which risks are risk carriers
willing to accept?

109
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:04,376
Which risks does the community expect 
the risk carriers to accept?

110
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:08,096
How can illegitimate 
risk transfers be avoided?

111
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:13,667
Public authorities are a key contributor 
to risk avoidance and risk mitigation.

112
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:18,427
They should make use of land-use planning
as an instrument to avoid newer risks.

113
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:22,415
The final decision 
often lays with authorities.

114
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:26,176
While asked to be the referee 
in balancing interests,

115
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:30,587
one has to be aware that decisions 
will be partially subjective.

116
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:33,708
It is impossible to set a hazard level

117
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:38,180
that will be universally applied
to define if buildings are safe or not.

118
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,448
A country has to take into account
all these aspects:

119
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:44,159
demography, economy and finance,

120
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,248
socio-cultural perception,

121
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:49,670
types of hazards and risks,
and insurances.

122
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,230
For example, Japan will have 
a completely different challenge

123
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,919
with the higher risks of earthquakes,

124
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,320
than Bangladesh with flooding, 
or Nepal with landslides.

125
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,379
Demographical development is a key aspect.

126
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,843
With increasing urbanization, 
risk exposures can evolve quickly.

127
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:10,483
The main reason for the shift

128
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:13,723
from centralized 
to decentralized organization

129
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:17,453
is that local scales are more efficient
in dealing with tasks

130
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:20,193
related to risk and emergency management.

131
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:24,413
The Swiss approach 
is based on local context,

132
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,415
regional or national,

133
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:29,145
and on the identified risks.

134
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:32,114
Decisions are taken 
at decentralized level.

135
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:35,135
We want natural hazard mitigation

136
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:39,205
to be integrated in the routine approach
to land-use planning.

137
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:43,195
Land-use planning is a complex procedure
encompassing many steps

138
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:46,306
in which, one of them,
is natural hazards.

139
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:49,435
Part of the work 
of natural hazard specialists

140
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,126
is therefore to make the data available

141
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:55,586
and explain the context 
to land-use planning specialists

142
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:58,218
in an understandable way.

143
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:00,557
This procedure chart has been established

144
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:03,728
to accompany the hazard
mitigation procedure

145
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:06,518
in the Swiss state 
where EPFL lays.

146
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,397
You will find the official version

147
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:12,248
in the reference documents
of this training.

148
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:16,197
What I would like you to note
is that the land-use planning actions

149
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:18,948
are taken at the beginning of the process.

150
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:22,058
If land-use planning is not sufficient
to mitigate risks,

151
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:26,858
then organizational passive 
and active measures will be taken.

152
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:32,399
The key messages that I would like you 
to remember about land-use planning

153
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,268
is that it is the first action 
for the mitigation of risks

154
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:38,730
related to natural hazards.

155
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,838
However, the approach has to 
be based on local conditions.

156
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:45,889
This is why the priority should be given

157
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:49,020
to decentralized analyses 
of the situation.

158
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,349
Therefore, there is no universal approach
to land-use planning.

159
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:57,090
This presentation can be summarized
in these two golden rules:

160
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,212
What is important to remember

161
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:02,982
is that data analysis 
and hazard mapping come first.

162
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,721
And that non-structural measures
should be implemented

163
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:09,571
before structural measures.

164
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,282
Thank you for watching.
