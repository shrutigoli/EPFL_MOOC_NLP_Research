00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,893
Insurance as a Risk Transfer Instrument

00:00:01,893 --> 00:00:04,236
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction

3
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:08,301
Welcome to this video about insurance
and disaster risk management.

4
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:12,262
This particular video is produced
for this MOOC by the SDC,

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,266
the Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation.

6
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:18,487
I'm Roland Steinmann,
a senior consultant on microinsurance

7
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:19,996
with the MicroInsurance Centre.

8
00:00:20,673 --> 00:00:23,591
In this video you will get
an introduction to the basic principles

9
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,591
of insurance as a risk transfer mechanism

10
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,054
and I explain how insurance fits into

11
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:32,054
the broader
disaster risk management approach.

12
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:35,662
We we look at the definition and
basic principles of insurance,

13
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:39,214
solidarity and mutuality and its limits,

14
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:41,411
what is an insurable event,

15
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:44,120
how to calculate an insurance premium,

16
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:46,931
the causes for headache from
an insurer's perspective,

17
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:50,053
and you will get a primer on
index insurance.

18
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:55,370
(speaker) <i>We all face a variety of risks
and often have several options</i>

19
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,340
<i>at hand to deal with them.</i>

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,319
<i>For the purpose of illustration,
let's look at flood risk.</i>

21
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:06,255
<i>First, we can try to avoid certain risks,
for example, we could move out of</i>

22
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:09,415
<i>a flood risk zone to avoid being flooded.</i>

23
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:14,407
<i>Second, we can reinforce dams so that
in the case of a flood,</i>

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,354
<i> the impact is lower
than we had not improved it.</i>

25
00:01:18,424 --> 00:01:23,540
<i>Third, we can prepare for the flood event
and plan what to do</i>

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,990
<i> in case the flood occurs.</i>

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,458
<i>Finally, we can take out insurance
and by doing so, transfer</i>

28
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,150
<i>at least part of the remaining risk
to a third party.</i>

29
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,775
With this final step,
we have introduced insurance

30
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:40,465
into the disaster risk
management area.

31
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,324
But what is insurance?

32
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:47,863
Insurance is a risk transfer mechanism
that ensures full or partial

33
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,953
financial compensation for the loss
or damage caused by events

34
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:54,640
that are beyond the control of
the insured party

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,744
within a specified period, provided a fee,
called premium, is paid.

36
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,149
Insurance products can be designed
to cover individuals, households,

37
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:09,568
groups or enterprises, and even countries.

38
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:15,279
People buy insurance because they seek
protection from financial losses

39
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:17,147
that come with experiencing shocks.

40
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:19,738
(speaker) <i>Good! So let's have
a closer look</i>

41
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:21,688
<i>at how insurance really works.</i>

42
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:25,148
<i>At it's very heart lies
the principle of solidarity.</i>

43
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:28,809
<i>It is about pooling of risks
within a group,</i>

44
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:32,963
<i>spreading costs within the community
in order to absorb shocks.</i>

45
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,153
<i>We can imagine inhabitants of a village
coming together all contributing</i>

46
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:42,535
<i>their share to a village health fund
which covers health expenditures</i>

47
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:45,433
<i>of the unlucky ones who get sick.</i>

48
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:51,219
<i>The individual contribution is then lower
than they payout of those that fall sick.</i>

49
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:54,597
<i>You can imagine the same principle
to cover other risks,</i>

50
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:57,766
<i>like fire in your home
or the death of a cow.</i>

51
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,302
<i>However, there are limits to what can
be handled through solidarity</i>

52
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:03,702
<i>within a community.</i>

53
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:09,299
If health issues become an epidemic,
if a fire ravages a whole slum

54
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:13,975
or a city gets destroyed by an earthquake,
the risk pool is too small

55
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:18,328
and more importantly, all members
are hit by the same event

56
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:21,059
with mutuality basically
breaking down.

57
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:25,444
This is where pooling across
different risks and geographies

58
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:27,525
through re-insurance comes in.

59
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:30,289
So what is an insurable event?

60
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:33,679
An insurable event has to be random.

61
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:40,370
Random and still you need to have
a good sense of how often it can occur.

62
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,198
The frequency should be rather low
and the event definitely has to be

63
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:47,960
beyond the control of the insured party.

64
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,900
The event should also then cause
a financial loss

65
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:56,549
and you need to be able to have proof
of the event of the loss,

66
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,239
that it really has happened.

67
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:04,170
The calculation of insurance premium
it is the price to pay

68
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,331
for transferring a certain risk can be
highly complex in practice

69
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:11,001
but the basic components are simple.

70
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:16,213
(speaker) <i>For example, let's look at
a certain flood level that occurs</i>

71
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,032
<i>every twenty year.</i>

72
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:25,474
<i>So then the risk premium would be
1/20 years times the severity.</i>

73
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:32,025
<i>Let's assume it is fifty million dollar
that this flood really costs</i>

74
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:41,618
<i>so then risk premium would give us
52.5 million dollar per year</i>

75
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:47,550
<i>that you need to cover the average
expected loss over one year.</i>

76
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,820
In addition to this pure risk premium,
you may have to add something

77
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,680
to make up for the uncertainty.

78
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:57,179
Does the flood really have a return period
of twenty years

79
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,640
or is it rather eighteen years?

80
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:04,573
What if the losses were rather
53 million and not 50?

81
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:09,973
Then, insurers need to cover
their administration cost, capital cost,

82
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,792
commissions paid to the agent,
that sells the insurance policy

83
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:18,135
and on top, you may add something
for profit and taxes.

84
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,383
What you see immediately from
these calculations is the importance

85
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:25,384
of good historical data
and loss statistics.

86
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:29,646
The better you know the past
and the current exposure

87
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:33,488
the better you can estimate
the likelihood for a certain loss,

88
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:37,218
calculate the premium and reduce
the uncertainty loading.

89
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:42,357
In the case of natural disasters,
climate change has an impact

90
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:46,340
on the value of event data as the past
is not necessarily

91
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:49,760
a good indication anymore
of what could happen today.

92
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,101
Taking on the risk of others is
the core business of insurance companies.

93
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,539
However, they constantly worry about
at least three key aspects

94
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,112
related to this transfer of risk.

95
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,131
Adverse selection, moral hazard and fraud.

96
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,002
What does this mean?

97
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:13,564
Adverse selection occurs if
an insurance company designs and prices

98
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:17,234
and insurance product for
the average member of a given community

99
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:22,367
but then ends up with clients that are
more exposed to risk than the average.

100
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:27,689
Examples here include health insurance,
where you don't want to insure

101
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,740
only the elderly or the smokers,

102
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,740
when doing the research
on product design phase,

103
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,590
you have considered a large community
of mostly fit, young, middle-aged people.

104
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,267
Or, in the case of floods, you don't want
to end up insuring

105
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,426
only those living on the riverbank,

106
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:48,166
like you can see here
in the picture for Paris.

107
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:53,893
Adverse selection has therefore also
to do with information asymmetry

108
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,793
between the insurer and the insured party.

109
00:06:58,103 --> 00:07:01,811
(speaker) <i>Moral hazard is describing
the fact that people may change</i>

110
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:04,326
<i>their behavior once they're insured.</i>

111
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:08,575
<i>This can be positive and be an
intended change, for example when people</i>

112
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:13,352
<i>visit the doctor more often or quicker
once they benefit from health insurance.</i>

113
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:18,182
<i>However, even though this is positive
from a public health perspective,</i>

114
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:22,094
<i>it can cause problems for
the insurance company if that effect</i>

115
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:24,576
<i>was not foreseen or underestimated.</i>

116
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:27,194
<i>Moral hazard is also viewed in</i>

117
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:29,674
<i>the context of crop
and livestock insurance</i>

118
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:34,155
<i>where some farmers may pay
less attention to their animals or crops</i>

119
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:36,997
<i>once they know that they are protected
through insurance.</i>

120
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:41,414
<i>Fraud, or the willful distortion of truth,</i>

121
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:44,414
<i>is a constant worry
for insurance companies.</i>

122
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:49,200
<i>For example, livestock is often tagged
in order to identify individual animals.</i>

123
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:54,358
<i>A few years ago, an Indian insurance
company providing livestock insurance,</i>

124
00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:00,068
<i>required the farmer to send in the ear
with the eartag of the dead cow</i>

125
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:01,358
<i>in order to make a claim.</i>

126
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:06,198
<i>This has led some farmers to simply
cut ears off animals still alive,</i>

127
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:08,849
<i>sending them in and getting
an insurance payout.</i>

128
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:15,001
<i>The cows with one ear left were known as
Van Gogh cows in the local communities.</i>

129
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:19,059
Now what happens really if a loss occurs?

130
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:23,373
Traditionally, the insured party has
to inform the insurance company

131
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:24,382
about the event.

132
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:29,272
You may have to prove that you really had
bought insurance and that you have paid

133
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:30,602
your premium in time

134
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:33,347
and that you really had lost something
in the event.

135
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:37,271
Both can be tricky, in the case of
natural disasters.

136
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:43,801
Let's imagine a flood where your papers
are likely simply gone, washed away.

137
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,057
Potentially the insurance company
has also lost their records too.

138
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:54,428
And so, you may find it very difficult
to prove that you really have insurance

139
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:55,725
and what you have lost.

140
00:08:56,297 --> 00:09:01,367
For sure, the sheer number of claims
it has to process would overwhelm

141
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:05,937
the insurance company, causing long delays
in settling legitimate claims.

142
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,920
Verifying and settling claims
 after natural disaster

143
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,720
is typically a lengthy and costly process.

144
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,377
These challenges have motivated
a new approach to insurance,

145
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,814
especially in the field
of natural disaster and agriculture.

146
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:24,314
It is parametric or index based insurance.

147
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,509
With index insurance, as these products
are often called, the decision

148
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:34,861
of whether to pay or not to pay
depends on an objective measure

149
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,642
such as quake intensity in the case
of earthquake,

150
00:09:38,714 --> 00:09:41,421
windspeed in the case of hurricanes,

151
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:44,373
amount of rainfall in the case
of crop insurance,

152
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:46,773
or water depth in the case of flood.

153
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:51,727
In other words, the insurance company
creates a correlation

154
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:56,827
between an objective, independently
verifiable measure on the client's loss.

155
00:09:57,628 --> 00:10:00,758
(speaker) <i>So let's have a look at
this graph.</i>

156
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:06,959
<i>It shows yearly rainfall data
in millimeters of rainfall over a period</i>

157
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:08,480
<i>of about thirty years.</i>

158
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:13,374
<i>The red line indicates
the level below which</i>

159
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:17,081
<i>the index product would start to pay out.</i>

160
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:23,061
<i>So in this case here it is about 55mm
of rainfall, if you have less than 55mm,</i>

161
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:26,345
<i>then you'll get an insurance payout.</i>

162
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,978
<i>What you see here is how this payout
is then really correlated to</i>

163
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:35,570
<i>the amount of rainfall.</i>

164
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:40,635
<i>You start by 56mm and then you have</i>

165
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:45,350
<i>a linear payout up to
about 7mm of rainfall</i>

166
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:54,310
<i>and in the example here, 1983, you had
a payout of 61% because your rainfall</i>

167
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:57,151
<i>was about 27mm.</i>

168
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:00,878
<i>This index approach comes with
huge advantages</i>

169
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:05,806
<i>as adverse selection and moral hazard
are effectively eliminated</i>

170
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:09,756
<i>and the insurer doesn't have to send
loss adjusters out to the field</i>

171
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,956
<i>after the event.</i>

172
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:14,145
<i>Thus, speeding up claims administration
dramatically.</i>

173
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:19,164
<i>The disadvantages and limitations,
however, are also quite important.</i>

174
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:23,927
<i>First, you have to find a really, really
good correlation between the index</i>

175
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:27,355
you want to use, rainfall,
quake intensity etc.

176
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:28,965
and the losses observed.

177
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:32,730
Otherwise, clients can't rely on
this type of insurance

178
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,889
and will have to consider it rather
a lottery than effective risk transfer.

179
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:41,999
Second, you are in trouble if not all
clients experience

180
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,121
the same level of destruction or loss.

181
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:49,431
This imperfect correlation between
the index and the individual's loss

182
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,080
is known as basis risk.

183
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:57,400
The policy may trigger in cases where
no or less payouts would be required

184
00:11:57,477 --> 00:12:00,880
and may not trigger, even though
the client has experienced a loss.

185
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:06,868
Insurance is a useful component
in the context of disaster risk reduction.

186
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:11,450
What is can achieve is limit the financial
consequences of events

187
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,634
and motivate people to invest
into preventive measures.

188
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:19,826
However, there is no proper disaster risk
management with insurance alone.

189
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:24,325
Therefore, we definitely need
a combination of several approaches

190
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,304
and remember the options at hand.

191
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:31,074
(speaker) <i>Prevention and avoidance
on the one hand</i>

192
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:37,069
<i>and mitigation of risks, prepare
for events and transfer parts of the risk</i>

193
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:39,220
<i>to insurance markets on the other hand.</i>

194
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,046
<i>In the context of disaster risk management</i>

195
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,806
<i>and especially in emerging economies,</i>

196
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:49,050
<i>prevention is almost always
the cheaper option than insurance,</i>

197
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,009
<i>at least in the long run.</i>
