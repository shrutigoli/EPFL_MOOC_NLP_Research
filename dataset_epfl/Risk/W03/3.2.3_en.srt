00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:05,795
Hi.
In this video,

2
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:08,645
I will explain what we mean
by knowledge management,

3
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:10,896
and we will link knowledge management

4
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:13,503
to education and evaluation.

5
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:16,596
Knowledge management is leveraging people,

6
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:19,045
resources, processes, and information

7
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:21,645
in order to achieve a strategic objective.

8
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:24,546
Other terms related
to knowledge management

9
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:26,446
include information management,

10
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:27,901
knowledge translation,

11
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:29,452
knowledge brokering,

12
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:31,150
and innovation brokering.

13
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:34,051
According to Weichselgartner and Pigeon,

14
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,751
it is important to differentiate knowledge

15
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:38,901
from providing information.

16
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,553
Knowledge management
is more than just information,

17
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:45,001
as you can see in this knowledge
management cognitive pyramid

18
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:47,852
where information management
and knowledge management

19
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:49,652
are clearly distinguished.

20
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:51,897
For Weichselgartner and Pigeon,

21
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:55,197
knowledge is required
for disaster risk reduction policy

22
00:00:55,197 --> 00:00:58,697
by which we mean information
decision making and practice

23
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:00,997
in the sense of coordinated action.

24
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:03,797
For them, the Sendai Framework for DRR

25
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,347
lends more attention
to the role of knowledge

26
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:09,047
than the Hyogo Framework,
and, furthermore,

27
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:12,748
provides recommendations
on knowledge creation and dissemination.

28
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:16,545
Still, they identify
that further work is needed

29
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:19,546
for effective knowledge management in DRR.

30
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:22,754
Concerning knowledge
management and technology,

31
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:27,104
UNISDR states that a sustainable
and successful information

32
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:29,146
and management system for DRR

33
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:31,496
should address user
technology constraints,

34
00:01:31,496 --> 00:01:34,402
and adapt technology to local context.

35
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,396
They emphasize the need
to standardize data

36
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:39,946
while respecting the local context.

37
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:44,347
They also insist on the importance
of ensuring interoperability,

38
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:45,596
and, where appropriate,

39
00:01:45,596 --> 00:01:48,496
promote open data,
and use open source technology,

40
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:51,296
and integrate social media
and social services,

41
00:01:51,296 --> 00:01:53,296
and communication systems.

42
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:56,148
Ultimately, we need to design and test

43
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:59,445
interfaces and interactions for usability.

44
00:02:00,397 --> 00:02:03,797
Also, UNISDR developed the scorecard,

45
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:07,597
which is the information and knowledge
management for DRR framework,

46
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:10,052
IKM4DRR Framework,

47
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:11,448
in question format.

48
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,148
The scorecard helps us to understand

49
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:16,345
whether we are following
recommended practice

50
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,946
concerning information
and knowledge management.

51
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:23,045
UNISDR also created PreventionWeb,

52
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,301
which is a participatory web platform

53
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:28,004
for the disaster risk reduction community.

54
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:30,235
For Weichselgartner and Pigeon,

55
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:32,897
we cannot consider
only one person's knowledge

56
00:02:32,897 --> 00:02:34,597
being conveyed to another,

57
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:36,576
or assume that the knowledge transmitted

58
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:38,898
will have the anticipated impact.

59
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:41,200
Therefore, we need education,

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,550
training, and awareness campaigns.

61
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,597
They are part of DRR
activities and measures.

62
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:50,396
Education is one effective way
to transfer knowledge.

63
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,501
Actors at all levels

64
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,451
have identified the need to promote

65
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:56,701
a global culture of safety and resilience,

66
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,402
and have identified the integration of DRR

67
00:02:59,402 --> 00:03:01,853
in formal and informal education

68
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:03,503
and participatory learning

69
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:05,497
and public awareness campaigns.

70
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:08,704
There are many tools
and technologies that can be used.

71
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:10,604
A few include the use of ICT,

72
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:12,854
for instance, wireless internet access,

73
00:03:12,854 --> 00:03:14,354
smart mobile device,

74
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:15,903
radio broadcasting,

75
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:18,799
and, of course,
Massive Open Online Courses!

76
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:21,304
Disaster risk reduction education

77
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:24,094
is essential for reducing vulnerability.

78
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:26,754
In Japan, several international students

79
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:29,004
have not been exposed to DRR education

80
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:30,799
in their countries of origin.

81
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,701
This is why the University of Nagoya,

82
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:36,401
in collaboration with Tohoku University,

83
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,401
developed an education program

84
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:40,601
to empower international students

85
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,304
to deal adequately with disasters.

86
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:45,697
Evaluation can be defined

87
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:49,297
as measuring progress
towards objectives and goals.

88
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,200
It is important to keep in mind

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,150
that evaluation is not a goal in itself.

90
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,450
Evaluation helps generate knowledge

91
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,997
because, through evaluation,

92
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:00,448
we can expand the evidence base.

93
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,002
Evaluation is important

94
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:03,999
because it helps us to learn and increases

95
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:06,744
transparency and accountability.

96
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:10,795
Furthermore, it will facilitate
the reporting to donor agencies,

97
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:13,197
and provides opportunity for feedback.

98
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:16,697
Evaluation can help us
adequately adapt management

99
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:19,496
throughout program implementation.

100
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:22,195
Overall, evaluation is an integral part

101
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,597
of an intervention.

102
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:27,297
Examples of science
and technology for evaluation

103
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:29,247
include the Risk Reduction Index,

104
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:30,797
cost-benefit analysis,

105
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:32,645
and the Theory of Change.

106
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:35,646
Other examples of science
and technology for evaluation

107
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:37,296
include logical frameworks,

108
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,796
problem trees, and focus groups,

109
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,653
or we can also use GIS,

110
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:43,704
big data, and models.

111
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:44,804
In this video,

112
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:47,249
we illustrated how knowledge is required

113
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:49,953
for disaster risk reduction
policy and practice.

114
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,298
We also showed that education

115
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:55,398
is one effective way
to transfer DRR knowledge,

116
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:58,100
and that evaluations provide information

117
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,098
and knowledge to decision makers

118
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:02,502
to enable them to make better decisions.

119
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:06,004
Once again, we could see
how science and technology

120
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:07,749
support knowledge management,

121
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:10,449
DRR education, and evaluation.
