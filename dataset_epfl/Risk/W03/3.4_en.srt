00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:08,020
Hi. In this video I will explain
and give a few examples

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,200
of the types and techniques
of structural measures

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,192
that can be implemented
to mitigate floods and landslides.

4
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:19,571
I will place structural measures
in the Swiss prevention framework.

5
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:23,525
I will explain the types of
structural measures that can be passive,

6
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:26,863
active, or organizational.

7
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:29,873
Then I will give examples
of structural measures

8
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:33,184
to mitigate floods and landslides.

9
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:37,465
And I will conclude by giving you
the main points that are to be remembered.

10
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:40,245
Here, I would like to place
structural measures

11
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:42,397
within the prevention framework.

12
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:45,366
Structural measures
can only be implemented

13
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,176
after mapping the danger,

14
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:50,256
integrating danger into land-use planning,

15
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:52,788
and evaluating risk.

16
00:00:52,788 --> 00:00:57,208
Risk assessment allows to determine
the objective for protection

17
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,345
(or lack of protection)

18
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:03,659
in a specific context and is mandatory
for choosing and designing

19
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,079
structural measures.

20
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,461
Structural measures
are only the last solution

21
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:11,771
to mitigate natural hazards.

22
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,561
The first step for
natural hazards mitigation

23
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:16,501
is land-use planning.

24
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:20,564
You can please refer to my previous video
for more information.

25
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:26,424
This solution is very effective,
especially in zones free of construction.

26
00:01:26,424 --> 00:01:30,564
The second step is the "avoiding" strategy.

27
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:34,222
This means that you want to evaluate
if the project could be developed

28
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:36,135
outside of the hazard zone,

29
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:38,575
or in a zone with a lower hazard--

30
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:41,116
meaning a zone with a lower intensity

31
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:43,966
or higher probability of occurrence.

32
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:48,406
Only when those two first steps
are not sufficient to mitigate the hazard

33
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:54,237
you have to analyze the third solution
which is structural measures.

34
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:57,259
There are two types of structural measures.

35
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:00,487
a) building in an appropriate manner--

36
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,199
this means that you
want to take into account

37
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:08,256
organizational measures or passive measures
on the object you want to protect;

38
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,522
and b) protection measures,
also called active measures.

39
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:17,732
Before we move on I would like to
emphasize on the fact

40
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:21,302
that authorities are responsible
for the prevention framework

41
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:23,514
and its implementation.

42
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:26,594
There are three types
of structural measures.

43
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:30,245
Passive measures reduce the scope
of potential damage

44
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:33,556
without influencing the course of events.

45
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:36,676
Active measures reduce or avoid
potential damages

46
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:39,985
by influencing the course of events.

47
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:44,287
Organizational measures are used
to limit the residual risk.

48
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:47,837
Individual measures versus
collective measures.

49
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:52,619
Individual measures are implemented
at the project or plot level.

50
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:55,718
On the other hand, collective measures
are implemented to protect

51
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,719
at local or regional level.

52
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,690
They require the coordination
of multiple stakeholders and authorities.

53
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,041
To choose adapted measures
for a specific context

54
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,451
a few parameters are key:

55
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:12,822
the risks involved, 
or the lack of protection;

56
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:18,162
the intensity of the hazard- for instance,
movement velocity for a landslide;

57
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:21,253
the probability of occurrence
of the hazard;

58
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:24,223
and finally, the local context

59
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:28,635
meaning social, economical
and ecological criteria.

60
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:32,445
I will now give illustrative examples
of possible structural measures

61
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,545
to mitigate flooding.

62
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:37,005
Note that hydrological models are key

63
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:41,215
in determining danger and
assessing risks and impacts of measures.

64
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:44,386
As you will see,
most structural measures against flooding

65
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:46,388
are collective measures.

66
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:50,368
River bed deepening is a measure
that allows to deepen the river channel

67
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,978
over a given period of time.

68
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:57,100
It allows a higher flow rate
at a specific location.

69
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,988
This measure is usually not sustainable.

70
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:05,581
River channel widening has the same goal
as the previous measure--

71
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:09,100
that is to say,
allowing a higher flow rate.

72
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,091
And this is usually not
a sustainable measure either

73
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:16,243
if it's not considered
at a catchment management level.

74
00:04:16,243 --> 00:04:19,421
River embankments are measures
that are frequently used

75
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:22,593
especially in urbanized areas.

76
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:26,964
This measure will have to be considered
at a catchment management level.

77
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,995
In certain cases, local embankments
can be considered for a single building

78
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:33,907
or a single plot protection

79
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:37,736
especially at lower and medium
danger levels.

80
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,796
Heightening of doors and windows
allows a local protection

81
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:46,728
especially in case of static flooding
with low water levels.

82
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:51,318
This means that the water level
will not reach the bottom of the doors

83
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:53,259
or windows.

84
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:59,320
Retention dams are useful
to guarantee a flow rate

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,591
that avoids floods downstream of the dam.

86
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,501
Flood corridors are often used
in rural or peripheral areas

87
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,191
where non-build land

88
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:12,762
can be used to divert flooding
outside of towns and villages.

89
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:20,514
This is implemented by construction
of either a triggered embankment

90
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:24,983
or a preferred outlet zone
where risks are under control.

91
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:35,356
Bed channel management refers to
rethinking the planning of the bed channel

92
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:38,567
by implementing widening
and ecological measures

93
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,877
that will allow it to absorb
a higher flow rate.

94
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:50,949
I will now give illustrative examples
of possible structural measures

95
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,579
to mitigate landslides.

96
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:56,479
Prior to any planning
and designing of measures

97
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,350
a very good understanding of
the landslide's processes and parameters

98
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,630
are mandatory, as well as danger
and risk assessments.

99
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:10,012
We will only address permanent landslides
in this presentation.

100
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:16,003
Spontaneous landslides call for
different types of structural measures.

101
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:20,024
Note that a combination of measures
is often used to lower risk

102
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:22,394
to an acceptable level.

103
00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:24,834
Reinforcing building foundations or walls

104
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,574
can be a solution to prevent
the structure being damaged

105
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:29,705
in the case of shallow landslides.

106
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:33,225
For deep landslides,
this measure can only be implemented

107
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,975
in case of low velocity

108
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:39,008
or in case of no
differential movements environments.

109
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:46,228
Run-off water management is an effective
and relatively cheap measure to implement.

110
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:51,749
It is a very used solution
combined with other measures.

111
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,925
Excavation management refers to
avoiding overloads

112
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:04,990
within the landslide area.

113
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:23,104
Drainage is an effective measure
in most situations.

114
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:26,705
It will stabilize the landslide
by lowering the water pressure

115
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:29,165
in the landslide surface rupture.

116
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:41,688
This measure is effective
at different depths

117
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:44,529
but its cost will increase accordingly.

118
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:54,489
For more detail concerning this measure

119
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:58,741
you can refer to the Swiss Federal Office
for the environments publication

120
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:01,491
that you will find in the reference list.

121
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:07,911
Constructive measures such as
retaining walls or similar structures

122
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:12,743
are solutions that can block a landslide
if properly executed.

123
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,495
The price of this measure is quite high

124
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,315
and will increase
with the landslide thickness.

125
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:25,445
Afforestation implies tree plantation.

126
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:28,786
It will be very good
for water run-off management

127
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:32,028
and particularly effective
in shallow landslides

128
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:35,828
and spontaneous landslides mitigation.

129
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:40,219
Monitoring has an essential role,
especially in two situations:

130
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,319
One, for residual danger management

131
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:48,339
where measures are too expensive
to implement against the low level of risk;

132
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:53,851
and two, for extreme occurrences
where no protection can be provided

133
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:57,467
or when structural measures
would be way too expensive.

134
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:00,617
It could also be used combined
with all other measures

135
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:02,482
in specific cases.

136
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:08,208
The main points that are to be remembered
in this video are the following:

137
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,804
Structural measures
should ideally be implemented

138
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:14,174
when land-use planning,
the "avoiding" strategy

139
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:19,444
and building in an appropriate manner
is not possible or sufficient.

140
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:22,986
Structural measures
can be active or passive

141
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:26,786
and individual or collective.

142
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:30,587
Context and personal assessment are key.

143
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:32,988
Thank you for watching.
