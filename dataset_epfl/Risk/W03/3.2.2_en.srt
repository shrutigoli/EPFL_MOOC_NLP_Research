00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:05,211
Hello.

2
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:09,491
In this video I will present science and
technology integration and regulations

3
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:13,042
at international, regional,
national and local levels.

4
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:16,444
Then, after listing other key elements
of good governance,

5
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:18,952
I will talk about the concepts 
of technology justice

6
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,442
and integrated risk governance.

7
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:24,333
"Disaster risk reduction laws
do save lives,"

8
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,485
concludes a 2014 joint comparative study

9
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,735
by the International Federation 
of Red Cross

10
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:33,205
and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC),

11
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:36,476
and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP).

12
00:00:36,476 --> 00:00:41,208
Therefore, DRR policy, legislation,
frameworks and regulations overall

13
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,488
can and should be developed
and implemented at all levels

14
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:48,209
from the local to the international.

15
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:51,979
At the international level, first the Hyogo
and now the Sendai Framework

16
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:56,639
for Disaster Risk Reduction,
2015-2030,

17
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,850
guide our work on DRR.

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,125
A central aspect of the Sendai Framework

19
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,975
in comparison 
to the Hyogo Framework for action,

20
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:07,115
is the change of emphasis
from managing disasters

21
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:10,475
to understanding and managing risks.

22
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:13,846
This change forces us
to better understand risk

23
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:16,038
and all the elements that affect risk,

24
00:01:16,038 --> 00:01:19,748
like hazards, exposure, and vulnerability.

25
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:22,469
Therefore, the role
of science and technology

26
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,719
becomes more relevant
in the Sendai Framework.

27
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,289
There are many references to science
and technology in the Sendai Framework.

28
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:33,210
Science and technology are mentioned
in many paragraphs,

29
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,240
such as Paragraph 19
which specifies the guiding principles,

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,121
Paragraphs 24, 25, and 36

31
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:44,681
and many others,
as you can see in the additional material.

32
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:49,344
For example, under Priority 1,
"Understanding Disaster Risk",

33
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:51,715
paragraph 25 (b) states:

34
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:54,564
"To promote the conduct 
of comprehensive surveys

35
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:57,554
on multi-hazard disaster risks
and the development

36
00:01:57,554 --> 00:02:00,244
of regional disaster 
risk assessments and maps,

37
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:02,764
including climate change scenarios."

38
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:06,275
At the international level,
and in addition to the Sendai Framework,

39
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:09,535
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)

40
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:14,417
and the UNFCCC acknowledge
the use of science and technology.

41
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:20,108
Science and technology for climate change
and DRR are relevant for many SDGs.

42
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:22,489
At the regional level, for example,

43
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,139
the Disaster Reduction Program

44
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,879
of the Applied Geoscience
and Technology Division

45
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,999
of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community

46
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:32,711
offers technical and policy guidance

47
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:35,601
to support
disaster risk management practices

48
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:38,903
in the Pacific Island countries
and territories.

49
00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:39,933
In Asia

50
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:43,673
the Agreement on Disaster Management
and Emergency Response (AADMER)

51
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:48,344
was signed by heads of
the ASEAN Member States in 2005.

52
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:53,034
The AADMER is the first binding agreement
on managing disasters regionally.

53
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:57,536
The agreement aims to help member states
to move from a reactive

54
00:02:57,536 --> 00:03:00,845
to a more active prevention approach
towards disasters.

55
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:02,955
Among other actions,

56
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:06,687
ASEAN members are required
to identify high-risk areas,

57
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,277
establish early warning systems

58
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:13,318
and cooperate with each other
on scientific and technological research.

59
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:16,328
At the national and local levels

60
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:19,760
we find countries
with disaster risk management laws.

61
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,809
For example, Algeria's Law

62
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:24,711
on the Prevention
of Major Risks and Disaster Management

63
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:28,840
in the Context
of Sustainable Development of 2004".

64
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,811
This law comprises requirements
for risk assessment and mapping,

65
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:36,932
land-use planning and building safety.

66
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:42,873
The frequently-updated Japan's "Disaster
Countermeasures Basic Act of 1961",

67
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:46,569
which is complimented 
by municipal ordinances,

68
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,845
includes requirements for the compilation 
of hazard data and mapping

69
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:54,025
and in establishing early warning systems.

70
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,496
The backbone of Vietnam's
early warning system

71
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:01,516
is the legally mandated system
of flood and storm Committees

72
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:03,166
found at all levels.

73
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,868
At the local level the Committees
are involved in the alert system.

74
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:09,298
When we talk about regulations and law,

75
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:12,199
it is important also to talk 
about customary law.

76
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,330
The comparative study 
completed by IFRC and UNDP

77
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,220
found that customary law
and traditional authorities in DRR

78
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,542
can be found in Ethiopia, Madagascar,
Namibia, New Zealand, Nicaragua

79
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,421
and South Africa.

80
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:32,131
In South Africa, traditional authorities
and customary courts participate

81
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:36,322
from the national to the municipal level 
disaster advisory forums.

82
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:41,844
Disaster risk management law requires
that indigenous knowledge is considered

83
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:46,799
in compiling national and provincial
disaster management frameworks and plans.

84
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,386
In Ethiopia, most pastoral
and agro-pastoral land tenure

85
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:53,366
is based on customary law.

86
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:56,981
However, there are customary rules
on water resource management

87
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,875
at the community level.

88
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,617
The <i>kebele</i>,
which is the communal authority,

89
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:05,118
has by-laws on water, pasture and grazing.

90
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:09,559
Also, informal traditional
approval processes for new buildings

91
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,089
exist at the community level.

92
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:15,939
Overall, and according 
to the IFRC-UNDP study,

93
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:19,040
low-income countries'
lack of adequate financial,

94
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,600
human, and technical resources

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,681
is one of the main causes
of less than effective

96
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:27,230
DRR legislative systems.

97
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,113
Even in countries 
with well-developed legal systems,

98
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,892
such as Germany and Austria,

99
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:35,373
competencies assigned to different actors
at different levels,

100
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:40,273
and the lack of coordination coherence
between individual risk-reducing laws

101
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,944
in different sectors
and different provinces,

102
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:45,595
hinders more effective risk reduction.

103
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,715
Also mentioned
in relation to early warning systems,

104
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:52,856
the following recommendations
provided by IFRC and UNDP

105
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:56,615
also concern other science and technology
regulations for DRR.

106
00:05:57,695 --> 00:06:01,997
These consist of including science
and technology in DRM legal frameworks

107
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:05,138
and establish clear roles
and responsibilities,

108
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:08,428
for example, by including
the roles of communities

109
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:11,209
to provide bottom-up information.

110
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,590
In addition to policy, legislation
and frameworks,

111
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,860
other key elements
of good governance include:

112
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,811
Transparency, for example, access to data;

113
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:25,842
Accountability and Safeguards,
for example, who is accountable

114
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:30,462
for the implementation of safeguards
when developing and using technologies?

115
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:35,473
Empowerment. How is the scientific
knowledge produced, shared and managed?

116
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:40,344
As well as linkages on participation,
equity and coordination

117
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:44,315
in the development and use
of science and technology for DRR.

118
00:06:44,315 --> 00:06:46,655
These key elements of good governance

119
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:51,976
bring us also to the discussion of the term
and concept of <i>Technology Justice</i>.

120
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:54,316
So, what is technology justice?

121
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:57,203
Practical Action, and international NGO

122
00:06:57,203 --> 00:07:00,747
that uses technology to challenge poverty 
in developing countries,

123
00:07:00,747 --> 00:07:03,058
states that "Technology Justice

124
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:06,649
is allowing people to choose
and use technology

125
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,519
to improve their lives.

126
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,470
It is focusing research and innovation
to meet humanity's basic needs

127
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,040
and protect the planet.

128
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,041
And it is making sure that technologies
don't harm others, now or in the future."

129
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,821
I would also like to present
another concept,

130
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:26,322
and one of the institutions
that are relevant

131
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:29,982
when discussing risk governance
and science and technology.

132
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,483
It is the concept of
<i>integrated risk governance</i>.

133
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:37,144
One of the institutions that works 
on integrated risk governance

134
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:42,085
is the Integrated Risk Governance Center,
here at EPFL.

135
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:44,021
The mission of this Center

136
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:47,446
is to make sense 
of emerging technological opportunities

137
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:51,497
that the public sector can benefit from
and should therefore support.

138
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:57,142
The Center also identifies and analyzes
existing and emerging risks

139
00:07:57,142 --> 00:08:01,159
that both industry and public authorities
should be aware of

140
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,776
in order to assess and make decisions 
about those risks.

141
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:09,689
The Center is a platform for dialog
on opportunities and risks

142
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,880
related to science and technology

143
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,301
with the aim of providing recommendations
for their governance.

144
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:21,132
According to the IRGC, governing risk
and managing technology

145
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:24,062
includes understanding 
that technology must emerge,

146
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:26,293
be encouraged and nurtured.

147
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:31,140
There is also a need to make sense
of technology by balancing opportunities,

148
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,475
risks, and governance challenges.

149
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:39,395
It is important to realize that we need 
to influence the development of policy,

150
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:43,536
and regulatory frameworks,
towards evidence-based policy.

151
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:47,857
In this video, we saw that communities,
national governments

152
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:51,766
and international institutions
are developing DRR regulations

153
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:54,688
that include science
and technology aspects.

154
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:57,628
However, there is much work
still to be done.

155
00:08:57,628 --> 00:09:01,688
For example, we need to increase access 
to technical resources.

156
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:05,549
We need to strengthen coordination
among different actors

157
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,440
and establish clear roles
and responsibilities,

158
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,701
and improve the coherence among laws.

159
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,001
Finally, we also discussed

160
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:17,852
that good governance is important
in science and technology use

161
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:19,202
and development,

162
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:23,164
but also that science and technology
could be important elements

163
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:26,443
through which we can
achieve good governance.
