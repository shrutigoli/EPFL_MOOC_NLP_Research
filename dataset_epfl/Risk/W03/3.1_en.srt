1
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:11,655
All of the sudden the earthquake rocked,

2
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:13,925
we hadn't thought 
about such things before.

3
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,826
If we had general knowledge about
consequences of an earthquake,

4
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:20,676
all of us would have made
stronger houses.

5
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:26,693
If we had such knowledge before,

6
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:32,281
that could have been good.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,789
Now, the people are encouraged to build
their house with 2 feet stone walls

8
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:45,427
then erecting wooden planks
and metal sheets as walls and roof

9
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:50,127
This type of cottage house is recommended
by the Disaster Management Committee

10
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:52,293
for the moment.

11
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:56,120
We are advising people not to use
stone walls like before.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,622
We are delivering people the message
that if such 2 feet wall house

13
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:01,880
with wood and metal sheets will collapse
during such natural disaster,

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,052
they will not crush to death.

15
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:06,012
Maybe they will be wounded.

16
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:09,815
Dear Participants,
Welcome to chapter 3 of the MOOC,

17
00:01:09,815 --> 00:01:14,181
<i>A Resilient Future Science and Technology
for Disaster Risk Reduction.</i>

18
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:18,591
This chapter addresses the prevention
phase of disaster risk reduction.

19
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:22,366
The objectives of this chapter 
include the presentation

20
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:24,913
of the non-structural aspects 
of prevention

21
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:27,503
from a science and technology perspective,

22
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:32,413
as well as the presentation of examples
of technologies and structural measures

23
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:35,744
that could help to prevent
and mitigate risks.

24
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:39,217
This chapter will answer
the following questions:

25
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:43,118
Who are the actors involved
in science and technology for DRR?

26
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,348
How are science and technology
included in DRR-related governance?

27
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:51,578
How does knowledge management
and land-use planning help in DRR?

28
00:01:52,184 --> 00:01:53,724
What is Eco-DRR?

29
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:56,871
What are some examples
of structural measures?

30
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:59,771
What are the different 
risk transfer mechanisms?

31
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:04,056
We will present these topics
with the help of external partners,

32
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:07,142
such as the Swiss Agency
for Development and Cooperation

33
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:10,074
and consultants from
the private and public sectors.

34
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,814
Welcome to chapter 3.
