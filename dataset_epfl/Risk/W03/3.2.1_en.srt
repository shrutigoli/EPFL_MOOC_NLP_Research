1
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:05,950
As the UNISDR document,

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,552
"Living with risk: a global review
of disaster reduction initiatives"

3
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:13,683
clearly states: "Disaster risk reduction
concerns everyone,

4
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:16,033
from the villagers, to heads of state,

5
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:19,363
from bankers and lawyers
to farmers and foresters,

6
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:22,044
from meteorologists to media chiefs."

7
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:25,115
The Sendai Framework
for Disaster Risk Reduction

8
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:28,634
recognizes that the state
has the primary role

9
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:31,236
to reduce the risk
that disaster could occur

10
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:35,296
but that the responsibility
should be shared with other stakeholders,

11
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:38,356
including local government
and the private sector.

12
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:40,818
In this video I will present the actors

13
00:00:40,818 --> 00:00:43,928
that are concerned by the application 
of science and technology

14
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:45,628
for disaster risk reduction.

15
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:48,688
I will start with a general presentation

16
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:52,378
of the types of actors
involved in science and technology for DRR

17
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:55,139
and at what level we might find them.

18
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,089
Then I will present

19
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,051
the general roles and responsibilities
of these actors

20
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:03,051
with an emphasis on the importance
of interaction among them.

21
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:05,686
Some of these points will be illustrated

22
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:09,922
by integrating excerpts from discussions
we had with our partners.

23
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:13,022
There are different types
of disaster risk actors.

24
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:15,745
Some of these actors 
come from very different sectors

25
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:18,274
but they are also involved
in the application of science

26
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:21,444
and the development and use
of technology for DRR.

27
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:24,584
For example,
as you can see from this list,

28
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:29,895
these might include academia, NGOs,
and multilateral organizations.

29
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:32,385
All of them, in one way or another,

30
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:36,637
develop or use science and technology
for disaster risk reduction.

31
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:39,677
We find these actors at different levels,

32
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:42,017
from the local
to the international level.

33
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:45,140
For example,
the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center

34
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,298
is an important actor
at the regional level.

35
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:51,688
While many local actors are concerned
with disaster risk reduction

36
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:53,310
at the local level,

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,960
their work might also include the national,
regional and international level.

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,651
Furthermore, many international actors

39
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:04,412
involved in the development and use
of technology for DRR,

40
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:07,932
such as the Post-conflict 
and Disaster Unit of UNEP,

41
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:10,473
also intervene at the local
and national level.

42
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:13,853
A non-exhaustive list
presenting some of these actors

43
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:18,264
can be found in the additional material
section of this video.

44
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,225
These actors may have similar

45
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,646
or very different roles 
and responsibilities

46
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:25,914
at one or several of the levels 
we presented before.

47
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,636
To give you a few examples,

48
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:31,007
the roles and responsibilities
of these actors may include:

49
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:33,847
knowledge generation
and dissemination of that knowledge;

50
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:35,697
technology development;

51
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,128
technology deployment;

52
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:40,808
or ethical concerns
linked to science and technology.

53
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:44,289
The role and responsibilities
of these actors may also vary

54
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,949
depending on the science they applied
or the technology they developed.

55
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,020
In the context of disaster risk reduction

56
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,901
some actors may focus their work 
on science and technology

57
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,911
for early warning and preparedness,

58
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:59,110
while others may focus 
on understanding hazards.

59
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,213
For example, the Sendai Framework for DRR
indicates that academia,

60
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:08,303
scientific and research entities,
and networks should primarily focus

61
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:10,644
on the disaster risk factors and scenarios,

62
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:13,064
including emerging disaster risk,

63
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:16,684
increase research for regional, national
and local application,

64
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:19,745
support action by local communities
and authorities,

65
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:24,426
and support the interface between
policy and science for decision-making.

66
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:26,766
You will now hear Professor Bresch,

67
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:29,637
who is a specialist
on risks related to climate,

68
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:31,597
speak about a particular example

69
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:35,448
that describes the role of academia
in science and technology

70
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,338
for disaster risk reduction.

71
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:42,389
More and more, there has been this push
towards the open-source story of things.

72
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,329
The challenge is, developing this model
is <i>many</i> years of investment.

73
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,459
So for commercial players
I fully understand

74
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,821
that they are not so much in a position
to just give away that all for free.

75
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:56,531
I think that's where universities
and university collaborations come in.

76
00:03:56,531 --> 00:04:00,232
Often, their access to
also <i>large</i> amounts of data--

77
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:03,823
some of these models use now,
<i>at least</i> terabytes

78
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:06,873
to basically constitute
the hazard component of it--

79
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:11,134
and they couple all of that
and make it <i>easy</i> for the downstream,

80
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,816
the user community,
to deal with these things,

81
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:17,055
and not having to download
terabytes of data.

82
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:20,595
Professor Bresch brings us also to
another important aspect

83
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:24,058
regarding the roles and responsibilities
of DRR actors,

84
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:26,718
namely, the crucial importance
of collaboration.

85
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:30,487
For example, 
in order to understand disaster risk

86
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,187
at the national and local level,

87
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,057
and to facilitate 
a decision policy interface

88
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:37,938
for effective decision-making, collaboration

89
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:40,499
between different groups
of stakeholders is key.

90
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:44,150
Under its Priority 4, the Sendai Framework

91
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,021
seeks to enhance disaster preparedness
for effective response

92
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:53,231
and to "Build Back Better" in recovery,
rehabilitation and reconstruction.

93
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:57,992
For this it states 
that at the national and local level

94
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:02,373
it is a priority to "promote
the cooperation of diverse institutions,

95
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:06,994
multiple authorities 
and related stakeholders at all levels,

96
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:09,634
including affected communities
and business,

97
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:14,245
given the complex and costly nature
of post-disaster reconstruction,

98
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:17,035
under the coordination 
of national authorities."

99
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:20,800
Collaboration takes place
through communities of practice,

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,986
local, national, regional,
and international networks,

101
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:25,953
platforms, and partnerships.

102
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:26,953
For example,

103
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,717
the Partnership for Environment 
and Disaster Risk Reduction

104
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:35,018
is a global alliance of UN agencies,
NGOs, and specialist institutes.

105
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:38,168
During the UNISDR
Science and Technology Conference

106
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:41,650
on the Implementation of the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction,

107
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,560
2015-2030,

108
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,850
that took place in Geneva
in January, 2016,

109
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,332
participants identified
a series of benefits

110
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:53,531
when collaboration happens among actors

111
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:57,483
in the particular context 
of science and technology for DRR.

112
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:02,303
These include, for instance, the production
of more robust recommendations

113
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:05,593
as they are jointly developed
by a group of actors,

114
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:07,754
each with their own perspective.

115
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:11,594
They also identified that collaboration
helps exchange information

116
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:14,407
and facilitates the mobilization of actors.

117
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,776
Let us now listen 
to Marc van den Homberg from Cordaid,

118
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:20,246
who will share with us
an interesting example

119
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,526
of the challenges of data collection

120
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:25,124
which illustrates
the benefits of collaboration.

121
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:27,848
This interview was recorded

122
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:31,578
during the 2016 UNESCO Technologies
for Development Conference

123
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:35,815
at EPFL in Switzerland in May 2016.

124
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:40,059
Yes, technology is never 
a solution on its own.

125
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:44,320
So it's very important
to look beyond just the technology.

126
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,780
To give an example, in Bangladesh,
around data collection,

127
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,093
the government has its own process
to collect data after a disaster happens,

128
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:59,543
but you also have all the different NGOs
who have their own assessment methodology.

129
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,274
So during the floods in 2014

130
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:04,645
we had the government collecting data--

131
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:08,585
paper-based, using a so-called
D-form and SRS-form.

132
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,935
And the different NGOs,

133
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:13,005
they actually tried for the first time

134
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:18,158
to combine their major needs
assessments methodologies,

135
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:20,707
and they did a joint needs assessment.

136
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:24,117
But still, unfortunately,
there were two different processes.

137
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:25,954
So we had the government,
on the one hand,

138
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:27,409
and on the other hand we had

139
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:31,144
all the national or international NGOs
having their own process.

140
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:33,269
So coordination is really key

141
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:37,440
to bring those two actors,
or actor groups, together.

142
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,010
And we are actually working on this
to work together with the government

143
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,392
and to help them also
in digitizing their process

144
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:49,061
and also the NGOs should adapt

145
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:52,133
to the processes
that the government has put in place

146
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:55,543
because that would be
the most sustainable strategy.

147
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,973
As you can see,
there is still a lot left to do

148
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:03,125
for science and technology, for DRR actors,
to strengthen collaboration.

149
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:07,065
Marc mentions one of the many
drawbacks that may exist

150
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:09,936
when collaboration is absent or limited.

151
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:13,747
Or, on the other hand, he points out
the many benefits of collaboration.

152
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:16,617
He also emphasizes the importance

153
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:20,407
of connecting science and technology
to the needs of actors,

154
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:23,598
for example,
through rigorous needs assessments.

155
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:26,498
Another danger to keep in mind

156
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:31,660
is that top-down technology development
will most likely be much less successful

157
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,218
than bottom-up and horizontal
development and application.

158
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,721
In the following interview,

159
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:41,479
Jacobo Quintanilla from the International 
Committee of the Red Cross,

160
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,891
ICRC, gives further insight

161
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:47,242
into the benefits of working 
in collaboration with communities

162
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:49,424
to avoid a specific pitfall,

163
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:53,074
such as the redundancy
of projects and technology

164
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,044
because of a top-down
technology development.

165
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:58,765
I think today there is still
an important gap

166
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:03,946
between technology groups, academia
and communities on the ground.

167
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:08,186
Sometimes, we have seen in a number of situations
where we put technology first

168
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:13,367
and after we tried to find a community
to use that technology, or pilot it.

169
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,887
I think there is a whole "piloted syndrome"

170
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:18,058
within the development
and humanitarian sectors

171
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:22,198
that we need to be more
serious and conscious about.

172
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:25,029
I think the most important thing
is to try to figure out

173
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,570
what are the problems
that we are looking answers for

174
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,861
and try to figure out what are technologies

175
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:33,301
that might or might not help us
well address some of those issues.

176
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:35,650
So it's important 
that both in our technology

177
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,631
and academic community--

178
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:42,741
working in collaboration with humanitarian
and development partners--

179
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:48,112
try to figure out 
some of those contextual challenges.

180
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:51,984
Let us look at the main points
we discussed in this video.

181
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:55,364
First, we realized that there is
a multitude of actors

182
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:58,795
at the local, national,
regional and global level

183
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:03,175
that develop and use science and technology
for disaster risk reduction.

184
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:08,627
We also saw that the roles
and responsibilities of actors in DRR

185
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:10,052
can be very different,

186
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:12,217
ranging from generating knowledge

187
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:14,758
to assessing ethical implications.

188
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:19,008
Most importantly,
collaboration among actors is essential

189
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:20,919
and should be given priority

190
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,379
when developing and applying technologies
for disaster risk reduction.
