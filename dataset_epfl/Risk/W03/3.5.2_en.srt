00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:07,762
Welcome to this video
about inclusive insurance.

2
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:11,245
This particular video is produced
for this MOOC by SDC,

3
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,626
the Swiss Agency 
for Development and Cooperation.

4
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:18,037
I'm Roland Steinmann,
a senior consultant on microinsurance

5
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:19,987
with the Microinsurance Centre.

6
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:24,138
For this session, my goals are
to help you understand the challenges

7
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:26,769
and solutions in the microinsurance space.

8
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:30,449
Furthermore, you will learn 
about the specificities and challenges

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,510
of catastrophe and index-based insurance
in the context of emerging economies.

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,951
When we look at the insurance market
in a typical emerging economy setting

11
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:44,302
then we observe that only
about the top 5-10%

12
00:00:44,302 --> 00:00:46,987
of the total population,
in terms of income,

13
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:49,642
are served 
by traditional insurance markets.

14
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:51,333
In other words,

15
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:55,013
the vast majority of people
have no insurance,

16
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,033
nor do smaller 
and medium-sized businesses.

17
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:02,154
Yet, the lower middle income
and economically active poor

18
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:04,875
could benefit from insurance services.

19
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:08,915
Looking at the graph, you'll notice
that there is also a population group

20
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:12,256
that can't be served
with private insurance services

21
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:15,808
as they are simply too poor
to afford buying them.

22
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:19,858
These people need protection
through social safety nets.

23
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:23,444
This huge un-
or under-served market segment

24
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:26,769
has caught the attention 
of both the development aid sector

25
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:28,499
and private insurance alike.

26
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:30,300
Both are increasingly pushing

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,800
for the development 
of microinsurance products.

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,861
The development aid sector is eager 
to find market-based mechanisms

29
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:41,121
to reduce the vulnerability
of low-income people,

30
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:43,561
thus contributing to poverty reduction.

31
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:48,813
And insurers increasingly realize
that if they want to expand their market

32
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:50,903
they have to start serving this segment

33
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:55,764
as competition at the top of the pyramid
is fierce and the market-size limited.

34
00:01:56,334 --> 00:02:00,414
Now all these people
face a wide variety of risks:

35
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:03,695
health, accidents, natural calamities,

36
00:02:03,695 --> 00:02:07,977
theft, loss of property, fire,
death of the bread-winner, etc.

37
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:11,968
Many of these risks
are directly responsible for poverty

38
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:14,097
and reduced economic development.

39
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:16,504
And they could be insured.

40
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:19,109
Microinsurance, as it is often called,

41
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:23,195
is not a very precisely defined concept,
as such.

42
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:25,939
Some players are
not using this term anymore,

43
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:31,000
instead talking of "emerging consumers"
or of the "mass market".

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,961
However, the intention behind it
is basically the same--

45
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:38,392
bringing formal insurance services
to a population segment

46
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,893
that has been neglected
by the insurance industry so far.

47
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:43,714
When thinking of insurance,

48
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:47,413
and why insurance should
play a role in poverty reduction,

49
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:51,455
we always should consider
the two sides of insurance:

50
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:55,205
the protective aspect,
as well as the productive aspect.

51
00:02:55,205 --> 00:03:00,836
Let me explain this with a simple graph
showing the hypothetical evolution of wealth

52
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:03,676
of a potential microinsurance client.

53
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:13,047
Let's assume the customer starts out--
here we have time and we have wealth

54
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:17,079
and we have the poverty line.

55
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,831
Let's assume that our customer starts
just below the poverty line,

56
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:32,472
moves slowly out of poverty
with some minor setbacks,

57
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:35,364
and then something bad happens.

58
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:41,594
So here, we have a shock.

59
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:47,554
And after that, she falls back
under the poverty line

60
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:52,646
and will struggle
to get back above poverty.

61
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:58,627
Now if she had had insurance here
that would protect her,

62
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,768
she would have been able

63
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:07,138
to continue her life 
above the poverty line

64
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:08,960
and recover much quicker.

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,691
Now the productive side of insurance.

66
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:16,510
We can imagine that somewhere here,

67
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:22,432
if she would have been able
to get insurance of her assets,

68
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,932
or insurance of her crop, or whatever,

69
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:30,199
then she would have had
a much steeper evolution of her wealth.

70
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:42,005
Now, let's have a closer look
at demand and supply of microinsurance.

71
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:46,635
When you go out and do market research
on typical risks people worry about,

72
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:51,406
you will almost always find
that people are worried about falling sick

73
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:54,478
and not being able to afford
decent healthcare.

74
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,598
Second, if you talk to farmers
under emerging economies,

75
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,239
farming is still the sector 
that employs a good,

76
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:03,898
or even the biggest part 
of the population.

77
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:07,929
You hear that farmers worry
about their crop and livestock.

78
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:12,550
Finally, you will find that in many
households or even extended families

79
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,772
income depends essentially
on one single person: the breadwinner.

80
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:21,031
And if she dies, the whole family
is in deep economic trouble.

81
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:25,373
In addition, funeral costs are very high
in several cultural contexts.

82
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:29,814
Now, compare this with the supply
of microinsurance

83
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:31,283
and you immediately see

84
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:34,585
the huge mismatch
between demand and supply.

85
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:38,224
This mismatch can be explained
from two angles.

86
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:42,496
First, microinsurance is in most markets
still supply-led,

87
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,906
and for insurers it is much easier

88
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:48,166
to come up with a simple life 
and accident product

89
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,696
than with property, agriculture,
or health products.

90
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:57,478
Secondly, we have to be careful
not to take need for demand.

91
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,679
Health and crop insurance, for example,
tend to be costly

92
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:04,720
and affordability 
quickly becomes an issue.

93
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,881
Furthermore, we have to acknowledge

94
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:09,361
that insurance 
against natural catastrophes

95
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:12,931
is almost absent in emerging economies

96
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:16,892
and has a relatively low uptake rate
in developed economies, too.

97
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:21,663
Important factors to explain this
are linked to behavioral economics

98
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:26,714
and the fact that we tend to underestimate
the importance of low frequency

99
00:06:26,714 --> 00:06:28,533
but high impact events.

100
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:31,825
From a theoretical point of view,

101
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:36,255
there are many good reasons to promote
the increased use of insurance services

102
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:40,286
to transfer risks away 
from vulnerable communities.

103
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:41,747
In practice, however,

104
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:45,297
a number of formidable challenges 
have to be addressed.

105
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:50,188
One of them, all the players
in microinsurance face, is distribution.

106
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:56,320
Finding ways to cost-effectively explain,
market, sell and service insurance at scale

107
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,851
is key to reach low-income people
sustainably.

108
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:04,861
Traditionally, insurance is sold
through agents that contact individuals.

109
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:08,227
This person-to-person model is very costly

110
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,122
and mostly not adapted to the reality

111
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:14,122
of low-income earners 
in emerging economies.

112
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:18,573
With selling individual policies
to low-income earners not possible,

113
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:23,544
the microinsurance sector has emerged
in partnership with microcredit banks,

114
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:27,664
which played a huge role in the beginning
of the microinsurance movement.

115
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:31,535
They have a captive market
and can relatively easily add

116
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,256
additional financial services
to their loan products.

117
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:39,296
Attempts to sell catastrophe insurance
at the retail or micro level

118
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:41,096
are relatively new.

119
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:43,438
For example, we have seen pilot projects

120
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:46,728
on flood insurance 
in Jakarta or Bangladesh,

121
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,498
crop insurance in Kenya,

122
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:52,060
and earthquake insurance 
in Guatemala and El Salvador,

123
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,390
designed for individual
low-income clients.

124
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,590
A few years ago, around 2011 or 2012,

125
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,711
first attempts were made to offer and sell
insurance through mobile phones.

126
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,502
This has quickly led to huge volumes,

127
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:09,182
though it is too early
to assess the success

128
00:08:09,182 --> 00:08:11,182
in terms of customer understanding

129
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:15,034
and what type of insurance products
can, or cannot,

130
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:17,504
be sold through mobile channels,

131
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:20,384
especially as this
goes to a population segment

132
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:23,276
that has very little experience
with insurance.

133
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:26,736
Aggregators of client and client demand

134
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:29,625
are essential to the success
of microinsurance.

135
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,886
For example, you can imagine
a farmer cooperative

136
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:41,259
that offers a variety
of insurance products to its members.

137
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:47,760
The cooperative management then becomes
the agent of an insurance company,

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,949
earning commissions

139
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:52,710
and making the cooperative
more attractive to its members,

140
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,601
as they get additional services.

141
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:59,972
A different way to extend the benefits
of insurance to the same group of people

142
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,762
is to place the cover
at the level of the cooperative,

143
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:07,343
and <i>not</i> selling individual policies
to each and every person.

144
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:09,653
This meso-level approach

145
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:12,704
would protect the assets
of the cooperative,

146
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:16,294
thus keeping it afloat
after a natural calamity.

147
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:20,215
Members of the cooperative
would benefit indirectly

148
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:22,786
through a more resilient cooperative.

149
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:26,246
Especially in the face of
large-scale natural disasters,

150
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:29,776
such meso-level covers
provide valuable services

151
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:33,498
keeping the local economic actors
solvent after an event,

152
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:36,208
and thus helping to rebuild quickly.

153
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:42,209
In the area of catastrophe insurance
we have examples from Indonesia and Peru,

154
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,299
where microcredit banks
protect their credit portfolio

155
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,389
against shocks
linked to natural disasters.

156
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:53,421
And their clients benefit indirectly
from the fact that this extra liquidity

157
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:57,341
will allow banks to restructure 
their loans after a catastrophe

158
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:59,461
and simply stay in business.

159
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:04,184
You can even go one step further 
and insure a whole country.

160
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:07,173
While this may sound
a bit strange at first,

161
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:12,174
it happens increasingly often and provides
governments with quick access to cash,

162
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:15,014
which is important
to finance relief efforts.

163
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:19,044
This has been successfully introduced
in the Caribbean, through CCRIF,

164
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:23,164
and in Africa, where
the African Risk Capacity, or ARC,

165
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,986
has taken the concept a step further,

166
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:29,317
making it mandatory for countries
that buy cover

167
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:31,824
to have emergency plans prepared

168
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:35,938
so that it is clear upfront
how insurance payouts will be used.

169
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,169
As mentioned before,

170
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:41,319
the market for insurance 
against natural catastrophes

171
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:43,009
for low-income customers

172
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,170
is rather unlikely to develop
without significant outside push.

173
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,991
The challenges related 
to product development, demand,

174
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:55,652
affordability and distribution
are simply too big

175
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:58,912
to make this an interesting case
for private insurance actors.

176
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:03,783
And as there are
important market imperfections,

177
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:07,363
there is a strong argument
for the public sector to get active,

178
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:10,644
not necessarily to support
the private sector <i>per se</i>,

179
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:15,216
but to allow the private sector
to play its role in providing protection

180
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,936
and help better cope
with the financial losses

181
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:19,946
due to natural disasters.

182
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,836
The public sector can support

183
00:11:21,836 --> 00:11:25,447
the development of catastrophe
insurance markets in many forms,

184
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:28,937
collecting and sharing
exposure and loss data,

185
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:32,768
which is the necessary basis
for quality insurance products.

186
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:35,698
Insurance regulation needs
in many countries

187
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:38,129
to be adapted to the new realities,

188
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,579
including dealing 
with the index-based insurance.

189
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:45,880
And then there is a huge need
for loss preventive measures,

190
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,131
which will reduce the exposure 
and make insurance for the residual risk

191
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:53,442
much more affordable--
or, affordable at all.

192
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:58,392
Finally, targeted and time-bound subsidies
can make sense

193
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:02,713
to cover start-up costs
of private sector-led programs.

194
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:07,633
Data, technology and especially
data obtained through remote sensing

195
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:10,065
are indispensable in this game.

196
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:13,476
They are the very foundation
of index-based insurance

197
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,905
which currently is the way to go.

198
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:21,107
The access to, and use of,
remotely-sensed data is evolving rapidly

199
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,066
with new opportunities offered

200
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:25,717
through recently launched
satellite programs.

201
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:31,078
The European Sentinel program, for example,
offers free access to data

202
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:33,558
and has allowed using radar data

203
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:37,228
to assess rice production 
across South and Southeast Asia

204
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:39,190
at a very granular level.

205
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,170
These new possibilities are exciting

206
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,352
and, indeed, I expect to see
many more approaches

207
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:48,051
to be developed and tested
in the near future.

208
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:51,963
At the same time
we should also be realistic.

209
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:56,954
Such products and programs
require time to develop and mature.

210
00:12:57,574 --> 00:13:00,504
It is about creating 
a whole new market segment,

211
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:02,724
and not an easy one.

212
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:06,924
Patience and long-term commitment
are therefore absolutely key.

213
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:11,806
From the perspective 
of integrated disaster risk management,

214
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:16,315
it is a rather new phenomenon to include
insurance into the mix of approaches.

215
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:20,817
However, there is a growing consensus
that insurance has a place

216
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,907
and should play a larger role

217
00:13:22,907 --> 00:13:25,887
in a holistic approach
to disaster risk reduction.

218
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,249
The rapid advances
in science and technology

219
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:31,509
open up new opportunities.

220
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,320
These possibilities should allow
to create better index products

221
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,000
and hence help bring insurance
into the fold.

222
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,071
It's all about finding
the optimal combination

223
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:46,081
of a variety of approaches

224
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,602
to make the world more resilient.
