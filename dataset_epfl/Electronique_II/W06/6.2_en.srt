1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,728
Well, hello! We will continue to study

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,054
or almost finish the course
and revise today

3
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:13,655
what is related to this transistor.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,993
So here I will discuss
a little introduction.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,868
later we will look at
the different functions.

6
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:23,942
So until today, we saw the
transistors in some setups.

7
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:26,067
I'll try to assign functions

8
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:29,430
using the skills of each
of these assemblies

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,192
that we have seen until
today to synthesize

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,117
and an extremely quick summary.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,605
Here is the sum of what we
have seen until today.

12
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:40,604
I would really go slowly,

13
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:44,952
bring out interesting ideas
and do a simple summary

14
00:00:45,153 --> 00:00:48,052
for a few minutes, we
would have seen virtually

15
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,232
what was presented until today.

16
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:53,694
I take the transistor, which
controls a voltage current.

17
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:56,894
this is the output of this transistor.

18
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,224
The output currents that we
see here clearly show

19
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:05,545
that it is a current source,
that this current source

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,531
collapses when we
enter saturation

21
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:10,032
and this saturation voltage

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,170
is relatively low for the transistor

23
00:01:13,582 --> 00:01:15,720
independent of the power limits

24
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:19,008
because it has been shown that the
transistor according to the casing,

25
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,044
according to the level
of characteristics

26
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,458
voltage and current at the output.

27
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,607
We will still have a limitation

28
00:01:25,808 --> 00:01:26,733
that is not

29
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:30,583
all currents that will come out
that we will be able to use it.

30
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:34,195
This is in reality the clear area,

31
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:36,695
the useful part of
the use of transistor

32
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:39,683
which is related to the power
dissipated in the transistor.

33
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:44,683
Then we have a vision pretty
enough of the transistor.

34
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:47,983
So enough is to say that our component,

35
00:01:48,283 --> 00:01:51,645
it was replaced in the
world of small signes.

36
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:55,008
And when you
look from the base,

37
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:59,770
we will seen as a resistor
whose value 1 on GBE

38
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:04,121
plus the resistance that
we could possibly be,

39
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:08,796
It depends on the setup whose
transmitter is multiplied by the beta.

40
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,483
So we see that if this
resistance is infinite

41
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,883
that means we has a current source here,

42
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,946
well, we will find that
this value is infinite.

43
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,458
If the issuer is directly to the
mass, it was enough.

44
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,871
Therefore in small  signals pattern, there is no resistance

45
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,946
the input impedance is limited to 1 GBE.

46
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:29,508
If we look view from the collector,

47
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:31,971
this is where we see the
highest resistance .

48
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:36,933
the one whose related to 1 of
GCE if the transmitter is grounded.

49
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:40,221
But if by chance,
there is a resistance here

50
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:42,796
and if this resistance is high,

51
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,721
the resistance seen from
there becomes extremely high,

52
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:50,820
it tends to beta divided by the
resistance we would have here.

53
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:54,946
And often it is because CGE
also has a one transistor

54
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:57,108
and it takes us cascode setup

55
00:02:57,308 --> 00:03:02,296
and I return you to the part where
we treated this cascode setup.

56
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:05,158
So that's the highest
impedance we could get

57
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:07,158
with a transistor when viewed.

58
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:09,821
And as it acts as a current source,

59
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,708
so this impedance is in parallel with,

60
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:15,283
corresponds to the highest
value confined here.

61
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,796
When we looking at the transistor emitter,

62
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:24,321
here we see the effect of a resistance
that would have existed on the basis

63
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,071
So if this resistance is null,

64
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:28,996
So we are able to take a direct voltage

65
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:32,058
Towards the base which does
not suffer from any impediment,

66
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,783
and although this component falls.

67
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:38,146
And there we have to do
on Gm 1 and this is where

68
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:41,708
the impedance I see
from here is the lowest.

69
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:42,796
And anyway,

70
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:46,421
this resistance is seen there, it is
divided by the beta of the transistor.

71
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:47,870
The higher the beta is high,

72
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:52,946
the less effect there is of what we
would have connected before this floor,

73
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:55,683
So what is appears as input resistance.

74
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:59,908
And now, with that, we would have seen
the transistor as the base component,

75
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:02,671
the transistor with its
output characteristic,

76
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:05,233
and the small signal
patterns that we took

77
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:07,296
on impÃ©dences of this transistor.

78
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:10,733
I want to talk aobut the
basic analog functions.

79
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:13,433
Until now we mostly talked

80
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,696
about how the transistor in
a assembly was used

81
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:18,945
We did common transmitters,
common collectors,

82
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:21,808
cascode, differential pairs,
of Darlington.

83
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,371
All that we had seen before,

84
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:25,521
I would like to bring
them to functions.

85
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,883
While the primary function
is the transconductance.

86
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:33,233
A transconductance is the
famous feature in which

87
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:38,046
we absolutely wanted to use
the transistor in its essential role,

88
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:42,408
converting the input voltage
into an output current.

89
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:46,708
And then we try to have a
current as output variable,

90
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:51,071
so it has a high impedance
at the output

91
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:53,283
and it is the characteristics
of these fixtures

92
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:56,146
whose the base is the common emitter.

93
00:04:56,346 --> 00:05:00,221
It becomes more sophisticated
when it becomes a cascode,

94
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,908
it means we puts a common transmitter

95
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:04,096
and is followed by a common base.

96
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:07,158
and has a differential input

97
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:09,395
and optionally a differential output

98
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:11,771
when using twice the same transistor.

99
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:15,058
But these three functions here or
there these three setups

100
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:17,395
give us a function of transconductance

101
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,195
namely current voltage conversion.

102
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:24,683
If you take this setup here,
the output impedance is high.

103
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,658
When we try to lower this impedance,

104
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:31,743
is done by cascading or level monitor

105
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:36,481
called the output stage, which
engages a transconductance

106
00:05:36,682 --> 00:05:39,444
and after ensuring that there
is a buffer between the two

107
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:42,069
who performms the output stage,

108
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:44,569
and there, we are not seeking
to make the voltage gain.

109
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:46,231
There you can make
the gain in tension

110
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:47,906
because the current
that might have out

111
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,782
by putting it in a high
resistance, or even infinite,

112
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:52,294
it gives us an infinite gain.

113
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:54,632
If we put behind
an output stage,

114
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,582
well this infinite gain realized
by a transconductance

115
00:05:57,782 --> 00:06:00,257
when looking at
the output voltage,

116
00:06:00,432 --> 00:06:07,944
we has to follow with an
output stage whose gain is unitary

117
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:11,532
often it is a voltage follower,
so he makes a gain 1,

118
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:14,369
and it aims to eliminate

119
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,319
this high output
impedance effect

120
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:18,957
and turn it into low
output impedance.

121
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:22,156
So here you have
first floor, second floor

122
00:06:22,357 --> 00:06:25,082
and you begin to understand
if you make a profit with it.

123
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:27,119
Well, to use this gain,

124
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:30,281
you need to put a floor in
the high input impedance

125
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:32,044
and the output impedance is large.

126
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:35,107
And what is it ? This assembly
there is the common collector

127
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:38,232
or the push-pull, a variation
of the common manifold.

128
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,494
This assembly then needs a load.

129
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:46,844
And this assembly there needs a load.

130
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,656
Therefore when using one or the other,

131
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:52,132
the load can be active or passive.

132
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:55,419
And that, the idea is that
if the output of a current,

133
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:58,519
must convert the current
to a voltage in a load.

134
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,131
If the load is passive,
it is a resistance,

135
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,081
is an inductance, it is a capacity,

136
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:05,769
this is what you know
as passive component.

137
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:10,244
And there, if the assembly
needs a transistor

138
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:14,444
which significantly saves space
when it was integrated on silicon,

139
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:16,844
and although it is
usually a current source

140
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:20,469
and is a current source that
realise, called active load.

141
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:22,669
And when it is associated
with a transconductance

142
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:26,107
thanks to it obtained an infinite gain.

143
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:28,531
And now, there are 3 levels

144
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:31,032
and the 3 are of AC nature

145
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:32,994
it depends to how we can use them

146
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:36,781
if it is based on the fixtures we
had already mentioned before

147
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,482
And finally, there is the appearance
test is that we would like

148
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:46,069
impolariser our transistors.

149
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:49,894
So we often polarizes either voltage

150
00:07:50,107 --> 00:07:52,082
but generally in voltage.

151
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:54,256
So when we impose a fixed current

152
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:56,331
thanks to current sources.

153
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:59,057
When we want to
generate fixed voltages

154
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:02,432
that do not move with temperature,

155
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:04,382
is thanks to voltage sources.

156
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,244
When there is about a voltage source,

157
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,119
it ensures that the
output is low impedance

158
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,206
to not disturb the tension
when we draws current

159
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:15,344
and when you have a power
source, we would like

160
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:19,276
have an output impedance
that is extremely high

161
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:23,438
for us to changes the voltage
without the current being affected.

162
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:25,963
so they are the basic functions.

163
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:29,390
I tried to summarize
the most important to know:

164
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:32,260
transconductance output
level, load and polarization.

165
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:35,431
Now I would like to
spend this diagram to

166
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:37,893
what I would call
the analog structures.

167
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:39,981
It's about what I said before

168
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:43,718
but I presented here
schematically with the transistor.

169
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,969
So if I take the transconductance
functions

170
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,969
I'd say the simplest of transconductance
on this kind of installation:

171
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:56,144
common emitter, an input
voltage, an output current

172
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,506
and it is from this current
where we could read voltage

173
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,769
if there has been a charge
that will be improved

174
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:06,618
thanks to a cascode assembly,

175
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:10,431
because the transistor you see
from here to here which is the same,

176
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:13,868
we put it behind a transistor,
the base is polarized

177
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:18,006
and then, the output impedance
has become extremely high.

178
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:20,405
It's beta time the 1 of the GCE

179
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:23,706
when in this assembly
is simply the 1/GCE.

180
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:26,993
So when trying to have an
extraordinary current source

181
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,805
with the output characteristics

182
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:32,069
ie a very high output
impedance, this is used.

183
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,056
And we've also studied a transconductance

184
00:09:36,394 --> 00:09:39,018
whose input differential voltage

185
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:42,629
and the output is a
current that will change

186
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:45,861
between I1 and I2, when one
increases, the other decreases.

187
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,184
So again, we have a differential output

188
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:50,022
which can be converted into voltage

189
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:53,206
when you throw our current in loads.

190
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:55,542
So when you look at these three fixtures,

191
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,242
this is roughly the same.

192
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,373
And you'll see if this one and this one

193
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:02,839
can be relatively comparable

194
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,489
Why? Because we made
the voltage gain

195
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:07,014
with this, this and that.

196
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:09,677
So generally the parameters
we are looking for,

197
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,490
is that when we convert
our current in voltage

198
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,977
and putting resistance, we get a gain

199
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:19,625
equal to Gm times the value
of the output resistance.

200
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:21,513
And it gives us the voltage gain.

201
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,087
The input and output
impedances we studied them,

202
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,499
we known the impedance here
and there that are the same.

203
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:32,724
There I have half the impedance
because I have 2 transistors.

204
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,894
There is the output dynamic.

205
00:10:35,157 --> 00:10:38,744
The output dynamic is how
this tension will move

206
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:42,169
up and down without the
voltage being disturbed,

207
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:43,669
it's mean distorted.

208
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:45,343
So that will give me the dynamics.

209
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:48,744
There it's normal that
I lost the dynamics, why?

210
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,607
Because I have a transistor
that will limit myself here.

211
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:54,454
There I can go down
to almost ground.

212
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,004
There, I can not go down
to the ground,

213
00:10:57,204 --> 00:11:00,341
I have to get off until the voltage here

214
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,105
allows me to prevent this
transistor from saturating.

215
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,192
So the dynamic is a parameter,

216
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:07,644
the bandwidth that
does not open here.

217
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:10,789
Well, we had seen is
the parasitic capacitances

218
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,665
such as the Miller effect which
has been introduced before,

219
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:15,927
and the same with the capacities used

220
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:17,964
for couplings and decouplings

221
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,990
limits us in these 2 assemblies.

222
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,890
The consumption, consumption
is how much fixed current one

223
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,652
had to impose in the assembly
to polarize them noise.

224
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:31,102
and something I did not present at all here

225
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,178
is the noise.

226
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:35,603
Then if you compare these two assemblies
to the one that is below,

227
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:39,728
we realizes that this assembly
there has the same parameters.

228
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:41,990
Besides, consumption is very visible

229
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,915
because we have
here a current source I0

230
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:48,178
this current is fixed, you can
not use no more no less,

231
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:51,165
which multiplied by
the supply voltage,

232
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:55,489
I get it with the total power

233
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:57,965
I need to provide such an assembly.

234
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:00,728
And when I look at the one
below, you will see

235
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,152
compared to those above,

236
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:05,052
It would typically be used when I'll

237
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:07,827
make an operational amplifiers or
transconductance amplifiers

238
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,515
because I have 2 positive
and negative inputs

239
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:13,028
that would allow me to make inputs

240
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:14,690
(INAUDIBLE) as you know it

241
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,827
So the first structure

242
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,161
or first series of Analog structure

243
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:22,223
to make transconductances
are presented here.

244
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:24,635
If you remember of these three fixtures,

245
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,361
it will help you much later to build

246
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:29,273
more complex patterns.

247
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:32,298
I continue with analog structures.

248
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:35,686
I called it transconductance,
I want to look at it well

249
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:40,286
what I called the floor function,
the output floors.

250
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:44,498
So output floors,
there I present 2 followers voltage.

251
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,698
A setup based on a common collector

252
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:51,936
So the tension there and
there are the same with a lag

253
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:54,173
a junction voltage.

254
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,111
There, I have the same
assembly but duplifiÃ©.

255
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,885
that mean I have a NPN and PNP transistor

256
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:04,036
which would allow me to
have a greater dynamic

257
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:07,361
and I block a transistor while
using another transistor

258
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:10,135
you will see the use
of this kind of setup

259
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,923
when I talk about classes of amplifiers

260
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:15,335
and we see that the performance
of such an assembly

261
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:17,973
is significantly better than the
performance of such an assembly

262
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:22,010
because here I have for alternating
half a transistor that works

263
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:25,286
while the other half-wave and
the other transistor that works.

264
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,336
The parameters, that is
exactly what I has shown

265
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:30,110
when I spoke about the transconductance.

266
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,472
So, when I speak of
transconductance

267
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:35,286
and output stage, the
parameters are the same.

268
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:38,622
Now what is it for this kind of
thing and that kind of thing?

269
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:41,411
I think you will understand very quickly

270
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:43,735
the day you want to make power gains

271
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:45,622
and not break your
voltage gain,

272
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:49,798
you are forced to take what I
would call a voltage follower

273
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:52,985
but it will make me a current gain
and especially lower impedance.

274
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:56,023
I take the family there and I
put it behind the family there.

275
00:13:56,248 --> 00:13:59,661
And the 2 make me an amplifier

276
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:02,473
having a large gain due to
this kind of assembly

277
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:06,998
and due to low output impedance
due to this kind of setup.

278
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:10,261
In my analoiques structures

279
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:16,435
I have passive loads,
you know: R, L, C.

280
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:18,835
I have not been here the transformer
because of course,

281
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:23,185
I could replace an inductor
by mutual inductance,

282
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:26,485
what is true, that would allow me
to decouple a signal to AC.

283
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:29,647
Which is widely used for lack
of space in this diagram

284
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:32,985
and a willingness to be
synthetic in the presentation

285
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:34,436
of what I call the charge.

286
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:36,835
I contented myself with decomposing,

287
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:40,336
I would say simply the resistance
of an inductance capacity.

288
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:44,761
But we have seen that if
you take discrete components,

289
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:47,961
and you want to
make a current source.

290
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:50,272
A current source,
that is an assembly

291
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,922
which has an extremely
high output impedance,

292
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,829
and that the output impedance
increases abruptly

293
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,379
when you put a large
enough strength there.

294
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,279
This resistance,
it could be passive

295
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:05,666
or active like
we did here,

296
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,205
and it would give us
an assembly called:

297
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:12,405
the power source is
done with discrete components,

298
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,054
that is to imposes the current here

299
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:17,330
by placing a fixed voltage on the base.

300
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:20,240
And we had good comment
on the difference between this circuit

301
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:21,178
and this assembly.

302
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,741
just saying that

303
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:24,942
when one has to make
to integrated circuits,

304
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:28,005
we can put two similar transistors

305
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,692
and we are not souffered of a
thermal runaway of a transistor

306
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,692
when he was taken to heat

307
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,829
Because of the current flowing through
it and the voltage at these terminals.

308
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:41,116
So we can make this current mirror

309
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,704
which has a much lower
impedance than we see here

310
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:45,891
if it is not cascoded.

311
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:47,879
Otherwise, I can very well take

312
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:51,966
a component that you see there
and put a transmitter setup

313
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,528
pardon me, a cascode current mirror,

314
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,703
and it would allow me to turn

315
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:59,966
this setup into a cascode
mirror and was also studied.

316
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:02,641
Still if you take
this kind of installation,

317
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:05,141
there you are doing an impedance

318
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:07,716
view from the manifold and the manifold

319
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:11,203
extremely high that you
have done with passive components,

320
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,153
as seen here.

321
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,453
If the resistance is integrated
to obtain a high resistance,

322
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:20,053
we must use many surface

323
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:23,753
to achieve a resistance that
could do with a reactive component

324
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:26,291
which occupies very
little silicon area on

325
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:27,929
therefore in an integrated circuit.

326
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,454
And to finish,

327
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:32,441
I want to talk about everything trial.

328
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:35,415
Make voltage references,

329
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:38,116
there are simple techniques
based on components

330
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:39,928
such as the Zener diode.

331
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:42,853
There are physical phenomena
that we use are called

332
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:46,928
the Band-Gap, which with a
transistor polarization technique,

333
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:49,353
we can have a reference voltage.

334
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:53,366
That is to say a tension which does
not depend at all on the temperature

335
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,328
or very little of a temperature.

336
00:16:55,529 --> 00:17:00,441
And this tension we
generate helps to generate

337
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:03,228
references of  fixed voltage
in integrated circuits.

338
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:06,379
You will have the opportunity
to study them in other courses.

339
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,079
Therefore, having these 2,
we can generate voltage sources

340
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:13,766
because by taking
a voltage reference

341
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:15,679
that is a fixed voltage,

342
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:18,416
putting behind an
operational amplifier

343
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:20,916
which will create
a buffer between

344
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:23,303
a reference voltage
and a voltage source

345
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:26,078
and we would do with this
thanks to the counter-erection

346
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,153
of a stabilized power supply.

347
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:31,403
And like that, we test
power alder stabilized

348
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:33,841
which allow us
to power a circuit.

349
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,378
And if we want to
make current references,

350
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:40,854
and if it has a
voltage generated

351
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:45,165
from here, used here
and give us a fixed voltage,

352
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:49,403
the reference current is
derived from a fixed voltage

353
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:52,640
where we impose this kind of
mounting and comes across a stream

354
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,015
that we can use for example
to produce this kind of installation.

355
00:17:56,216 --> 00:17:58,278
If I want to use a
power source here

356
00:17:58,504 --> 00:18:01,016
well I just have to take
this current mirror

357
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:05,254
and put here by taking
a stabilized voltage

358
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:08,816
and by generating a stabilized
power supply with that,

359
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,929
I can get a stabilized current.

360
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:15,103
I tried in this kind of
diagram to show you that

361
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:18,166
we think in analog structure.

362
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,829
These analog
structures have roles

363
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,191
that call functions.

364
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,041
And now I'll show you,

365
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:29,154
In this course during all we studied

366
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:31,828
how is what we tried to
synthesize these functions.

367
00:18:32,104 --> 00:18:35,665
And immediately after, chained
by a video that would show you

368
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:38,090
that if I want to do an
operational amplifier,

369
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,190
I just have to play with these
analog structures by putting

370
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,452
one behind the other and
use all the functions you here

371
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,578
to build an operational
amplifier.

372
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,765
I start from my analog structures,

373
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:52,728
and I will generate models;

374
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:55,415
It was the essential of what
we studied this semester.

375
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,440
We replaced representations
with transistor

376
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:05,028
by highly synthetic representations
to tell a transconductance,

377
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,727
is when my input
variable is a voltage

378
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,640
my output variable is a current.

379
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,427
He suffers this controlled
current source

380
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:15,814
suffers resistance, it happens,

381
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,414
they put it here and
you realize with that

382
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,640
a function that will take
the input voltage, convert

383
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,115
and which contains all
the necessary components

384
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:29,666
to put it with all floors
which will precede it

385
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,241
which will become before
and after and we could solve it

386
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:38,115
as an exercise of basic
circuit theory with Kirchhoff's laws

387
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,564
and all that is
linear simplification.

388
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,951
So now, the output stage can be presented

389
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:45,252
Either like that,
or like that.

390
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,164
Since V1 and V2 are the same,

391
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:50,939
and generally identifies
R Out is a very small,

392
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:54,451
so it appears there V1 here,
it seems quite sensible

393
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:58,776
to use the model Thevenin
instead of Norton model

394
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:02,514
to present an output stage knowing
that the gain here is equal to 1.

395
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:05,589
Here, the model is
the one you see here.

396
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:10,552
By against the equivalent of an
active load of a transistor

397
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,752
as we saw just before

398
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,814
be replaced by
the current source

399
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,952
a test current source
with its output impedance.

400
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,889
Quite often, this output
impedance is calculated

401
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,638
in function of the transistor
output conductance.

402
00:20:24,827 --> 00:20:28,764
And if it is cascode, there is the beta
is going to interfere in that calculation.

403
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:31,801
And polarization, there
I have not changed compared

404
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:33,226
to what we had seen before.

405
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:35,326
because it is a current source,

406
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,251
it's the same as what you see here.

407
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:40,563
And the voltage source is good
is the voltage source

408
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:43,814
realized as we had seen
in the theory of basic circuit.

409
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:47,877
I would like to end
this I just go now.

410
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:52,089
I wanted at all costs to
distinguish what I would call function

411
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:55,201
and what I call analog structures.

412
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:58,627
We spent the semester, well
we spent all these courses

413
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:01,163
studying analog structures

414
00:21:01,364 --> 00:21:05,951
And I wished to make a small
summary to show you that

415
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:10,477
these small assemblies
that correspond to structures,

416
00:21:10,764 --> 00:21:11,751
taking functions.

417
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:13,452
What will make things easier

418
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:15,539
In the video that will follow right now

419
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:18,502
to do a little editing
and show you

420
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:21,114
that I just have to make
these analog structures

421
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,564
when I mastered and assigned

422
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:26,139
a clear function in
each of these structures

423
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:29,551
and assemble them to perform the

424
00:21:29,777 --> 00:21:31,501
the most advanced electronic functions

425
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:33,838
I'll give you an example

426
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,802
how is an operational amplifier

427
00:21:37,002 --> 00:21:40,002
thanks to these functions
we just saw now.
