1
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:06,966
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:07,697 --> 00:00:09,167
We practically arrive

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:12,554
to the end of the analysis
of all the basic structures.

4
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:14,692
So in this video,

5
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:17,896
we will learn what is called
the differential amplifier.

6
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:20,355
So with this last
structure, we are going to

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,805
make a type of amplifier

8
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,740
that is a bit special, it's a bit similar

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,686
to the common transmitter,
but you will see right away

10
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:27,459
that there is a fundamental difference

11
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:28,918
compared to the common transmitter.

12
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:30,812
And I will end

13
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:33,400
in this series this week

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,366
by the Darlington setup analysis

15
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:39,573
and then I will resume

16
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,802
everything we saw

17
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:42,787
since the beginning
of the study of transistors

18
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:45,492
up to all the structures

19
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:47,329
which we analyzed

20
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:49,412
just to refresh the mind

21
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:50,820
of those who follow this course.

22
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,609
And I'll conclude with a
treatment of a complete excercise

23
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,198
which allowing you to see

24
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:57,606
how is it used

25
00:00:57,806 --> 00:00:58,840
or how it is synthesized

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,720
using different basic analog structures

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,809
that we have traveled so far.

28
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,711
So it is a crucial week

29
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:06,914
because it will summarize

30
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:08,882
all of what we saw from the beginning.

31
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:11,050
A differential amplifier,

32
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:13,295
that is drawn here,

33
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,094
compared to a common transmitter amplifier,

34
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:19,567
wich I'll draw next

35
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:22,767
so if you take our famous common transmitter,

36
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:25,252
where we had a transistor

37
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,449
then we arranged

38
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,171
in a small pattern signals,

39
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:30,288
to connect its transmitter

40
00:01:30,488 --> 00:01:31,738
to a fixed potential.

41
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:33,800
So look, it's a fixed potential.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,011
They put a RC load

43
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,324
and they brought a signal,

44
00:01:37,524 --> 00:01:39,381
in a manner to give an increase here

45
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,309
and called this V1,

46
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:44,509
and called this V2.

47
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,709
If I compare this to that,

48
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,667
I see there,

49
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:53,802
the voltage V1 and the voltage V2

50
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:56,615
are both compared
to a fixed potential.

51
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:00,112
And it is a potential that
we have a priori imposed.

52
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:02,164
So it's a potential that can be grounded,

53
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:03,456
someone has imposed,

54
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:04,756
or a DC voltage.

55
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:07,360
I will not go into details
on how it is created

56
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,085
because we saw it in long and wide.

57
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:11,223
When you see the
variation of the voltage V2

58
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,803
relative to this fixed potential,

59
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:15,079
brought for example to V1

60
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,972
finally, this potential that is the same,

61
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:18,862
well, this generates a current

62
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:21,149
passing in RC etc. etc.

63
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:23,297
I will like to compare this

64
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:24,920
to this,

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,496
just remember that the gain

66
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:28,529
that was found,

67
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:31,037
this is a gain which is -gm x RC

68
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:35,182
and gm corresponds to a
polarized current divided by UT.

69
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:36,470
I come to this setup.

70
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,495
Look there.

71
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:39,396
Instead of one transistor,

72
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:40,439
I put two.

73
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:43,468
Both transistors are connected

74
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:44,999
by their transmitters

75
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,414
and the two bases constitute

76
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:50,948
the input to this setup

77
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,179
and the two terminals
that you see, V11, V12

78
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,682
are generally,

79
00:02:56,882 --> 00:02:58,576
these two terminals that, quite often,

80
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:01,140
when you take an operational
amplifier

81
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,537
you were told that there is
an input (+) and an input (-)

82
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:04,364
and in it

83
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:05,967
is an integrated circuit,

84
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,588
and this circuit represents

85
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,036
a positive-negative input

86
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:10,316
that are in reality

87
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:12,740
these two potentials V11 and V12

88
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,379
and they say to you here,
there is a differential voltage

89
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,265
and often there is such a gain there,

90
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:19,247
that this gain is terribly great

91
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:22,288
to make these two tensions
close to each other.

92
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:24,959
They say in an ideal amp,
the gain is infinite

93
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,247
and V (+) = V (-).

94
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,831
So in reality,

95
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,450
there is a setup like this

96
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,888
placed at the input

97
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:34,876
of an setup of the type
of integrated circuit

98
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:37,043
which is the operational amplifier.

99
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,808
The comparison to the common transmitter,

100
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:41,125
I return to this point,

101
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,071
it's that an issuer that is in between,

102
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:45,342
it floats.

103
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,936
Look, we put a power source,

104
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:50,407
this current source, in terms of DC,

105
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:51,883
It could endure

106
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,671
any DC potential.

107
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:56,642
So you can apply here any voltage

108
00:03:56,842 --> 00:03:59,614
that would float between the supply rails,

109
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:04,021
between (+ VCC) and (-VCC).

110
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:05,325
So it is a potential

111
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,030
which is quite arbitrary,

112
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,665
which is imposed by the person

113
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:10,541
who is doing the setup.

114
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:12,957
So if you take an operational amplifier,

115
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:15,745
and I will take, ie, amplifier

116
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:18,915
with a potential, the (+) to ground

117
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:21,894
against a feedback through resistors,

118
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:24,578
and you will see that
one has the impression

119
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:27,882
that imposes a potential 0 here

120
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,420
And they say, "Here is
the entrance to the other side."

121
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,789
So it's like someone is taking

122
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,883
the (+) and impose
it on one of these two inputs,

123
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,002
So if you plug it here,

124
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:40,627
and you say: this setup is inside,

125
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,610
we will reason on this reflection,

126
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,533
they will say:

127
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,119
there, one has a given potential data,

128
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,685
good, we will go to 0 V,

129
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:50,293
there, I have a voltage drop,

130
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:53,809
If the transistor conducts
on the order of Uj to DC.

131
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,778
So the analysis brings me back quickly

132
00:04:56,978 --> 00:04:58,611
that this potential will be stabilize

133
00:04:58,849 --> 00:04:59,727
to -Uj.

134
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,704
So again,

135
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:04,785
I meet the fact that

136
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:08,939
the transmitter of this transistor
is found at a fixed potential

137
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,147
imposed by someone

138
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,738
who as connected from outside a ground.

139
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:15,626
So if the person would come

140
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:17,412
and put a voltage source here

141
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:21,031
well, this voltage source would
require a different voltage

142
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:26,422
on the droping basis of Uj,

143
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:32,392
bring back the transmitter
to another value DC.

144
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:34,084
so basically, we are saying

145
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:38,021
that transmitters are virtually
at a stable potential,

146
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,079
So we have a  DC potential

147
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,495
imposed by what would
have imposed on the base.

148
00:05:44,764 --> 00:05:45,980
when I say all this,

149
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,812
to show that we dont have to define it,

150
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:52,001
the potential that had been set

151
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,737
and they brought back in a potential

152
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,103
imposed by someone,

153
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:59,454
here, it is imposed by anyone

154
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:01,311
that would use this setup,

155
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:02,724
and the setup, alone

156
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:04,608
will adapt and will bring back

157
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:07,343
a polarization to that node.

158
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:09,600
Then I'll erase all that is written above,

159
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,322
and we will begin to analyze

160
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:13,740
with the data which are absolutely linked

161
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,570
to a very basic analysis

162
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,209
from what I see in this diagram.

163
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:19,930
First, I see that I have a voltage

164
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,375
which is located between
the base of two transistors

165
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:24,660
and this voltage one,
takes into consideration,

166
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,326
if I say that, it's V1,

167
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:27,863
that too is V1,

168
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:29,180
it goes like this,

169
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,182
and then, it gives me V1.

170
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:33,020
So I can easily write

171
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,045
V1 is V11 - V12

172
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:40,057
which is nothing else than VBE1 - VBE2.

173
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,081
Therefore, the input voltage,

174
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:45,853
it takes two junction voltages,

175
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:49,349
but one in opposition to each other.

176
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:52,461
Now I look at what
will happen with the currents,

177
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:55,035
I take the two currents I1 and I2,

178
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:56,795
I pass them into 2 transistors

179
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:58,944
I sum both of them in this node there,

180
00:06:59,144 --> 00:06:59,778
and I said:

181
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:02,978
I0 is alwas equal to the
sum of these two.

182
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:06,258
So I impose the fact
that there is a current source

183
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,636
which is always the
sum of the two currents.

184
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:10,097
So let's do an analysis

185
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,067
of what we just saw.

186
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,953
I re-clear again my arrow

187
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:16,437
and we will analyze it.

188
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,108
We will finally say

189
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:20,721
if I impose a common mode here,

190
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:22,958
as just now, we put it to ground,

191
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:24,823
it can be any voltage,

192
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:26,431
if you take a common mode,

193
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:28,149
that is to say that this
potential is fixed,

194
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:31,565
and you begin to increase V1,

195
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:35,533
that means it's VBE1 which will increase,

196
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,254
and VBE2 that will
decrease of the same amount.

197
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:40,697
So any change that I see on VBE1,

198
00:07:40,897 --> 00:07:42,366
it is brought back on VBE2

199
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:44,969
and one is in phase
opposition compared to other,

200
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:47,189
therefore it increases on one side
and it lower on the other side.

201
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:48,991
What will happen with the currents,

202
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,530
It's exactly the same thing.

203
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,443
When you increase VBE1,

204
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:55,186
you will increase the l1 current

205
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:57,070
and what happens on the other side,

206
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,294
you lower VBE2,

207
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:00,549
therefore, you will reduce the current I2.

208
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:01,824
So the two currents

209
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,028
will also move

210
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:05,554
in the opposite direction

211
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:06,832
one against another

212
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:08,196
of the same quantiy

213
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:10,576
which is shared between 2 transistors.

214
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:12,758
So the one who has understood this,

215
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,794
he understood that we have practically

216
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,606
a swing with a pivot

217
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:19,830
and this pivot is
located around this point

218
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,113
and we will rotate it,

219
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:24,384
we will go up or down,

220
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,168
what I gain on one side

221
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:28,349
I'll lose it on the other side

222
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,273
either from excitement at the input

223
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:32,804
that compared to this current

224
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:34,594
which passing in both branches.

225
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:36,834
Who says current that
passes in the two branches,

226
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,999
would also say voltage V2.

227
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:39,742
Why?

228
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,033
Because this current one,

229
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:42,708
it's converted to a voltage

230
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:44,603
through the resistance RC,

231
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:46,460
it is also converted into a voltage

232
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,198
through the resistance RC

233
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:49,674
and if RC and RC are the same,

234
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:51,549
so when the tension rises on one side,

235
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:52,910
it go down on that side there,

236
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,934
and vice versa.

237
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,223
So we will see on the output

238
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:57,420
a differential voltage,

239
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,357
if we look between V21 and V22,

240
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:02,438
as we can watch between V22 and V21,

241
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:03,795
- Is it a story of terminal,

242
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:05,417
so we'll see this potential

243
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:07,895
swinging like a swing.

244
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,554
You can imagine that when
it increases to one side,

245
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:13,007
it go down on the other,
and the same of either side,

246
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:14,205
well we control it

247
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:15,543
by the input voltage.

248
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:17,828
It's called the differential pair.

249
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,871
I'll take this structure

250
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:22,173
and I will analyze

251
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:24,600
to extract from it an amplifier.

252
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:30,581
I take the diagram of
my differential pair.

253
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,277
The findings that we have just made here,

254
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:34,590
that is to say it has been said

255
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,278
that the sum of voltages
V1, it's VBE1 - VBE2,

256
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,176
which as noted there

257
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:42,585
and the current flowing I0,

258
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:43,911
it is all the time the sum

259
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,489
of blue current and red current,

260
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:47,623
I1+I2

261
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:48,999
and at rest,

262
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:53,249
when V11 = V12

263
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:54,778
equal to any voltage

264
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:57,597
wich floating between (-VCC) and (+ VCC)

265
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,075
well, you'll fall,

266
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,443
on a voltage which
is the same on both,

267
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,866
so VBE1 = VBE2

268
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:05,826
and at that time,

269
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:09,026
your current I0 is divided into two

270
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:12,319
and you will have I1 = I0/2

271
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,394
I2 = I0/2

272
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:15,774
And that's what I've noted here.

273
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,577
that's if you have I1 = I2,

274
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:26,987
then there is a mistake is I1 = I2 = I0/2

275
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:29,747
when the voltage V1 = 0.

276
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:31,523
I take the transistors laws,

277
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:35,108
each of these transistors is governed
by the famous exponential law

278
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:37,145
which would say that the current I1

279
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,323
is proportional to
the control voltage V BE1

280
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:42,285
through this exponential.

281
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:43,220
Same for I2.

282
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,777
So I will write both laws.

283
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:46,886
I express VBE1

284
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:50,633
therefore, it is logarithm I1/IS

285
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:51,669
multiplied by UT.

286
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:52,972
Same for VBE2.

287
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:54,794
All this, I apply

288
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:56,059
what I see there.

289
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:58,251
I say at the entrance,

290
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,877
caution VB1, or rather V1,

291
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,357
it is the difference of VBE1 - VBE2

292
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:06,224
which brings me to simplify this

293
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:10,181
because that is a ratio of I1/I2

294
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:11,927
because IS is simplified,

295
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:15,364
I replace I1 by its value

296
00:11:15,564 --> 00:11:18,872
because I know that the
relation between I1 and I2,

297
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:20,540
it's the complement to this I0,

298
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,884
and it will give me a relationship

299
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,762
between V1 and I1

300
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:26,976
or V1 and I2

301
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:28,973
and I say

302
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:31,555
I1 = f (V1).

303
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:36,164
So I take you back to
the mathematics courses

304
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:38,565
to see that when I have
that kind of relationship,

305
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,467
it is called "hyperbolic tangent"

306
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,745
and the hyperbolic tangent of V1 / 2UT,

307
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:46,279
plus 1, multiplied by I0 / 2,

308
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:48,612
is nothing other than
the current you order.

309
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:50,051
It is a non-linear law.

310
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,305
And there again, it is the expression I2

311
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:53,539
which is of the same nature,

312
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:55,139
there is a (-) here and a (+) here

313
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,480
and there are I1 and I2 expressed.

314
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,475
then I'll take these two relations

315
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,087
and I'll go and draw

316
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,387
that expression

317
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:05,476
and see the plotted relationship

318
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:08,142
between I1, I2 and V1, V1.

319
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:09,668
So, I recall that V1,

320
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,789
it's the differential input voltage.

321
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:16,355
I take I1 and I2

322
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:17,490
and I draw them here.

323
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,265
I see indeed

324
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:24,035
if V11 = V12,

325
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,388
equal to a given potential,

326
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,290
Well, there I0 / 2Well,

327
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,703
therefore when V1 = 0,

328
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:32,579
so when this was bypassed like that,

329
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:36,508
well, you will end up in that point.

330
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:38,844
When V1 = 0,

331
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,195
you find I0/2

332
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,223
the current I1 = I2.

333
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:46,144
And it's the only one point where
the two currents are the same.

334
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:49,344
Because if you start

335
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,463
increase V1,

336
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:55,264
what's going to happen,

337
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:56,627
if V1 increases,

338
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:59,029
the VBE1 voltage increases,

339
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:00,184
I1 will increase,

340
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:02,804
And you end up with this
current that will increase

341
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:04,062
according to that law.

342
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,821
So I1 will be managed by V1

343
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,951
and given what is increasing on one side

344
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:12,180
is decreasing from the other side,

345
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,335
the other current would
follow the same law

346
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:16,541
but in the opposite direction

347
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:19,602
when the current in the
blue transistor increases ,

348
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,900
the other decreases to the same quantity.

349
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,079
So the one we add to one side,

350
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,425
is subtracted from the other side

351
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,346
because the sum of the two
is always equal to a constant.

352
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:30,106
so we see that there is a law

353
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,738
which describes V1,

354
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,195
or rather I = f (V1)

355
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:38,395
sorry

356
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:41,718
I1 = f (V1) and I2 = f (V1)

357
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:46,424
that is, thereof, the other is red color.

358
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:48,655
There, what is very
interesting is that I find

359
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:51,219
what I'm looking all the time,
it is a transconductance

360
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:53,077
me, I wanted to create a structure

361
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:54,652
as the normal transistor

362
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:56,086
where I take

363
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:59,773
a proportion of variation on my curve

364
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,195
therefore in this case here,

365
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:03,528
it is the blue line or the red line

366
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:04,559
or both at the same time

367
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,177
and I say: finally, the transconductance,

368
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:10,034
is that I'm taking a tensionV1, I'll vary

369
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:12,408
and I expect that
I see a current that follows,

370
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:13,713
What I see here?

371
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:14,821
when I increase V1,

372
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,460
the current increases and I drops,

373
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,029
it is a transconductance

374
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:19,479
but I have it on both sides.

375
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:21,631
So I have two transconductances,

376
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:24,517
I have two currents
that follow each other

377
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:26,735
and it is a voltage-current conversion

378
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,048
and that current-voltage conversion

379
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:32,271
there is a zone which is fairly linear

380
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,845
this is the one I presented as

381
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,896
a slope of the tangent around the origin

382
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:39,771
you see with the features blue or red,

383
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:41,149
which are nothing else

384
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:44,330
that the derivative of that law one

385
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,804
that will give me the slope of the tangent

386
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:51,645
when I have the current I1 = I2 = I0/2

387
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:54,026
and if I replace this relationship,

388
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,962
therefore, I seek the value
of the slope analytically

389
00:14:57,894 --> 00:15:02,981
the dI / dV1 when V1 = 0,

390
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:06,319
I come across this
relationship (I0/2) / 2UT.

391
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,739
So this is I0 / 4UT.

392
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,983
When I tell you to rest,

393
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:14,183
when the voltage V11 = V12,

394
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:17,383
each of the transistors is
driven by the half of this current.

395
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:18,569
So, at rest,

396
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:21,067
I have a current I0/2 and I0/2.

397
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,602
So you may well say:

398
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,329
the gm2 of this transistor

399
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,732
that, the gm2 of the transistor

400
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:29,295
this is nothing else
than the bias current

401
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,549
therethrough, divided by UT.

402
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:34,415
So then this slope

403
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:38,897
is the transconductance
of the transistor, gm2/2

404
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:41,870
and that one it's gm1 / 2.

405
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,982
So I see here a slope and a slope there,

406
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:46,998
which are nothing other
than the transconductance

407
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:48,773
of each of these two transistors.

408
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:50,660
There, in additional, I have traced

409
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,751
the variation of the current
fonction on the time

410
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:55,209
when we applying a
sinusoidal voltage at the input

411
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:58,259
and when a current increases,

412
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,387
the other decreases

413
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:03,617
and when all the current source

414
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:06,027
is deviated in a transistor,

415
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:07,626
it will reach I0

416
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:08,931
and when all the current

417
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:10,442
is deviated in the other,

418
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:14,237
it will reach I0 in the red transistor.

419
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:15,939
So we have a swing

420
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,770
where when one hits the ground,

421
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,941
we have these swings

422
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:21,697
where there is all the
current that switched

423
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,135
from one side or the other,

424
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:24,694
well, we've saturated the system.

425
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:27,780
So, we saturate in currrent because
we lost all the current source.

426
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,587
since lost all power source.

427
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:31,440
Caution!

428
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,223
Here I'm not talking about
transistor saturation

429
00:16:34,423 --> 00:16:36,344
because your transistor when it saturates,

430
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:38,779
is when this voltage is then UC = 0,

431
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:40,149
I'm talking about the saturation

432
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,303
of the differential pair whole.

433
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,606
It means that all power
has already shifted

434
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:45,924
to one side or the other.

435
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:49,010
So we find the same thing
you would find with a transistor

436
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,303
with that story of transconductance.

437
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,166
We will take now

438
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,065
the same explanation

439
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,124
but instead of talking about current,

440
00:16:57,324 --> 00:16:58,934
we will talk about tension.

441
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:02,134
So instead of saying that
the current I1 and the current I2,

442
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:05,188
when one increases,
the other will decrease,

443
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:07,708
I will pass currents through a resistance.

444
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,485
You remember that resistance,
is the element that I use

445
00:17:10,685 --> 00:17:12,348
to convert a current into voltage,

446
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,677
and I am interested in
the change in voltage

447
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:16,052
the terminals of the load

448
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,835
because in a pattern small signals,

449
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:19,766
even this tension one will become

450
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:21,323
an short-circuit to the ground

451
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:22,931
so, I'm interested to what is happening

452
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:24,628
with the RC resistance

453
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:26,466
and I am interested in the voltage V22,

454
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,909
eiiher compared to the potential one,

455
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:31,639
or relative to another DC potential,

456
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,176
since it is a short-circuit

457
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:34,343
in a AC pattern.

458
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:37,543
So if I convert my current into a voltage,

459
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:42,205
and I absolutely expect to
see the same characteristic,

460
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:44,405
the same aspect of my curve,

461
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,135
I discovered in a short while

462
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:48,134
for the current converted in voltage,

463
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,886
because it is through a resistance

464
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:52,730
it would become a voltage V22 and V21

465
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,930
and these two voltages will
exactly follow the same pace

466
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,055
that the currents.

467
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,255
So if you are interested to V22 and V21,

468
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:04,208
look at, V22 compared
to any fixed potential,

469
00:18:04,408 --> 00:18:06,157
its variation is going to be linear,

470
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:08,084
when the growth is weak

471
00:18:08,284 --> 00:18:09,976
So, look, when I talk about low

472
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:13,176
I talk about of (-UT) and (+ UT)

473
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:16,756
Therefore, there is an order
of magnitude of 26 mV,

474
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:19,530
there is very little variation

475
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,388
before you get anyway

476
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:24,486
in the non-linearity

477
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,873
of this curve.

478
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:26,688
So we're talking about

479
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:29,046
all the very small
variations at the input,

480
00:18:29,246 --> 00:18:30,770
an increase, and this increase

481
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,111
translates into a voltage
variation at the output.

482
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:34,783
But which of these tensions?

483
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,422
It may be that tension one

484
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:38,048
when I increase V1,

485
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:40,256
I will have V22 to follow,

486
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:42,455
it depends if I look here and there,

487
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,659
and V21 which will follow
from the other side.

488
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,741
with a different terminal,

489
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:49,177
this phase is positive,
that phase is negative.

490
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:50,563
But then, I can well

491
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,904
look at the difference V21 - V22

492
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:55,772
and then I look at taht potential
compared to this potential.

493
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:57,854
it's exactly the swing story

494
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:58,915
that we talked about,

495
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:00,490
if you are on these swings,

496
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,932
one side, it goes up,

497
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:03,936
and we look at the person in front

498
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:05,332
we see that we have

499
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:06,969
twice of our variation,

500
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:09,523
same, we see the double of the variation

501
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:11,717
when one is interested in us

502
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,377
compared to the one who move in front

503
00:19:14,577 --> 00:19:17,253
or, if you look directly V22,

504
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:18,832
with respect to a fixed potential,

505
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,272
well, you look at the ground

506
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,619
it is as if you are watching your
swing compared to the earth

507
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:25,472
so you see that you type

508
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:26,847
on a fixed potential.

509
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:29,082
But if you look at the person in front,

510
00:19:29,282 --> 00:19:31,644
which goes up and down,
you will find that it's twice

511
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:32,631
the dynamics.

512
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:34,662
So V2 it's taking these two curves

513
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,067
and do the subtraction,

514
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:38,301
which gives you this curve here.

515
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:41,921
That is the voltage V2 = f (V1)

516
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:43,671
this is a differential voltage

517
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:45,568
compared to a differential voltage

518
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,591
it is called "differential output"

519
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,019
"differential input".

520
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:51,546
When we look at either
one side or the other side,

521
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:54,562
we're talking about "unilateral"
or "asymmetrical"

522
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:56,815
because we look compared to the ground.

523
00:19:58,384 --> 00:19:59,660
On this curve there,

524
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,368
we find that the gain,

525
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:04,197
it's like a transistor since
the transconductance

526
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:08,506
we had seen it is (gm / 2) x RC

527
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:10,016
and on this curve one,

528
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:11,918
when I look at the one in front,

529
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:13,193
it is multiplied by 2

530
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:15,391
so the factor 2 which was there,

531
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,302
seen here disappear

532
00:20:17,502 --> 00:20:21,280
because it is gm1 or gm2
since it is the same gm

533
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,028
given that

534
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:25,135
tthe currents through
the two at rest are the same.

535
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,736
So the slope here in differential output

536
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,129
is equal to RC x gm1

537
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,048
so I won a factor 2 on the gain.

538
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:35,363
I repeat what I just said,

539
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:38,446
when I go out to one side

540
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:39,818
or from each other,

541
00:20:40,018 --> 00:20:43,583
I designed it here with V21 and V22

542
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,695
admitting that I have a voltage V1

543
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:47,192
sinusoidal at the entrance,

544
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:49,581
then I see a phase

545
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,760
is opposite to the other

546
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,766
when the red voltage increases

547
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,855
the other come down, and vice versa,

548
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:59,927
and the peak values V22 and V21 are known

549
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,665
on both sides are the same.

550
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,314
Now, if you take

551
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:04,289
from that side,

552
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:05,869
the difference between the two,

553
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:08,495
and there you have to
impose a common mode

554
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:11,695
because there is not a
DC potential that we look

555
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,603
to know the common mode,

556
00:21:13,803 --> 00:21:15,380
this, you study it in other courses

557
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,103
Where it is shown that by
imposing common modes,

558
00:21:19,303 --> 00:21:21,365
in the case of resistans,
there is no problem,

559
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:23,975
because we switch compared
to a DC potential known

560
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:26,360
but we will see just now
with the active loads,

561
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,326
it will be something else.

562
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:29,573
And we see a variation in tension

563
00:21:29,773 --> 00:21:31,750
that is double what we would have seen

564
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,925
on one side or the other.

565
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,993
And I will take you to remember this:

566
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,580
the gain, when in differential output,

567
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,201
it's like a common transmitter,

568
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:43,296
the gain when we are with
a unilateral release,

569
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:46,875
is half of a normal common
transmitter gain.

570
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:49,204
We always used

571
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:51,917
to go through the scheme small signals.

572
00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:54,425
So we will make the scheme small signals

573
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,342
of the differential pair.

574
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,872
I've always presented that like that,

575
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,801
one part with the actual pattern,

576
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,340
that we would have achieved

577
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:06,155
we draw the diagram small signal next

578
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:07,677
considering that we polarized it

579
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:09,954
and we extracted small signal parameters,

580
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:11,398
and once we have finished it,

581
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:13,229
we standardized this

582
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:15,203
to replace the scheme small signals

583
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:16,591
by a quadripole

584
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:17,978
having an input impedance

585
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:19,153
an output impedance,

586
00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:20,791
and a controlled current source.

587
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:22,723
So we will do the same.

588
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:25,923
the polarization is by this current source.

589
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:29,517
As soon as the current I0 imposed here,

590
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:31,581
each of the transistors,

591
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:33,663
when the two voltages are the same,

592
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:35,738
sees half of the current pass through.

593
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:37,505
So I can write

594
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:39,930
transconductances gm1 and gm2

595
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,765
that I call gm

596
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,349
because it's the same thing,

597
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:45,482
which in this case is equal

598
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:47,444
to the polarization divided by UT

599
00:22:47,644 --> 00:22:48,980
therefore I0 / 2UT.

600
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:51,384
Now the beta of transistors,

601
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:53,348
I consider that it is the same beta.

602
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:56,915
the Gbe of the transistors are the same,

603
00:22:57,115 --> 00:22:58,291
and it is easy to write

604
00:22:58,491 --> 00:22:59,856
because I know gm/beta

605
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:01,391
so I divided it by beta

606
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:03,938
and I find the transistor gbe

607
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:06,493
and for me to be easy
to do the calculation,

608
00:23:06,693 --> 00:23:08,932
I consider that there is no Early effect,

609
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:12,087
that it is an ideal current source,
the transistor T1 and T2,

610
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:13,774
therefore the output conductance

611
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:14,804
is equal to 0

612
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:17,644
or the output resistance
of the transistors is infinite.

613
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:18,840
And there I draw

614
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:21,328
the scheme small signals.

615
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:23,600
You see your transistor in blue,

616
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,218
and your transistor in red

617
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:28,169
it is a controlled current source

618
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:29,612
with its RC load

619
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:31,083
and look at here,

620
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:34,189
as the transmitter is floating,

621
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:36,943
so I put a current source

622
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:40,077
it is a potential which can take any value.

623
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:43,166
If it is not imposed
by these two terminals,

624
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:47,251
it can take any value between
(+ VCC) and (-VCC).

625
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:48,596
So I make this link

626
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:51,267
there is a current source
so it is infinite resistance

627
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:52,292
I don't show it

628
00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:54,117
I replace, and I finally show

629
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:55,848
the two input impedances.

630
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:58,388
And I leave in an extremely
simple reasoning.

631
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:00,006
The current ie1,

632
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,732
it's the current flowing, here

633
00:24:04,471 --> 00:24:07,126
it is the current flowing
through the transmitter there.

634
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:10,326
The ie2 current is the current
that passes trought there,

635
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,297
So it's the current that will
come in this transmitter, there.

636
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:16,277
The both will join

637
00:24:16,477 --> 00:24:18,502
but since this current and this current

638
00:24:18,702 --> 00:24:20,972
are in the same wire in an AC signal,

639
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:24,574
thus the current ie1 = -ie2.

640
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:28,319
Similar to what was said to v1,

641
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,510
the voltage v1,

642
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:32,826
it appears here,

643
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:34,497
like this, really like this

644
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:36,580
in this mesh.

645
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,996
So it's nothing but VBE1 - Vbe2.

646
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:45,016
And VBE1 tension - Vbe2 is v1 of course

647
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:46,414
that's what I just wrote.

648
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:51,118
When I see a voltage increase and
the other decrease in the same way,

649
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:53,473
it means that the voltage VBE1

650
00:24:53,673 --> 00:24:56,002
is v1 / 2

651
00:24:56,202 --> 00:24:58,099
and Vbe2 is -v1/2.

652
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,999
So that's pretty trivial to
what has been written here,

653
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,842
and then I'm leaving in
the IB1 expression,

654
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:05,375
the current flowing here

655
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:08,021
this is multiplied by the GBE1 VBE1,

656
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,065
the same as what we did all the time

657
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:13,935
same here, ibe2, I can
write that way in red,

658
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:16,188
and I can replace VBE1

659
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:18,165
by its value there

660
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:20,838
and Vbe2 by its value here

661
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,011
and it will give me this relation

662
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:24,735
which easily allows me

663
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:27,627
to conclude that the input impedance

664
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:30,599
I see at the entrance
of a differential pair

665
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:32,811
which must consider

666
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:36,350
the dV1 voltage or v1

667
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,403
divided by the IB1 current,

668
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:43,723
is just 2 x (1/gbe)

669
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:45,850
I remind you that for a common transmitter,

670
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,169
it was just 1/gbe,

671
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:49,644
there, I have an input resistance

672
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:51,171
which is twice superior

673
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:54,171
than what I would have
found with a common transmitter

674
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:55,856
and we can understand very well

675
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,303
because we must provide a
current to the two transistors

676
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,354
which are connected

677
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:01,501
in that way.

678
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:03,774
So now I have everything I need.

679
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:05,563
We earlier calculated

680
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:06,744
the Gm0.

681
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:08,680
It has been discovered that
there are two ways:

682
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,643
either we go out in differential,

683
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:12,389
it is the ratio of this voltage,

684
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:14,212
divided by this tension one.

685
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:16,738
And there, it's exactly
like a common transmitter,

686
00:26:16,938 --> 00:26:18,374
the gain is gm x RC.

687
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:22,081
Why there is no sign (-)?
Because it's for you to decide.

688
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,544
When this is differential,

689
00:26:23,744 --> 00:26:26,026
you can say that's
positive that's negative

690
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:27,086
or the contrary

691
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:30,286
and then, you invert

692
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:32,188
the V1 and V2 inputs.

693
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:34,917
That's for you to decide
where are located (+) and (-).

694
00:26:35,117 --> 00:26:36,520
Is it a story of terminal

695
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,784
between V1 and V2.

696
00:26:37,984 --> 00:26:38,787
So the sign (-)

697
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:40,211
it is added or not

698
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:42,823
depending on if you decide V2,

699
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:44,431
this is positive in that sense

700
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:46,339
or V2 is positive in the other direction.

701
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:48,407
The input impedance,

702
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,502
is twice of a common transmitter

703
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:53,916
when we have a differential input

704
00:26:54,116 --> 00:26:55,677
it's like a common transmitter

705
00:26:55,877 --> 00:26:57,175
with a difference here.

706
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,898
Now, if I take a unilateral output,

707
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:01,629
So I go out either that side

708
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,895
either that side there,

709
00:27:03,095 --> 00:27:04,518
So, I forget half,

710
00:27:04,718 --> 00:27:06,160
it is as if I have a current I2

711
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,343
I operate,

712
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,769
and the other, its variation,

713
00:27:08,969 --> 00:27:10,703
I let it slip in the supply

714
00:27:10,903 --> 00:27:12,019
I do not use it.

715
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:14,540
So I lose half of effectiveness.

716
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,311
I acted on the voltage

717
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,153
but I have not consider the current

718
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:20,013
when I go out unilaterally.

719
00:27:20,213 --> 00:27:21,754
So I lose half of the gain.

720
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:22,935
Look at gm x RC,

721
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:24,866
and there is gm x RC/2.

722
00:27:26,075 --> 00:27:27,687
And the input impedance
remains the same,

723
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:28,697
it does not change,

724
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,153
it depends on the terminal one

725
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:36,613
which is unaffected by the
unilateral or differential output.

726
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:37,844
So finally,

727
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:42,219
adding these two quadrupoles

728
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,882
which represent the differential pair

729
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:47,884
in a circuit according to what comes out,

730
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,065
either there, or on one
side or the other.

731
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:53,184
And to continue in the same reasoning,

732
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:55,329
a differential amplifier

733
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:56,585
with active load,

734
00:27:56,785 --> 00:27:59,402
you remember when we
took the passive loads

735
00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:00,703
with resistors,

736
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:02,990
and we said:

737
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,772
we do with it that we have just analyzed,

738
00:28:04,972 --> 00:28:06,102
passives loads

739
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:09,397
and what will happen if we
replace the resistances

740
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:11,330
by transistors

741
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,462
which correspond to current sources

742
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:15,655
and they are currents
sources that are polarized

743
00:28:15,855 --> 00:28:16,775
to a fixed potential

744
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:18,845
and we put an active load?

745
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,590
So that's the plan.

746
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,933
I simply draw your attention

747
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,542
when you take this current I0

748
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:30,989
and connecting these two sets here,

749
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,984
and you put a DC potential which
is common between the two,

750
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,721
well, what happen is that your current

751
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:38,556
it splits,

752
00:28:38,756 --> 00:28:41,255
If everything is perfect,
it is divided into 2 alone.

753
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:44,519
Here, if you put an active load,

754
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,108
you must be sure

755
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,191
the current flowing there, there,

756
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:52,547
added once passed by the transistor

757
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:54,157
we give the current I0 here.

758
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,433
Otherwise, this is the origin

759
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,552
of a systematic offset

760
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,433
which will appear in your amplifier

761
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:02,631
when all the time we have

762
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:04,967
a little more current,
a little less current

763
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:08,791
which gives a voltage
which is also balanced.

764
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:11,635
So I leave you look at
this diagram there.

765
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,498
I took the power source

766
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,105
and I realized by a current mirror

767
00:29:17,126 --> 00:29:18,448
to create the current I0.

768
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,277
I use the power supply (+ VCC) (-VCC)

769
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:23,606
So from here to there,

770
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,544
I have 2 x VCC.

771
00:29:29,114 --> 00:29:32,592
I connect a diode connector transistor,

772
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:34,437
but I put two in parallel,

773
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:35,782
you'll see why,

774
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,393
so here I have a voltage
of the order of Uj

775
00:29:40,104 --> 00:29:42,297
and there I have a voltage
of the order of Uj

776
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:44,929
So I can very well
calculate the current I0

777
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:49,355
as the current I0, it will
be easily calculated,

778
00:29:50,312 --> 00:29:54,290
I0 = 2VDC - 2UJ,

779
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,540
therefore, it is Ui + Uj

780
00:29:58,146 --> 00:30:00,395
and the 2VDC due to this tension,

781
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:01,744
divided by a resistor

782
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:03,145
I would have chosen myself.

783
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:05,852
This tension one, I know it,
that tension one, I know her,

784
00:30:06,052 --> 00:30:07,597
I only have to determine the resistance R

785
00:30:07,797 --> 00:30:08,827
to impose I0.

786
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:11,282
I come now to the active load part,

787
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:13,251
I'd like two current sources,

788
00:30:13,464 --> 00:30:16,113
look, it's a current source
it's a current source.

789
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,178
Why? Because the
voltage here is the same.

790
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:20,021
There I have the same
voltage as you see here.

791
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:23,388
This line is connected, therefore,
I have a voltage that is imposed

792
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:24,904
by these two transistors.

793
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:26,735
When I take the I0 current

794
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:28,725
and I make it go through two transistors

795
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:29,814
absolutely the same

796
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:32,396
So that structure is put
into an integrated circuit,

797
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:35,323
you can not do it with
discrete components,

798
00:30:35,523 --> 00:30:37,908
you absolutely must
take an integrated circuit,

799
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:39,445
this tension then imposed

800
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:42,050
at the base of these two transistors

801
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,370
will absolutely copy the I0/2 current

802
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,456
in each of these two transistors.

803
00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:51,101
You will end up with I0 / 2 + I0 / 2

804
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:53,187
which summit here and give you I0,

805
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:55,042
So this structure you see here

806
00:30:55,242 --> 00:30:57,351
this is your differential pair we have here

807
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:59,977
but brought to a structure
with active load

808
00:31:00,177 --> 00:31:02,269
and we are left with a differential voltage

809
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,133
and an extremely high gain

810
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,054
because it is gm,

811
00:31:07,254 --> 00:31:14,431
the gain, it is always gm x Rout

812
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,631
and this Rout here

813
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:18,857
is huge.

814
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:20,881
The resistance that I see from here

815
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:22,825
Rout,

816
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:24,881
is the parallel

817
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:26,912
of 1/gce of this transistor

818
00:31:27,112 --> 00:31:29,405
in parallel with the 1/gce of this transistorin

819
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:33,176
that give you, I look at this,

820
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:41,754
1/(+ gce3 gce2), we will call it 3

821
00:31:41,954 --> 00:31:43,193
same on the other side.

822
00:31:43,823 --> 00:31:46,393
So if you multiply gm on this gain,

823
00:31:46,593 --> 00:31:48,677
this output resistance,

824
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,812
you will see that it give a gain

825
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:51,957
which is phenomenal,

826
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:54,098
it depends on your polarization of course,

827
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:56,665
but we would have an
exercice to do around it.

828
00:31:57,962 --> 00:31:59,343
I would like to remind you

829
00:31:59,971 --> 00:32:01,449
what I lost just now

830
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:03,472
when this link one

831
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,756
did not exist.

832
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,976
See this link, I'll delete it,

833
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,810
I will delete this link then,

834
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,013
It's like it does not exist.

835
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:13,939
all the time,
I just do something like that.

836
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:15,752
If I polarizes the
base of this transistor,

837
00:32:15,952 --> 00:32:17,671
of course, this arrangement would not work

838
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:20,191
I would have to put a polarization

839
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:22,731
what I had done in the
scheme that was before.

840
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:26,449
Now if I connect this,

841
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:29,649
I connect there

842
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:31,673
to there,

843
00:32:31,873 --> 00:32:33,602
there, there is another thing,

844
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:35,434
it's like I tell the current I1

845
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:37,801
I'll copy it from here to there.

846
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,664
This is a current mirror

847
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:40,693
look it well,

848
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,680
the current I1 will be here.

849
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:46,537
Earlier, I had made a remark,

850
00:32:47,158 --> 00:32:50,786
I was said when a differential setup

851
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:53,844
in which I only use half

852
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:55,373
ie I have looked through

853
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,457
what happens to that side

854
00:32:57,657 --> 00:32:58,826
according to that side,

855
00:32:59,026 --> 00:33:01,135
I just looked out, as it is now,

856
00:33:01,335 --> 00:33:04,335
according to a given DC potential,

857
00:33:04,535 --> 00:33:05,905
the variation of this current one,

858
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,850
I left it spin in the supply

859
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,094
and I did not use it

860
00:33:09,294 --> 00:33:10,736
There, in this kind of installation,

861
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:11,844
It is'nt so.

862
00:33:12,044 --> 00:33:13,033
I take this current I1

863
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:14,009
and I sparkle it

864
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:15,549
and I bring it back to the other side.

865
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:16,718
I don't lose it,

866
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:18,433
I do not let it go,

867
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:20,033
I copied it on the other side.

868
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:23,282
So when I1 increases here

869
00:33:23,482 --> 00:33:26,001
it is expected that I2 decreases

870
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:27,265
Yes it's right,

871
00:33:27,478 --> 00:33:28,676
this is what will happen,

872
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:31,150
but instead of leaving this variation

873
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:33,863
outside the interest of the load,

874
00:33:34,063 --> 00:33:35,261
if you put a load here,

875
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:37,953
there you see I1 that
descends into your load

876
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:40,309
and I2 which is withdrawing from your load

877
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:43,509
it corresponds to a unilateral output

878
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,423
because I go to one side

879
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,843
in which I no longer have a
gain that was divided by 2.

880
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:50,822
We was saing, unfortunately,

881
00:33:51,022 --> 00:33:53,428
an unilateral exit makes us lose,

882
00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:55,445
gives us a gain equal

883
00:33:55,645 --> 00:34:01,967
gm multiplied by a load resistance,
or an output resistance

884
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,564
divided by 2.

885
00:34:03,764 --> 00:34:04,997
And here,

886
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:06,034
in this case,

887
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:07,870
since I recovered what I lost

888
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,967
and I brought it back here,

889
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:12,517
that factor 2 has been erased.

890
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,879
So this is an setup

891
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,402
in which I have a unilateral output

892
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:20,214
and I have an absolutely full gain

893
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:22,057
as a normal common transmitter

894
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:23,973
which is equal to gm x Rout

895
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:26,552
and as Rout remains what
we have calculated earlier,

896
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:27,887
which is very large,

897
00:34:28,087 --> 00:34:29,426
so I will find with that

898
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:30,840
a gain gm,

899
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,526
I'll call it again

900
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:34,182
transistor T3,

901
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:35,712
it will give me back

902
00:34:35,912 --> 00:34:46,809
a gain Av = gm / (+ gce3 gce2)

903
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:48,279
which is very large,

904
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:50,004
I let you do the math

905
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:53,204
I'll still do it quickly for you

906
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:56,609
the gm is the ploarized current

907
00:34:56,809 --> 00:34:58,014
which passes through both,

908
00:34:58,214 --> 00:34:59,542
so it was said that the gm

909
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:02,742
it is a current I0/2

910
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:05,942
divided by UT.

911
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:08,950
I divide, let's say both gce are the same,

912
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,094
this transistor and this
transistor have the same gce2

913
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:13,575
The two are traversed

914
00:35:13,775 --> 00:35:14,913
by half the current

915
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,853
divided by the Early voltage,

916
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:24,325
plus I0/2, divided by the Early voltage,

917
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:26,107
and I can simplify.

918
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:28,340
So we see that it is
independent of the current

919
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,980
and I find myself with 2UA / UT

920
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,167
so it will depend on the value of AU.

921
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:35,534
So that gain there,

922
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,601
the gain of such a setup,

923
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:40,029
depends on the value of the Early voltage.

924
00:35:40,229 --> 00:35:42,180
You can have an extremely high gain

925
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,314
if you have low power transistors

926
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:46,930
where the Early voltage is very large.

927
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,977
I end with a setup

928
00:35:51,177 --> 00:35:53,210
it looks like it's just

929
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,861
a substitution of bipolar transistors.

930
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:58,376
I would like to explain
the futility of this transistor.

931
00:35:58,576 --> 00:36:00,542
When you take a simple transistor,

932
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,007
it has a beta,

933
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,207
beta, you can not change it,

934
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,888
it is in your transistor,

935
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:11,012
this is one of your transistor
design parameters.

936
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,271
Now, if you take

937
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,992
a power transistor,

938
00:36:15,192 --> 00:36:17,025
you can not make high betas.

939
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,870
Your transistor,

940
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,431
when it has to undergo
a change in voltage, UCE,

941
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:23,436
very, very high,

942
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:27,310
it suffers,

943
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:30,043
physically speaking,

944
00:36:30,243 --> 00:36:33,083
of its inability to possess a high beta.

945
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:34,877
What we do with it,

946
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:35,859
we help it.

947
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:36,986
If this transistor

948
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:39,105
is the T2 transistor that has a low beta,

949
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:40,496
we would put it

950
00:36:40,696 --> 00:36:42,673
with a second transistor
that comes before

951
00:36:42,873 --> 00:36:44,708
and this is a transistor

952
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:46,546
that often enough, are sold

953
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,302
encapsulated both

954
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,603
in a same box

955
00:36:50,803 --> 00:36:52,664
and it's called the Darlington circuit.

956
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,061
So in other words,

957
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:56,745
the imperfection of the transistor

958
00:36:56,945 --> 00:36:58,278
which has a low beta

959
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:01,574
is corrected by the fact
of using two transistors.

960
00:37:01,774 --> 00:37:03,518
And we do not forget

961
00:37:03,718 --> 00:37:05,551
that there I joined.

962
00:37:05,751 --> 00:37:06,844
There, to order it,

963
00:37:07,044 --> 00:37:08,230
I need 2 connections.

964
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,379
Then I will analyze this setup

965
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:12,838
and it will look like all this

966
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:14,142
is calculated.

967
00:37:15,474 --> 00:37:17,071
I will analyze this setup

968
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:20,271
taking the Darlington setup

969
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:22,657
and watching what happens

970
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:24,764
as if it had been a simple transistor

971
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:27,196
So I say base-transmitter-collector

972
00:37:27,396 --> 00:37:30,770
knowing it, there are still
two transistors that follow.

973
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:32,995
I consider that the current IC;

974
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:34,433
that's what I wrote here,

975
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,993
it will be divided in IC1 and IC2 here

976
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,609
and current IC1,

977
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:43,248
it passes into the first transistor
and it comes out the other side

978
00:37:43,448 --> 00:37:44,350
it becomes IE1.

979
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,933
So I can easily say

980
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:50,614
that the stream that exits the IE1

981
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:53,535
is beta1 x IB1,

982
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:54,874
and I called IB1, IB

983
00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:57,530
because I want at all costs to
consider that there is a transistor

984
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,218
which has 3 terminals: IC, IB and IE

985
00:38:00,418 --> 00:38:03,418
which come in and
out of this transistor.

986
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:05,056
So I write this relationship

987
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:06,598
as simple as it is

988
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:08,156
taking IC1

989
00:38:08,356 --> 00:38:10,470
by expressing it as being equal to IE1

990
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,702
IE1 and saying it is beta IB1

991
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:14,221
and I calculate this

992
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:16,981
and I look at what is the value of IC

993
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:19,506
when I add IC1 and IC2

994
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,959
including this effect

995
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:23,391
because the same current of
the transmitter of this transistor

996
00:38:23,591 --> 00:38:26,188
become the base current
of this transistor T2.

997
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:27,275
So this transistor,

998
00:38:27,475 --> 00:38:28,757
it will release a current here

999
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:30,779
that will be its own beta

1000
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:32,091
but given

1001
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,252
that it has already
taken advantage of the beta

1002
00:38:34,452 --> 00:38:35,850
of this transistor that is there,

1003
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,209
therefore, it makes beta1 x beta2

1004
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:40,812
as an approximation of the two gains.

1005
00:38:41,012 --> 00:38:42,785
So if you calculate that expression,

1006
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:45,761
You find that the current that
comes out, or rather the current IC,

1007
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:49,496
that's IB multiplied by the product
of the betas of the two transistors

1008
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:51,466
plus beta2, plus beta1.

1009
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:54,295
We can very well

1010
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:57,129
simplify (beta1 + beta2)

1011
00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:59,515
compared to the product of (x beta1 beta2)

1012
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:01,253
and say this is of the order of magnitude

1013
00:39:01,453 --> 00:39:02,441
of beta1 x beta2.

1014
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:03,862
So I just realized

1015
00:39:04,062 --> 00:39:05,704
one equivalent of a transistor,

1016
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:08,904
if I draw bizarrely,

1017
00:39:09,104 --> 00:39:11,024
we'll say that it is a super-transistor

1018
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,645
so the beta

1019
00:39:14,982 --> 00:39:17,421
equals to beta1 X beta2

1020
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,376
that a manufacturer gives you,

1021
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:22,044
but he tells you "Caution,
there you are going to have

1022
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:23,628
two junction voltages

1023
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,204
when you order it."

1024
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,256
Because there is 2 jonctions
following each other.

1025
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:29,315
Someone who says
"I have two junction voltages,

1026
00:39:29,528 --> 00:39:31,382
if I use it in an increase,

1027
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:33,486
the Voltage IBE delta

1028
00:39:33,686 --> 00:39:35,193
will be divided on two transistors,

1029
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:37,779
which brings a gm on 2."

1030
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:40,219
You remember that
the voltage variation

1031
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,193
generates a current variation,

1032
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:43,504
but then, this transistor

1033
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:45,565
instead of seeing a change,

1034
00:39:45,765 --> 00:39:47,084
it will lose a variation

1035
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,028
on the first,

1036
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:50,341
which brings us roughly to say

1037
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,350
it has lost its transconductance

1038
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,408
because it needs twice variation

1039
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:57,161
to give us an equivalent
change in current.

1040
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,111
Thus, the gm is divided by 2.

1041
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:01,485
Taking this expression

1042
00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:03,587
and saying that the gbe,

1043
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,061
the input impedance,

1044
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:06,807
it's gm/beta

1045
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:09,619
but the beta, it became beta1  x beta2,

1046
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:10,894
I can very well say

1047
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:13,267
it's gm / (x beta1 beta2)

1048
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:15,845
I can bring to the output transistor

1049
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:17,880
gbE2 / 2bêta1

1050
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:20,134
Early voltage is not affected

1051
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,235
because we will say to the approximation

1052
00:40:22,435 --> 00:40:24,350
is the Early voltage of the transistor T2

1053
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:25,229
will dominate

1054
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:27,088
because there is an Early voltage here

1055
00:40:27,288 --> 00:40:30,424
but it does not bother
us to see the output.

1056
00:40:31,026 --> 00:40:32,725
So I find these expressions

1057
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:34,838
and there is an setup

1058
00:40:35,038 --> 00:40:36,413
so-called Darlington

1059
00:40:36,613 --> 00:40:37,675
because we used

1060
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:40,202
two transistor of the same
type and NPN and NPN

1061
00:40:40,402 --> 00:40:42,420
I can do of course with PNP and PNP.

1062
00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:45,530
But if I mix the transistors,

1063
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,662
one PNP, one NPN,

1064
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,761
in the PNP one,

1065
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,585
this is the control transistor,

1066
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:53,252
this is the one that will see

1067
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:55,231
the variation between the base and transmitter

1068
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:57,239
and the NPN transistor,

1069
00:40:57,439 --> 00:41:00,362
this is the one that will
play the output interface,

1070
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:02,347
I'll see there,

1071
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,113
what I have gained according to this,

1072
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:05,019
is that the gm

1073
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:06,353
wich was divided by 2

1074
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:08,124
because of the fact that I lost

1075
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:10,583
twice the junction voltage when ordering,

1076
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:13,048
then I took it back
to a junction voltage.

1077
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:15,400
So that will bring me
to a transconductance

1078
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,204
as transconductance
of a normal transistor.

1079
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:20,231
I won on transconductance

1080
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,841
and then, in terms of beta,

1081
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:29,211
I fall back on the same
thing, more or less,

1082
00:41:29,846 --> 00:41:32,068
beta1 beta2 x as a proxy.

1083
00:41:32,298 --> 00:41:33,815
Now, what will happen

1084
00:41:34,015 --> 00:41:35,406
with the input impedance?

1085
00:41:35,656 --> 00:41:37,314
The value of the input impedance here

1086
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,670
is not the same as there

1087
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,462
simply because the gm2

1088
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:43,548
there was gm2/2

1089
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:45,913
which made me gain a factor of 2

1090
00:41:46,648 --> 00:41:47,867
on the input resistance,

1091
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:52,119
the input resistance is 2bêta1 / GbE2,

1092
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,658
then it will become GbE2 / beta1

1093
00:41:55,858 --> 00:41:57,990
So, I have the factor 2

1094
00:41:58,757 --> 00:41:59,479
which missing here,

1095
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:01,085
therefore the input resistance

1096
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:04,285
of an setup made by
a pseudo-Darlington,

1097
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:06,422
allows me to improve the gain setting

1098
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:07,955
which is the transconductance

1099
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,531
and it allows me to lose a factor of 2

1100
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:11,899
on the input resistance,

1101
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,090
there, the input resistor

1102
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,427
is two times higher than
what I have seen here

1103
00:42:15,627 --> 00:42:18,159
while the output impedance is the same,

1104
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,475
the gce is the same.

1105
00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:22,675
I have just finished

1106
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,357
a completely new structure,

1107
00:42:27,557 --> 00:42:29,704
the differential setup

1108
00:42:29,904 --> 00:42:31,901
which closed the series

1109
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:33,685
of analog structures

1110
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:35,708
that we will use to do with

1111
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:37,005
amplifiers

1112
00:42:37,205 --> 00:42:39,075
and mostly transconductances.

1113
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:41,941
And it is one of the transconductances
that is the most used,

1114
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:44,525
in this case, the input
of an operational amplifier

1115
00:42:44,725 --> 00:42:46,533
uses an input (+) and (-),

1116
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,437
so this is a differential pair

1117
00:42:48,637 --> 00:42:50,816
and therefore this part of my course,

1118
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:52,656
ended, with just

1119
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:56,148
a variety of a bipolar transistor

1120
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:57,865
who was to booster the beta

1121
00:42:58,065 --> 00:42:59,968
through the use

1122
00:43:00,168 --> 00:43:01,247
of two transistors

1123
00:43:01,447 --> 00:43:02,469
to multiply the beta

1124
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:05,669
and obtain a product of
betas between two transistors.
