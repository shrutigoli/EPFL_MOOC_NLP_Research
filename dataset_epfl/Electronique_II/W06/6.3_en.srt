1
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:08,259
Well, compared to what we
just saw in the video before,

2
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:11,736
I promised that we will now
move on to the use

3
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:15,037
of these functions
and analog structures.

4
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,958
And we will build together an
operational amplifier,

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,145
which is made with three levels
that follow each other.

6
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:26,128
<i>Before starting, see what we will do,</i>

7
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:27,822
<i>I'd like to remind you</i>

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,040
<i>what is an operational amplifier.</i>

9
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:31,640
<i>So, an operational amplifier,</i>

10
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:33,284
<i>we gave it these characteristics</i>

11
00:00:33,473 --> 00:00:34,623
<i>that you see here.</i>

12
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:38,855
<i>We would like that, ideally,
we have an infinite gain A</i>

13
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:41,948
<i>or a gain in any case
very, very high.</i>

14
00:00:42,132 --> 00:00:44,793
<i>We wish that there is
no current entering</i>

15
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:46,648
<i>in the positive and
negative strip</i>

16
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:49,447
<i>if not, we will have an
extremely low current here.</i>

17
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:53,730
<i>So this comes down to say the
input impedance is infinite</i>.

18
00:00:54,453 --> 00:01:00,278
<i>We wish to draw from
it an infinite current</i>

19
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:03,108
<i>without disrupting this voltage.</i>

20
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,437
<i>That is to say that
the series resistance,</i>

21
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:08,235
<i>we have seen
here, is zero.</i>

22
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:11,759
<i>With these three
characteristics, I can say,</i>

23
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:15,174
<i>It is necessary to constitute
in this black box</i>

24
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:20,653
<i>containing a + input,
an input -, an output voltage,</i>

25
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:24,487
<i>I should reach a very large gain.</i>

26
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,845
<i>I should make sure
that the entries have</i>

27
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:31,000
<i>very high impedances,</i>

28
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:34,729
<i>and the output has a
very low impedance.</i>

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,627
<i>And let's go with the analysis
of what is inside.</i>

30
00:01:40,342 --> 00:01:44,053
<i>If I turn into levels,</i>

31
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:46,120
<i>to an operational amplifier,</i>

32
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:48,085
<i>I could say,</i>

33
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:51,140
<i>since I have to make a
level that makes the gain,</i>

34
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:53,277
<i>then let's do:</i>

35
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:56,059
<i>levels may be with "s",
level without "s",</i>

36
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,599
<i>there will be a single level
that makes an infinite gain</i>

37
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:01,184
<i>or one level, or 2 or 3 levels,</i>

38
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,935
<i>which make a voltage gain infinite</i>

39
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:06,303
<i>but which also possess
one differential input</i>

40
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:08,316
<i>because I want to make
the counter-reaction-</i>

41
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:09,685
<i>with the negative terminal,</i>

42
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:11,256
<i>and at the same time,</i>

43
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:13,198
<i>I would like that the current who passes,</i>

44
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:14,945
<i>is very, very low.</i>

45
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:18,074
<i>We'll have as I make
an output level,</i>

46
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:20,099
<i>and this output level</i>

47
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:23,161
<i>should not be contributing
to the gain</i>

48
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,298
<i>and, in any case, have a gain</i>

49
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:26,491
<i>to the very high current,</i>

50
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,278
<i>that is to say, it must have
a very low input impedance</i>

51
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:31,620
<i>with an output current
which will be great.</i>

52
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,652
<i>If you look at these
colors that I put there,</i>

53
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:37,200
<i>and you will see that I
used two levels</i>

54
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:41,218
<i>to realize what I call
the gain level,</i>

55
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,156
<i>that's why there is the "s" here</i>

56
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:46,441
<i>and a level to make
the output stage.</i>

57
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:50,257
<i>And we will take this structure
there and start to study it</i>

58
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:53,146
<i>far and wide,
and then I'll ask you</i>

59
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,599
<i>to do this exercise</i>

60
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,166
<i>and calculate the
gain with numbers</i>

61
00:02:57,815 --> 00:03:00,015
<i>after this video.</i>

62
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,930
<i>Take this and look
at what I noticed.</i>

63
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:06,438
You remember, I called
it "analog structure."

64
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:09,614
<i>So "S" as Structure,</i>

65
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:13,440
<i>where I S1, S2, S3, I
have 3 structures here.</i>

66
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,685
<i>I will read what I have
noticed in the face:</i>

67
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:19,981
<i>I called S1: S1 is an input level</i>

68
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,296
<i>formed by a differential pair,</i>

69
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,930
<i>so the floor is formed
by a differential pair</i>

70
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,938
<i>with a passive load and
an unbalanced output.</i>

71
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:31,742
<i>Why asymmetrical?
Because if you remember,</i>

72
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,863
<i>a differential pair,</i>

73
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:36,195
<i>I can go out there and there at a time,</i>

74
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:39,326
<i>but then I decided to go
out from only one side</i>

75
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:41,786
<i>so I have an unilateral output,</i>

76
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,909
<i>just to read the voltage
which is from that side there.</i>

77
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:49,987
<i>The structure S2 is an
intermediate floor</i>

78
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:54,489
<i>as a Common type transmitter,
which must have a large gain</i>

79
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,929
<i>why I did not notice it here</i>

80
00:03:57,107 --> 00:03:59,271
<i>and although I have not
spoken of gain here, because</i>

81
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:00,505
<i>if you noticed,</i>

82
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,972
<i>of how to incorporate this thing</i>

83
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,501
<i>or to carry out this circuit,</i>

84
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:08,151
<i>I opted to put a
passive resistance,</i>

85
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:11,139
<i>So usually, when you have a
passive resistance here</i>

86
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,074
<i>the gain is relatively low,</i>

87
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,047
<i>that's on one side ...</i>

88
00:04:14,227 --> 00:04:15,278
<i>On the other side,</i>

89
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:17,227
<i>the fact to having
plugged this level here</i>

90
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:19,603
<i>I am condemned to see
the input impedance</i>

91
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:20,928
<i>from this level.</i>

92
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:25,180
<I>The input impedance of this
stage is 1/GbE in transistor</i>

93
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,325
<I>which is usually not
biger than that,</i>

94
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,373
<i>so it is useless to put
an active load here</i>

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,910
<i>I'll be condemned to use a
filler here passive in nature</i>

96
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,134
<i>because I break the gain</i>

97
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:40,172
<I>with the input impedance
that I see here.</I>

98
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,267
<i>If we take this,</i>

99
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:44,873
<I>and we look at the level to the end,</i>

100
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:48,764
<I>I would see that S2
has a large gain</i>

101
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:50,920
<i>through an active load</i>

102
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:53,438
<i>because I have put an
infinite resistance.</i>

103
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,643
<i>I took the collector
of this transistor,</i>

104
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:57,700
<i>I disregard these two diodes,</i>

105
00:04:57,894 --> 00:05:00,271
<i>because these two
diodes in terms of AC,</i>

106
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,300
<i>it is practically two
series resistors,</i>

107
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:06,105
<i>are the differential resistances
of the two diodes</i>

108
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:07,480
<i>that we can neglected here</i>

109
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:10,192
<i>and in series with
the huge impedance,</i>

110
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:14,025
<i>this huge impedance
is a current source</i>

111
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:17,805
<i>therefore dull in resistance
is infinite resistance.</i>

112
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:19,571
<i>Of course,
this level here</i>

113
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:22,533
<i>should see an input impedance, here,
which is very, very big</i>

114
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:24,717
<i>otherwise I risk
breaking the gain..</i>

115
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:30,411
<i>And I finished with the
S3 structure which is here</i>

116
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:35,042
<i>is a "push/pull" assembly
linearized with two diodes:</i>

117
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:37,330
<i>D1 and D2. So I read:</i>

118
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:40,268
<i>output level push/pull
of high input impedance,</i>

119
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:43,084
<i>so I'm supposed to have a
high input impedance here</i>

120
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:45,479
<i>and low output impedance,
which is normal,</i>

121
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,484
<i>there, I have a low
output impedance</i>

122
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:49,325
<i>Because I exit on the transmitters</i>

123
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:50,712
<i>and if you remember,</i>

124
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,856
<i>the impedance of
a transmitter is low</i>

125
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,078
<i>with unit voltage gain, so
it is a gain equal to 1</i>

126
00:05:57,277 --> 00:06:00,090
<i>but a very high beta current
gain ,</i>

127
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:01,834
<i>very often,</i>

128
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:04,834
<i>instead of a single transistor,
here and here, we put</ i>

129
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:06,868
<i>Darlington transistors</i>

130
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:10,061
<i>to use beta 1 x beta 2
of two transistors,</i>

131
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:12,679
<i>that allows us to have
extremely high beta.</i>

132
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:16,495
<i>So that is capable of providing
a current in the load RL</i>

133
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,689
<i>taking account of a weak
current that goes here</i>

134
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:21,650
<i>much current fgoes from there,</i>

135
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:24,412
<i>Remember that the output
current goes like this.</i>

136
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,762
<i>So, I take very little control current</i>

137
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:29,369
<i>I multiply by beta and
the majority of the current</i>

138
00:06:29,543 --> 00:06:32,244
<i>I draw it by there in the
or from the mass,</i>

139
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:34,294
<i>to the other transistor.</i>

140
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:37,948
<i>So there are
two stories here,</i>

141
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,600
<i>they are current sources</i>

142
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:42,025
<I>which are not executed
with transistors.</i>

143
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:45,140
<i>Then I will take the complete
digram that will be the next:</i>

144
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:50,727
<i>that's the conceptual diagram,
that's the full diagram.</i>

145
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:53,067
<i>The difference is that I replaced</i>

146
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:56,940
<i>active charges by
active charges diagrams</i>

147
00:06:57,136 --> 00:07:00,136
<i>that is to say, I take
a current mirror,</i>

148
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:05,002
<i>I call it S4, and I used here.</i>

149
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:07,505
<i>to polarize my differential loss</i>

150
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:10,546
<i>and there to realize
an active charge</i>

151
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:14,571
<i>Look at the difference of
the same current mirror,</i>

152
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,644
<i>which takes the same polarization</i>

153
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:20,687
<i>and that generates
the same bias current.</i>

154
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:24,932
<i>This transistor one it is supposed
to lead us to have a voltage variation</i>

155
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:29,254
<i>this transistor there is not caused
to have a voltage variation</i>

156
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,277
<i>because if you take this
operational amplifier</i>

157
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:35,029
<i>and if you decide that,</i>

158
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:37,180
<i>your amp is something who
is going to be like that,</i>

159
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:43,386
<i>I'll put it as follower assembly
or rather in inverter.</i>

160
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:48,684
<i>There is one input of
the positive terminal</i>

161
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,606
<I>which is connected to ground,</i>

162
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:51,880
<i>which means</i>

163
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:53,869
<i>that there is a inputs
connected here to ground</i>

164
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:55,586
<i>and when it connected to ground,</i>

165
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,398
<I>the voltage drop of 0.7
volts is fed directly</i>

166
00:07:58,595 --> 00:07:59,534
<i>on that node there,</i>

167
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:02,800
<i>that node there is stable because
it has a stable voltage here</i>

168
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:04,693
<i>and any small variation here</i>

169
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,714
<i>it is due to the output
conductance</i>

170
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,811
<i>when I have a common
mode which can move</i>

171
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:11,741
<i>or imperfections of my
operational amplifier.</i>

172
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,842
<i>I wanted to say that
this transistor there,</i>

173
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,792
<i>it plays the role of a charge.</i>

174
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:20,505
<i>On the other hand, this transistor
here, plays the role</i>

175
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:23,714
<i>of a current source for
biasing DC current.</i>

176
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:27,153
<i>And the two are part of
a mirror of current ,</i>

177
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,341
<i>where the single current, and
to generate one and the other</i>

178
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:34,680
<i>comes from the diode or
the transistor diode-connected </i>

179
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:36,673
<i>and a stabilized voltage source</i>

180
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:39,092
<i>that would have to feed our "amp"</i>

181
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,064
<i>and a bias resistor.</i>

182
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:45,090
<i>So we have our four structures:
a transconductance,</i>

183
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,873
<i>a second transconductance</i>

184
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:49,309
<i>there I am saying the
name of the functions</i>

185
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:52,252
<i>which were used in
the output stage</i>

186
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:56,155
<i>and one bias and an active load</i>

187
00:08:56,378 --> 00:09:00,402
<i>and the 2 are derived from
a simple current mirror,</i>

188
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:02,134
<i>And then, we went through</i>

189
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,426
<i>what we just saw in
the previous video</i>

190
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,173
<i>concerning functions,
and they are now</i>

191
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,406
<i>in the form of analog structure,</i>

192
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:12,658
<i>and their link with the
functionality in an amplifier.</i>

193
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:15,622
<i>I will go level by level,</i>

194
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,585
<i>and I'll analyze</i>

195
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,357
<i>what I get with modeling,</i>

196
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,444
<i>that we studied in the course.</i>

197
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:23,889
<i>So we studied that,</i>

198
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:27,264
<i>when I am dealing with
a differential pair,</i>

199
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:33,718
<i>I take my differential pair and
I'll watch the equivalent of AC.</i>

200
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:37,267
<i>The source of the current,
here will disappear.</i>

201
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:41,211
<i>The equivalent diagram
of a differential pair,</i>

202
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:44,377
<i>I refer you to the course
on differential pair,</i>

203
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,555
<i> and just</i>

204
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:48,968
<i>This has an input impedance,</i>

205
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,914
<i>an output impedance,</i>

206
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,286
<i>a controlled current source with a transconductance.</i>

207
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:59,044
<i>The input impedance it had been
calculated, it is 2 / GbE,</i>

208
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,525
<i>either one or the other,
because it is the same GbE,</i>

209
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:06,744
<i>at rest, we have the Iq current
that will pass in half here,</i>

210
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:09,703
<i>and half there.</i>

211
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,079
<I>So we will be with the half current</i>

212
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,479
<i>in one and
in the other,</i>

213
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,468
<i>and the voltage
V1 is distributed</i>

214
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:17,363
<i>between a junction and
a second junction,</i>

215
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,999
<i>and when a junction
sees a high voltage,</i>

216
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:22,049
<i>the other sees a lower voltage,</i>

217
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:24,322
<i>which brings me immediately
to understand that</i>

218
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:26,923
<i>is as a common emitter,
apart from that the impedance</i>

219
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:31,703
<i>she finds multiplied
by a factor of 2:</i>

220
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,196
<i>the input impedance.</i>

221
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,558
<i>The transconductance</i>

222
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:39,772
<i>is the half of each of
the transconductances,</i>

223
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,946
<i>And the output impedance,
then you have to ask the question</ i>

224
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,289
<I>from this impedance.</i>

225
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:48,031
<i>If that node there corresponds
to a virtual ground,</i>

226
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,799
<i>because if there is a
common mode input,</i>

227
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:54,976
<i>there is a voltage drop here
DC, which requires a fixed potential</i>

228
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:59,910
<i>this is where we see that
I have 1 on Gce of this transistor here</i>

229
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:01,583
<i>because I go out there
on that node</i>

230
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,472
<i>which come in parallel
with the power supply,</i>

231
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,401
<i>which goes back
to the resistance R2</i>

232
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,715
<i>and in parallel with 1/Gce2.</i>

233
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,057
<i>And often 1/Gce is high enough,</i>

234
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:17,779
<i>compared to the load resistance</i>

235
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:20,887
<i>so I can approximate it by R2.</i>

236
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:23,857
<i>So I just took my differential pair</i>

237
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,276
<i>and what we took as a model,</i>

238
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:28,224
<i>I replaced the AC settings</i>

239
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,243
<i>with the values that
​​we have found.</i>

240
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,158
<i>That I now possess a summary</i>

241
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:33,893
<i>of what is my differential pair</i>

242
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,912
<i>I put aside.</i>

243
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:36,864
<i>I will continue with the next floor.</i>

244
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:38,874
<i>It's very important this way.</i>

245
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:40,540
<i>So I will not look at</i>

246
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:43,023
<i>the whole of  my
operational amplifier,</i>

247
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:45,855
<i>I divides it into each analog structure.</i>

248
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:48,828
<i>The structure, I know
its characteristics.</i>

249
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:50,606
<i>I know it's his function,</i>

250
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:52,344
<i>thanks to what I've synthesized</i>

251
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,705
<i>and the values ​​that are
in there will depend</i>

252
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:56,434
<i>of my bias currents</i>

253
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:58,240
<i>that I have chosen
which are inside.</i>

254
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:01,370
<i>This is the second level.</i>

255
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:02,636
<i>The second level</i>

256
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:04,686
<i>is a transconductance again.</i>

257
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:09,050
<i>the Structure 2, it is a common
transmitter with an active load,</i>

258
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:13,100
<i>the model of the transistor, I know,</i>

259
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:16,928
<i>the input impedance, is that I see there,</i>

260
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,909
<i>1/Gbe of this transistor.</i>

261
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:23,764
<i>The transconductance is
Gm, the gain is Gm x R out</i>

262
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,359
<i>and the R out here,
you remember,</i>

263
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:28,014
<i>instead of the current source,</i>

264
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,477
<i>we had a transistor,</i>

265
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:32,184
<i>so that's why it's 1/Gce6,</i>

266
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,557
<i>parallel with 1/Gce5,</i>

267
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:37,074
<i>because this transistor
was the transistor 5.</i>

268
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:40,985
<i>So I write the three parameters
and I have everything that's necessary,</i>

269
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:44,187
<i>gain is Gm X R of this setup.</i>

270
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:48,984
<I>And that's pretty high, it will
bring me a very high gain.</i>

271
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:55,163
<i>At the moment I have not connected
what would come after.</i>

272
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,274
<i>If by chance, I just
take the differential pair</i>

273
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:01,769
<i>we saw before,</i>

274
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:04,973
<i>and this level here, I already
have the two gain levels.</i>

275
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:08,275
<i>The product of two level gains
gives me the gain level,</i>

276
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:12,062
<i>provided that I do not come
to break the gain here.</i>

277
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:15,151
<i>If by chance we plug here</i>

278
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:20,133
<i>any low resistance,</i>

279
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:23,464
<i>look, it will come in parallel here.</i>

280
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,563
<i>I call it R, and come here.</i>

281
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,610
<i>So if this resistance is low,</i>

282
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,922
<i>that's it, you've broken all
the resistance R out of this setup</i>

283
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:36,506
<i>and if you broke it, it is because
of this setup here</i>

284
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,026
<i>that generates the essential
of the high gain.</i>

285
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:41,431
<i>So if we take this low-resistance</i>

286
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:43,958
<i>you will end up with
R out equal to it,</i>

287
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:52,659
<i>so the gain of this stage is:
-Gm6 multiplied by the  R out resistance</i>

288
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,571
<i>of this level here.</i>

289
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:59,491
<i>And there it is, if R out is low,
I degrade the gain,</i>

290
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,249
<i>and what I wanted to do,</i>

291
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,654
<i>that is to get a very high gain,</i>

292
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,666
<i>well I do not get it,</i>

293
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:07,578
<i>because I degraded
it because of this.</i>

294
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,438
<i>So this is something
I could not do</i>

295
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,866
<i>and I connect a level here,</i>

296
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:17,196
<i>the one which comes here,
this level which will come here,</i>

297
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,032
<i>should at all costs have
an extremely high resistance here</i>

298
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,315
<i>because it will come
in parallel with this,</i>

299
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:26,591
<i>I would not degrade
the value I got here.</i>

300
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,197
<i>That's why I opted
to take an output level.</i>

301
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:32,255
<i>Hence the need for this output level</i>

302
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,922
<i>when I plug on this side.</i>

303
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:36,277
<i>Well, what I see on this side here,</i>

304
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:40,366
<i>is the input impedance
of a push / pull setup</ i>

305
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,552
<i>which is like
the common collector,</i>

306
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:52,669
<i>and its impedance that I see here
is 1 / GbE + Beta X RL,</i>

307
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,953
<i>So it depends on RL,
it also depends on beta.</i>

308
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:58,941
<i>For example, why we put
Darlingtons here,</i>

309
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,369
<i>instead of these two,
we put Darlingtons</i>

310
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:03,957
<i>so as to greatly
increase the beta,</i>

311
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:06,525
<i>because when we increase
the beta, look at R in,</i>

312
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:10,286
<i>it is more dominated by
this factor here, this beta X RL.</i>

313
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,257
<i>So often in our designs</i>

314
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,039
<i>we put very high betas.</i>

315
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:16,459
<I>The RL, it depends on the user.</i>

316
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:19,574
<i>It is the resistance that
you will connect by yourself</i>

317
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,518
<i>when you use your "amp",</i>

318
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:23,585
<i>if it is an audio amplifier</i>

319
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,667
<i>and you put here a low-resistance</i>

320
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:26,725
<i>of a few ohms,</i>

321
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:30,270
<i>know that this level here,
if it doesn't have a very high beta,</i>

322
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,357
<i>it may decrease the gain.</i>

323
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:34,473
<i>And generally thanks to
the counter-reaction,</i>

324
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:36,486
<i>we improve all this
thanks to the gain</i>

325
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,330
<i>in open loop of the set.</i>

326
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:41,701
<i>That said, it is the overall pattern,</i>

327
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:45,024
<i>or rather the model of my setup</ i>

328
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,910
<i>as we studied it,</i>

329
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,276
<i>We know the input
and output impedances,</i>

330
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:56,238
<i>and we know that the output resistance
is approximately 1 / Gm</i>

331
00:15:56,613 --> 00:16:00,800
<i>since that the gain will be
Gm divided by the 1 / Gm.</i>

332
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:06,626
<i>Look, this over this equals 1,
so we end up with a diagram</i>

333
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,305
<i>that will give us a voltage follower,</i>

334
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,511
<i>where a gain equals 1.</i>

335
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,959
<i>So I now have my three levels</i>

336
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:16,333
<i>and I'll put them
one behind the other.</i>

337
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:22,171
<i>The differential loss,
the common-transmitter, and the push-pull.</i>

338
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:27,532
<i>There is the first, independent
of the others, it's here.</i>

339
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:29,138
<i>The second too,</i>

340
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:31,191
<i>and the third too.</i>

341
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:35,879
<i>But you know that when
you put levels like this,</i>

342
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:40,627
<i>you're forced to calculate
the function of the overall gain.</i>

343
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,284
<i>It is V2 divided by V1.</i>

344
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,620
<i>This is the output of all,
this is the entrance of all.</i>

345
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:49,022
<i>And so if I have to take V2 / V1,</i>

346
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:57,094
<i>I have to do:
Va / V1 x Vb / Va x V2 / Vb.</i>

347
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,126
<i>Each has a transfer function,</i>

348
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,969
<i>Look, we simplify</i>

349
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:05,305
<i>this and this, this and this,
which gives us V2 / V1 found here.</i>

350
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:08,048
<i>So the three levels, sums up,</i>

351
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,505
<i>to take each gain</i>

352
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,329
<i>and multiply it by the other.</i>

353
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:17,611
<i>But be careful, if I hide
this part, I do Va / V1,</i>

354
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:22,357
<i>now when I plug this level behind</i>

355
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:24,090
<i>look at this resistance:</i>

356
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,022
<i>the input resistance of
my common-transmitter</i>

357
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:30,735
<i>comes in parallel with
the output resistance</i>

358
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:32,523
<i>of my differential pair.</i>

359
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,819
<i>So the paralleling of these two,</i>

360
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:37,428
<i>will have an effect
on the gain of this.</i>

361
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,448
<i>So without this level, you see
a gain Gm X this resistance,</i>

362
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:44,593
<i>Now we see a gain Gm X this resistance,</i>

363
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:47,226
<i>parallel with this.
This is very important.</i>

364
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:49,689
<i>So we can break everything
while plugging incorrectly,</i>

365
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:51,964
<i>so degrading the characteristics,</i>

366
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:53,720
<i>this is not important</i>

367
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,969
<i>because we counted on the gain</i>

368
00:17:56,164 --> 00:17:58,002
<i>which would be done
in the common transmitter,</i>

369
00:17:58,184 --> 00:18:00,472
<i>so it's in doing this that
we can break the gain.</i>

370
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:02,991
<i>You remember that
I wanted to do the gain</i>

371
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,924
<i>thanks to these two levels,
and I want to say,</i>

372
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:08,739
<i>that the gain is basically
done by this level here</i>

373
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:10,691
<i>So we should not degrade the gain,</i>

374
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:13,294
<i>because of a relatively
low input impedance.</i>

375
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:15,422
<i>Here I take my expressions</i>

376
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:17,894
<i>and I take into account
what has just been added.</i>

377
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:27,487
<i>So this is due to that.
So it came in parallel</i>

378
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:30,349
<i>compared to what I'll note
before connecting it.</i>

379
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,118
<i>Same here.</i>

380
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:35,136
<i>This resistance
came in parallel here,</i>

381
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:39,842
<i>So the beta X RL comes here.</i>

382
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:42,591
<i>And here, the resistance RL,</i>

383
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,262
<i>is that which the user will
connect in open loop,</i>

384
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:48,206
<i>and it comes here.</i>

385
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:52,366
<i>So when I write this,
it is precisely to take into account</i>

386
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,541
<i>of the input and output impedances,</i>

387
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:55,977
<i>and which come into parallel</i>

388
00:18:56,158 --> 00:18:58,071
<i>when I put them one behind the other,</i>

389
00:18:58,286 --> 00:19:03,362
<i>and here I am trying to describe
my gains Va / V1, Vb / Va, V2 / Vb</i>

390
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:06,925
<i>and I just have to multiply
this X this X this,</i>

391
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,947
<i>and find the total gain of this setup.</i>

392
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:12,989
<i>So this, will be an exercise
I'll give you</i>

393
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:16,551
<i>immediately after this video,
you can continue to solve it,</i>

394
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:19,007
<i>there are numerical values
and you will see</i>

395
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,203
<i>you can achieve fairly high gains</i>

396
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,765
<i>with this kind of setup,</i>

397
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:28,178
<i>and make a setup that gives
an operational amplifier,</i>

398
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:29,811
<i>realized by three floors.</i>

399
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:34,366
<i>Pay close attention to the fact
that something is missing</i>

400
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,099
<i>in this explanation.</i>

401
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:37,945
<i>You will see it in other lessons,</i>

402
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:39,835
<i>it is to make it stable,</i>

403
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:42,296
<i>that is to say when we do
a counter-reaction,</i>

404
00:19:42,478 --> 00:19:44,403
<i>it is necessary that we respect</ i>

405
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,506
<i>the delay created by the setup,</i>

406
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:50,164
<i>for us to continue having
sufficient phase margin</i>

407
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,439
<i>for the setup to be stable,</i>

408
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,873
<i>is that we have to compensate
for this setup by adding</i>

409
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:57,509
<i>the junction capacitance,</i>

410
00:19:57,717 --> 00:20:00,580
a Miller capacitance or
other compensation techniques,

411
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,997
<i>to adjust it,</i>

412
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:04,011
<i>what I have not done in this exercise,</i>

413
00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:06,872
<i>so it remains an oriented exercise.</i>

414
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:10,298
<i>Function, analog structure
and gain calculations</i>

415
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:12,336
<i>to be implemented,</i>

416
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:15,531
<i>it will be necessary to add the stability
study of this type of installation.</i>

417
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,423
I'd like to finish this part,

418
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,345
I think I just tackled the essential

419
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:24,921
of what we should know about the transistor,

420
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:27,436
the last example we just saw

421
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:31,331
shows us the power of the methods we studied,

422
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,005
a more complete exercise that
could be very, very useful

423
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:39,649
for someone who would really want
to use all the structures

424
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,304
we learned to calculate,
and all the methodologies

425
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:43,450
that were added,

426
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:46,832
perhaps take a more detailed
operational amplifier,

427
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:49,504
or a more complex audio amplifier

428
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:52,912
and achieving it would be
a great exercise to do

429
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:55,996
in the continuation of this course.
