1
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,529
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,883
Today, we will study

3
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,804
the polarization of transistors.

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,573
So we have already passed through

5
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:17,680
the small signals model of the transistor,

6
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,463
but it was considered that the transistor

7
00:00:19,663 --> 00:00:20,530
has already been polarized,

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,871
that is to say that the current
flowing through our transistor

9
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,379
has been set by a given technique.

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,502
The objective of this chapter

11
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:32,143
is actually to see
how we polarize a transistor,

12
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:33,227
first thing,

13
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:35,141
so we'll see a small introduction,

14
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:36,450
then we will look

15
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,928
what are the polarization
methods available

16
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:41,528
and you will see that finally,
there is only one method,

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,083
the one that will be used
practically all the time

18
00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:46,211
and afterwards,
we will look at the assemblies

19
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,942
based on discrete components,

20
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:51,445
it means that you take
a transistor from the market

21
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:53,846
and you put around it some resistances

22
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:55,626
and power supplies

23
00:00:55,826 --> 00:00:57,730
to realize your polarization

24
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,756
and we will do this by current sources

25
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:01,086
so learn to make

26
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:03,912
current sources with discrete components

27
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:06,388
to finish after with an assembly

28
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:08,975
which is extremely known
for making integrated circuits

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,452
or in integrated circuits

30
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:12,227
called "current mirror"

31
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:14,477
and which enables us
to make current sources

32
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:15,775
based on transistors.

33
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,756
I would like to remind you again

34
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:22,002
what was this objective of polarization.

35
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:23,586
We started with the symbol

36
00:01:23,954 --> 00:01:25,873
and we examined it,

37
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:27,321
and we did with it

38
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:29,639
the small signals model,

39
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,171
and we said that between two,

40
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,635
we will have to polarize.

41
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:34,179
Polarization means

42
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,269
imposing the current of polarization IC0

43
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:39,944
because as soon as this is known,

44
00:01:40,412 --> 00:01:40,937
look,

45
00:01:41,137 --> 00:01:44,137
all parameters, we know them.

46
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,054
Everything else depends on things

47
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:48,080
determined by laws of physics

48
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,585
or determined by
the component that we used.

49
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:52,408
The polarization means

50
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:57,234
that we set
all the potentials of a DC circuit

51
00:01:58,054 --> 00:02:01,660
and as soon as we set these DC potentials,

52
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,679
we can forget that,

53
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:06,852
and go directly to an AC analysis.

54
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:10,599
So there you do your DC analysis

55
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:11,963
by polarization,

56
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:13,807
and then once it's done,

57
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,177
we do the AC analysis.

58
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:18,370
So, in the path of this course,

59
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,918
I preferred to present you the purpose,

60
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:25,483
that is to do linear functions
with your circuit

61
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:28,374
taking the diagram AC,

62
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,574
and it was saying that later,
we will study the polarization.

63
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:33,155
But know that in practice,

64
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:36,004
this, is much more important than this.

65
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:37,660
That, is a goal,

66
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,693
and that, is the way to do it.

67
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,580
The objectives of polarization

68
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,918
are first to set all the DC potentials

69
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:51,649
of your diagram or electronic circuit.

70
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,849
Know that it is very difficult

71
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,707
to choose, to make the right choice

72
00:02:57,907 --> 00:03:02,003
of your DC potentials in all the nodes

73
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:04,618
and all the polarizations in your circuit

74
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,124
rather than calculate a gain,

75
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:07,935
a gain is extremely simple

76
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:10,507
calculate the input impedances,
the output impedances,

77
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:14,011
you have understood that
it is a matter of correctly choosing

78
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:17,086
your common transmitter-
common base assembly

79
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:18,394
or common collector.

80
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:20,364
Now what you do not know,

81
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:22,173
but you will learn it later,

82
00:03:22,373 --> 00:03:23,930
that your components

83
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,608
first suffer from an inaccuracy,

84
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:32,086
they change behavior with temperature

85
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:33,993
and unfortunately

86
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:35,245
they have values,

87
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,806
such as beta, such as offline voltage

88
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:39,689
that are not fixed values,

89
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,531
this is not absolute values,
it is things that vary

90
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,237
and depend relatively
on one component to another

91
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:47,962
and that vary in extremely high errors.

92
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,242
That's the first thing.

93
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:50,788
Second thing,

94
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:53,631
polarization is the spot

95
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,260
that allows you later to say
"I have a supply voltage

96
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,417
that ranges between
0 and a certain amount."

97
00:03:58,617 --> 00:04:00,491
Today, the supply voltages

98
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:01,666
are very low,

99
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,705
we work around 1 volt.

100
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:06,869
So when you work with low supply voltages,

101
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:09,159
and you want to have
a dynamic of your signal

102
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,411
that is a range in which
your signal will change,

103
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:16,010
the choice of polarization will be

104
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,483
among the most difficult things to do.

105
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:22,638
So I'm not going to start
moving quickly in the course

106
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:24,828
because we're going
to analyze all of these things,

107
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:27,475
showing first how we polarize,

108
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:31,064
and later we'll see how we choose
the value of the polarization

109
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:33,705
which would become
the most important parameter

110
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,686
of a circuit design

111
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:38,495
and it is with that,
once it has been determined,

112
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,199
everything else becomes easy to find.

113
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:45,412
Here is the output characteristic

114
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,552
of any transistor,

115
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:49,821
in this case bipolar,
as an example here.

116
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,258
The manufacturer
will give you a lot of limits.

117
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,353
He'll tell you "Caution,

118
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:57,940
my component would not like
to have a higher

119
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,841
voltage than the so called VCEmax."

120
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,183
This tension,

121
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,213
it can not exceed

122
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:06,457
a certain value

123
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:10,413
that the manufacturer of
this component will give you.

124
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:12,186
When he gives you this value,

125
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,055
it does not mean that if you exceed it,

126
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:17,554
you will damage your component,

127
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:19,269
you can spoil it

128
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:22,241
if you are not careful,

129
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:23,383
there is a phenomenon

130
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,718
called drilling phenomenon,

131
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,113
this is when the base
of a bipolar transistor

132
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:31,239
it has disappeared,

133
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,486
the PN junctions on either side

134
00:05:34,686 --> 00:05:38,955
are found without
an active zone of bipolar,

135
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,098
that is to say there is the depletion zone

136
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:43,211
of this junction and this junction there

137
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,643
that touch completely

138
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:45,653
and this creates a phenomenon

139
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:48,410
where your transistor appears
as a low resistance

140
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,135
and the current flows directly

141
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:51,516
from the emitter to the collector.

142
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:56,811
And that is because of a voltage
VCEmax that you have exceeded

143
00:05:57,011 --> 00:05:58,460
So the manufacturer gives it to you,

144
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,010
if you are able to put a resistance

145
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,182
either to the collector
or to the transmitter,

146
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:05,678
and limit the current that passes,

147
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:07,550
your component, it is not dead,

148
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,921
you can retrieve it

149
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:12,338
nevertheless your transistor is
no longer a transistor,

150
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,872
it becomes a resistance.

151
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,402
Likewise, the manufacturer will tell you,

152
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:18,543
"Do not exceed a maximum current,

153
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:22,173
if you put into the component
a current that exceeds the ICmax,

154
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:23,831
there may be a destruction."

155
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:25,174
It can simply be

156
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:28,133
the wires that connect the silicon

157
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,609
to your case which limit this

158
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:32,921
or simply the capacity

159
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:36,229
or the density of the current

160
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,606
which passes through the silicon

161
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,485
that the component can not support

162
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:41,695
beyond a certain density of the current

163
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:43,252
which is given by the manufacturer

164
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:44,646
So we have a limitation there

165
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:45,989
and we have a limitation here.

166
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:50,920
The VCEsat is a voltage

167
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,651
that is specific to the transistor

168
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:54,118
and specific to your assembly.

169
00:06:54,318 --> 00:06:55,904
That's when your voltage

170
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,235
goes on to the order of magnitude of 0

171
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:00,174
or a few hundred millivolts,

172
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:01,736
from 100 to 200 mV

173
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:05,798
there, you've lost
the so-called linear part of using

174
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:06,911
the one that's here.

175
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:08,295
This part

176
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,997
the maximum power

177
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,269
that your component could support,

178
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,039
is mainly determined of course,

179
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,219
by the size of your transistor,

180
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:20,170
active part of your transistor,

181
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,979
and in large part also

182
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,961
by the housing capacity

183
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:26,108
to evacuate the accumulated heat.

184
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:29,657
So the person who makes you the component,

185
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:31,993
will put it in a given box,

186
00:07:32,193 --> 00:07:34,398
and that box, if you get to cool it,

187
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:37,241
or you get to put it in a condition

188
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:40,198
where you stay below this curve

189
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:42,712
for the product VCE x IC,

190
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:44,943
well, you're going to have the transistor

191
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:47,415
behaving as a power source as you see it

192
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:49,156
and we should not overflow

193
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:51,827
here, there or here,

194
00:07:52,027 --> 00:07:53,657
to ensure that we are

195
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:54,886
well polarized

196
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:56,474
and we do not exceed

197
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:58,446
the limits of use of the component

198
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,243
sold by a manufacturer.

199
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:03,752
Let us now start with
the polarization techniques

200
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:05,227
of bipolar transistor.

201
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:07,928
The goal is to find

202
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:08,879
the IC0.

203
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,683
We will give a numerical value to IC0.

204
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:14,663
So, it is simple,

205
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:16,395
in the bipolar, it is understood

206
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:19,724
that the IC0 is exponentially proportional

207
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:21,241
to the transmitter base voltage,

208
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,138
so if you put a base transmitter voltage

209
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,028
of a given VC value,

210
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,652
IC0 will automatically
have a certain value.

211
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:34,627
It is proportional to a parameter
specific to the component,

212
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:36,157
which is given by the manufacturer,

213
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:37,545
or you can measure it,

214
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:40,511
and the thermodynamic voltage

215
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,792
and otherwise, there is
an exponential relationship.

216
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:43,863
Similarly,

217
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:46,013
your current IC0

218
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:49,553
depends on the base current IB0,

219
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:51,225
multiplied by beta.

220
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:52,853
So of course, you can also

221
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:54,503
get an IC0 value

222
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:56,235
simply by imposing

223
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,142
a base current IB0.

224
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,138
And finally,

225
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:02,279
it was said that
in the bipolar transistor,

226
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:04,087
I want to redraw again next,

227
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:07,733
if you neglect the base current,

228
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:10,193
so you consider that there is
beta which is very high,

229
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:13,250
the current flowing in the collector, the IC0,

230
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,336
will be equal to
your transmitter current, IE0.

231
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:19,366
That's it.

232
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:20,984
Thus there are 3 ways

233
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:24,184
to determine the polarization current

234
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:25,660
which is the goal.

235
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,559
That's what we would like to have

236
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,951
and give it a value

237
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,193
in a circuit.

238
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:32,822
Looking at these 3 techniques,

239
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:34,549
I can immediately tell you,

240
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:36,682
we will see right away,

241
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:38,273
that this technique

242
00:09:38,473 --> 00:09:40,144
is never used,

243
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,143
because an exponential relationship

244
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:45,114
between a voltage and a current

245
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:47,018
would pose a problem

246
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:49,664
because it is necessary
to control this value well

247
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:51,124
and there is another parameter

248
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,669
related to the temperature,

249
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:55,247
we already saw, I will repeat
immediately after,

250
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,378
but know that this, we never use it.

251
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:00,940
When you look at IC0 according to beta,

252
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,219
well, there is the beta value
that is between two,

253
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,038
so this value of beta

254
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,537
depends on the accuracy of beta.

255
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,700
And know that the manufacturer

256
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:12,249
of your bipolar components

257
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,326
has great difficulty to ensure you

258
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:17,393
betas that have some
fairly accurate value.

259
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,421
Thus, from one transistor to another,

260
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:20,633
the beta will vary

261
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,512
and there is an extremely high error

262
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:25,294
and there is a dependency of
beta with respect to the similar

263
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:26,993
temperature between the two cases.

264
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,308
It is less dependent on temperature here,

265
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:32,313
but the dispersion of betas
is extremely high.

266
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:33,949
This will stay.

267
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,407
And that's what we're going to use.

268
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:38,538
So that's valid,

269
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:39,959
but in a laboratory.

270
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,861
And that, will really be the solution

271
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:44,575
that we will use all the time.

272
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,059
I repeat the 3 methods

273
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:50,571
and I now add

274
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:52,184
what will prevent me

275
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:55,260
not to use this one to start,

276
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,338
less use this one and
especially use this one.

277
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:00,213
The first method,

278
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:03,413
that one based on the use of BVE0,

279
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:05,920
so put a voltage between base and emitter

280
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,297
which is DC,

281
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:10,339
except that to control
exponentially a current

282
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,662
is very difficult on one side,

283
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:15,064
know that any variation

284
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,695
of this tension

285
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,550
with respect to temperature,

286
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,426
will create a variation,

287
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:26,463
any change of delta T,

288
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:29,212
will make me a drift of the temperature

289
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:31,937
of 2 mV per degree.

290
00:11:32,137 --> 00:11:33,606
But there is this sign (-),

291
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:35,612
and that is what is the most critical.

292
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:39,372
If you now take the beta
of the transistor,

293
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:41,502
it also depends on the temperature

294
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:46,784
and it varies in the order of
0.8% per degree centigrade

295
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:47,717
or degree,

296
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,208
and it varies up to 1.5

297
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:52,462
In reality, here, there is no minus sign.

298
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:53,872
So that's fine.

299
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:54,725
We can handle it.

300
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:57,148
There it can be destructive
for the transistor

301
00:11:57,348 --> 00:12:00,910
if you impose a fixed voltage
and if the temperature changes,

302
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,734
you made a bipolar

303
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,973
transistor circuit

304
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:06,972
that you use in a car

305
00:12:07,172 --> 00:12:08,352
and in your car,

306
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:09,900
you have a temperature,

307
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,876
may be in winter, negative,

308
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,421
and in summer positive,

309
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:15,600
know that the polarization
that is calculated

310
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,864
will give you a variation,

311
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:19,259
there is a huge variation

312
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,159
between a temperature of maybe 0 degrees

313
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,320
to something that goes up
to 20 to 30 degrees,

314
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,764
it will strongly influence,

315
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:29,495
depending on temperature,
the value of the polarization

316
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,957
because this one,
if it varies according to that,

317
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:34,025
it will impose a runaway

318
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,615
of your transistor because of this IC0.

319
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,073
So I would like to show you

320
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:40,565
how and why

321
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:42,304
this VBE0,

322
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:46,448
I took the IC-VBE curve of the transistor and I drew the behavior of this at room temperature, in the order of 25 degrees, j I took a case where it was very cold, -5 degrees, and a case where it was heated because there is a certain efficiency in your assembly and your assembly heated, it reached 55 degrees.

323
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:48,707
and I drew

324
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,705
the behavior of this

325
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,984
at room temperature,

326
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:55,343
in the order of 25 degrees,

327
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:58,186
I took a case where it is very cold,

328
00:12:58,386 --> 00:12:59,788
-5 degrees,

329
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,194
and a case where it was heated

330
00:13:02,394 --> 00:13:05,271
because there is
a certain efficiency in your assembly

331
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:06,826
and your assembly heated,

332
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:08,539
it reached 55 degrees.

333
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:11,158
Suppose you have polarized your transistor

334
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,331
somewhere here.

335
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:14,666
You came with a temperature,

336
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,954
you want to have a current that is there,

337
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:18,719
this current from here to there,

338
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,530
on that curve here,

339
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,862
and that's it, you have calculated
what is the voltage

340
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:26,904
you need.

341
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:30,029
And you found this voltage here.

342
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:33,834
The VBE0, it's there.

343
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,964
Well, if you are here

344
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:40,401
at 25 degrees,

345
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:43,182
and all of a sudden, for a given reason,

346
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:44,335
it was cold,

347
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:49,768
look at the value of your current
that will pass.

348
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,287
If you are at -5 degrees,

349
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,305
and in your laboratory,
when you have calculated your circuit,

350
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:57,620
you find 5 mA of IC0 in it,

351
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,554
so your IC0 you searched for

352
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:03,152
and assume that your IC0 here

353
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:05,406
is equal to 5mA,

354
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:09,013
and this 5 mA here, you calculated it

355
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:14,753
and it gave you a value of 0.7 V,

356
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:17,028
well, if by chance

357
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:19,619
you hold this 0.7 V

358
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:20,989
but it is less cold,

359
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,989
look at the current that flowing in.

360
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:25,310
Your current becomes extremely low,

361
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,923
it is barely somewhere,

362
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:30,538
some micro-ampers

363
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:31,984
and the opposite is true.

364
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:34,223
If by chance you find yourself

365
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:37,423
with a situation in which

366
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:41,550
your temperature has risen

367
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,687
it is 55 degrees,

368
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:44,137
there you have to go very far

369
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,901
and you will see a current IC

370
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,723
that is going to be much higher than this

371
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,746
knowing that the curve is exponential.

372
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:51,990
So, that thing,

373
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,158
we never use it.

374
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:57,163
So it's never used

375
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,263
because it is really not possible

376
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:02,061
to first control such a stable tension.

377
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:04,179
Two, the component itself

378
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,349
when it passes
from one characteristic to another,

379
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:09,329
it may create a low current
or a high current

380
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,305
and the fact that it moves
in that direction,

381
00:15:12,505 --> 00:15:15,072
whenever it heats,
it moves in that direction,

382
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:17,829
the meaning of this -2 mV

383
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,610
it makes the problem very tricky

384
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,025
because the more the current increases,

385
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:27,470
the more your component
will consume even more,

386
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,950
or will dissipate more power,

387
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,050
then the power is IC x VCE

388
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,392
so it will heat up even more

389
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:36,532
and the more it heats,

390
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:39,120
the more this characteristic
moves in that direction,

391
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,354
and the more the current increases
and it will eventually

392
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,306
destroy your component

393
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:45,752
and it is called the thermal runaway.

394
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:47,978
It is the phenomenon
that is very destructive

395
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:50,041
in a bipolar type transistor

396
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,657
because of this phenomenon
that we have just seen.

397
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,329
Take the second case

398
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,094
of polarization by controlling
the base current.

399
00:15:59,294 --> 00:16:02,294
I want to impose a constant IB0 current

400
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,142
and say "This current and this current

401
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:07,549
are linked by a beta relationship."

402
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,361
Can I calculate this current?

403
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:10,237
Very easy!

404
00:16:11,122 --> 00:16:12,352
I just have to look at

405
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:15,580
the current that I see
from there to there,

406
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,633
if I look at that current,

407
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,771
if I look at this current
in that direction,

408
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:25,487
well, I will be able to say

409
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,108
that this voltage from there to there

410
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:29,238
it's VCC,

411
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:32,638
is equal to that voltage
from there to there

412
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:35,818
which is IB0 x RB,

413
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:38,534
so that is IB0 x RB,

414
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:45,514
and there I have the voltage VBE0

415
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:50,112
and if you remember that
this approximates to Uj

416
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:52,390
when it comes to the polarization

417
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,129
because the error is very small,

418
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,096
it is simply in polarization
that we have the right to say that.

419
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:59,067
So, in this loop

420
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:03,081
VCC is equal RB x IB + Uj

421
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:04,354
this is what I wrote here,

422
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:07,182
VCC is equal RB x IB + Uj

423
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:09,749
I only have to take the value of IB0

424
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:11,366
I'll write it here anyway,

425
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:19,042
VCC is equal to RB x IB0 + Uj

426
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:21,537
which will give me the relation IB0.

427
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,026
So, I have to choose RB,

428
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:26,927
knowing VCC,

429
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:29,258
knowing that it is of the order of 0.7,

430
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,788
it's good, I have my basic current.

431
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:35,771
The basic current,
I just have to choose a transistor,

432
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,870
and then, my transistor, it has its beta

433
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,919
that comes with,

434
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,044
and it will give me directly IC0.

435
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:43,534
First thing is that your beta

436
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:46,668
varies with the temperature,

437
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:48,809
it is true that there,
it is not as serious

438
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:50,486
that the case of VB0,

439
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,151
first, there is no exponential,

440
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:53,848
it is a linear relation, one.

441
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:56,585
Two, the variation with respect
to the temperature is there

442
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,707
but it is relatively low.

443
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:01,142
But the beta dispersion,

444
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:03,527
you only have to take
a component of the market

445
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:04,875
and watch the beta.

446
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:07,418
The manufacturer,
he gives you that famous beta

447
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:10,863
with a beta min,

448
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:13,797
a beta type,

449
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:15,944
and a beta max.

450
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:18,521
It gives you these different values

451
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,602
in 3 columns,

452
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:21,370
it tells you, the beta min,

453
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,789
I take an example of transistors

454
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:27,678
such as the BC107 or the BC77,

455
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:32,265
the beta min, it can go down
to the order of magnitude of 50,

456
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:35,762
The beta type is about 200, or even 300,

457
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:37,146
it depends on the manufacturer,

458
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:39,767
and the beta max,
it can go up to 300 and some.

459
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:42,015
So when you look between this and that,

460
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:44,339
you'll see that there is
an extreme difference

461
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,861
and this extreme difference,

462
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:48,569
it means that you can easily fall,

463
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,126
when you buy a lot of transistors,

464
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:55,428
you can find betas
that are of the order of 100,

465
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:57,148
and betas of the order of 300

466
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:58,611
for the same component.

467
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:00,392
If you want to mass-produce

468
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:01,635
an electronic circuit,

469
00:19:01,835 --> 00:19:03,794
and you base your calculation

470
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:04,946
on that beta,

471
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:07,072
know that your current of polarization

472
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,241
it will fluctuate

473
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,505
with the difference between
that beta and that beta

474
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:11,839
and you remember

475
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,830
that the gain of that assembly

476
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,842
it is gm times the resistance that is here

477
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:19,823
and the gm of this transistor

478
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:22,514
is directly your IC0 in question

479
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:23,621
divided by UT.

480
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:26,558
So the variation of
that IC0 that you see there,

481
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,513
It varies in the order of magnitude

482
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:29,900
of the change in beta.

483
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,779
So, this is not a good choice.

484
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:33,439
It can go into a lab

485
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,277
because when you polarize
by a basic current,

486
00:19:36,477 --> 00:19:37,746
look how simple it is!

487
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:38,511
You will see,

488
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,623
the solution I am going to propose,

489
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:42,388
it would pose a little more problems

490
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:43,827
because we will have to insert

491
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:44,895
a resistance here

492
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:47,160
that will create other conflicts.

493
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,354
To say here a common transmitter

494
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,155
the transmitter is directly grounded

495
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:53,678
a resistor that comes to the base

496
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:55,651
and right away you have your gm

497
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:57,080
compared to that IC0

498
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,770
and you are gone to use it
as an amplifier directly.

499
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:03,387
I will now show you

500
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:06,101
the second solution,
or the third solution.

501
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:09,516
It is the polarization
by control of the emitter current.

502
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:11,085
So we're going

503
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:13,601
to try to apply this legislation.

504
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,801
It's that this current and that current

505
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:17,792
are the same.

506
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:21,330
Imposing a current in the transmitter

507
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,359
depends on that mesh

508
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,487
you see there.

509
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,217
It is the mesh that is there.

510
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:29,041
One has a mesh in tension,

511
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,164
one says this tension from there to there

512
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,338
equal to this one

513
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:33,474
plus this one.

514
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:35,923
If you write that like that,

515
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:39,797
and you choose your VB0 wisely

516
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:43,358
and you say
your VBE0 is of the order of Uj,

517
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:46,842
that's it, VE0,
it is automatically known.

518
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:48,141
That is what is noted there.

519
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:50,717
If this current,

520
00:20:50,917 --> 00:21:03,558
or rather writing
VB0 equal to Uj + IE0 x RE,

521
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:08,564
which is nothing but VE0,

522
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:09,585
it is good!

523
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:11,514
You only have to write it there,

524
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:13,062
and you make the approximation

525
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:14,387
that this base current

526
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:15,520
is negligible,

527
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,349
and at that moment

528
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:18,357
you have IC0 equal to I0,

529
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:20,386
equal to VE0 / RE

530
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:23,256
equal to VB0 - VBE0 / RE,

531
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:28,948
and you make this linear model by segment

532
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:31,052
to say that it is not exponential

533
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:32,914
finally, we can simplify it

534
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:38,520
by simply putting a curve IC, UBE

535
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,981
that comes to do something like this

536
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:42,601
instead of the exponential

537
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,621
and this is called Uj.

538
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:47,027
That allows us to make this approximation

539
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:48,927
which is quite valid in a mesh

540
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:51,653
if this voltage is not very, very low.

541
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:54,472
Here's the relationship:

542
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:56,722
your IE0 is set,

543
00:21:57,454 --> 00:22:00,361
it's called a feedback loop.

544
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:04,454
Let's analyze the definition
of feedback loop here.

545
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,332
It is written there actually,
what happens in this mesh

546
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:11,800
so your IE0,

547
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,276
it is proportional to VB0 - VBE0.

548
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:20,187
So if by chance, for a given reason,

549
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:22,762
your current IC0 increases,

550
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:25,990
if this current increases,

551
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,712
the voltage VE0 is nothing but

552
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,432
IC0 x RE.

553
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:33,548
Therefore VE0 = IC0 x RE.

554
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:34,950
So that tension

555
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,941
will increase.

556
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:39,625
If this tension is fixed,

557
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,332
if that is fixed,

558
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:43,966
then that tension increases

559
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:45,607
what happens with it?

560
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:46,647
It will decrease.

561
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:50,126
If the base-emitter voltage decreases,

562
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:52,956
you will lower IC0.

563
00:22:53,156 --> 00:22:54,858
Thus, we are acting

564
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:57,751
in feedback on the variation of IC0.

565
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:59,928
IC0 wanted to climb

566
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,173
it has pushed the voltage VE0 with,

567
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:04,811
it is fixed,

568
00:23:05,011 --> 00:23:06,843
their difference
between the two has dropped,

569
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:11,584
this loop will again regulate IC0,

570
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:13,347
to decrease it again

571
00:23:13,547 --> 00:23:15,498
and we speak of a feedback loop

572
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:17,337
because this relation puts us

573
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:24,248
the relation IC0 and U0
with respect to VBE0

574
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:26,154
with a sign (-) which is in front.

575
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,526
Let us take this relation which is here,

576
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:30,258
which we have just derived from there.

577
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:33,641
Let's look at the parameters
that depend on the temperature,

578
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:35,948
so derive delta IC0 on dT,

579
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,979
I would like to see how IC0
varies with temperature,

580
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:42,019
I want to derive this in relation to dT.

581
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,944
VB0 being independent of temperature,

582
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:48,071
it is a voltage source that is considered

583
00:23:48,271 --> 00:23:49,859
not to be temperature dependent.

584
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,956
So the derivative of VB0
on ​​dT is equal to 0.

585
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:58,405
The derivative of
the base-emitter junction

586
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,071
VBE0 depending on the temperature,

587
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:02,420
that's what I note here,

588
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,636
it is known,

589
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:06,502
it is equal to -2 mV per degree.

590
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:11,549
So I replace the dVB0 on ​​dT by -2 mV.

591
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:13,572
But since there is a sign (-) in front,

592
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:16,009
the derivative, it will give (+).

593
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:20,759
The resistance RE will stay here.

594
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,847
And it will give you something

595
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:26,196
that your component or current

596
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:27,350
it will vary

597
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,415
by 2 mV for each degree

598
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:33,690
but divided by the value of RE.

599
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,674
It means that this value of RE

600
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,808
that you will select yourself
to put in the transmitter

601
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:40,323
will divide this variation

602
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:41,661
and this is very important

603
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:43,951
because if you wished

604
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,408
to take a polarization current IC0,

605
00:24:46,608 --> 00:24:48,846
so you are looking for, you normalize

606
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:52,314
this variation from a given current IC0,

607
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:55,200
so you need to write IC0 here,

608
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,263
and you need to write IC0 there.

609
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:00,578
So I divided, divided, divided by IC0,

610
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:02,166
look what I find there.

611
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:03,927
IC0 x RE

612
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:08,141
IC0 x RE is VE0.

613
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,797
So that's VE0.

614
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,365
It is as if I am saying:

615
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:14,563
In an assembly like this,

616
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:18,117
when I add a resistance here
in the transmitter,

617
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:23,578
for a polarization current sought,
set by you,

618
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,461
the more you put a high resistance,

619
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:28,440
the more you increase VE0 with,

620
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,536
the less there is a variation effect
of your transistor itself.

621
00:25:33,736 --> 00:25:35,494
So the higher this voltage is,

622
00:25:36,924 --> 00:25:40,476
the effect of variation of 2 mV per degree

623
00:25:40,676 --> 00:25:41,947
will become divided

624
00:25:42,147 --> 00:25:44,500
by the voltage VE0 you impose

625
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,753
or, in other words,

626
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:48,886
by the RE resistance you chose yourself.

627
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:53,754
I repeat the same thing I just explained

628
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:56,023
but I will put numerical values.

629
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,219
So I rewrote a little more cleanly

630
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,682
what I just noted,

631
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:02,882
and I showed that these 2 mV

632
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:04,523
are all the time divided

633
00:26:04,723 --> 00:26:06,499
by the voltage VE0.

634
00:26:07,314 --> 00:26:08,718
So it is this tension,

635
00:26:08,918 --> 00:26:09,595
it is this one

636
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:10,582
less this one.

637
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:11,839
I noted it here.

638
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:13,784
And I put numerical values.

639
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:15,166
I simply took

640
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:18,927
VB0 equal to 4.7 V

641
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:21,035
and I wanted to see what is the effect

642
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:23,462
of this dIC0 on IC0

643
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:25,854
on the temperature dT,

644
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:27,477
the temperature variation,

645
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:33,114
and I found something
that varies from 0.05% per degree.

646
00:26:33,314 --> 00:26:34,157
So you see?

647
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:36,682
And that is a manageable value

648
00:26:36,882 --> 00:26:41,693
through RE x IC0

649
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:44,607
so your design parameter

650
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:46,013
is going to be this resistance

651
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:50,804
less, or rather more,

652
00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:53,269
the designer is trying

653
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:57,054
to make dIC0 on dT low,

654
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,001
he only has to increase

655
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,295
the voltage drop

656
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:01,487
of this VE0

657
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,261
and like that,

658
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:06,909
your effect of temperature
variation on IC0

659
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:09,433
will be more and more limited.

660
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,283
In fact, one can easily see here.

661
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:13,512
You have an exponential junction

662
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,695
and you have a linear law

663
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,839
and both see the same current.

664
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,291
The exponential junction sees
the current IC0

665
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:23,491
and the linear law sees the current IC0

666
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:24,971
once in a resistance

667
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:26,765
and once in the exponential law

668
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:28,364
and you are saying:

669
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,326
Make the linear law

670
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:32,158
wage on the exponential law

671
00:27:32,358 --> 00:27:33,597
and like that, you gain

672
00:27:33,797 --> 00:27:36,290
in terms of temperature regulation.

673
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,490
I would like to finish

674
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,389
this first part

675
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:43,529
of this week

676
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,955
with a summary on polarization.

677
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:47,233
So we have analyzed

678
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,121
the 3 techniques of polarization

679
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:51,143
and we have just discarded one

680
00:27:51,343 --> 00:27:52,451
that is never used,

681
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:55,106
it's to fix a voltage VBE

682
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,002
in the transistor in DC voltage

683
00:27:58,202 --> 00:28:00,324
and say: we would get with it

684
00:28:00,524 --> 00:28:02,189
a continuous current fixed.

685
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:06,393
It was eliminated because of
the phenomenon of thermal runaway

686
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:09,097
and especially in the control
of an exponential law

687
00:28:09,297 --> 00:28:10,538
also by a tension,

688
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:11,919
very, very difficult to fix.

689
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,519
We used the second one,

690
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:16,188
which involves
the beta of the transistor, also

691
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:18,405
to say, in the laboratory, go do it,

692
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:21,415
but you will have great difficulty
in using this

693
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:23,706
for manufacture in large quantities

694
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:26,307
of electronic circuits
based on a polarization

695
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:28,884
basing everything
on the beta of the transistor.

696
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,003
And we ended

697
00:28:30,203 --> 00:28:32,833
by adding an additional component

698
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,141
in the transmitter

699
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:36,625
and say: thanks to a resistance,

700
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:39,361
inserted in the emitter
in the bipolar transistor,

701
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:46,007
we can find a fixed current IE0

702
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:48,306
and if the transistor is of low power,

703
00:28:48,506 --> 00:28:51,111
it is as if we are saying: we fixed IC0

704
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:53,740
and it is going to be this assembly

705
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,633
that will be used for the following

706
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:56,794
and we'll see

707
00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:58,540
how to now

708
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,067
generate all the components

709
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:03,252
around this transistor and polarize it

710
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:04,789
with passive components

711
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:06,184
that we will add around.
