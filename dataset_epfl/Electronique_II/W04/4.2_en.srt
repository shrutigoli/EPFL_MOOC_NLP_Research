1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,825
As soon as we learned

2
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:09,322
how to polarize a transistor

3
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:10,417
and we have seen that
it will be necessary

4
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:12,601
to apply a fixed voltage to its base,

5
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:15,041
to impose a current

6
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,489
in its transmitter,

7
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:17,929
in this part,

8
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,319
we will learn how
to realize this circuit.

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:21,933
That is to say, we are going to approach

10
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:23,956
the realization of a fixed voltage

11
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:26,039
to impose on the base of a transistor.

12
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:27,622
You will see, it is extremely simple.

13
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:29,949
Once we have finished with this part,

14
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:31,386
we will go immediately

15
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:34,152
to the use of the polarized transistor.

16
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:36,537
And you'll see, it's the same

17
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:39,219
thing that we will call suddenly
"power source".

18
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:41,949
Because it is enough
to look at it from its collector

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,261
and we will see that there is

20
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:44,471
a fixed current that comes out

21
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:46,518
or which is absorbed by the collector,

22
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:48,026
and we will use it

23
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:49,080
as a current source.

24
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:52,761
Once we have finished with
the demonstration

25
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:54,059
that a transistor seen

26
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,108
from the collector

27
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:58,113
and wich is polarized with the
resistance, we will see immediately,

28
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:00,153
brings us to a current source,

29
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:01,733
we will immediately address

30
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,534
the integration of the same circuit,

31
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,452
which has been realized by
passive components

32
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:09,904
with discrete components,

33
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,077
and we want to pass

34
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:12,143
on an integrated circuit.

35
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:14,159
So we would like to implement

36
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:15,719
on a silicon chip,

37
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:17,542
what we call an integrated circuit,

38
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:20,720
and demonstrate that it
would become much simpler.

39
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,698
And we remove many of

40
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,226
these passive components,

41
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:25,407
and we'll count

42
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:26,686
on the transistor itself

43
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,372
and realize cells

44
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:30,278
we'll see at the end of this video,

45
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:32,171
to make current sources.

46
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:36,909
Let us consider the pattern
that we saw earlier,

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,187
so this famous transistor:

48
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,570
to polarize and impose a IC0 current,

49
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:41,660
we had said that we will impose

50
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:42,789
a VB0 voltage.

51
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:45,122
Imposing a voltage VB0

52
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:47,135
on a node of a transistor

53
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:51,226
by having a stabilized power supply

54
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:51,984
available.

55
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,180
So it always gives us

56
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,645
what are called power rails

57
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:57,318
and we will put

58
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,460
a resistive divider

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,715
which is made by the resistors R1 and R2

60
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:02,371
to lower this voltage

61
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:04,020
and bring it to a potential VB0

62
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,043
of our choice.

63
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,619
Because that's how we had seen

64
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:09,549
that the objective is to impose VB0;

65
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:11,135
we used the transistor

66
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:13,121
which will cause this voltage to fall

67
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:15,309
of the order of magnitude of
a junction voltage,

68
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:17,769
and the VE0 voltage that remains to us

69
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:19,311
allows us to impose IE0.

70
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:20,982
I would like to take

71
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:24,783
the source of VCC voltage which is there,

72
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:26,005
so that is here,

73
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,205
I draw my VCC source,

74
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,445
and I'll put a resistive divider

75
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:34,561
which will be realized by the resistor R1

76
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,738
and resistor R2

77
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:39,519
and remind that this kind of circuit

78
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:44,070
will, empty, give me a voltage there.

79
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,707
And that tension, it's proportional

80
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:50,266
if I talk about voltage V ...

81
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:51,870
and I'll call it VB0,

82
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:54,007
you see, because it will be
the same as this,

83
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,692
so I'll write VB0

84
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,673
in this circuit

85
00:02:57,773 --> 00:03:01,125
equal to ... this, that's VCC

86
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:05,136
equal to VCC which multiplies R2

87
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:07,018
and which is divided by the sum of the 2,

88
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:08,443
R1 + R2.

89
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:10,918
And here, I have a voltage

90
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:12,636
which is always lower than VCC

91
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:13,403
and depends

92
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,211
on the resistance report that I've chosen,

93
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,607
it's something you propably know

94
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:17,912
very, very well.

95
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:20,526
But this is valid only

96
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,653
when the current I pull from there,

97
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:24,130
that current I

98
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,522
that I will write B0 of course

99
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,193
because it will be this current one;

100
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:30,886
This current IB0 must absolutely

101
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:32,073
be equal to 0.

102
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:33,710
I can write this

103
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,892
and put the equality

104
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:36,208
and all this is correct.

105
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:38,158
But is it, really,

106
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,940
when I realize a resistive divider here,

107
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,703
I take it and I connect in this node one,

108
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:45,643
this IB0 current is equal to 0?

109
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:46,608
Absolutely not,

110
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,163
because here there is a current IB0.

111
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:49,954
So this circuit there,

112
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,154
if I use it as it is without thinking,

113
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:55,221
it will not allow me

114
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57,048
to impose a fixed voltage.

115
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:59,504
So we learned that

116
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,734
to be able to impose a current

117
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:02,830
in a resistive divider,

118
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,884
you know

119
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:05,230
that the current that would pass there,

120
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:06,697
this current,

121
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:10,163
if the current IB0 is equal to 0

122
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:11,282
it continues its way,

123
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:12,297
it comes down here.

124
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:14,956
Now, if by chance you pull

125
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:17,643
a certain amount of current IB0,

126
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:18,521
you will see,

127
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:20,684
you will drop the voltage

128
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:22,993
across your resistor R2

129
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:26,423
simply because a part of this
current is gone.

130
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,755
You can very, very well

131
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:30,329
make this circuit and say:

132
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,606
What happen if the current

133
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,012
I impose there,

134
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:35,862
this current I'll call I,

135
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:38,017
is much larger

136
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:40,355
that the current IB0?

137
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:42,344
If you put that condition

138
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,136
and you say: I have much more

139
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:46,409
current here than this

140
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:49,044
the very small portion of current

141
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:51,590
that goes into IB0 will never

142
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,397
drop that voltage or disrupt it,

143
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:57,427
or if it disrupts it,

144
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:59,030
it will disrupt it weakly.

145
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:00,717
So in other words

146
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:02,572
if you put that condition,

147
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,553
so if you impose here a current

148
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:07,091
called I,

149
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:10,894
which is much larger than the current IB0,

150
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,243
you manage to impose here

151
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,813
a potential that is nearly constant.

152
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:18,304
And that's what will be applied

153
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:20,353
to achieve polarization

154
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,820
with a resistive divider.

155
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:23,257
So we agree that this is not

156
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,506
an ideal voltage source.

157
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:26,102
This is a source of voltage

158
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:27,636
which depends on this current IB0.

159
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:30,402
Here, I give you conditions:

160
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,238
if you arrange to put here

161
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:34,966
a current which is an order of magnitude

162
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:37,062
10 times greater than this,

163
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:39,121
or more than 10 times,

164
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,986
well you disrupt a little

165
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:42,469
the potential VB0.

166
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:43,816
And then you will tell me:

167
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:47,048
so why not put all the
time a current 100 times

168
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:49,190
or 1000 times greater than B0?

169
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,568
Be very careful:

170
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:51,932
the current which passes

171
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:53,644
in these two resistances,

172
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:55,247
it's a lost current,

173
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:56,907
it's a current of polarization.

174
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:58,841
This current one is effective,

175
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,383
it is the current that allows us

176
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,203
to calculate the small signal parameters,

177
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:04,681
and this, it has absolutely no

178
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,040
impact on this,

179
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,971
it is simply to avoid

180
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:10,341
that this potential VB0 does not match

181
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:11,618
to that which would have been calculated

182
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,071
by that relation.

183
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:15,059
If you write this relationship,

184
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,380
you get VB0

185
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,242
but you've considered the fact

186
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:19,811
that IB0 does not exist.

187
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:21,933
And if this IB0 exists,

188
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,074
it means that you have set

189
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:25,472
a higher current.

190
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:27,542
But in reality, the current,

191
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:29,506
is a current that is lost,

192
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,923
and that is why we are content

193
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:33,920
to move from the order of magnitude

194
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,416
of a ratio 10 between this and this.

195
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:37,800
In the worst case,

196
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,789
if you take this current equal
to this current,

197
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:42,393
it means that it is the β of
your transistor

198
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:43,644
that connects the two,

199
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,450
so it is as if you were saying

200
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:48,767
I have β times more current than there

201
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:51,558
thus β is equal to 100, 200, 300,

202
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:52,789
depending on the type of transistor

203
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:53,740
you have chosen.

204
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:56,940
And at that time, your potential VB0

205
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,264
is not impacted by this.

206
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,816
I intend to take this same scheme

207
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,529
and I now intend to go

208
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:08,429
to comment a little more what will happen

209
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,648
with my resistive divider

210
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:12,607
by replacing it with a voltage source

211
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:15,381
such as I presented here,

212
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:16,409
before clearing.

213
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:18,398
And here it is.

214
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:20,602
So I just extract

215
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:21,685
my 2 resistors,

216
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,516
I brought my voltage source VCC

217
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,198
and I put my 2 resistors

218
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:27,642
as we saw earlier

219
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:31,034
just prior to this slide,

220
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:33,237
and you will see that the tension there,

221
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:34,556
this is the one I have just written.

222
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:36,502
And I left a little bit

223
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:37,425
of 2 resistors

224
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,492
to see that they are the same
that I moved here.

225
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,309
Now it has been said that this current

226
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,349
which will pass here is indeed

227
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:45,689
the current that will be our current IB0

228
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:47,684
and that we will calculate

229
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:49,870
taking into account that

230
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,197
the voltage source
we just realized,

231
00:07:52,397 --> 00:07:54,457
and in reality that VB0,

232
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:56,939
these are the dividers

233
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,155
with resistors

234
00:07:58,205 --> 00:07:59,929
that you've chosen yourselves,

235
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:03,383
with the values ​​for R1 and R2,

236
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,717
by applying that VB0 is equal to

237
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,718
the tension that would have
been calculated.

238
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:10,576
But the factor 10 that
I just mentioned,

239
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:11,567
it's here.

240
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:15,040
So it is arranged that at least

241
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,377
we have 10 times more of current

242
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:18,743
which passing in that branch

243
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:20,948
compared to this current IB0.

244
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:24,303
But if you take this tension

245
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:27,030
we see, VB0 with that source,

246
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,097
you know very, very well that

247
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,545
if you look at the resistance from there,

248
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:33,786
the source's resistor,

249
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,870
with a voltage source

250
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:38,652
realized with two resistors

251
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,199
as a resistive divider,

252
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,144
it is as if you did

253
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:44,274
an ideal voltage source

254
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:47,629
whose value is this, the VB0.

255
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,194
So empty, if I do not plug that,

256
00:08:50,494 --> 00:08:51,729
I have seen this tension.

257
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:53,678
And the internal resistance

258
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:55,772
of your source will be

259
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:57,959
the implementation in
parallel connection of R1

260
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,101
parallel with R2.

261
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,538
Therefore R1 parallel with R2

262
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:04,629
will give us the equivalent resistance,

263
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:05,737
view from here

264
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:07,189
from an ideal source

265
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:09,653
whose value is VB0

266
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:13,217
and whose output resistance,

267
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,235
or the source resistance,

268
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:16,164
will be R1 parallel with R2.

269
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:18,743
So if I want to take this scheme there

270
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,044
and put it here

271
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,904
by removing the two resistors R1 and R2,

272
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,578
I'll get this.

273
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:28,013
this is my schema now

274
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:31,772
with my empty voltage source

275
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:35,253
And the paralleling of the two resistors,

276
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,323
and this circuit which is there matches

277
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:39,389
actually

278
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,896
something quite correct.

279
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:45,079
Now, considering my current IB0,

280
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,121
by putting it in the ideal source,

281
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,587
putting it in this ideal values

282
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,209
of resistances that I have chosen

283
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:52,437
to impose the current
passing through

284
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:54,268
the resistive divider,

285
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,324
and I shall have put an
equivalent resistance

286
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,419
which is equal to R1 parallel with R2,

287
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,283
I can calculate exactly,

288
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,216
the current, or rather voltage

289
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,300
that I will see on the basis

290
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,343
of this transistor.

291
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,785
Or, in other words,

292
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,781
in this mesh which is here,

293
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:10,854
so the one which is there,

294
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:12,877
I have to consider

295
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:14,551
a voltage drop here

296
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:18,536
which is equal to IB0 multiplied by RB

297
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:21,098
and this IB0 x RB will give me

298
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:22,344
the drop voltage here,

299
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:25,217
that I have to subtract

300
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:27,078
from the empty voltage

301
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,127
to be able to really calculate

302
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:30,315
the tension VE0.

303
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,258
And as I know that the current,

304
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:37,639
the link between IC0 and
IB0 passes through the relation

305
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:41,668
IC0 β = x IB0,

306
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:43,707
well I'll find easily

307
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,972
the exact expression of IC0

308
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,767
which takes account of the resistances

309
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,374
that I added myself

310
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:54,199
to realize this voltage division.

311
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:55,522
And you will see that

312
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,542
compared to what we had seen before,

313
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,249
if I hide this part,

314
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:01,339
you find the original expression

315
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,558
that brings the current IC0

316
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,591
without the effect of this resistor RB

317
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:07,209
because we have calculated,

318
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:11,028
we considered qu'IB0 is 0,

319
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,349
it is as if we had said β = ∞.

320
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,487
If you put β = ∞,

321
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:18,834
this term will disappear,

322
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:20,490
and you will find the IC0

323
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,012
that we had calculated before.

324
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:23,242
If β is finite,

325
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,869
and if the resistor RB

326
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:25,935
you have added

327
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:27,841
is a finite value resistance,

328
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,459
if you write this equation that

329
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,294
we have extracted from the mesh,

330
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:34,898
you fall on the exact expression

331
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,277
of your current IC0

332
00:11:36,477 --> 00:11:38,090
in fonction of β and RB.

333
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,237
so, in practice,

334
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:44,015
if I can impose a
current here rather high

335
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:45,779
compared to IB0,

336
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,373
I can erase it;

337
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,120
it's like I was saying

338
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:56,969
the RB is much larger than β x RE.

339
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:58,523
So if that's the case ...

340
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,545
sorry, excuse me, I said wrong.

341
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,915
It's like I was saying:

342
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:08,514
the RB / β is much smaller than RE,

343
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:12,994
RB is so much smaller than β x RE.

344
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:13,867
And we fall down

345
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,595
on the approximation before.

346
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,168
The exact expression

347
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:20,816
and the expression taking
account of the simplification

348
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:22,542
depend on your choice

349
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,312
of resistors R1 and R2,

350
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,255
and the β of your transistor.

351
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:31,747
I would like to summarize here,

352
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:32,925
on what we see there,

353
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:35,368
the history of polarization.

354
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,935
We used a resistive divider,

355
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,231
we've calculate the current IC0

356
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,626
taking account of a resistance

357
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,291
which is the paralleling of the 2

358
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:45,798
if we want to be exact,

359
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:48,520
and it has been found that the VB0,

360
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,852
if actually the current here is very large,

361
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:52,427
is equal to this expression.

362
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,725
And this brings us to the idea

363
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:56,686
that we're trying to apply:

364
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:59,501
how to make a current source

365
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:03,218
where this current IC0
is equal to a constant

366
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,107
independently
of the variation

367
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,095
of the temperature

368
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:10,471
which is due to our component,

369
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:12,208
the bipolar transistor.

370
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:13,381
We had seen that

371
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:14,708
this current will be affected

372
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:16,328
the temperature drift,

373
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:17,774
or the shift in temperature,

374
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:19,227
or the variation in temperature

375
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:21,442
of this ΔIC0

376
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,723
fonction of the voltage UBE0

377
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:26,570
which is 2 mV/°C,

378
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:28,458
and this depends

379
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:29,580
of the voltage drop

380
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,053
you put on RE x IC0,

381
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:35,143
so this is the VE0.

382
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:36,476
And there, we saw that

383
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:38,296
more we increase this tension,

384
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:40,569
this voltage increases,

385
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:43,990
that law of 2 mV

386
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,721
which is specific to silicon

387
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:48,776
will be divided by what we have chosen,

388
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:50,204
so this is our conception

389
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:53,187
that will make steady

390
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:55,654
the variation of this current

391
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:57,137
depending on the temperature.

392
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,847
So we are in the considerations

393
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,409
of circuit design.

394
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:04,120
And it is up to the designer
to take those kinds of decisions.

395
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,054
And now, I summarized this.

396
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:09,137
So, looking at that,

397
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:12,360
I finally did what with it?

398
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,272
I applied a current IC0= 1mA.

399
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:18,421
So this current does not vary

400
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:21,388
even if I vary this voltage.

401
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,303
You remember that he was saying:

402
00:14:23,503 --> 00:14:25,608
UCE, when it varies,

403
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:26,448
there is the Early effect

404
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:29,772
and it impacts on my current IC0

405
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:33,163
who, when the CPU voltage increases,

406
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:36,242
we will see that IC will increase with

407
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,185
a slope that is linked to this Early voltage.

408
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,734
In practice, when we use our transistor,

409
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:43,762
we connect a load here.

410
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:45,529
So we will have a resistance

411
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,229
who would come there.

412
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:48,362
If your resistance is variable,

413
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:50,615
it means that
that resistance changes in time,

414
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:52,724
or it changes depending of

415
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,971
a variation of something;

416
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,491
so that voltage rises up

417
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:57,716
or goes down;

418
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:00,221
even when we are in DC

419
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,442
so we have a DC voltage,

420
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,271
the variation of this voltage,

421
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,879
look at this voltage,

422
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:07,579
we did everything to make it constant.

423
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:09,073
And we did it in the mesh,

424
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:10,532
therefore in this mesh

425
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:12,058
this voltage minus this voltage

426
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,510
give me this one constant.

427
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:15,469
The one where I move my fingers,

428
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:18,671
she will hit the VE0 tension.

429
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,193
So when I increase that resistance

430
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:22,680
I see rather ...

431
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,664
[stammering]

432
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:26,815
I increase my current IC0 which is there,

433
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:29,940
it will increase the voltage
across that resistance.

434
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:31,162
look at my 2 fingers

435
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:32,985
or rather my finger,
from here, it will go down

436
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:35,207
and it goes down until
it touches the other.

437
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:36,550
And when he touches the other,

438
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:38,771
it's like I was saying: UCE = 0.

439
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,736
When this voltage then
is equal to that tension,

440
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:46,772
my transistor is no
longer a source of current.

441
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:48,077
So I can not longer talk about

442
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,535
polarization and an imposition
of a constant current.

443
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:53,863
So I cant use this assembly.

444
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,130
What I would like say around this,

445
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,288
I will erase what I have just added;

446
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,549
I would like to come back

447
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:02,451
to this idea:

448
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:04,543
I would like to realize a current source.

449
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,332
So here a constant current

450
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:13,335
which supports any
voltage variation here

451
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:15,450
until the saturation of course,

452
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:18,467
while having lost

453
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:22,416
this range of 0 to VCC

454
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,330
a part for VE0.

455
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:25,944
So remember that at the beginning,

456
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:28,091
if you put the transmitter to ground

457
00:16:28,391 --> 00:16:29,965
the VE0 did not exist.

458
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:33,031
And this voltage VE0,

459
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:35,635
we just add for this
to obtain ths relation.

460
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:38,956
So we have a stable current source

461
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:40,264
but we still lost

462
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:42,095
somewhere this VE0.

463
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,491
And I would like to have a circuit

464
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:47,255
which behaves as a current source

465
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:48,740
having lost this,

466
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,481
and see what I can do with

467
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:53,629
when I vary my tension that comes here,

468
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:56,607
and say that I have done a current source

469
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:57,785
that will help me later

470
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,108
to polarize by running a lot of things

471
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:01,244
and that will allow me

472
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:03,670
from the lesson of next week

473
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,474
to understand that there

474
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:08,029
the IC0 current it goes,

475
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:09,512
or that kind of assembly will

476
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,379
allow me to use a fixed current source

477
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,507
that will give me infinite resistance

478
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:16,485
and then I will call "active load"

479
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:18,036
but we'll see next week.

480
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:20,001
So we just saw  the polarization.

481
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,217
Now I will take this bias

482
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:23,911
and see it little differently.

483
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:26,351
If the current is fixed

484
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:31,698
and stable relative to the temperature,

485
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:34,193
Look, this is a symbol
of a current source.

486
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:35,872
A current source,

487
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,451
What we would like
to have in parallel with it?

488
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:40,175
We know that it has a fault

489
00:17:40,777 --> 00:17:41,911
which is due to resistance

490
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:44,009
wich comes to parallel,

491
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:45,991
that if this resistance does not exist

492
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:48,171
and I can create

493
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:49,609
a short-circuit at the output,

494
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,297
my short-circuit current is equal,

495
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:54,300
so if the UCE is équals to 0.

496
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:56,466
And if I take it and I said:

497
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,044
that's the equivalent of a UCE,

498
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,425
if it had been a transistor,

499
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,347
I can bypass my transistor.

500
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,950
If there had not been this resistance,

501
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,876
I would have all the current going
through my source here

502
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:07,290
and it would be amazing.

503
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:09,049
we just dispel the idea

504
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:11,158
that we can not short-circuited
a transistor

505
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,302
between collector and
emitter because of saturation.

506
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:14,915
Independently of that,

507
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:19,396
if there is a resistor
in parallel with a current source,

508
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:21,979
the current IL which starts here

509
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,700
will suffer a current

510
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,870
which, when the output voltage changes,

511
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:32,218
so that tension is IL x RL,

512
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:35,224
when that IL x RL changes,

513
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,257
the tension here will change.

514
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:40,030
Therefore the current flowing
through this resistance also.

515
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:42,337
Therefore in fonction of this voltage,

516
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:44,855
I run the risk of losing a proportion

517
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:45,706
that passes within

518
00:18:45,906 --> 00:18:47,446
my current IS,

519
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:49,817
that I would have liked IS = IL.

520
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:52,080
So this resistance should be infinite,

521
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,766
it does not exist, it disappears,

522
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:56,348
or the highest possible.

523
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,416
So when I look at this current source

524
00:18:58,454 --> 00:18:59,629
and I ask myself:

525
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:02,285
if I want to use this analogy,

526
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:04,333
that is equivalent to that,

527
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,099
which is true,

528
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,876
What is the value of  RS?

529
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:09,813
So here I have a fixed current,

530
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,145
that, it will be the IS,

531
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,766
but then, it suffers from
an output resistor.

532
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:14,740
What is its value?

533
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:16,703
If it were not for RE,

534
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,209
I know very well, it's 1 / GCE.

535
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:21,526
But now we added RE.

536
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,451
Is this resistance has deteriorated

537
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:24,573
or improved?

538
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:30,355
The answer: R OUT resistance
was perfectly improved.

539
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,257
on the contrary.

540
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:34,457
the fact of using this circuit like this

541
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:35,429
putting RE

542
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,969
will allow me to get a resistance R OUT

543
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,337
which will be high.

544
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:41,665
And it will be the circuit
that we will use

545
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:43,125
to make current sources.

546
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,581
Here is my montage

547
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:46,999
and here is what I want to do,

548
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,953
this is what we had studied before

549
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:51,774
to calculate what the output resistance.

550
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:53,162
So I take this scheme there,

551
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,061
I replace it with the equivalent

552
00:19:56,442 --> 00:20:00,357
saying these two resistors
R1 parallel with R2

553
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:03,882
created me a resistance RB in the base.

554
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:06,465
I added a RE resistance myself.

555
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:08,395
So what is the impedance

556
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:11,615
Ithat I look from
the collector of a transistor

557
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:14,586
having a resistance RB in the base

558
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:16,166
and RE in the transmitter?

559
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,358
I send you the chapter
where we studied it.

560
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,514
But if I take into account
an additional consideration

561
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:24,416
and I say: this resistance RB

562
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:29,371
compared to β x RE

563
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:31,792
so I can no longer speak,

564
00:20:31,992 --> 00:20:34,781
I can consider that RB is almost 0,

565
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:37,211
that is to say
the current IB0 is very, very low,

566
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:39,577
and resistors R1 and R2

567
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:43,695
who are here and are placed in
parallel with the source

568
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,480
do not affect me much

569
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:49,680
in the voltage VB0,

570
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,924
it is as if this potential was not moving

571
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,366
So this resistance R1 parallèle with R2

572
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:55,929
becomes equal to 0.

573
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,935
Well, I came across this approximation

574
00:20:58,035 --> 00:20:59,547
that we calculated in length and breadth

575
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,567
there are some lessons before,

576
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:03,401
and we was found the following things:

577
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:05,785
R OUT = 1 / GCE,

578
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,533
and the numerator is 1 + x RE GM,

579
00:21:10,155 --> 00:21:12,859
and the denominator is 1 + x GBE RE.

580
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:21,499
If I consider GBE x RE >> 1;

581
00:21:22,307 --> 00:21:23,240
In other words,

582
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:26,440
GBE depends on IC0

583
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,408
as GM, so, depends on IC0;

584
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:33,001
but I put a sufficiently large
ER resistance in there,

585
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:35,945
that the product of the
resistance I added myself

586
00:21:36,537 --> 00:21:40,149
multiplied by the GBE that
I got by the polarization

587
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:41,706
is much greater than 1.

588
00:21:42,617 --> 00:21:43,477
So if that is the case,

589
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,021
I can say: the 1,

590
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:49,461
it is almost negligible compared
with that GBE x RE.

591
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:50,664
So in this case,

592
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:52,695
there it is sure that it is negligible,

593
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,011
since I am allowed to neglect here

594
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,003
I must surely neglect here

595
00:21:57,103 --> 00:22:00,338
because GM is β x GBE.

596
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:01,885
So that's much larger

597
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:04,501
so I can also overlook this.

598
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:08,571
And I'll find myself with
(GM x RE) / (GBExRE)

599
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:11,634
so I simplifie RE and RE,

600
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:15,044
I find GM / GBE which is
nothing other than β.

601
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:17,700
So GM / GBE β =

602
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,499
and I had the 1 / GCE:

603
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:21,575
I find that the output resistance

604
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,002
is β x 1 / GCE.

605
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,324
I remind you that a simple transistor,

606
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,410
if you plug your transistor

607
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:32,608
and the transmitter, you will
put it to ground in AC,

608
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,984
that's 1 / GCE

609
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:38,973
to Having added a resistance
in the transmitter,

610
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:41,428
you will find yourself to β / GCE

611
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,618
to having imposed a fixed
voltage on the base.

612
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:47,037
So we are β times greater

613
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:49,411
than what would have been
obtained with a single transistor.

614
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:51,396
Extremely interesting to do that.

615
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:53,038
So here I find myself,

616
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:56,338
compared to a simple polarized transistor:

617
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,516
RS would have been 1 / GCE,

618
00:22:59,716 --> 00:23:01,359
and in the calculations that we've made

619
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,179
It shows us according
to the tension of Early

620
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,141
and the current that was put in there

621
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,245
that we tend towards something

622
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:09,940
of about ten kΩ

623
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,323
And here I found:

624
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:13,268
it's β times,

625
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:16,513
so you'll boost and increase

626
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:17,715
your output impedance

627
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,936
or output resistance

628
00:23:18,974 --> 00:23:20,791
by a β factor of your transistor

629
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,154
thanks to that resistance.

630
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:24,851
So it's very interesting

631
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:28,336
and we have just completed an equivalence

632
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:33,429
With an RS of the order
of magnitude of β / GCE

633
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,912
of a transistor having a polarization IC0

634
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:38,332
and a given Early voltage.

635
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:41,369
Some few words about

636
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:45,075
an improved thermal stability.

637
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,613
This resistance was added

638
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:50,558
and I just made you a
proposal with this scheme.

639
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,758
And this scheme, I took a transistor

640
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:55,947
and I said, I will use the same as this.

641
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:57,981
So I have 1 transistor, 2, 3,

642
00:23:58,031 --> 00:23:59,384
which are exactly the same.

643
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:01,274
Know that this,

644
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:04,477
we find them when we integrate the 3 sets

645
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,170
on the same chip of silicon,

646
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,700
and then on the same chip,

647
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,774
we choose the same
component repeated 3 times,

648
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:14,454
and we has rules that
are called rules of matching,

649
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,556
or pairing in French

650
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:19,921
that is to say, it is ensured
that the 3 components are similar

651
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:21,827
during the production,

652
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,902
manufactured by the same
manufacturing process

653
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:25,716
at the same time,

654
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,847
So many similarities

655
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:29,104
between the 3 components.

656
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:32,358
And if you take a component like this,
a transistor,

657
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:41,197
and you short the base-collector junction,
And you short-circuit the junction
of Base-collector, you are canceling
The transistor effect..........

658
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,746
you are canceling
the transistor effect..........

659
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:45,125
The transistor has disappeared.

660
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:47,837
You just keep a base-emitter junction.

661
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:49,629
And why was that?

662
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,170
It becomes like a diode,

663
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,839
it's really the same with that.

664
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:57,849
That is to say, if you take the component

665
00:24:57,949 --> 00:24:59,258
and you repeat 3 times,

666
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:03,155
the rules of similarity between
the three will be respected

667
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:05,714
taking a transistor and modifying,

668
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:07,754
by transforming into a diode,

669
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:10,954
and it is called a "diode-connected transistor"

670
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:14,203
where the base-collector junction
has been completely eliminated

671
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:15,121
by a short circuit.

672
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:17,887
And we will remain a
base-emitter junction.

673
00:25:18,087 --> 00:25:20,531
So this transistor,
the voltage UCE

674
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:23,150
is equal to UBE all the time

675
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,901
and it is a junction voltage.

676
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:28,255
So it is a voltage of
the order of magnitude of UJ.

677
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:29,964
And it's the same

678
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:31,659
because there is a
short circuit between the two.

679
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,722
There is no more transistor,
there is now a diode.

680
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,918
I'll take this kind of scheme,

681
00:25:36,093 --> 00:25:37,059
I will remember you this

682
00:25:37,097 --> 00:25:38,740
because we will use it very,
very soon,

683
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:40,929
and I'll take it

684
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:42,736
and do a little calculation around.

685
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:45,511
I'll be interested in the tension
I see here

686
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,900
and I'll call the voltage VB.

687
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:52,990
And I will write it in consideration
of this resistive divider

688
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:53,832
that we maintained.

689
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:57,013
So I took a same resistance
to both sides

690
00:25:57,396 --> 00:25:59,734
and I put here two diodes in series,

691
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,223
so I'll draw this part

692
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:04,179
and I'll call this voltage VB

693
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,450
and I will write that the voltage source

694
00:26:08,488 --> 00:26:09,125
I see there,

695
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:12,586
it will have a resistance R,

696
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:14,596
a diode,

697
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,602
in series with a second diode,

698
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:20,318
in series with a third resistance

699
00:26:20,418 --> 00:26:21,620
or a second resistance

700
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,881
having the same value with this one,

701
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:27,659
and I'll call this tension then VB or VB0,

702
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:29,432
it's like you want.

703
00:26:30,928 --> 00:26:35,748
And these 2 diodes will find
themselves traveled by a current

704
00:26:35,948 --> 00:26:39,376
therefore they will display
a voltage from here to there

705
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,984
2 x VBE

706
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,424
and this tension there,

707
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:46,725
it is of the order of magnitude of VBE.

708
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:50,261
If you consider

709
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:54,588
that this current is then the same
order of magnitude as this,

710
00:26:55,108 --> 00:26:59,048
so this VBE, this VBE and
VBE are really certified copies,

711
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,086
you have a transistor
traveled by a current

712
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:03,915
which is the same that you imposed here,

713
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:07,620
and there, you'll have 2 x VBE.

714
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:09,265
If you take it,

715
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:12,263
and you look at what is
the voltage VB that appears,

716
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:13,579
you can apply

717
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:15,909
the principle of superposition
for example,

718
00:27:16,293 --> 00:27:20,508
like, you say: I have VCC

719
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:25,528
you say: I canceled VCC and look
at the effect of 2 VBE

720
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,595
on the tension that I see here,

721
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:29,834
wich is will be the voltage VB,

722
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,079
it gives me a superposition

723
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,684
with the fact that
I cancel these 2 voltages

724
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:38,512
and I look on the same voltage VCC

725
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:39,392
and I add the 2,

726
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:42,205
and I will find what is the potential VB.

727
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:42,946
I'll write it.

728
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:45,307
So if you want to write VB

729
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:52,338
which is the effect
of cancellation of this source,

730
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:55,757
this is when I short-circuit these 2 diodes,

731
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,312
and I look at the power I see here

732
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:00,801
and it is as if I had strength
and resistance

733
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:02,451
and a voltage VCC,

734
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:03,472
it will give me:

735
00:28:03,672 --> 00:28:05,310
VCC / 2.

736
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:08,990
Now I cancels the voltage VCC

737
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:11,847
and I look 2 VB...

738
00:28:12,652 --> 00:28:13,994
Sorry, I forgot the E here

739
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,127
2 VBE here

740
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:18,540
this tension that I see here

741
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,059
which in this case VB,

742
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:23,271
and I find that
this is equal to

743
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:25,701
2 VBE

744
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,372
multiplied by the resistive divider

745
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:29,920
realized by the two resistors,

746
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,146
and as it is the same value,

747
00:28:32,246 --> 00:28:33,557
this gives me 1/2

748
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:36,262
and it will give me + VBE.

749
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,384
So this voltage VB,

750
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,872
I look at it according to that

751
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:42,931
and I write it here.

752
00:28:43,592 --> 00:28:46,143
This same tension,
I look to that side

753
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:47,537
as calling it VE.

754
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:49,533
I say: This same tension

755
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:55,502
is equal to VBE + VE

756
00:28:55,702 --> 00:29:01,166
Indeed, this voltage is equal to VBE + VE,

757
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,814
and VE it is from here to there.

758
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,334
This voltage VE.

759
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,697
So I have VCC/2 + VBE which is equal

760
00:29:07,897 --> 00:29:09,772
on that side, on the other side,

761
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:11,577
equal to VBE + VE.

762
00:29:11,777 --> 00:29:15,684
So I have VBE and VBE that will disappear

763
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:21,082
and I have the voltage VE who's
only equal to VCC/2.

764
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,406
It's amazing!

765
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:26,053
That is to say: the fact
of having added 2 junctions

766
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,539
made by diode-connected transistors

767
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:30,691
or by simple diodes,

768
00:29:31,297 --> 00:29:33,623
I eliminated the effect of VBE

769
00:29:33,823 --> 00:29:37,007
and this modification of temperature

770
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:40,022
which impacts on the current,

771
00:29:40,222 --> 00:29:43,467
I've completely canceled
by that phenomenon

772
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:45,422
and I realized a
current source

773
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:48,966
practically independent
of the temperature

774
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,870
in having no effect of VBE,

775
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,396
provided that I do this

776
00:29:53,596 --> 00:29:55,416
in an integrated technology.

777
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:58,459
So a little cleaner
than what I just wrote,

778
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,694
I'll just comment

779
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,472
very quickly on this.

780
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,745
This is strictly drawn,

781
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:08,916
and that is the same relationships

782
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:12,927
I wrote on VE depending on that side,

783
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:15,400
and VE depending on that side,

784
00:30:15,682 --> 00:30:17,703
that gives me that relation.

785
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,609
So I equalize VE and VE

786
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:23,809
and I actually fall on a voltage VB

787
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:26,585
which will be equal to VCC / 2

788
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,785
and which depends only
on the division by 2

789
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:31,327
of a supply voltage,

790
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:34,338
and I hope that when you
use this type of installation,

791
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:35,793
your supply voltages

792
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:37,210
are stable in temperature.

793
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,546
So you managed to achieve

794
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:43,542
a current which depends on a  VB voltage

795
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:46,637
where this tension then really does ...

796
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:49,802
the effect of the relation between IC

797
00:30:49,902 --> 00:30:54,220
and the voltage which
has applied to the base

798
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,784
has no effect of the temperature.

799
00:30:58,242 --> 00:31:00,901
We have seen how to make a current source

800
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,797
with discrete components.

801
00:31:02,997 --> 00:31:04,549
And if I present it to you,

802
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:09,653
and I tell you:
that, it'll be also a current source

803
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:11,677
which would be integrated.

804
00:31:11,877 --> 00:31:13,005
Why integrated?

805
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:15,330
I take the same speech of just now:

806
00:31:16,397 --> 00:31:18,949
I made a transistor connected in diode.

807
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:24,498
So this is like if I had a simple diode.

808
00:31:25,903 --> 00:31:27,906
The equivalent of a transistor

809
00:31:27,956 --> 00:31:31,437
I've short-circuited
the base to the collector,

810
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:32,323
it's like a diode.

811
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:36,089
And I plugged it a resistance here

812
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:38,459
to bring it a current

813
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:40,680
and I put it against the base.

814
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,506
So it's going to see a
current running through it.

815
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:44,224
It is this current one.

816
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,925
That's going to generate a tension

817
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:48,444
That tension,

818
00:31:48,482 --> 00:31:50,335
I don't even want to
know how much it is worth

819
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:52,277
I have a current which
pass through a diode.

820
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:53,641
If I tell you:

821
00:31:54,485 --> 00:31:57,425
impose this current in this component,

822
00:31:57,986 --> 00:32:00,323
and take the same component,
put it at other side,

823
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:03,713
and read the voltage,

824
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,614
the one who is there,

825
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,454
that you copy here

826
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,011
on an absolutely similar component,

827
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:14,509
what is will happen to you?

828
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,164
If you neglect the current which passes here,

829
00:32:17,264 --> 00:32:21,215
you say: this current is null.

830
00:32:22,326 --> 00:32:23,383
I take a current,

831
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,999
I converted to voltage

832
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:26,729
and in the same component.

833
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:29,024
I converted the same
voltage into a current.

834
00:32:29,124 --> 00:32:30,078
And you'll tell me:

835
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:31,460
without knowing anything,

836
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,622
I can say that this current
is equal to this current.

837
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:36,221
I made a current mirror.

838
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,565
I took a current
converted in voltage

839
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:42,735
and I converted back to current

840
00:32:42,772 --> 00:32:44,242
through a similar component.

841
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:46,874
It as a law, no matter it's

842
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,661
in this case there is the exponential,

843
00:32:49,043 --> 00:32:50,649
current, voltage, voltage, current,

844
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:53,066
then I ind myself with a perfect equality

845
00:32:53,654 --> 00:32:54,795
between this current there

846
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:55,940
and this current one.

847
00:32:57,624 --> 00:33:00,679
What are the assumptions

848
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:01,810
that I just do?

849
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,379
While the assumptions are:

850
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:05,970
we assume first

851
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,812
that this current is equal to 0.

852
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:09,003
So I canceled this current,

853
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,352
whereas this current that
will go into the basics

854
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:13,132
is almost negligible or nonexistent.

855
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:15,338
So, the second hypothesis,

856
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,323
is that this voltage is then applie

857
00:33:17,523 --> 00:33:19,595
on the 2 transistor junctions,

858
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:20,879
base-emitter and base-emitter

859
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:23,321
which are the same in reality.

860
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:25,458
But then if you look at this voltage,

861
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:27,097
this is indeed it.

862
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:30,197
So this tension that we see here and here

863
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:33,680
is the UBE voltage of a transistor

864
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:37,064
which is of the order of magnitude
of a voltage UJ junction.

865
00:33:37,904 --> 00:33:39,376
And then when I look at the other side,

866
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:42,863
I'll see that I have a transistor
voltage UCE.

867
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:46,953
So if there is this tension-UBE

868
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,484
and this voltage is then UCE,

869
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:51,248
and I have 2 transistors that are similar

870
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:53,756
with two currents which are the same,

871
00:33:53,956 --> 00:33:55,810
so I'll write the
dissipated power

872
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:57,153
in each of these components.

873
00:33:57,512 --> 00:33:58,915
I take it this component

874
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:00,220
I'll call T1

875
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,942
and this one I'll call him T2.

876
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:04,447
And I will write the power P1

877
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,767
which will be current here

878
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,538
I'll call I REF,

879
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,369
So this current I REF,

880
00:34:13,082 --> 00:34:15,226
and this is the same on the other side,

881
00:34:16,177 --> 00:34:19,975
well I'll write the power in
the transistor T1 and T2.

882
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,878
it will give me P1 is equal
to the magnitude of UJ

883
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:26,866
multiplied by I REF.

884
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:30,281
Contrariwise the other side,

885
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:32,473
it will be the power P2

886
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:36,322
that will be of course the famous
I REF but multiplied by ECU.

887
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:39,490
It's UCE x I REF.

888
00:34:40,638 --> 00:34:42,207
Now when you look at this

889
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:43,759
and you say, it will depend,

890
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,774
there I REF I, I REF,

891
00:34:45,874 --> 00:34:47,462
but then it will depend on ECU.

892
00:34:47,662 --> 00:34:49,179
That's an almost constant voltage,

893
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:50,410
it moves but very, very little.

894
00:34:50,736 --> 00:34:52,527
So this ECU voltage depends on what?

895
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:55,311
This is what we have plugged in here.

896
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:57,498
If I plug here a variable resistor,

897
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:01,258
and this resistance,
she will vary the voltage

898
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,812
Since VCC to voltage saturation.

899
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,530
So this UCE varies in a dynamic

900
00:35:06,568 --> 00:35:08,317
which is of the order of magnitude of VCC.

901
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:10,875
If we look at this variation,

902
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,723
So this UCE is much higher,

903
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:14,585
it could be much upper than UJ

904
00:35:14,885 --> 00:35:16,760
which will give me a power P2

905
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:18,663
dissipated in the transistor

906
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:21,563
which is much higher than transistor T1.

907
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,700
In the transistor T1 is almost constant.

908
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,430
So what is it going to give?

909
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,214
We had studied it is banned

910
00:35:28,864 --> 00:35:30,445
to take a transistor,

911
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:32,858
to apply on him a fixed voltage

912
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,092
and to imagine that by putting
this voltage fixed,

913
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:38,389
when the transistor will heat

914
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:41,325
because of this power that
I have mentioned here,

915
00:35:41,525 --> 00:35:42,905
there will be a thermal drift.

916
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:44,892
Why ? Because the temperature increases.

917
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:47,545
so let trace the IC characteristic

918
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:56,270
according to a junction voltage UBE

919
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:59,307
and we was told that this feature there,

920
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:02,170
we have no right

921
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,780
to come and apply a voltage UBE0

922
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,373
who come from some source of tension.

923
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:09,847
And here is what we are doing.

924
00:36:09,947 --> 00:36:11,442
we took this tension there,

925
00:36:11,642 --> 00:36:13,464
we have applied
to the transistor here.

926
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:14,882
And early,

927
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:16,731
when we spoke about that effect

928
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,707
and we said:
When the temperature increases,

929
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:22,351
that feature moves in that direction.

930
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,838
So your UBE0 will generate
a higher current.

931
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:34,136
So IC x UCE will give me power increases,

932
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:36,949
so thus heating of your device,
your transistor,

933
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:37,843
which will increase,

934
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:40,730
therefore your characteristic
continues to move

935
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,938
until this current here applied

936
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:46,136
an extreme current in your component,

937
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:48,454
which brings back to thermal bolting,

938
00:36:48,654 --> 00:36:50,697
and the transistor is destroyed by heat.

939
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,896
So how come that

940
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:54,565
we admit that it is feasible,

941
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:56,652
Yet it was forbidden to do it before

942
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:57,936
because of this phenomenon?

943
00:36:58,751 --> 00:36:59,975
Well, what happens,

944
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,363
is that when you take
these two transistors,

945
00:37:02,463 --> 00:37:05,789
the condition of making a current mirror

946
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:08,572
is to put the two side by side

947
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:11,130
inside a silicon substrate.

948
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:14,866
And usually when you make
a layout of an integrated circuit,

949
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:18,901
therefore the current mirror can
only be implemented or realized

950
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:20,621
in an integrated circuit,

951
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:23,801
the two are really glued
to one another,

952
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:25,734
or even blended together

953
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:26,699
in their layout,

954
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:29,319
in their way of building
at the level of silicon.

955
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,677
When this transistor starts to heat

956
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:33,148
it heats at the same time his neighbor.

957
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,457
So this junction which imposes tension,

958
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:40,455
it will also see its UBE0
move simultaneously.

959
00:37:40,755 --> 00:37:43,866
So if this tension UBE0

960
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:45,981
is the same as the other,

961
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:47,533
and this transistor is warming

962
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,142
therefore also the other is warming up,

963
00:37:49,342 --> 00:37:51,046
if the two transistors are similar,

964
00:37:51,246 --> 00:37:53,240
the 2 characteristics
of the 2 transistors

965
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,307
move in the same direction
and at the same time.

966
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:57,735
So this voltage continues

967
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,455
to be changed according to
the temperature of this

968
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:02,972
if we ignore

969
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:06,341
the thermal inertia between the one
and the other,

970
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,859
so it's an adaptation of the UBE voltage

971
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,477
to the exponential law

972
00:38:10,677 --> 00:38:14,523
and to the adrift,
the thermal drift of the transistor.

973
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:17,939
So we can make
2 transistors like this

974
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:20,664
in something called " mirror of current"

975
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:25,125
provided that the 2 are integrated
together under conditions

976
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:27,050
that you will probably learn

977
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,464
in a course of integrated circuits

978
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:29,106
where you are told:

979
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:31,201
we apply the rules of matching,

980
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:32,747
or matching in English,

981
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:34,943
so that the two components
are absolutely the same

982
00:38:35,143 --> 00:38:36,631
and that the temperatures are the same

983
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:37,591
applied to 2.

984
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:40,132
Otherwise, I would point out:

985
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:42,217
you need to add one resistance here

986
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:43,280
and one resistance there,

987
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,326
which allow or enabling

988
00:38:45,363 --> 00:38:47,688
to prevent thermal runaway
of your transistor

989
00:38:47,888 --> 00:38:50,138
by inserting an
Ohm's law there.

990
00:38:51,983 --> 00:38:54,291
Now we saw the mirror of current

991
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:56,998
with the condition that is here,

992
00:38:57,198 --> 00:38:58,607
be very careful.

993
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:01,101
Do not take 2 discrete components

994
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:04,521
and do not connect a component
away from the other.

995
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:06,693
Because if you do this

996
00:39:06,718 --> 00:39:08,284
and this transistor
starts to increase,

997
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:09,628
you can try it in the laboratory

998
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:11,128
I strongly you advise against:

999
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,213
put two transistors connected
to a diode transistor

1000
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:16,749
and put your finger on it,

1001
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:17,746
as I do here.

1002
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:18,911
You'll see.

1003
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:20,772
you're going to burn your finger.

1004
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,118
Your finger will burn

1005
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:24,522
because he is racing so fast

1006
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:27,878
because you have 37
of your body temperature,

1007
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:29,968
by the time the temperature
reaches to the junction,

1008
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,458
this transistor racing

1009
00:39:31,658 --> 00:39:35,097
and your transistor
will perhaps destroy

1010
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:36,207
because of the temperature,

1011
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,294
but you'll quickly feel it on your finger

1012
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:39,681
which corresponds
to a real burning,

1013
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:41,193
especially if
the case is metallic.

1014
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:43,361
I drew now

1015
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:44,836
my current mirror

1016
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:46,711
with all the balance of the current flowing.

1017
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:48,190
I said, this current one,

1018
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:50,785
it will provide a current IC

1019
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:53,241
but it will still lose 2 IB.

1020
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:54,227
Why 2 ?

1021
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:56,709
Because there are two bases
connected together,

1022
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:58,018
one draws a current IB,

1023
00:39:58,118 --> 00:40:00,302
the other would draw the same current IB

1024
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:01,394
so I have 2 times IB.

1025
00:40:01,856 --> 00:40:03,892
As against this base-emitter voltage

1026
00:40:04,092 --> 00:40:05,622
is absolutely the same for the two.

1027
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:09,946
This transistor is still
living with a VBE voltage,

1028
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:12,486
UCE is equal to UBE;

1029
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:14,871
this transistor will live with the UCE

1030
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:17,036
that you make it undergo as a function

1031
00:40:17,544 --> 00:40:20,802
of the load and the voltage here which is
equal to the same voltage as the other.

1032
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:22,650
contrariwise, the current is copy.

1033
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:27,803
So if you write the relation
between the current I REF

1034
00:40:28,312 --> 00:40:29,367
which will provide 2 IB,

1035
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:30,342
you have to write like that.

1036
00:40:30,392 --> 00:40:32,015
I must give IC + 2 IB

1037
00:40:32,115 --> 00:40:32,897
as noted herein.

1038
00:40:33,654 --> 00:40:35,295
If you consider that this tension,

1039
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,803
this is the magnitude of UJ

1040
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:38,191
because it is connected
as a diode,

1041
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:42,050
you will find that I REF = (VCC - UJ) / R.

1042
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:44,037
Now I take stock

1043
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:47,758
and hope that the two transistors

1044
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:49,229
have the same β

1045
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:54,044
and I calculate by saying
that this IC is equal to IC:

1046
00:40:54,473 --> 00:40:59,578
I find that the relation between
I REF and the current IC,

1047
00:40:59,778 --> 00:41:02,196
is 1 + 2 / β,

1048
00:41:02,554 --> 00:41:03,938
the β of this transistor.

1049
00:41:04,038 --> 00:41:06,410
So finally, the β of the transistors,

1050
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,760
if β is high, this term is very weak

1051
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,143
so you can cancel it

1052
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,160
and we can say that
the 2 currents are the same.

1053
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,895
There is a ways to do better.

1054
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:18,184
So it happens in some assambly

1055
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:21,014
where we really try not to load

1056
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,461
the current I REF by 2 x IB.

1057
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:25,482
We can do the next thing.

1058
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:28,664
We can do that,

1059
00:41:29,342 --> 00:41:31,543
add an additional transistor.

1060
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:34,215
The additional transistor
would come here,

1061
00:41:35,443 --> 00:41:36,936
and instead of putting a short circuit,

1062
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,417
we add a transistor

1063
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:40,728
which will impose a voltage
from here to there

1064
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:43,744
which will be of the order
of magnitude of 0.7 V.

1065
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,709
So this transistor,

1066
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:47,906
it is absolutely certain in normal mode,

1067
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:50,080
because he has between base

1068
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:52,878
or rather between
collector and base,

1069
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:54,132
a voltage of 0.7 V.

1070
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:56,114
But that is not what interests us.

1071
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,095
What interests us

1072
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:58,826
is that the current I REF,

1073
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:01,868
before, provided a current IC

1074
00:42:02,168 --> 00:42:04,331
and he lost 2 x IB.

1075
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:06,599
And here we have seen the following:

1076
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:07,932
the 2 x IB are still there.

1077
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:09,732
2 IB are there.

1078
00:42:10,785 --> 00:42:13,367
This current IB3 is the 2 IB

1079
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:16,042
divided by the β of the transistor.

1080
00:42:16,822 --> 00:42:19,684
So we just extracted from I REF

1081
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:22,526
a proportion 2 IB,

1082
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:24,533
but divided by the β

1083
00:42:24,633 --> 00:42:26,225
of a transistor that
would have been added,

1084
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:27,448
and that β-there,

1085
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,854
it is 100 to 200 times

1086
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:31,773
so we just shot 100 to
200 times less current

1087
00:42:31,823 --> 00:42:32,897
which disrupts I REF.

1088
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:36,320
So the relation between I REF and IC,

1089
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,424
it's like just now,
the 1 + 2 step divided by β,

1090
00:42:40,461 --> 00:42:41,545
it became β².

1091
00:42:41,745 --> 00:42:44,160
So if you have a β equal to 100,

1092
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:47,573
you're going to have a factor of 10,000

1093
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,965
that divides the famous 2
that we saw earlier,

1094
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:53,842
so it is a solution that reduces
the impact of current

1095
00:42:53,942 --> 00:42:55,270
in the base of the transistor.

1096
00:42:57,131 --> 00:42:59,682
The solution that is adopted
in integrated circuits,

1097
00:42:59,882 --> 00:43:02,384
it is based on a discussion like this one.

1098
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,400
If you
are going to watch

1099
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:06,568
a circuit implemented
in bipolar technology

1100
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,008
or integrated technology,

1101
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:08,950
You'll see.

1102
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,771
that the manufacturer
uses the power rails.

1103
00:43:12,871 --> 00:43:15,759
Here in this case,
I took + VCC and -VCC.

1104
00:43:17,313 --> 00:43:22,200
And they add 2 batteries
of current mirrors

1105
00:43:22,238 --> 00:43:24,875
because we can
copy a current mirror

1106
00:43:25,075 --> 00:43:25,787
several times.

1107
00:43:26,634 --> 00:43:28,268
So look at that, it corresponds to

1108
00:43:28,468 --> 00:43:30,089
a PNP current mirror.

1109
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,600
That is an NPN current mirror.

1110
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:36,891
So if you take from VDC + VCC, -VCC,

1111
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:40,609
and you put a transistor
connected in diode

1112
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:42,105
of type PNP,

1113
00:43:42,505 --> 00:43:45,215
a transistor connected
in diode of type NPN

1114
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,996
and you choose a
strength of your choice:

1115
00:43:48,196 --> 00:43:50,341
You can very well
say: The current I REF

1116
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:52,006
I neglect the base current

1117
00:43:52,206 --> 00:43:53,833
and I will write I REF

1118
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,927
which will be VCC - (-VCC)

1119
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:00,244
so it is 2 VDC,

1120
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:03,585
divided by the ...

1121
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:05,870
Sorry.

1122
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,616
less the voltage drop I here

1123
00:44:09,156 --> 00:44:10,418
I will approximates to UJ

1124
00:44:10,518 --> 00:44:13,768
and the one I have where
I'm going to approximate to UJ,

1125
00:44:13,968 --> 00:44:15,664
it gives me 2 UJ

1126
00:44:16,561 --> 00:44:19,372
that I will divide the resistance R.

1127
00:44:19,963 --> 00:44:23,742
So it gives me:
(2 VCC - 2 UJ) / R

1128
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:26,100
so I'll get the current I REF

1129
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,224
which I will have calculated
according to my resistance R.

1130
00:44:28,776 --> 00:44:31,480
And now I take this current

1131
00:44:31,995 --> 00:44:34,331
and I will make
the current mirrors

1132
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,210
that copy it

1133
00:44:35,754 --> 00:44:36,972
to provide currents,

1134
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:38,173
current sources,

1135
00:44:38,373 --> 00:44:41,826
which inject a current
in that direction.

1136
00:44:41,863 --> 00:44:43,751
And I can copy it as
many times as I want.

1137
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,477
I can make
current sources

1138
00:44:45,527 --> 00:44:46,614
that draws currents

1139
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:49,658
and I can also inject as
many times as I want.

1140
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:51,717
And here, I have just made a subtlety:

1141
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:55,138
that is, know that if you
want to multiply by a factor 2

1142
00:44:55,238 --> 00:44:56,073
this same current,

1143
00:44:56,273 --> 00:44:58,382
just plug 2 parallel transistors.

1144
00:44:58,682 --> 00:45:00,606
Take the same transistor

1145
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,249
and you put it 2 times in parallel.

1146
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,769
the current that passes here,

1147
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:04,967
it will be I REF

1148
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:06,039
and that is I REF.

1149
00:45:06,077 --> 00:45:06,608
Why?

1150
00:45:06,658 --> 00:45:08,241
Because they all
have the same voltage,

1151
00:45:08,441 --> 00:45:10,304
so the I REF will appear here

1152
00:45:11,303 --> 00:45:12,957
and  the I REF will appear here

1153
00:45:13,029 --> 00:45:14,844
and there you will
end up with 2 I REF.

1154
00:45:15,044 --> 00:45:16,347
So later,

1155
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:17,573
when we begin to look at

1156
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:21,819
circuits realized
with integrated circuits,

1157
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:23,922
you will easily see

1158
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:25,935
that the first thing you do in a circuit

1159
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:27,897
is to generate reference currents

1160
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:29,473
which are made in this way

1161
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:31,105
and we will use it anywhere.

1162
00:45:31,726 --> 00:45:33,844
Then, the output
impedance that I see everywhere,

1163
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:36,738
I have a transistor that
I watch since collector and emitter,

1164
00:45:36,938 --> 00:45:38,005
this output impedance,

1165
00:45:38,043 --> 00:45:39,085
is 1 / GCE

1166
00:45:40,181 --> 00:45:41,210
of this transistor.

1167
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:44,669
So what is the transistor 4,

1168
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:46,188
it's going to be 1 / GCE4,

1169
00:45:46,635 --> 00:45:49,441
there it's the same thing but GCE7,

1170
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,739
and caetera, and caetera.

1171
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,722
We will see how to do better

1172
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:56,538
to boost this output impedance.

1173
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:57,740
This output impedance,

1174
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,723
she's great

1175
00:45:59,165 --> 00:46:00,541
but can we make it bigger?

1176
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:01,950
Yes, we can do more.

1177
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,171
And how do we do it?

1178
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:04,597
This is done in this way.

1179
00:46:06,788 --> 00:46:07,965
We do it like that.

1180
00:46:09,745 --> 00:46:11,784
That's my original
current mirror.

1181
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:15,115
And I just put on

1182
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:18,218
another mirror of similar current.

1183
00:46:18,518 --> 00:46:19,869
So I do 2 floors.

1184
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,418
Before going into
the details

1185
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:23,665
of the output impedance

1186
00:46:23,702 --> 00:46:24,731
I have spoken to you

1187
00:46:24,756 --> 00:46:26,069
and that will be improved,

1188
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:27,725
I would just like to show you

1189
00:46:27,925 --> 00:46:29,567
this kind of installation,

1190
00:46:29,918 --> 00:46:32,514
it is already extremely well done

1191
00:46:32,564 --> 00:46:34,551
for drift in temperature

1192
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,042
and in order to impose

1193
00:46:36,142 --> 00:46:38,305
a fixed voltage on this transistor T2.

1194
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,831
You remember, just now

1195
00:46:39,868 --> 00:46:42,543
when I took the normal
current mirror

1196
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:47,562
and I connected
a diode transistor

1197
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:51,341
and I made a
whole speech about the fact

1198
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,652
that this transistor there,

1199
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,713
it will undergo a voltage UCE

1200
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,834
and this transistor,
it will undergo a voltage UJ.

1201
00:47:01,013 --> 00:47:02,495
So that, it was a problem

1202
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,554
that the heat dissipation
in this transistor

1203
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:05,372
will be greater.

1204
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:06,746
And how we improve that?

1205
00:47:06,946 --> 00:47:08,394
By pairing,

1206
00:47:08,494 --> 00:47:09,609
the fact that one and the other,

1207
00:47:09,646 --> 00:47:10,573
it is on the same chip.

1208
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:11,797
Is this is the case

1209
00:47:11,835 --> 00:47:13,071
Compared to T1 and T2

1210
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:14,807
when I put a floor above him?

1211
00:47:14,907 --> 00:47:15,661
Let us analyze it.

1212
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:19,247
I look at this transistor:
what he sees here?

1213
00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:20,331
I'll talk about UJ

1214
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:21,439
to simplify my life.

1215
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:22,963
He will see a UJ voltage

1216
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:26,030
What is the tension there?

1217
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,072
This is UJ.

1218
00:47:29,643 --> 00:47:31,028
What is the tension here?

1219
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:32,070
It's UJ.

1220
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:34,487
The tension here is UJ.

1221
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:37,739
Then I will look at the tension
which is thence to there:

1222
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:43,658
the tension that I see
from here to there,

1223
00:47:44,242 --> 00:47:46,246
this voltage is equal to what?

1224
00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:47,663
There, in that side

1225
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:48,864
if I hide this part

1226
00:47:48,964 --> 00:47:51,026
it's UJ + 0,

1227
00:47:51,226 --> 00:47:53,725
it is 0, it is a short circuit.

1228
00:47:54,155 --> 00:47:57,809
On this side, from there to there

1229
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:00,524
this voltage is shared, it is the same.

1230
00:48:00,996 --> 00:48:03,519
If on this side I have UJ and there I have 0

1231
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:05,151
necessarily on the other side I have UJ

1232
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:07,417
and there I have a voltage
drop equal to 0.

1233
00:48:08,815 --> 00:48:09,880
So this tension there,

1234
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,720
although I do not have
a real short circuit,

1235
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:15,014
I find myself with a
potential difference

1236
00:48:15,114 --> 00:48:16,980
that will tell me that the
base and collector

1237
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:19,527
are at the same potential.

1238
00:48:19,627 --> 00:48:21,871
So this transistor T2 is placed

1239
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:24,129
at the saturation threshold.

1240
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:27,440
And if he sees by construction

1241
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,033
that he has a voltage 0,

1242
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:31,171
that is to say that tension
from here to there

1243
00:48:31,371 --> 00:48:32,684
it is also equal to UJ.

1244
00:48:32,884 --> 00:48:33,694
That's great !

1245
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:35,738
The two voltages are the same.

1246
00:48:35,938 --> 00:48:38,627
This transistor and
this transistor will live

1247
00:48:38,677 --> 00:48:39,268
all the time

1248
00:48:39,468 --> 00:48:41,410
with the same voltage.

1249
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,058
So it's like I was saying:

1250
00:48:43,258 --> 00:48:45,013
the Early effect will not appear,

1251
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,961
there will be no voltage variation.

1252
00:48:46,998 --> 00:48:50,206
If you connect a load here

1253
00:48:50,825 --> 00:48:52,703
and you vary this load

1254
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:54,973
with a variable resistance,

1255
00:48:55,173 --> 00:48:57,081
so you'll have this tension which will drop

1256
00:48:58,146 --> 00:48:59,746
this transistor,

1257
00:48:59,946 --> 00:49:02,497
it sees all the time its
transmitter to a fixed voltage

1258
00:49:02,534 --> 00:49:03,434
which is equal to UJ

1259
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:04,455
and not moving.

1260
00:49:06,368 --> 00:49:09,022
When the UCE voltage is equal to 0

1261
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:10,071
and it saturates,

1262
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:11,890
this transistor has not saturated.

1263
00:49:12,428 --> 00:49:13,729
It is beyond saturation

1264
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:16,313
what will bring us to
have this structure

1265
00:49:16,363 --> 00:49:19,465
which is much more stable
in terms of temperature,

1266
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:20,594
that's on one side,

1267
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:21,898
and on the other side

1268
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,877
this transistor
finds itself charged

1269
00:49:25,977 --> 00:49:28,090
with an impedance there.

1270
00:49:29,688 --> 00:49:32,056
It had been established earlier,
how much it is?

1271
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,158
It is 1/GCE.

1272
00:49:34,898 --> 00:49:37,091
So there I have 1/GCE as impedance

1273
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:39,548
I put in the transmitter
of a transistor.

1274
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:41,859
So this is a transistor

1275
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:44,901
where it is that the
base has a fixed potential.

1276
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:48,814
And the base of this
transistor from here to there

1277
00:49:49,299 --> 00:49:52,014
UJ UJ + is: it's 2 UJ.

1278
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:55,279
Therefore the base is
connected to a fixed potential,

1279
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:57,309
that's like a common base,

1280
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:01,987
I look at its impedance
from this collector

1281
00:50:02,407 --> 00:50:04,879
and its transmitter,
I've put it resistance

1282
00:50:04,979 --> 00:50:07,675
equal to something 1 / GCE

1283
00:50:08,158 --> 00:50:10,486
which is necessarily much larger

1284
00:50:10,499 --> 00:50:11,653
his 1 / GBE.

1285
00:50:11,753 --> 00:50:12,763
And if you remember,

1286
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:14,966
when we say 1/GCE

1287
00:50:15,501 --> 00:50:18,067
or rather the resistance
that I added in the transmitter

1288
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,207
or that I called RE,

1289
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:22,488
is much greater
than 1/GBE

1290
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:25,298
well I'll find myself with
an output impedance

1291
00:50:25,498 --> 00:50:29,187
which will tend towards
β divided by GCE.

1292
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:30,585
It's great !

1293
00:50:30,685 --> 00:50:33,091
So I get an output impedance

1294
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,487
extremely high

1295
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,504
while having a structure in which

1296
00:50:38,604 --> 00:50:40,032
the tension here is not moving

1297
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:43,661
and the top transistor
will undergo a change.

1298
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:45,928
So this is an excellent current source.

1299
00:50:46,381 --> 00:50:49,108
We will look at it again cleaner

1300
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:53,228
with all that I added
as writing on this.

1301
00:50:55,329 --> 00:50:57,429
Look the same assembly

1302
00:50:57,848 --> 00:50:59,153
now analyzed

1303
00:50:59,353 --> 00:51:01,535
with all current balances

1304
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:03,173
I won't going into details,

1305
00:51:03,273 --> 00:51:04,289
because it makes no sense

1306
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:06,498
to show that there is
a current flowing.

1307
00:51:06,535 --> 00:51:07,638
If we want to improve it,

1308
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:10,411
one only has to add the
transistor that would come here

1309
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:12,460
to pull a component of the current,

1310
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,120
we can do the same here.

1311
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,140
But that are the solutions of second order

1312
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,467
That is rarely done in certain circuits,

1313
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:20,913
where when one is looking
for perfection,

1314
00:51:21,113 --> 00:51:22,865
we try to put a transistor here

1315
00:51:22,902 --> 00:51:23,727
and a transistor there.

1316
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:25,891
But we come across a diagram,

1317
00:51:26,562 --> 00:51:28,633
called the mountage Cascade

1318
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:30,114
that we have already studied.

1319
00:51:30,622 --> 00:51:35,181
Because two transistors have been cascaded

1320
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:39,539
and we've imposed on
the base of a transistor

1321
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:40,454
a fixed potential

1322
00:51:40,554 --> 00:51:42,854
and at the base
of a transistor, the second,

1323
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,852
a fixed potential,

1324
00:51:44,052 --> 00:51:46,214
and impedance that
I will see from here,

1325
00:51:46,252 --> 00:51:48,495
it'll be the β x 1 / GCE.

1326
00:51:48,695 --> 00:51:51,242
And this is repeating

1327
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,097
the same current mirror

1328
00:51:53,135 --> 00:51:54,625
and copying the second time.

1329
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:58,307
And I realize that with an
excellent power source.

1330
00:51:58,768 --> 00:52:00,545
So that's the equivalent of that

1331
00:52:01,353 --> 00:52:03,039
with an output impedance

1332
00:52:03,401 --> 00:52:06,431
whose value is then β / GCE,

1333
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:09,143
compared to the simple
current mirror,

1334
00:52:09,499 --> 00:52:12,125
if I had not added
another over

1335
00:52:12,325 --> 00:52:14,747
I would have gotten that equals
from here to there

1336
00:52:14,772 --> 00:52:16,924
at just 1 / GCE.

1337
00:52:17,124 --> 00:52:19,454
So in terms of output impedance,

1338
00:52:19,479 --> 00:52:21,523
I just improved β times

1339
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,717
relative to a normal current mirror.

1340
00:52:24,817 --> 00:52:26,609
And of course, all this would

1341
00:52:26,671 --> 00:52:28,759
come with the thermal stability
of this mounting.

1342
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,302
And to sum up,

1343
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:34,435
I do not think there is need

1344
00:52:34,523 --> 00:52:36,449
and comment on it a second time

1345
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,444
we just saw it,

1346
00:52:37,644 --> 00:52:39,794
and I reported this drawing,

1347
00:52:39,994 --> 00:52:41,685
and this earns you a summary

1348
00:52:41,885 --> 00:52:43,235
of the output impedance

1349
00:52:43,273 --> 00:52:44,442
which greatly interests me

1350
00:52:44,642 --> 00:52:46,948
and the reference current

1351
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:48,088
that I just imposed.

1352
00:52:48,288 --> 00:52:49,811
So on that side there,

1353
00:52:50,111 --> 00:52:52,589
I have a current I impose myself,

1354
00:52:52,789 --> 00:52:53,700
so  of diode,

1355
00:52:54,277 --> 00:52:55,146
on the other side,

1356
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:57,101
I see a power source.

1357
00:52:57,301 --> 00:53:00,016
Be very careful as to that side

1358
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:02,255
there is no current source:
I impose a current

1359
00:53:02,267 --> 00:53:03,103
in 2 diodes in series.

1360
00:53:03,629 --> 00:53:05,577
And then I find myself with really

1361
00:53:05,677 --> 00:53:08,175
a current source that is like this

1362
00:53:09,665 --> 00:53:12,520
and this current one,
it is the current IC4.

1363
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:16,416
And here it is
required to ground

1364
00:53:16,616 --> 00:53:21,617
and the R OUT resistance is there,

1365
00:53:22,228 --> 00:53:28,480
it is this resistance as high as β/GCE.

1366
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,896
And know that if you repeat this

1367
00:53:30,996 --> 00:53:32,338
and you still add a floor,

1368
00:53:32,388 --> 00:53:33,698
you can continue to heaven,

1369
00:53:33,898 --> 00:53:36,575
and every time you add a β times

1370
00:53:36,775 --> 00:53:37,728
that comes here.

1371
00:53:37,828 --> 00:53:40,562
So I'll have, bystill adding a
current mirror above,

1372
00:53:40,612 --> 00:53:42,935
I would find β²/GCE.

1373
00:53:43,135 --> 00:53:46,343
So current sources that
have an extraordinary stability

1374
00:53:46,443 --> 00:53:47,971
and can be
used to achieve

1375
00:53:47,996 --> 00:53:50,000
current sources and current references

1376
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:52,644
which are extremely stable,

1377
00:53:52,744 --> 00:53:55,810
having removed all that is
related to the Early effect

1378
00:53:56,257 --> 00:53:57,522
a simple transistor.

1379
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:00,315
So in summary,

1380
00:54:00,415 --> 00:54:03,515
we have seen all circuitries

1381
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,649
that is used for polarize a transistor.

1382
00:54:06,198 --> 00:54:08,657
Know that the polarization
is something absolutely ...

1383
00:54:08,857 --> 00:54:11,044
the most important in a circuit.

1384
00:54:11,244 --> 00:54:14,240
We will see later that it
impacts on the dynamics,

1385
00:54:14,277 --> 00:54:15,984
it impacts the
performance of the circuit.

1386
00:54:16,476 --> 00:54:18,773
And we ended up towards the end

1387
00:54:18,873 --> 00:54:21,955
with some specific
polarization circuitries

1388
00:54:22,155 --> 00:54:23,640
which have called
the current sources

1389
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,767
and we will see that
these current sources

1390
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:27,138
will be to at the orignin

1391
00:54:27,338 --> 00:54:29,818
of the embodiment of infinite resistance,

1392
00:54:29,843 --> 00:54:31,751
that which will used in integrated circuits

1393
00:54:31,776 --> 00:54:34,680
and in particular in operational amplifiers.

1394
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,601
Because, if you remember that
the gain of an op amp is infinite,

1395
00:54:38,801 --> 00:54:39,985
the gain in tension,

1396
00:54:40,185 --> 00:54:42,441
it is because we realized
an infinite resistance.

1397
00:54:42,566 --> 00:54:44,333
And these current sources will allow us

1398
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:45,860
to impose a fixed current

1399
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,986
or to make active loads

1400
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:52,347
which will be the subject
of our next chapter.
