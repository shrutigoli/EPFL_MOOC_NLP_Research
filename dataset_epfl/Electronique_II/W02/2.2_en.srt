1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,780
Now that the small signal model
has been introduced,

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,710
we will implement it in
the context of a circuit.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,230
The purpose of this video is
to take a simple example

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,424
of a transistor where we will have
to polarize it, of course

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,304
and superimpose an increase
on the polarization.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,850
Thanks to this, we can
see what will happen

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,670
with our transistor and
how the small signal model

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,890
is used once our transistor is put in

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,720
a complete circuit context.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,750
The example of the circuit is as follows.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,420
We see out transistor here,
and there is a supply.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,136
This is a voltage source VCC.

13
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:48,880
I took a DC voltage source, I can

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,368
of course draw it here if I want.

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:56,630
I pull this here, and
I just have to draw a

16
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,000
VCC voltage source that will power all this.

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,870
When I analyze my circuit, once I drew

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,070
this, I'll point out the following.

19
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:11,050
I take again the circuit
now that I've cleared this

20
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,000
source I added, and
I notice that this voltage source,

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,380
which is usually drawn like this without

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,272
drawing it every time, we do not add it,
that's why I deleted it.

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,830
I put a transmitter that comes from

24
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,910
the voltage supply to the base.

25
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,400
I added a capacity here
and I added a voltage

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,328
that I noted in lowercase, I called it V1.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,220
I added an increase source, or a source

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,160
that will give me the signal
through my transistor and

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,450
I decoupled it by a capacitance .

30
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,250
What is decoupled by a capacitance?

31
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,580
We'll have a full lesson on what this

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:59,200
capacitance is, but if you observe here
what I just noted, I put C = ∞.

33
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:03,088
You know that the capacitance value is

34
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:08,200
extremely high and you say
C = ∞, it is as if you

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,368
were telling the impedance of
my complex ZC capacitance,

36
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:16,420
which is equal to 1 over

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,180
the signal frequency,
or the signal pulse which is

38
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,260
2πF, it's (2xπxF) which I inject times

39
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,790
C, which will come from here

40
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,500
an I put here it is equal to infinity.

41
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,440
It's like I was saying that for all

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,248
that is variable, all that has a frequency,
the impedance is equal to 0.

43
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,128
The capacitance behaves like a

44
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:47,000
short circuit to all
that concerns variations.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,010
For all we add here that has some

46
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,544
variation, this capacitance
acts as a short circuit.

47
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,050
For everything that
is not variable, it behaves

48
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,090
as an open circuit.
It means this circuit here,

49
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,592
I can deal with it in two ways.

50
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,530
If I want to deal with it in DC,
so if I want to deal with it

51
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,430
without injecting or rather keeping
everything that is connected

52
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,920
here, but not taking into account
that I have here a variable source,

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,704
I only have to remove this part.

54
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:16,530
That part will disappear
and there I have my circuit

55
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,550
supplied, and of course
this component here is not there.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,310
All these components that
are here will disappear.

57
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,410
So that, it will disappear
in DC model,

58
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,620
this will disappear in DC model and this too.

59
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:37,400
So there are no AC variations,
all this is due to

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,580
to the fact that I used a capacity
and it decouples variations.

61
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,730
All that is variable,
will pass through and

62
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,470
otherwise I find myself with
a circuit uniquely powered

63
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,984
by a supply voltage and
there is no DC component.

64
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,710
All thanks to this capacity
because the capacity is

65
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,300
there to enable this source when this source

66
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,880
applies a voltage variation to increase,

67
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,690
something that varies in time,
which has certain

68
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,340
frequencies, when we talk
of a sinusoidal voltage, its

69
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,950
impedance here will be 0.

70
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,880
It behaves as a short circuit, only when

71
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,200
I have a voltage which varies
in time and has been brought to

72
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,570
a sinusoidal voltage to be able
to speak of the impedance.

73
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,288
There you go.

74
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:25,560
I would like to take my circuit
and put it back

75
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,590
in its DC use, that is to say,
I will erase every where

76
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,440
I have the capacitance.

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,750
I'll just watch the DC model
on what happens.

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,460
It was said that here, we will look only
at the DC components.

79
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,260
I erase everything on AC,
all this will disappear.

80
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:48,400
I'll end up with a very simple circuit,
which is this.

81
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,770
All this is as if it did not exist,

82
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,890
I can erase it, I do not see it.

83
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:58,870
The V1 source that generates
the AC signal will disappear.

84
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,820
Here, now I have my polarization circuit.

85
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,784
Observe this well, this is
indeed a polarized circuit.

86
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:08,420
What would i like to do, really?

87
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,730
In fact, I would like
to apply the Ic0 current.

88
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:12,912
You will remember that the first step of the use.
In reality, I would like to impose current IC0.

89
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:16,940
Remember that the first step in the use

90
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,500
of a transistor is to polarize it.

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,370
This is a fairly known polarization
diagram, not very much

92
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,520
used, we will see later why, but rather

93
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,770
didactic to explain that.

94
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,360
We said we had a DC power supply,
that is to say from here

95
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,544
to here, I have a voltage +VCC.

96
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:40,620
When you apply a

97
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,670
voltage +VCC and you put a resistance

98
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,620
coming from the base, you know
that when your transistor will

99
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,950
conduct, it will have
a tension here if you use the

100
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:56,256
simple model of the transistor
that ignores the exponential.

101
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,460
Remember that we said
that during polarization

102
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,430
of a transistor, we just use the simple

103
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,088
transitor model, one that is linear by segment

104
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,590
that will show me that here I have
a junction voltage of the order

105
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,872
of magnitude UJ, so VBE, or VBE0,

106
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,580
will be of the order of magnitude of UJ.

107
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,410
Obviously this value of UJ
is an approximation.

108
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,160
This is perfectly valid when we want
to look at the polarization effect.

109
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,080
So only in polarization do we
have the right to use it.

110
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,240
Because after the variable VBE,
it will be injected

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,520
by this voltage source
that will perform a

112
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,580
voltage variation between
base and transmitter.

113
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,510
If you start from that and you say
IB0 passes by, the

114
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:45,488
IB0 here and there I have
a voltage which I called VRB

115
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,584
which is equal to (IB0xRB),
I can write that VCC, the

116
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,440
supply voltage is equal to IB0

117
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,800
multiplied by RB plus UJ.

118
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,250
And that is the voltage that is
here plus this one.

119
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,648
So I can easily extract my current IB0

120
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,720
which will be (VCC-UJ)
divided by the resistor RB.

121
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,050
Finally, the calculation element is the RB.

122
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,136
It's up to you to chose RB resistor to apply IB0.

123
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:23,920
That is not the objective,
the objective is IC0.

124
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:29,200
This allows us to determine IB0,
but I know IB0

125
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,450
is linked to IC0 by the fact that the β

126
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,928
of the transistor IB0 will give me
this current IC0 so IC0 is known.

127
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,464
The β of the transistor is given,
we have a β equal to 100.

128
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,630
So the famous IB0 I have
here will enable me to

129
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,624
calculate IC0 once I decide the value of RB.

130
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,640
These two relationships
allow me then to size the

131
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,000
RB resistor for an IC0 current.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,856
If you want to put IC0 to a value of

133
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:06,220
1 milliampere or other,
we will calculate it later in this circuit.

134
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,280
But if you want to impose a value here,

135
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,100
knowing the β, you will find the IB0,
you put the IB0 by its value here.

136
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,528
VCC is known,
UJ is of the order of 0.7 volts.

137
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:20,000
You have to calculate the RB,
so it is only RB

138
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,616
we should extract from this
once you imposed IC0.

139
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:26,420
Actually, what I'm doing, I'm

140
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,910
saying that I polarized
my transistor, I have IC0.

141
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,450
What is the current EVBE0
that will go through my transistor?

142
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,470
We said we will not calculate it,
it was approximated.

143
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:39,040
But if you put it
in the exponential law, you

144
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,190
will need to have the real value of VBE0
which is quite close

145
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,680
to this value, knowing
that the law is exponential.

146
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,016
Our transistor is polarized,
our famous IC0 is known.

147
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:52,208
What would we do then?

148
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:57,010
Well this IC0 will overlay

149
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,050
this IC0, and this IB0, the variation

150
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,000
that will come from what I just erased.

151
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,850
Let's see the values ​​taking
into account the correct calculation

152
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,280
that takes into account
the values ​​that we have added.

153
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,590
We put a resistor RB of 186  kΩ and

154
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,008
the resistance RC = 1 kΩ.

155
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,830
This is exactly what I just noted,
but with numerical values.

156
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,280
We applied an IC0 current
of 5 milliamps, really,

157
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,240
it's how we say it.

158
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,740
We just polarize
a bipolar transistor with a

159
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,060
constant current equal
to 5 milliamps that will cross

160
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,416
our transistor permanently.

161
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,940
Do what you want,
as soon as you plug these

162
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,688
values, supply it, you will have
this equal to 5 milliamps.

163
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:49,392
You will end up with

164
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,784
5 milliamps divided by IB0
that will give you something.

165
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:56,570
But before going further,
we must at all costs

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,060
check that the UCE voltage
is raised from 0, from this

167
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,380
transistor, we give a value with what we just

168
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,800
calculated which guarantees
that our transistor is not saturated.

169
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,200
For it to be blocked,
it could not be blocked,

170
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,890
it is in conduction because
it has a current

171
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,208
going through, but I must be sure
that this is positive.

172
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,260
Generally, we will see it later, we try

173
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,224
placing it in the middle
of the dynamic, that is to say,

174
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,800
if it's supply with a voltage what
we call the supply rail

175
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,820
between 0 and VCC,
we must try to place this

176
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,512
potential almost in the middle
of this range here.

177
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:38,110
Why ? Because this voltage
will rise up to VCC,

178
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,792
it will drop to 0.

179
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:44,460
If it gets to VCC, the transistor will block.

180
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,180
If it gets towards 0,
the transistor is saturated.

181
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,880
When V20 is 0, and this is
what will happen to it

182
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,870
because remember,
when you put a variation

183
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,370
here this tension will then move with.

184
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,320
It will go up to a maximum of VCC,
it will come down to a minimum to 0.

185
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,330
It will give you what would later
be called the dynamic.

186
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:08,140
I think now is not the time to

187
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,330
talk about it, what is
most important to me is to

188
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,480
find that the UCE of
this transistor is at rest,

189
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,272
therefore the UCE0 which is V20,
is equal to 5 volts.

190
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,672
So 5 volts is not equal to 0,
so our transistor is not saturated.

191
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,450
Very good. Our transistor is
neither blocked nor

192
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,110
saturated, I can put
my transistor in normal mode.

193
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,890
It is an essential verification
to be sure that

194
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,000
what I'm doing with my circuit later

195
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,820
would result in a circuit
that will enable the

196
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,570
input and output voltage, in the case that

197
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,440
the variation of the output current be linear.

198
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,230
I now take again my diagram once I have

199
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,010
added the capacity C
which is there to couple

200
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,450
AC component that is here.

201
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,270
I am indeed interested
in this AC component

202
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,350
that will be generated by the AC source
that was added here.

203
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,250
But of course, this AC component
is superimposed on

204
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,860
the DC component
we just calculated just before.

205
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:23,760
Before getting here, I calculated
the IC0, IB0, IE0 and V20.

206
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,500
Now I just plug my source and I

207
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,670
ask my capacity to create
a short circuit and

208
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,400
couple all the variations that
come from this node here

209
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,400
towards the other node to bring back
the variation caused by

210
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,430
this source here to the VBE voltage,
which is of course

211
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:46,544
a ΔVBE or a tiny VBE
which describes the change in the VBE.

212
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,000
Any variation of this voltage
will generate a

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
variation of this current
through the transistor effect,

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,270
So through the transconductance
we had seen before.

215
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,780
All variations of this voltage
will conduct

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,870
a current flowing here
which is the base current.

217
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,450
I will be able to remove
my transistor and only

218
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,280
observe in AC what happens
with this circuit.

219
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,000
Most important in this model
is that it is a

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,270
model which is based on the fact that
I have derived the nonlinear

221
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,600
law of my transistor
to replace it with this

222
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,590
small signals model
that we had done before.

223
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,950
We said that any ΔVBE change
will give me

224
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,048
a current proportional to (GMxΔVBE).

225
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,690
Same for the impedance
that I see here, it is a

226
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,590
kind of a resistance,
there is here 1/GBE which is

227
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:48,192
proportional to a voltage variation:
ΔVBE = 1/GBExIB.

228
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:49,770
If I applied it to

229
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,550
the transistor and would like
to remove from this diagram my

230
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,070
transistor and replace it
with its model which is

231
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,290
represented by a resistor,
a controlled current source,

232
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,400
I have to do it for the rest of my circuit.

233
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,210
And for the rest of my circuit,
I have a constant voltage here.

234
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:12,512
A constant VCC voltage is equal to 10 volts,
it remains constant.

235
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:14,650
You can take what you want

236
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,370
as current of this source, it has no value

237
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,560
on the supply voltage of 10 volts.

238
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:27,660
If you are looking for what is
the derivative of this tension

239
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,740
DVCC divided by the change in current,

240
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,600
well there is nothing that varies,
it gives you a 0.

241
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,860
This voltage source is none other than

242
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,930
a short circuit because
a zero impedance gives you

243
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,184
a short circuit between
this node and this node here.

244
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:51,120
And that's what will allow us
to take all the

245
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,320
diagram and say: as the voltage source is

246
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,740
constant, the derivative with respect
to the current does not vary.

247
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,790
So this node here
it is the same as that in the

248
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,944
diagram I'll draw.

249
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:06,530
The capacity is a short circuit
because its value is infinite.

250
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,360
So, its impedance is zero.

251
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,770
The transistor, I remove and
replace the transistor

252
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,280
with the model we had seen before.

253
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,740
The resistors remain as they are.

254
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,210
So a DU/DI gives a resistor RB
and the same here.

255
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,030
That's it, I have all it takes
to remove this

256
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,380
diagram and replace it
with a diagram where the source of

257
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,450
voltage becomes, in an AAC model,

258
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:42,330
an earth short circuit.

259
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,590
I don't have any more variation here.

260
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,210
The transistor, when I replace it,
I have to replace it

261
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,872
between the base and transmitter
using the famous 1/GBE.

262
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:58,000
We can write GBE or 1/GBE
it's up to you to know whether

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
you talk about a resistance
or a conductance.

264
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,930
At the exit, you have a power source

265
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:15,600
that will give you a current ΔIc
where Ic = GMxVBE.

266
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,440
And now, here you have
the transistor with its model

267
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,576
which is base-transmitter-collector.

268
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:29,120
So this, this and this.

269
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,650
And the resistance you have
here will come upon the

270
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,144
collector of your transistor.

271
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:38,510
It is the resistor RC.

272
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:40,070
I'd like to see the transmitter.

273
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,950
The transmitter is connected to earth,
very well, it is linked to earth.

274
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,840
The resistor is connected to +VCC.

275
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,888
But as a constant voltage source,
its derivative

276
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,704
is zero, I have to replace it with a short circuit.

277
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,920
This is a resistance equal to 0.

278
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,910
A voltage source doesn't
have any resistance.

279
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,490
The voltage does not vary
depending on the current variation

280
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,450
so you will end up with a

281
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,020
resistor also connected to earth.

282
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,424
RB is also connected to VCC.

283
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,160
Therefore the same, RB will appear here

284
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,264
and you'll connect a capacity that has a

285
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:21,440
short circuit because
of it and you will get the

286
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,088
voltage source V1, here.

287
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:28,210
That's it, you are applying V1
between the base and

288
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,440
the transmitter, and it is this
source which must have a

289
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,112
very small growth value, less than

290
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:37,220
UT, which will controls the change here.

291
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,770
And you have all the DC components
that will be the rest point.

292
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,720
Whenever there is change,
we go from this rest point and

293
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,330
we will change the output current
in regards to

294
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,130
the variation of this voltage source V1.

295
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,800
And here you have the equivalent
of what we just saw

296
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,820
as with a complete diagram with a circuit.

297
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,000
When it was modeled in AC
where the voltage sources

298
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,820
are replaced by short circuits,
our transistor

299
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,730
is replaced by its small signals model and

300
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,170
we end up with an equivalent diagram,
which is this.

301
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,350
Now we can see all this
a little more clearer

302
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,030
and represent what we have
just saw earlier:

303
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,000
the RB resistance, RC resistance,
the controlled current source

304
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,360
and the conductance at the input,
or the resistance at the input.

305
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,900
And here's the transistor as we have seen.

306
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,830
It's amazing, because
we have a completely linear circuit.

307
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,080
We forget this, we do not see anywhere

308
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,030
content components, why?

309
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,192
Because they are hidden in GM and GBE.

310
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:49,744
If I want to write the value of GM,
I would have written

311
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:54,816
Gm = IC0/UT.

312
00:18:56,144 --> 00:19:02,176
If I want to watch the current, or rather the GBE,
I just have to write it's GM/β.

313
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,220
I absolutely have the value

314
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:11,680
of GM and GBE, because

315
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,500
IC0 divided by β gives me
the current IB and I have all

316
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,020
that is needed in there,
everything is known.

317
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,460
As long as we calculated the IC0,
we found 5 milliamps

318
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,760
you put this value here.

319
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,550
UT is known, so you have
the transistor GM value.

320
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,290
You take the GM, you divide
by the β you find the

321
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,570
GBE value and replace it by its value,

322
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,816
the RC resistance is known,
the RB resistance is known and

323
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:44,420
that's it, you have a voltage V1
and have a voltage V2.

324
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,900
But the voltage V2 is very easy to write.

325
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,440
This voltage V2 is this current here

326
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,008
which is this tiny Ic which
is equal to GMVBE

327
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,520
passing in this direction.

328
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:03,008
That is the GMVBE

329
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,400
which multiplies the resistor RC.

330
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,264
Therefore, V2 = -GMVBE.

331
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,880
It is a current flowing through a resistor.

332
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,120
It will generate a voltage by ohm's law

333
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,060
which multiplies the resistor RC.

334
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,210
That's it, the output voltage is directly

335
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,920
proportional to the variation
of the input voltage

336
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,850
V1 and VBE because VBE
and V1 is the same thing,

337
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,950
multiplied by the GM which
gave us this current.

338
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,260
The current was converted into
a voltage by passing it through

339
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,792
a resistor, it become an output voltage.

340
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,730
If now you want to watch what happens

341
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,000
like the relationship between
V1 and V2, you just do it.

342
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,180
V2/V1, it's called

343
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,150
a voltage gain, that is to say,
we took V1, it was

344
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,264
multiplied by something to give us V2.

345
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,424
This is something,
it is what I will write here.

346
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:11,632
V2 is the -GMV1 which

347
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,960
is VBE, the same thing multiplied by RC

348
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,000
divided by the V1 here.

349
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,272
V1 will simplify, it gives me a gain equal

350
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,936
to -GMxRC.

351
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,940
And now, you just made a voltage gain

352
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,168
with a minus sign to say that
there is a phase difference.

353
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,460
If you apply a sinusoidal input voltage,

354
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,620
you find a 180 ° phase shift in respect to the

355
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,930
voltage that you see at the output.

356
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,160
It was converted to a voltage V2
that appears from here to

357
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,790
here or from here to here,
but it's the same thing.

358
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,900
Why ? Because in AC mode,
these two are short-circuited.

359
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,170
You remember it,
it comes here, so whether you

360
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,490
see the change here or here,

361
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,300
it's the same because
it's the same voltage V2.

362
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,860
And that's how we determine
what is called gain

363
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,550
in voltage and we have
seen that we just completed a

364
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,440
voltage amplifier:
we apply to it a voltage V1

365
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,736
and it gives us a voltage V2
and the voltage V2 is multiplied by this.

366
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:19,850
One has only to calculate
the value of this which is

367
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,830
(-IC0 / UTxRC) and

368
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,870
here I will write IC0xRC too,
it is nothing other than this.

369
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,408
That's the IC0.

370
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:36,608
And that, is the RC so, the voltage

371
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,192
you see here, I'll call VRC, well it is

372
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,410
the voltage I will even write in red because it's

373
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:49,136
a DC component, it is VRC/UT,

374
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,440
the thermodynamic voltage.

375
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,260
So we see that we made
a gain which will multiply,

376
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,072
that will give me the voltage V2.

377
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,910
When I multiply this by V1
multiplied by the DC component

378
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,920
that I see here, I divided it by

379
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,448
thermodynamic voltage of 26 millivolts
at room temperature, it gives me V2.

380
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,370
Look at the power of polarization,

381
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,864
it's really IC0 that did everything.

382
00:23:17,392 --> 00:23:21,070
So the IC0 you imposed here,
the resistor value you

383
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,976
selected, the DC component
we chose that's worth 5 volts,

384
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,672
you remember, it was calculated.

385
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:31,536
This, it gives us the VRC = 5 volts,
we found that

386
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:35,920
it is equal to 5, here we have 10 volts
so we are left with 5 volts here.

387
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,580
That's 5 volts divided by 26 millivolts, you

388
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,620
multiply it by any changes here,
you'll find it at the output.

389
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,880
So this is what will
allow us to do what we'll

390
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,220
later call the function of
a common transmitter with

391
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,920
a based polarization diagram
by a base resistor

392
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,010
that brought the current IC0
to become fixed in

393
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,000
applying an IB0 current to the input.

394
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,600
Here is the same diagram,
a little clearer, written

395
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,530
now with the values ​​we obtained.

396
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,650
The GM transconductance,
if I take into account values

397
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,860
calculated, it will give
me 126 milliamperes per volt.

398
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,568
So I have a numerical value of this GM.

399
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:24,920
The gain, the same calculation
that I showed you, I

400
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,630
remind you it is -GMRC.
We saw it and I repeat it

401
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,160
a second time, because this,
to calculate it,

402
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,760
it's much faster to see it:
it's that, as soon as you

403
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,940
take a diagram like this
and you put a resistance,

404
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,140
you apply a current in there, you're going

405
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,170
to end up with the voltage drop
here and

406
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,672
this voltage drop is this term.

407
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:49,536
So that's IC0xRC.

408
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:52,130
So we have not yet applied anything yet,

409
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,480
we simply imposed IC0 and had a resistance

410
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,940
of RC loads and we will find it in this

411
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,060
application, well in this application
or in any

412
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,520
other application,
gives us a value once

413
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,410
divided by UT, it gives
us directly the gain and

414
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,860
we will find that the gain
is 192 or one hundred ninety-two,

415
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,810
if you are in Switzerland
or if you are in France or

416
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,920
elsewhere, you would have said maybe 192.

417
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,860
With a minus sign in front,
so you end up with

418
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,660
a ratio between
the output voltage divided by the

419
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,780
input voltage, if you multiply by a gain V1

420
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,900
equal to 192, you get
an output voltage that is

421
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,270
significantly higher
than the input voltage.

422
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,570
That's how we calculate
the circuit and replace

423
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,600
the transistor, we replace
the voltage sources.

424
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,712
All that is continuous becomes
a short-circuit to earth in an AC diagram.

425
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:48,530
And the transistor takes the linear

426
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,760
diagram we extracted in
the first part of this course.

427
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,480
I want to finish this video
with transistor imperfections

428
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,140
we had not seen until today.

429
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,710
We have always considered
that the current and voltage in

430
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,070
a transistor, so if you want
to see the current change

431
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,460
with respect to voltage, we said that it is

432
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,200
an ideal current source, it's like

433
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,704
we had a curve that was like this.

434
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,696
And unfortunately this is not the case.

435
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,170
In a transistor, there is a phenomenon
that occurs

436
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,110
such that, you remember

437
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,480
when the transistor
was presented as a sandwich

438
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,230
in which there is a synoptic diagram to

439
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,550
show that there is a base,
there is a collector and a

440
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,008
transmitter and we are in between the two.

441
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,060
So it turns out that
when the transistor you polarize

442
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:48,650
the collector-base junction
and you increase the voltage.

443
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,930
So in other words, the more
you increase the voltage

444
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:58,224
VCE, the more the junction or collector-base
voltage increases with it. Why ?

445
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,140
Because this tension, it is almost

446
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,830
constant, it does not move,
it is of the order of UJ.

447
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,030
The VBE0, when the transistor
conducts, it will give you

448
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:11,040
VBE value, the junction voltage.

449
00:27:11,472 --> 00:27:13,696
So every time you increase
this voltage here,

450
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,840
given that it was constant,
so the latter, increases with it.

451
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,270
And when you increase it
like this, what happens is,

452
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,460
there is a depression region
in the PN junction that will

453
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,470
increase with it, from this side.

454
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,000
So it munches part of the base
and we talk of

455
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,630
the active part of the base,
it becomes increasingly

456
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,770
low when the collector-transmitter voltage
increases with it.

457
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,770
In reality, what happens is,
when this tension

458
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,880
increases, it increases with it
because it is equal to this plus this.

459
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,680
Therefore it increases with it
and when it increases,

460
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,750
your base becomes smaller.

461
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,030
When the base increasingly becomes
small as an active area,

462
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,140
the combination of the electrons
that takes place in the

463
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,570
base or holes, depends on whether you have

464
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:05,792
an NPN or PNP transistor, makes sure that
the base current, it reduces with it.

465
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:09,648
Therefore, the collector current,

466
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,700
will follow it: if it increases,
it increases with it, or if

467
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,750
it reduces, it reduces with it.

468
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,020
So it will take you
to the slope shown here.

469
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:22,000
So, I'll delete this red line and you can

470
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,630
now see that the output characteristic has

471
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,750
a slope and all these tensions,
sorry,

472
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:35,072
all these slopes here meet at
a voltage called the voltage "Early".

473
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,560
And this voltage Early, it is noted

474
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,590
as a voltage VA, it is negative because,

475
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,040
when you pull this line here, it will join in

476
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,770
a point and when you see
the slope of the line here.

477
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,000
And if you take your transistor,
you polarize it

478
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,210
by applying a given IC0 current,
therefore, suppose you

479
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,896
put a current IC0 that's equal to
six milliamps ... sorry, excuse me.

480
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,950
If you put a current that's here

481
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,940
and you put a VCE0 voltage
on your transistor terminals,

482
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:12,090
if the VCE0 voltage drops,

483
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,976
you will end up with another current,
and vice versa.

484
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,310
What will happen is that
this slope, it will

485
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,580
have to change the behavior
of your transistor between

486
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,540
the collector and the transmitter.

487
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,256
If we look at this triangle here.

488
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:28,850
So I'll try to draw it better.

489
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,820
So if I look at this triangle
and then I look at a

490
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,000
polarized current IC0 VCE0 and I look at

491
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,480
what's happening with the VCE voltage
when the voltage increases,

492
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,900
or decreases, I'll find myself
with such a similar triangle.

493
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,730
Here I have two triangles that are similar,
from here to here, I have VA.

494
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,520
From here to here, I'll end up with a VCE0.

495
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,230
And from here to here,
I have the original polarized current

496
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,310
before there was a bit of dynamic
on the terminals of my transistor.

497
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,780
So I can write that the slope
I see here, if I

498
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,832
am here, or here, or here,
it depends on this IC0 divided by

499
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,624
the voltage Early which is from here to here,

500
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,024
plus the polarization voltage,
whether this or this or this.

501
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:24,368
So it gives me IC0/VA+IC0.

502
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:26,220
The voltage VA is high enough,

503
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,080
the supply that we use
in low voltage transistors,

504
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,540
may vary between 5-15 volts or 20 volts.

505
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,710
Therefore, when we compare
a voltage of a hundred volts

506
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,560
that depends on your transistor, so that's

507
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,440
something that is reflected
in the characteristic

508
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,424
of the transistor,
this is something you're given.

509
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,160
So the voltage Early, you can consider the

510
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,470
voltage Early and neglect
the polarization voltage

511
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,088
you get with regard to this Early voltage,

512
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,890
which will take you to an output
conductance that will be

513
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,350
an approximation of IC0 divided by VA.

514
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,170
That's how we calculated it.

515
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,620
So again, we are left
with the polarization current

516
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,830
IC0 divided by a voltage that we should

517
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,910
give you, or you should be able
to measure it in a

518
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,400
transistor when you trace
its output characteristic.

519
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,580
What we do often is:
we measure, we change the

520
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,620
VCE0 voltage and we look
at what's going on with

521
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,900
the IC0 current and we extrapolate
the slope and it allows us

522
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,140
to calculate the voltage VA
when drawing this line

523
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,650
until we get to a current IC = 0 so we can

524
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,680
find the voltage UA, otherwise
the manufacturers will give it to you.

525
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,600
And we found that it is mainly
the polarization current

526
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,440
and a value given
by the manufacturer, which

527
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,904
is determined by your components.

528
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,550
So again, it is you
who will decide and it is

529
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,590
because of your polarization current
that will give you

530
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,750
a conductance output or
a resistance output.

531
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:06,960
We will now change
the pattern of our transistor

532
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,380
taking into account what we just observed.

533
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,390
Therefore, there is an additional defect.

534
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:14,030
Remember when we analyzed the large

535
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,680
signal patterns, we talked about
the DC model of the transistor?

536
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,390
We said a transistor can
be replaced by a source

537
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,280
of controlled current when working in DC,

538
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,650
we replace the base-transmitter
voltage by a voltage drop

539
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,520
of the order of UJ,
we replace the collector current

540
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,810
with the β of the transistor
given by a manufacturer

541
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,100
multiplied by the base polarization
current, which gives us the IC0.

542
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,304
And there is an output conductance we call and multiply
by the base polarization current, which gives us the IC0.

543
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:42,500
And there is an output conductance called

544
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,490
GCE, which is IC0/VA.

545
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,360
Here, I should have put
approximately equal, because

546
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,056
we just saw that we have neglected
the voltage UCE0.

547
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,760
The small signals model that we derived
from this transistor is this.

548
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,720
And, in this small signals model,
we need to add the

549
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,530
output conductance that adds itself.

550
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,460
So earlier,
we did not have this, we simply

551
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,660
said the transistor behaves like a

552
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,344
resistor equal to 1/GBE between the base
and the transmitter and a controlled current source.

553
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:15,000
There, I have to take into

554
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,410
account the output resistance
that appears, which is

555
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,020
1/GCE and I have to add
the value of 1/GCE.

556
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,810
So, I end up with the values ​​that we had

557
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,180
calculated and I added the GCE.

558
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:33,248
So, look carefully: IC0, IC0/β,

559
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,504
which is IB0 and IC0.

560
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,080
So everything is related to the choice
of this polarizing current IC0.

561
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,810
As soon as you set it,
you can calculate GCE,

562
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:48,040
GM, and GM GBE and it

563
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,570
will give you all this model
with numerical values

564
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,770
which is proportional to your IC0, why?

565
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,340
Because VA is given by a manufacturer.

566
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,400
UT is 26 millivolts.

567
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,550
β is given by the manufacturer
of your transistor,

568
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,170
everything is known and
its upon you to get IC0.

569
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,000
So this is the most important
task of a designer

570
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,770
when he polarizes his transistor,
what is the value of

571
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,630
IC0 that he would put in his transistor.

572
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,800
So it comes from this model here.

573
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,530
When calculating IC0, it is when
we are in DC mode and that is

574
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,260
what will give us the value
we spread here and

575
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,070
immediately we have the different values.

576
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,512
Here is the diagram of NPN and PNP.

577
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:30,360
So here, there is absolutely
no difference between this and this.

578
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,010
There are really the same
expressions found here.

579
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,344
I noted below conditions and
would like to emphasize on them.

580
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,488
If you look at that GBE = IC0 / βUT,

581
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,872
in other words, GM / β.

582
00:34:49,312 --> 00:34:51,648
GM is IC0 / UT.

583
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:58,032
GCE is IC0 / VA.We said VA

584
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,328
is known, β is known, UT is known.

585
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,616
So all these things are known.

586
00:35:06,128 --> 00:35:09,110
In practice, we assign values to VA where,

587
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,560
we know that it is between 50 and 100,

588
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,310
or even 120 or more.

589
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,600
β, for a low power transistor, or rather low

590
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,856
voltage and low power,
is of the order of 100 to 300.

591
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,688
UT is in the order of 26 millivolts
at room temperature.

592
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:33,110
So, this relationship makes sens.

593
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,570
UT is 26 millivolts, it is significantly lower

594
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,920
perhaps 100 times this value, it is clearly

595
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,280
less than something,

596
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,920
Don't forget that these 26 millivolts
here multiplied by

597
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,770
100, it's still well below a hundred volts.

598
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,140
So if you look at
this relationship here and you

599
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,580
try to write 1 / GCE, 1 / GBE, 1 / GM, you

600
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:00,800
will end up with this:
1 / GCE is VA / I0,

601
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,690
this is a resistor.

602
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,270
this, it's a resistor.

603
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,460
It's also the unit, it will give you as

604
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,750
a resistance 1 / GM, in terms of units.

605
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,800
So you're going to say I0, I0, I0,
it divides all these.

606
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,000
So you may well say: VA is more

607
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,240
than β UT, what we just got here
and this relationship is valid.

608
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,560
So this brings us to this reflection: it will be

609
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,670
in gold this relationship
when we go into practice.

610
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,410
Because you will see later
that this is what will

611
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,070
allow us impedances,
to see the impedances at the

612
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,940
accesses of our set ups and
we are discovering that

613
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,120
1/GCE is much bigger than 1/GBE it is

614
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,210
much bigger than 1/GM,
and that's a fact, it is a reality!

615
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,660
And later, our set ups,
they will be based on a

616
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,530
reflection, on this inequality
where a designer must

617
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:57,630
know that the lowest is
always 1/GM and

618
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,936
the highest, is still 1/GCE.

619
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,910
And it's with this decision, the 1/GBE,
is between the two.

620
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,610
But that's a high resistance.

621
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,730
This is a low resistance in value and this

622
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,230
is a resistance between the two.

623
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,220
And this is what will determine,
during the designing,

624
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,610
what setup to use and
we will see it in details later.

625
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,850
One of the transistor imperfections is its

626
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,464
temperature dependence.

627
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:30,848
I take the exponential law of
the ICF2VBE transistor.

628
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,910
Unfortunately, I say unfortunately this

629
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,968
feature here moves in this direction.

630
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,568
Therefore, it moves like this,
when the temperature increases.

631
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,660
So when I am -5 ° I am with

632
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,104
a feature that is here.

633
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:53,850
It begins to heat, to become hotter.

634
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,680
The transistor is in a usage condition

635
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,580
that makes it heat, or it has
a warm atmosphere inside

636
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,780
or close to a car engine : we start

637
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,870
when it's cold, it's -5 °
at a certain time and the engine

638
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,390
begins to heat, then
it continues to heat and

639
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,110
unfortunately it is mutating,

640
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,920
its characteristic moves in this direction
when the temperature increases.

641
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,920
This will leads us
to a drift in temperature,

642
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,304
a temperature change ΔVBE/ΔT, ΔT of

643
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,890
- 2millivolts per degree centigrade,
which is a value pretty

644
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,560
well controlled, correct enough,
that we even use to

645
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,810
make a thermometer by
measuring the difference of

646
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:42,128
temperature, by measuring
the variation of the voltage ΔVBE.

647
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,784
Same for the β, the β of
the transistor varies

648
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,250
with the temperature variation.

649
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,704
This is of the order of 0.8% to 1.5%

650
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:57,820
with the temperature.

651
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,570
I would like to emphasize this:
it is excluded

652
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,752
to consider later, because of this drift

653
00:39:08,752 --> 00:39:12,430
in temperature that moves
the temperature like this,

654
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,650
that we will one day apply on a transistor

655
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,150
a constant VBE voltage.

656
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,190
Because, if you apply
a constant VBE on this

657
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,730
curve here, look at your transistor,
if it's cold, it

658
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,184
is in a condition where it is -5 degrees,
it is almost blocked.

659
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,848
There is no current flowing through it.

660
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,260
The same transistor,
if you want to apply a voltage

661
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,290
VBE0 and that will

662
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:45,024
apply a current IC0 which is here.

663
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,690
If you apply it at
a temperature of 25 °, it will

664
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,488
give you a current IC0 which is here.

665
00:39:56,512 --> 00:39:59,630
If, suddenly, the transistor heats by

666
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,910
an external condition, suddenly,
the current passing through it increases.

667
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,110
You will see later that
the power dissipated in

668
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,960
your transistor is proportional to this
current then multiplied by the VCE.

669
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,800
So if you want to multiply
this IC0 that just increased, not because of

670
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,200
you or because of your set up,
it is because of this

671
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,500
transistor characteristic
which moved: it is

672
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,744
at 5.55 °, it further heated
a little more, this curve

673
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,600
will continue to decline,
to move in this direction.

674
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,580
And same for the current which
will increase in your transistor.

675
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:38,920
Therefore, the more the characteristic
moves, the more the current

676
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,330
increases, the more the power dissipation
increases and your transistor wraps.

677
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:48,512
So it will heat up itself
because of this effect.

678
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:52,880
So it is absolutely out of
question to one day play with

679
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,770
the VBE0 by imposing it.

680
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,000
Generally, we apply the current IC0,
but we will have the

681
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,280
time to see it in detail later.

682
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,780
And to finish this video
I would like to show

683
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,440
a second imperfection, or third imperfection

684
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,870
of the transistor due to the fact
that your transistor, until today,

685
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,120
has been shown as if there is no capacity.

686
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:18,370
This is not true: your transistor
has a parasitic capacity.

687
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,776
It is not visible,
it is part of the transistor,

688
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,232
the junction itself,
the housing and other things

689
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,560
that will impose a capacity
between base and collector.

690
00:41:28,992 --> 00:41:31,696
Same, there is one between
the base and the transmitter.

691
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:35,296
Same, there is one between
the collector and transmitter.

692
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:38,540
Therefore, between the three
ping transistors, there is a

693
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,904
parasite component of
capacitive nature that is added.

694
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,240
I have not added to the small signals diagram

695
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,610
this ability here,
because it is one of the lowest.

696
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,370
We can induce it if we make a bad circuit

697
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,456
and we put two wires of the collector and
transmitter and we create a parasitic capacity.

698
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,820
I should have added it here,

699
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,090
but I have not added it
compared to the other two.

700
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,360
I added that of base-transmitter
I added that of base-collector.

701
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,640
You will see later,
the most dangerous is this one.

702
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:13,340
The base-collector capacity,
it often connects the input to the output.

703
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,600
So your signal, which is supposed
to change a voltage

704
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,710
to generate a current,
can go through this capacity

705
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,790
right out and it will give us what we

706
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:27,000
call in the control jargon, a 0 of transfer function

707
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:31,328
therefore, a short circuit between
input and output via this capacity.

708
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,450
I would just mention that to end with this

709
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,490
capacitive coupling phenomenon
that can be created by

710
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:43,610
parasitic capacities which
are associated with the components

711
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:48,640
and at the encapsulation
of your device, or sometimes

712
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,944
in the way it is connected in a circuit.

713
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,110
In conclusion, with what
we have just seen, we just

714
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,950
put the transistor in a diagram.

715
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,350
We have seen that we begin by polarizing it

716
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:04,810
with a constant current and
it is through this constant current

717
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:07,780
we will be able to calculate
all the small signals parameters

718
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,280
of your transistor and you can replace

719
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,540
your transistor by
the famous small signals diagram ,

720
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,824
called the AC diagram.

721
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,440
And I remind you that, as soon as
we talk of AC diagram

722
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,840
everything that concerns
constant voltage source turns

723
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,096
into short circuit, it's like a zero resistor.

724
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,360
And I have not mentioned
all the current sources.

725
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,450
And of course, it will be replaced
by an infinite resistor,

726
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,190
that is to say,
you simply remove it from your

727
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,410
circuit and you will end up with
a completely linear diagram,

728
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,944
which contains resistors and current sources.

729
00:43:40,944 --> 00:43:42,390
As we are used to dealing

730
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,880
with linear circuits, we will
be able to solve it and it

731
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,030
will allow us to go further with

732
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,376
transistor based linear applications.
