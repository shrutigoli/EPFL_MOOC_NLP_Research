1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,586
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,000
Today we'll tackle small signals models .

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,160
Small signal models
it's really the essential

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,133
of transistor use in the analogic circuits.

5
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:17,870
As you know, the world around us is more

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,500
analog in nature than digital.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,870
And we want to make linear functions

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,690
and the transistor in its normal operation,

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,440
should allow us to use it

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,620
in functionalities mainly analog.

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,330
So we'll spend some time to model it

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,380
so that it is quite linear
between the input voltage

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,370
and the output current
which is of interest to us.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,380
So understand this transistor
capability to play

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,630
its transconductance role.
To study the different

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,070
principles, how we make a transistor

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,000
useable as a linear analog component, we

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,680
will study it first by looking at

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,200
the unique feature that allows us
namely the normal mode.

20
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:09,540
Therefore a transistor which is used as

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,540
component in its linear region, should

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,900
not be neither saturated nor blocked.

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,900
And if you remember this,
you begin to understand

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,530
that all along this part
your transistor is in normal mode.

25
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,200
And you will always check that it is never

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,250
saturated or blocked
when we apply to it a voltage

27
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,000
that can push it towards
saturation or blocking.

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,950
So, it was very clear
that saturation or blocking

29
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,080
is due to your circuit and
not the transistor itself.

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,670
If your circuit blocks
the transistor by a supply voltage

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,270
or prevents current from flowing in for a

32
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,160
certain dynamic, well know that your transistor is

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,890
no longer in normal mode. So the transistor
should be in normal mode.

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,310
It is mostly used for analog circuits.

35
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:00,706
And we will introduce
the concept of the increment.

36
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,960
Increments, it means tiny variations.

37
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,560
And we call this, the small signals.

38
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,490
Which gave the name to this
model that we will study

39
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,130
called the  small signals transistor model or

40
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,780
model for increase. I would like to come back

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,300
to the transistor seen with
the symbol and remind you very

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,290
quickly it is nonlinear.

43
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,840
Look at the current controlled
by the voltage, it

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,210
gives us an exponential law
so it is not linear.

45
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,950
If you look here,
you'll see the same for the

46
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,300
base current in the transistor since

47
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,840
the relationship is linear with Ic0, first

48
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,440
approximation, we have
to divide it by the β of

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,426
the transistor and we get the current Ib0.

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,800
So Ic0 and Ib0 give us two laws that
are exponential and not linear.

51
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,100
And we will see this law that is here.

52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,280
Here we drew Ic.

53
00:02:56,373 --> 00:02:59,000
I can easily write it

54
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:02,480
= β.Ib.

55
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:07,320
And this allows us
to see that Ib is nothing

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,560
other than this exponential curve
also divided by β.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,120
Therefore the transistor when
it will be used, it should be conducting.

58
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:17,973
So we said here, it is blocked.

59
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:21,510
Here it will conduct and the saturation,
is due to something

60
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,580
related to your circuit.
So what is certain

61
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,800
is that you have to apply to your

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
transistor, a current
called polarization current.

63
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:30,000
Why do we do this ?

64
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,180
It's that we want linearize the transitor

65
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,890
function that is nonlinear.

66
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,150
Look at it very well.
It is a nonlinear function.

67
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,220
It's all that. But we will focus on an

68
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,460
operating point
and it is called operating point.

69
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,020
We will go to that point.

70
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,460
We apply a direct current
in the transistor that will

71
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,800
generate a given Vbe0 voltage.

72
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,850
And once there is this current
that flows in the

73
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,190
transistor and this Vbe0 voltage, we will

74
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,580
focus on a small portion of
this exponential law

75
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,530
to say, and if ever we limit the

76
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,500
dynamics of the signal
we impose between the base and

77
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,610
the transmitter, this variation about
a few mV,

78
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,960
very very few dynamics
between the base-transmitter

79
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,950
junction, which controls the current, it is sure

80
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,960
and certain that this change,
this range will

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,250
generate an almost linear current
regarding it.

82
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,090
And if we say almost linear,
it is as if it had been

83
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,650
a small line that was
completely confounded

84
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,190
with the characteristic itself
of the transistor.

85
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,740
And we call it, the tangent
at an operating point.

86
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,770
Someone who understood the operation,
has understood that first,

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,226
we need to apply it.

88
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:50,300
That's the first thing.

89
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,830
So we can not use a transistor in an

90
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,000
AC mode without applying a DC component.

91
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,030
So we will all the time superimpose
the AC and DC

92
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,430
in order to use the transistor.

93
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,320
You must bring it to
a selected operating point

94
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,920
because it is you who will choose the

95
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:12,960
the most important parameter
and you will see that it is

96
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,100
the most important thing,
it is the polarization current.

97
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,160
Nobody looks at what is Vbe0.

98
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:22,190
This would give something
only if you replace it,

99
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,090
Ic0 and you look for the
corresponding Ib0 provided that

100
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,250
you know the Is,
I remind you that the

101
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,480
thermodynamic voltage is 26 mV.

102
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,070
You have a Vbe0 voltage,
but no one will see

103
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,240
what it is,because
we're polarizing the current.

104
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,270
Once we do that, we will say what is
the slope of the tangent here.

105
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,350
And then we will move to
a variable component around

106
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,840
Vbe0 which will be superimposed
around this value

107
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,000
which we do not know, the Vbe0.

108
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,300
And we will see
that a variation will be seen,

109
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,650
that goes around Ic0,
that had been applied in the

110
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,820
transistor, to vary the current here.

111
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,050
And that's it, we have a line between the

112
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,510
variation of the input voltage versus
the variation of the output current.

113
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,760
And that's the famous transconductance
of the transistor that

114
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,250
we seek to define and model.

115
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,490
So I repeat, we will no longer
look at the transistor

116
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,000
as such because
it will contain two things.

117
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,090
It will contain what is in red,
namely everything

118
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:34,146
that concerns direct current, DC voltage.

119
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,260
So this voltage, will be continuous.

120
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,550
So there will be a variety
of continuous components.

121
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,300
But that is independent
of the use of transistors

122
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:45,380
because after we move to
a model so it is not

123
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,660
the reality it is a model we will
confound in a non linear law

124
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,173
that will come out of
this analytical law here,

125
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:55,550
a transconductance
which is linear because it

126
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,000
will bind a variation
of the input voltage to the

127
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,100
variation of the voltage, the output current.

128
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,700
That is what we will do.

129
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,310
Continue the reasoning
around this basis, that we

130
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,530
started with a DC component on which we will

131
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,250
add a variable component.

132
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,840
And here is the variable component.

133
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,746
We said the ΔVbe.

134
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:19,050
Notice I wrote a lowercase, what is in red

135
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,100
I wrote in capital letters
and it is constant and what

136
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,590
varies with time, and there I drew a

137
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,093
sinusoidal voltage whose
amplitude is a few mV,

138
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,330
very small, hence the name increase.

139
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,826
And this variation will
control over this curve here,

140
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,500
on the exponential law, the current
that goes through your transistor.

141
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,630
And that's it, if you admit that the Gm

142
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,630
of the transistor is a component
that will link the voltage variation

143
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,000
to a current change,that's it you're

144
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,760
about to give a linear model because you

145
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,900
have confounded a straight
line end  on a part of the exponential

146
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,100
and you have found
a law that will convert U

147
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,410
to I and it is called the transconductance,
the famous law of the transistor.

148
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,700
And now this is what
I would like to extract on the Gm.

149
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,426
So if Gm is a straight line on one point

150
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,660
of an analytical expression it is
of course the derivative at this point.

151
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,590
This everyone knows that
the tangent at a point on an

152
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,590
analytical law corresponds
to the derivative in which we

153
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:41,773
made a point which is the famous
operating point the Vbe0 Ic0.

154
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,710
So we will apply it.

155
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,860
So the transistor
itself has this relationship.

156
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,410
And if I want to derive
this relationship, so to extract

157
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,670
the tangent of the slope
at a point, I derive this current

158
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,540
over this tension and
then I replace in the derivative

159
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,760
the point in where I am seeing this

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,666
curve and in this case it concerns
current Ic0 and Vbe0.

161
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,870
And I get this relationship
that gives me the slope of the

162
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,060
tangent which now allows me to convert any

163
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,090
variation here in a variation
that will appear here

164
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,930
in current with ΔI which is equal to

165
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,146
ΔV.Gm with a Gm equal to Ic0/Ut.

166
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:33,770
It deserves nevertheless to be looked at.

167
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:37,000
When I insisted earlier to tell you that

168
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,000
the polarization current Ic0
is very important, here.

169
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,890
So that's your choice,
it is you who will apply

170
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,660
a polarization current
with a given amount.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,940
We will learn later how
to define this Ic0 current.

172
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,510
So as soon as you set current Ic0 by your

173
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,450
polarization layout, which will allow you to

174
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,290
determine on which point of
your curve you will be,

175
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,190
this is it, your Gm will have a value, it is

176
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,120
directly proportional to Ic0.

177
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,670
Remember that Ut, it's known, it is a value

178
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,920
equal to 26mV at room temperature.

179
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,546
So as soon as you set Ic0
it's like you set Ib0.

180
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:25,200
Ib0 is the famous Ic0/β

181
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,440
so you'll find  Ib0 = Ic0/β.

182
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,146
So similarly, if you look
at the transistor and you

183
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,420
look at what happens between
the base and transmitter, you

184
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,700
will say, if Ic0 gave us the Gm what will

185
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,550
happen upon something that
would later be connected here?

186
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,140
I have two fingers that are
placed on a termination, it's

187
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,000
as if I look at a resistance
at the edge of which

188
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,690
I have a Vbe voltage and current Ib,
of course I speak of

189
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,200
values ​​that vary over time, it is like

190
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,790
a resistance and we call it 1/Gbe whose

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,426
Gbe conductance is again the
derivative of dIb/dVbe.

192
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,930
So this law you see here
at an operation point

193
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,530
which is Ib0 Vbe0 and Ib0
is proportional

194
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,026
to Ic/β, and you will find this.

195
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,746
And once you recognize here
the famous Ic0.

196
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,520
Which says Ic0 for a transistor and given beta
says Ib0 is also known

197
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,260
So we end up with,
between base and transmitter,

198
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,620
a kind of resistance that will draw
some current when

199
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,210
there is a voltage variation and that

200
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,260
resistance, linearized, give us something

201
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,800
proportional to the famous Gm
we just calculated.

202
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,510
So the analysis sequences
lead us each time

203
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,370
to apply a polarized current, which gives us

204
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,920
immediately a value of transconductance.

205
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,000
So as soon as you have applied
the Ic0 you know you

206
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,310
will achieve a Gm.
And once you have applied

207
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,930
this Ic0 you will immediately
find your Gbe and

208
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,400
this Gbe is proportional to this,
it is the same Ic0, the β

209
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,180
and in the transistor,
it belongs to the value you

210
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,480
get with your transistor and the Ut is given.

211
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,530
And that's it, the transistor is now  linear.

212
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,106
For all that is AC,

213
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,940
it behaves between these
two points and this point like

214
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,720
a transconductance linking the variation

215
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,430
and converts it to current .

216
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,760
So at this Ic0, when it encounters
a ΔVbe, so when it

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,373
encounters a small Vbe of T,
it will add here Ic0+ (Ic of t).

218
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:55,150
And the same,
when it encounters a Vbe change

219
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,570
here, it will draw current in the base that is

220
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,750
proportional to this current ΔIb
and which is linked to it.

221
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,860
So everything is in the Ic0.

222
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,010
Once we set Ic0,
we've finally replaced the

223
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,720
transistor with a resistance
from here to there, a current source

224
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,600
from here to here and
this is achieved by the

225
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,030
Gm, and this will be like a resistor
that draws current.

226
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,370
And that's it, we have seen
our transistor with the

227
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,760
model called the linear small signal model

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,040
it is indeed linear, you just have to see it

229
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,930
with this linearization merely
obtained by derivative.

230
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,060
Now I want to emphasize that.

231
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,066
What did we do to linearize?

232
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,250
We derived. We watched
a change in current,

233
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:43,760
divided by a voltage variation.

234
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,410
So in other words if you
do not have a voltage change

235
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:49,580
somewhere, if you have
a component somewhere

236
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,340
that has no voltage variation,
this gives us a value of 0.

237
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,020
So this is what will allow us to use

238
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,240
this model in a context in
which there is a circuit and

239
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,130
where there are fixed voltage sources.

240
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,360
The model of my transistor is now this.

241
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,620
If I ask you to replace the

242
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,340
transistor by its AC model,
what does that mean?

243
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,840
That means you have
polarized your transistor because

244
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,890
you put it in an already polarized circuit.

245
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,320
So you already know the famous Ic0.

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,480
And as we said, no one will look
at something else.

247
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,573
We will seek to apply Ic0
that will give us the Ib0

248
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,140
because there is the β of the transistor.

249
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,850
And once we get the Ib0, that's it
we have all this we

250
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:42,080
could immediately draw.

251
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,140
I can remove my transistor
as a layout,

252
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,010
replace it with a vision model,
that is to say

253
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,140
something that looks like
this and I repeat,

254
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,000
to be able to do this, i have to verify
that my circuit or my

255
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,410
transistor is not saturated or blocked.

256
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,100
This sentence is extremely
important, that is to say

257
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,650
you must check that later
when you are going

258
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,490
to vary Vbe and you will vary Ic, and this

259
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,490
is found in a circuit context,
you must check

260
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,000
for linearity to exist and the transistor

261
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,350
behaves like that, you must be
absolutely sure that

262
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,280
your transistor never comes
into saturation, never

263
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:25,520
will your transistor be blocked.

264
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,260
We will have the opportunity
to talk of it and this brings us to

265
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,950
talk about something called dynamics

266
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,010
which is one of the most
important parameters as to

267
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,430
designing a circuit.
When I applied this current

268
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,900
Ic0, I can take my transistor
(Ot) and replace it

269
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,773
by something like that.

270
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:45,020
So we go into a linear circuit analysis.

271
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,613
I have a resistance
which is equal to 1/Gbe.

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,600
I can write here Gbe or 1/Gbe,
it's the same.

273
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,810
It's up to me to know if I write
a Gbe conductance,

274
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,340
I must consider the relationship
between voltage and current

275
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:03,893
and if I speak of 1/Gbe it is
U = RI therefore  U = (1 / Gbe) .Ib.

276
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,693
But what is important here is to watch
these two relationships.

277
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,760
We have the famous Gm and the Gbe that

278
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,173
will be immediately calculated as soon
as you applied your Ic0 current.

279
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,330
This is an example with an NPN transistor,

280
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,420
it would give us the same thing
with a PNP transistor,

281
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,130
there is absolutely no difference,
it would give you

282
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,920
the same model and
the same values ​​for both.

283
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,870
And there you have the complete
diagram of two supplemantary transistors

284
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,120
where you remove this and replace the

285
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,040
linear model instead
when it concerns a circuit

286
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:48,040
especially where we look
at the changes, small

287
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,400
signals or increase.

288
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,000
Same for the PNP,
you replace it with this,

289
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,690
the expressions are exactly
the same, nothing changes.

290
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,700
Given that we have
a variation here Vbe and Veb

291
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,770
remain the same so it would
give us the same thing.

292
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,920
There is no difference problem
between the two

293
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,150
transistors, we apply the same laws.

294
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,330
We now have seen what to do with

295
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,480
a transistor when it is used
in a circuit context

296
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,700
replacing it with this model.

297
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,900
I would absolutely like to
repeat this sentence.

298
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,860
I just derive the current change

299
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,600
divided by a voltage change in a circuit.

300
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,170
I'll keep this state and with this state

301
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,140
I could replace my transistor
with a linear model

302
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,940
where the transistor is seen
as a resistor between the base

303
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,260
and transmitter which is equal to 1/Gbe.

304
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:46,770
It is seen as a controlled
current source between

305
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,840
the collector and the transmitter,
at the output, and which is controlled

306
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,840
by the input voltage Vbe.

307
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,500
To overcome this we must see
this in a context

308
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,740
of an example with
a full circuit because we

309
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,260
are, all the time, made to cohabit the

310
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,000
direct current with
variable voltage in a circuit

311
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,770
because the transistor would
never have found its

312
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,180
linear AC model if it had not
been polarized by a constant

313
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,130
current that will cause
constant tension all

314
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,490
around this transistor in
the complete circuit as we shall see.

315
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,040
So we'll soon move to the second video

316
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,410
which will follow a model
or rather a circuit that

317
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,026
shows us how we use this model.
