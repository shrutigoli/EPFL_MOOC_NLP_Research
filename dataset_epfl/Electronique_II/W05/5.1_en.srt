1
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,376
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:10,639
Today we will start a chapter

3
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:12,587
which will open the door on

4
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:15,587
the synthesis of amplifiers.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,250
So to begin that study of amplifiers,

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,619
first we will pass on
something called the

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,160
passive and active charge.

8
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:27,795
So we'll just make the difference
between a passive charge

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,157
that you know very well, a resistance

10
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:33,940
and an active charge
that will be the transistor.

11
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:35,902
Once you understand that difference,

12
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,672
we can move up in the
structure of the amplifier

13
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:42,277
we just quickly revisit the
polarization to fix the ideas,

14
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:44,027
we have a look at the diagrams,

15
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:46,546
the models we have already
done in previous chapters

16
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:49,406
quickly like that to see the structure

17
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,847
and the differents steps

18
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,417
for realise an amplifier

19
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,782
before addressing
the voltage amplifiers.

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,467
And there, we take the time to
analyze the voltage amplifiers

21
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:03,207
with passive charge
and with active charge

22
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:05,088
and after we pass

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,700
to push the characteristics
of these amplifiers

24
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:12,464
to get the best bandwidth
or increase the gain

25
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:16,306
before analyzing the
so-called voltage plus followers

26
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:19,914
more later we will see
the differential amplifiers.

27
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:22,223
And all that I tell you now

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,847
will lead us to achieve the
famous operational amplifier

29
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,747
and we will see that by
putting cascaded stages

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,019
we get the operational amplifier.

31
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,815
Just to remind you
what a charge is.

32
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,118
We know that a passive
charge is something,

33
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:43,186
it is something in this
style this is a law U

34
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:45,290
which is equal to the resistance

35
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:47,666
multiplied by the current.

36
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:51,495
And that is a current source.

37
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:53,797
If we disregard the resistance,

38
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:55,587
we do not see this resistance

39
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:58,139
and we look at what
a current source is

40
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:01,036
we known that as a current source,
it has a characteristic:

41
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,437
I according to U

42
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,273
which is something like that.

43
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:09,637
Thus there is a fixed current I zero

44
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:12,125
which is absolutely
independent of U.

45
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:14,655
Does that actually exist?

46
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:17,833
Probably with complex
tri-electronics circuits,

47
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:19,875
one can achieve something of this.

48
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:24,174
But generally, it has already
been learned that a transistor

49
00:02:24,373 --> 00:02:27,017
can be taken and a current
source can be made with,

50
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:29,056
because the output of a transistor

51
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:31,559
has a very high output impedance.

52
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:35,162
This output impedance R out
is the one that I symbolize here

53
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:38,660
and that we will find it every
time we make a current source,

54
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:41,604
it's the parasitic impedance
which is due to the fact

55
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:45,043
that the transistor still has
a sufficiently high resistance

56
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:47,866
that can even increased
and boosted. We will see how

57
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:50,991
or we have already seen that by
putting an assembly break elbow

58
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,976
we can improve the
output impedance.

59
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:54,719
Nevertheless,
this output resistance

60
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:57,165
can be extremely
high, which leads us

61
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,265
to the implementation
of a current source.

62
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:03,930
Why do I come back to these bases

63
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:07,492
of so-called passive
or active elements?

64
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:09,075
It's because I'm interested

65
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:12,245
in apply the relationship
that we had seen before:

66
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:13,155
that whenever

67
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,035
we wish to make a transistor assembly

68
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,661
and create an AU voltage gain,

69
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,097
we found that in absolute value

70
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:24,477
this gain, it is proportional to
the transistor transconductance

71
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:27,117
multiplied by a load resistor.

72
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:29,346
And if by chance,

73
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:32,015
we can use this load resistance

74
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:34,175
that we call RL as "load"

75
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,261
to increase the gain,

76
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,870
more this resistance is high,

77
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,804
more high is the gain.

78
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:46,408
Therefore the transconductance of a
transistor depends on its polarization

79
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,375
in contrast the resistance
load that will be put to

80
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,322
this transistor could be
very high, even infinity.

81
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,317
So if we do not possess
this resistance here

82
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:59,705
and we put a current
source like here

83
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:03,194
to a transistor that we
will connect just now

84
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,861
and you'll quickly see here

85
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:09,141
and we link that to that,

86
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:12,278
Well this transistor there,
it will do the conversion

87
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:16,412
delta U voltage into a I delta current

88
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:19,586
and which will go to
a very high resistance

89
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:21,394
and this very high resistance

90
00:04:21,454 --> 00:04:23,554
will ensure that
the gain increases.

91
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,024
And this kind of assembly

92
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:29,335
we will call it an "common emitter
of active load" assembly.

93
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:31,965
And that will make all
the difference in relation to ...

94
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,455
to rather connect a
resistor to the collector.

95
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:36,700
And you will see that

96
00:04:36,937 --> 00:04:37,878
this kind of installation,

97
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,511
it's typically what we will use
in integrated circuits later

98
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:42,760
and allowing

99
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,278
to get infinite gains as
an operational amplifier.

100
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,283
I repeat what I have
called an amplifier

101
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:55,365
and I will remember the
sequences of achievement

102
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:58,805
and I've added an AC amplifier.

103
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:00,371
So this is an amplifier

104
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:04,088
which can only
amplify the signals

105
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,799
of variable nature

106
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:09,084
of the  small signals
increments. Why?

107
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:11,328
Because if you
connect your amplifier

108
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:16,951
and you look at the 3 presentations
representations of your amp,

109
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:18,998
the actual pattern of the amp,

110
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,222
I chose one of the amp
possible polarizations

111
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:25,789
and I choose the one by which
I polarize the current in the base

112
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:29,701
by a resistance which brings
back the current from here

113
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:31,021
and injecte it into the base.

114
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:34,058
And this current multiplied
by the transistor beta

115
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,415
becomes a current of polarization IC0.

116
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,716
It's a way to do, that
is didactic very easy

117
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:43,857
which just requires a
resistor to be performed

118
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:45,456
and it polarizes the transistor.

119
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:46,875
Beside,

120
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:50,626
I showed what I call the small
signals model that we studied.

121
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,908
So if you remember

122
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:55,278
when you plug the
transistor in that way

123
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,838
and it is polarized,

124
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:59,526
we can ignore this scheme

125
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:02,110
and go to a scheme that
we draw on a piece of paper

126
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:03,996
to only see the transistor

127
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:05,304
when we apply to him

128
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:09,072
an increase or variation
or small variable signals.

129
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:12,832
So we will connect it
signals that vary in time

130
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,433
and as we are only interested in
the amplification of these variations,

131
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:19,633
and well continued tensions,
we make them disappear

132
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,208
because we will be interested
in all that is variable

133
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,473
so whose derivative
delta V on delta I

134
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,241
and the delta V on delta I of a
voltage source is a ground.

135
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,499
So we convert it into a model

136
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:34,261
that gets all fixed voltage sources

137
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:35,907
and brings them back to the ground.

138
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:39,044
And we replace the
transistor by those derived

139
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:40,765
therefore the different
impedances of

140
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,762
sight between base-emitter
collector-emitter

141
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:47,399
and the fact that there is
a controlled current source

142
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:50,905
and we replace the transistor by this.
So we've already seen all this

143
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:53,791
and made an analysis that from that,

144
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:58,196
we can represent thanks
to the circuit theory

145
00:06:58,393 --> 00:07:02,249
that any block having
a voltage at the input

146
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:04,887
which will be converted into
a voltage at the output.

147
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:09,034
It can be presented or represented
by the input impedance

148
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:11,536
an output impedance,
a controlled current source

149
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:13,990
and it's called the
equivalent quadrupole.

150
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:16,136
So from here to
there and the reality

151
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,400
from here to there,
this is the model

152
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:21,506
and the simplification
for us to be able to solve

153
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:24,395
and analyze transistor scheme.

154
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:28,607
Here is a simple vision

155
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,063
of what we'll see, but I
want to draw your attention

156
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,823
that when you put

157
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:37,415
your finger here or this pen there,

158
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:40,706
we will realize that here
I have a voltage difference

159
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:42,950
from here to there of DC nature

160
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,195
And I will continue this explanation

161
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:47,482
taking the polarization of transistor,

162
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:50,595
the one we were told that this is

163
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:55,459
the most appropriate polarization
when you have a passive load.

164
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:57,594
So the load is this one.

165
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,316
So we connected a load

166
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:02,166
in the transistor collector which is RL.

167
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:04,923
I repeat

168
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,946
the polarization of transistor,

169
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,775
the one we presented

170
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:12,436
as really being the
polarization to use,

171
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:15,232
which imposes a fixed potential

172
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:17,067
on the base.

173
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:20,067
And to generate a constant current IC0,

174
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:24,369
we impose a transistor
and a current IE0

175
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,054
in its transmitter.

176
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,230
Well, these two currents
are approximately the same

177
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:32,294
seeing the beta of the transistor
that exists between the two.

178
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:33,719
So in other words,

179
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,925
we impose the current IC0 via IE0

180
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:39,468
so it's a current that we
have imposed, but to get it

181
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:42,418
it was necessary to impose
a fixed voltage on the base.

182
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,027
I will repeat this phrase:

183
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:47,185
on the base, I have a VB0 voltage,

184
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,202
it is a BC voltage.

185
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:50,971
On the transmitter,

186
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:54,437
here I have a voltage VE0

187
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:56,259
and this tension there,

188
00:08:56,622 --> 00:09:00,025
she's VB0 minus the voltage UJ drop.

189
00:09:00,521 --> 00:09:02,682
So I have again a tension

190
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:07,548
which appears here,
which is of DC nature.

191
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,538
What happens here with
the tension at the collector?

192
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:12,375
Do I know it ? No.

193
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,612
It will depend on the load.

194
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,183
There, I have not drawn a load

195
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:17,203
But imagine that someone
accidentally

196
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:19,378
adds a load here, a resistance.

197
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:23,397
If you put a resistance there,

198
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,475
this resistance,

199
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:27,475
it will have a voltage drop here

200
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:30,029
and that voltage drop, it will be

201
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:34,784
equal to IC0 times RL.

202
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:38,752
So RL, your passive load exists.

203
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:40,597
The current of polarization

204
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,597
you need it, you just create it.

205
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:48,053
The voltage drop here,
it will make you a tension VC0

206
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:54,567
which is equal to VCC minus
the voltage we will call here VRL,

207
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,617
minus VRL and that's it !

208
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:02,571
This VC0 voltage,

209
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:04,564
it is defined, it is known,

210
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,776
it hadn't been brought to
a signal to be amplified,

211
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:11,075
but we already see that we
have a DC voltage here.

212
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:13,314
So I have a DC voltage there,

213
00:10:13,477 --> 00:10:16,314
I have a DC voltage there and
I have a DC voltage there,

214
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,017
and you just created it yourself

215
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:21,905
depending on the
required polarization

216
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,532
when you have a passive load

217
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:28,057
and we can know values
​​such as I just write here.

218
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,256
I would like to compare
it to this assembly.

219
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,025
I take my transistor,

220
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:34,506
and I put it here,

221
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,725
instead of putting a resistance

222
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:40,482
in the transmitter which
was essential for creating IE0

223
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,297
in this case IC0,

224
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:45,109
I directly connect to the ground

225
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,872
and I come and put it a current source,

226
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,633
so this ideal current source

227
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:51,995
that I just plug here

228
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:55,490
will impose a IC0 current
that will pass in my transistor.

229
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:57,876
This current there,
it will immediately

230
00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:00,876
generate a IB0 current

231
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:02,159
that will come from?

232
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:04,259
Well, it's coming from the
assembly which is here.

233
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:06,361
this assembly that I have not drawn.

234
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:09,208
What is the value
of VB0, do I know it?

235
00:11:09,308 --> 00:11:11,715
Yes ! VB0, it is actually

236
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:13,815
proportional to this VBE voltage

237
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,919
which is of the order
of magnitude of UJ.

238
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:18,681
While this tension there,
it will be fixed.

239
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,681
So this almost
constant tension

240
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:24,152
depends on the stage
just before we plug.

241
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:26,311
So if you plug
something here,

242
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:29,372
this thing that would come before
the stage that would come before,

243
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:33,557
should accept the fact that a
voltage VB0 is imposed on it.

244
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:36,545
What happens with
this VC0 tension?

245
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:39,717
Do I know it? Absolutely not !

246
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,359
See why I can not know it

247
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:42,927
as it is presented here.

248
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:46,614
Do I know UC0 ?

249
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,560
To know a voltage,

250
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,747
IC0 must be

251
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:53,585
multiplied by a
resistance that I see here,

252
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,235
between this and that,
imposing a voltage UC0

253
00:11:57,777 --> 00:12:01,534
to say VCC minus UC0 is
equal to the voltage drop here.

254
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:04,172
But what happens is
that this transistor there

255
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:06,142
behaves as a current source.

256
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,886
Suppose it has no output conductance,

257
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,261
that the effect "Early"

258
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:13,600
the Early voltage of this
transistor is equal to infinity.

259
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,180
So it's like I tell you,

260
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,796
the output resistance is infinite here.

261
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,225
And suppose that

262
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,843
you have a current
source as drawn here

263
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:25,865
and below, you will also
have a power source.

264
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,103
And this current source absorbs,
everything is perfect inside:

265
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,944
the IC0 current flows
through your transistor,

266
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:35,500
it is able to absorb
the same IC0 current

267
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:36,876
and someone asks you,

268
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:41,864
when you'll assemble
this between VCC and 0,

269
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:43,995
what is the voltage
that appears here?

270
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,387
You could not say.

271
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:48,993
Because this tension,
it could not be defined

272
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:51,320
it can be anywhere in that range.

273
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:53,323
It may actually go up and down

274
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:55,531
anywhere within this range.

275
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,692
Actually this kind of assembly exists,

276
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:01,281
it is used in integrated circuits

277
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,763
and usually when you
make an output this way

278
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:07,713
we add a circuit to fix what is called

279
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,327
the common mode output.

280
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:13,008
So the tension VC0 contrary
to what you see there,

281
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:15,598
that we directly see
in this assembly there,

282
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:16,907
it could not be known,

283
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:19,186
it will depend on what
you will connect yourself

284
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,527
on that side.

285
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,653
If it's a similar assembly
as we said here,

286
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:26,434
if you come here to connect
a transistor like this,

287
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:29,326
this tension from here to
there if it is a PNP transistor,

288
00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:32,534
it will be of a voltage junction nature.

289
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:33,652
But for the moment,

290
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:36,056
nobody could tell you
what is the VC0 tension.

291
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:39,583
One can of course
ignore or make a guess

292
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:40,817
that there here

293
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:42,091
I have a resistance

294
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:45,343
which is the output transistor of
that resistance  which is 1 / GCE

295
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:48,268
and this resistance there

296
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:52,156
allows me to find the
test potential that is at output.

297
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:53,870
But what I want to said

298
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:57,542
there comparing these two approaches,

299
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:59,163
that's an assembly

300
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:01,988
which takes into account
the discrete components

301
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:03,496
in which I had to use:

302
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,619
a resistance to impose IC0 current,

303
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:10,485
two resistors to impose the potential VB0

304
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:13,354
and there, I had to use a component

305
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:15,256
which is a current source,

306
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:17,314
we will see just now
how we will do it

307
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:20,000
to impose the IC0 current.

308
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,438
In this case, when I write the gain,

309
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:25,944
it is really the gain of a
common transmitter assembly,

310
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,846
So this is the gain

311
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:33,678
which will be equal minus
GM times a load resistor.

312
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:36,692
I consider that this resistance there,

313
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:39,223
it is infinite so it does not exist,

314
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:41,445
I erase this.

315
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:45,159
There, there is no resistance here

316
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:50,623
and there it is an infinite
resistance, we have just seen it.

317
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:52,821
So what is the gain of this circuit?

318
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:56,077
Well the gain of this
assembly, it can only be infinite,

319
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:58,969
because RL is infinite.

320
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,176
We have just seen that a power source

321
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:03,938
it's great, I just realized an assembly

322
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:06,142
whose the gain is infinite.

323
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:08,937
I remind you that in an
operational amplifier

324
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,694
when you take an ampiOP, it displays

325
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:16,612
theoretically an infinite
gain if not very very large.

326
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,589
So it's probably inside,
we used an assembly

327
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:24,544
in the integrated circuit which
mold the operational amplifier,

328
00:15:24,745 --> 00:15:27,320
we used an assembly
of that nature here.

329
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:28,933
And it is absolutely the case

330
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,061
because we use active charges

331
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:35,174
because thanks to that, we have
the very high resistance

332
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:38,510
if not infinite, and
we can cascade 2 stages

333
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,841
which lead us to extremely high gains.

334
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:44,460
I go back to

335
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:48,555
the analysis of this circuit
we just saw before.

336
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:52,526
That is to say the assembly,
I hide these 2 parts,

337
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:54,401
I show it like this,

338
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:57,026
It is the famous montage
where it was necessary to

339
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:58,628
polarize

340
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:01,841
I points back potentials

341
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,114
VB0 - VE0 - VC0

342
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:09,199
that we called resting
points or operating points.

343
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:10,960
An operating point,

344
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:13,342
is that, at rest,  when you plug it

345
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:16,005
and you take a voltmeter
according to ground

346
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:20,325
and measure that point, it
displays the VB0 voltage,

347
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:24,164
we measure this, it displays
VE0 and here we see VC0.

348
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,884
But when you take an
alternative signal

349
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,078
so this which is in red

350
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:32,200
represents the DC components.

351
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,793
Suppose that here you have a sensor

352
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,416
which varies over time,

353
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:38,696
we can take an example
of an audio signal

354
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,106
coming from a microphone.

355
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:44,986
So suppose that is a microphone
and then you bring a signal

356
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,499
and you want to amplify, you want
to amplify the signal that arrives here

357
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:52,051
this signal is of AC nature in this node A

358
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:53,714
which is an AC signal

359
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:55,670
therefore which varies in time.

360
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:58,697
That is a source of tension.

361
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:02,518
How could we connect this
tension there on a DC point?

362
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,434
If the capacity

363
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:06,429
that you see here does not exist,

364
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,951
so if you're in that situation,

365
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:11,744
so I'll delete this capability

366
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,280
and I will replace it with a short-circuit

367
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,324
If I do not have that capacity

368
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,596
and look what will happen to you.

369
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:22,821
You take this, you plug
this line directly like that,

370
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:25,902
you find that the VB0

371
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:28,116
appears across your source.

372
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:29,580
If it were a microphone,

373
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:33,276
your microphone it will never work
because it will have a DC potential

374
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:35,861
which is imposed so it will have
a current that will go through it

375
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,429
that goes in that direction there,

376
00:17:37,517 --> 00:17:40,429
it comes a current that
goes into your microphone

377
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:43,887
that comes from that connection here.

378
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:45,606
So that, that's wrong!

379
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,953
Same, if you come this way
and you connect,

380
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:52,165
we will say a loudspeaker
to facilitate the task

381
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:54,311
and you put a signal transducer

382
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:56,571
which will convert the audio signal

383
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,084
and that the capacity

384
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:00,340
which is there doesn't exist

385
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:02,690
and well you find yourself
with this capacity

386
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:05,807
which is again replaced
by a short circuit.

387
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:09,709
So as if your speaker, it
is connected to a DC potential.

388
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:13,044
So I take my signal here

389
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,456
and I connect it to that,

390
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,844
So this: the VC0,

391
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:20,472
it will tackle a DC
voltage on your speaker.

392
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:22,114
So a scheme of this style, there

393
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,033
to which you connected

394
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:29,402
a resistance which comes to
putting on a DC potential

395
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:32,652
will be covered by a DC current of course.

396
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:35,874
So in a speaker, it'll
make a hell of a noise

397
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:38,322
when you plug it because
it will pull the membrane

398
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:41,320
and it will make passing
a constant current

399
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,095
and there on that side, your
microphone it will also be browsed

400
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:48,262
by a constant current and this
assembly it could not be used.

401
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:51,884
So what we can do,I
return to the previous diagram,

402
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:53,660
I put my capacities back

403
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:56,109
and I observe what happens.

404
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:59,744
If I look at this capacity
and I imagine that there,

405
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:01,482
I have an impedance,

406
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:03,604
we will consider that
it is purely resistive.

407
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:06,960
I will draw what I see there,
I hide all this part there

408
00:19:07,137 --> 00:19:08,702
and I say all this,

409
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,753
it is equivalent to a resistance,

410
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:14,351
this is something that appears

411
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:17,194
as a resistance.

412
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,331
And if I look at this
circuit which is there,

413
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,752
so this whole part there comes
down to that resistance there.

414
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:25,650
And I draw below what I see.

415
00:19:25,825 --> 00:19:27,380
I see a capacity

416
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,699
CC1 and an impedance
which appears here.

417
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:38,025
I apply here a variable AC source

418
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:42,776
and I go into this kind of circuit.

419
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:47,002
Well it's this kind of circuit,
this is typically

420
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:49,758
a circuit of high-pass nature.

421
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,561
I see that the C and R,

422
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:55,989
I represent them in a Bode diagram

423
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,023
So H of J omega module

424
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:02,747
according to omega,

425
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,565
it would give me
something of this style

426
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:14,422
with a point here that is equal
To 1 / R x CC1.

427
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,014
Therefore knowing the resistance R,

428
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:19,968
I can calculate the capacity CC1

429
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:22,764
and deciding that from a point,

430
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:26,272
I strongly attenuates
the low frequencies

431
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,854
and I have a
bandwidth in which I

432
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,717
transit my AC signal.

433
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,654
So when I take an AC signal,

434
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:35,167
I correctly calculate my capacity,

435
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:38,935
which couples the increases
through this assembly,

436
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:42,475
the DC voltage can not
pass in this direction there,

437
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:44,844
there is no DC current
which crosses my capacity

438
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:46,041
it is well known.

439
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,403
So my capacity,

440
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,381
it will act on the alternative current
that will cross it in this direction

441
00:20:51,562 --> 00:20:53,092
and it will come in my assembly

442
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:55,822
and it will overlap with the component

443
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,962
VB0 which is here.

444
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:01,483
So I find myself with a high-pass circuit

445
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,821
where low frequencies
have been eliminated

446
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:06,455
so the DC components as well.

447
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:08,753
And I can do the
same on that side.

448
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:12,475
From that side, I put
a coupling capacity,

449
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:16,485
This capacity it will take
the alternative signal here

450
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:18,379
which is superimposed on VC0.

451
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:20,203
When I vary the tension there,

452
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,117
I will vary the tension there.

453
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:25,731
And the capacity, it will
behave as a closed circuit

454
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:28,582
for variations and it will decouple

455
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:31,757
the DC voltage,

456
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:34,705
so the DC voltage does
not appear on that side

457
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,716
except of course the index response

458
00:21:36,853 --> 00:21:38,163
when I have a voltage jump

459
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:40,951
and I put in tension all of this.

460
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:44,643
So the capacity is loading
to this potential VC0,

461
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:47,230
on the other hand, the
signal AC passes through

462
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:50,925
and again, here if you
analyze what you observe here,

463
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:56,757
it is again a circuit of CZL nature

464
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,059
and there you have a
high-pass filter

465
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,506
if this is a resistor.

466
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:05,435
So we realise a filter on that side,

467
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:06,568
a filter on that side

468
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:09,156
and these 2 filters are of this nature

469
00:22:09,272 --> 00:22:11,860
to pass the high frequency components.

470
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,314
I return to the assembly.

471
00:22:15,152 --> 00:22:17,647
So I think we located

472
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:19,713
the capacity used

473
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,934
to prevent the AC signal

474
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,532
to be shorted

475
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:29,757
or rather the DC signal to come
on our source and load

476
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,579
and we decoupled
the variation by capacities,

477
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,320
it was called capacity-decoupling
or capacities-decoupling.

478
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,556
When we studied the common
transmitter assembly,

479
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:42,852
the transistor transmitter was
connected to ground

480
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,491
and there, we had
to add it the resistance RE,

481
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,176
so the transmitter is
not connected to ground.

482
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:51,089
If you have a variation here

483
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:54,785
and you have a variation,
you have an almost constant

484
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:59,225
drop voltage which is UJ there,

485
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,331
so you will end up with

486
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:05,387
your variation which
moves and turns on EV.

487
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:08,387
The variations there and the
variations there are the same

488
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,963
if tensions between the two,

489
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:12,066
the voltage is constant.

490
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,187
So you will end up with that
tension there copied here.

491
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,743
So on this resistance there

492
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,683
you have a varying voltage.

493
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:23,219
Same on VC0, you'll have
a tension that varies.

494
00:23:23,824 --> 00:23:25,823
When the transmitter
has been grounded,

495
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:28,132
there wasn't this resistance RE

496
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,203
and it was considered that
the gain of this assembly,

497
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:33,948
The gain of this assembly was
calculated and we had seen

498
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:38,780
that this gain equaled less GM
times the load resistance.

499
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:40,060
Is this is the case?

500
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,869
when I add a resistor in the transmitter

501
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:45,354
This is valid when the
transmitter was to the grounded.

502
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:47,162
Now I'll add him a resistance

503
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:48,869
and well that is not the case.

504
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:50,993
You will do this in an exercise

505
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:53,861
and you will see that
the gain of this assembly

506
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,736
When we put a resistance,

507
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:58,786
this gain is not this,

508
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:05,054
the gain will be of the order
of less RC divided by RE.

509
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:09,091
So we do not have the high gain

510
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:10,132
we will have a gain

511
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:13,108
which is relatively
low compared to this.

512
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,872
so how do we do?

513
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:16,963
How to bring the
transmitter to the ground?

514
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:19,614
Well what we're going to do,
We will do the following:

515
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,573
we will add

516
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:23,657
in the same way a capacity

517
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:27,185
which would short-circuited
the resistance RE

518
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:29,919
for the alternating
current to pass

519
00:24:30,132 --> 00:24:32,315
By capacity not by resistance

520
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:34,681
and again from the AC point of view

521
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:36,512
this resistance is short-circuited.

522
00:24:36,694 --> 00:24:37,861
And here it is!

523
00:24:38,764 --> 00:24:41,094
this is the assembly

524
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:45,375
when using a decoupling
of the transmitter.

525
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:49,527
so if you have an AC
current that happens here,

526
00:24:49,786 --> 00:24:51,405
I will get a current here,

527
00:24:51,564 --> 00:24:53,001
a IB delta

528
00:24:53,754 --> 00:24:57,290
which will generate a  IC current delta.

529
00:24:57,974 --> 00:25:01,475
This current is approximately
the same IE delta,

530
00:25:01,985 --> 00:25:03,744
this current arrives in this node there,

531
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:06,886
it has a capacity in parallel

532
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:09,382
and it has a resistor in parallel.

533
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:12,463
The impedance
of the ZC capacity

534
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:14,285
is proportional

535
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:19,720
to 1/2 x Pi x F x C.

536
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:23,603
So if you consider
that it is infinite

537
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:26,684
or a very very high capacity

538
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:29,465
this ZC it will be equal to 0.

539
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:33,202
and the impedance of
the capacity ends to 0

540
00:25:33,427 --> 00:25:36,931
or when the frequency is
high, the ability is high.

541
00:25:37,228 --> 00:25:38,978
So what IE delta,

542
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:44,547
he sees himself in a node
where it can go here and there

543
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:47,229
and of course it will go
through the lowest impedance

544
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,335
in this case the
impedance of the capacity,

545
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,133
so the capacity which is there

546
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:54,258
will short-circuit your RE resistance.

547
00:25:54,396 --> 00:25:56,333
And from the AC point of view,

548
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,333
from the point of view
Alternating current,

549
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:01,800
it will rather
by your ability.

550
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:05,485
which brings you back to say
That the transmitter goes to ground

551
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,975
by a short circuit

552
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:09,313
performed by a
decoupling capacitor.

553
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,372
And here are two names:

554
00:26:11,794 --> 00:26:13,802
coupling and
decoupling

555
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:14,965
that will allow us

556
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:17,018
to create assembly

557
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:20,536
in which one will superimpose
of the DC components

558
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:22,963
and AC components

559
00:26:23,236 --> 00:26:25,090
and in which we removed

560
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:27,313
the effect of the RE resistor

561
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,322
which is essential to the DC.

562
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:33,124
And when there is a variation,
It is shorted-circuited

563
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:35,127
despite the current continues,

564
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,746
continues to cross it
because the direct current,

565
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:40,819
the one we had seen, that
we would see red here.

566
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,858
If I put a DC here

567
00:26:44,015 --> 00:26:47,405
IC0 which is pretty
much the same here

568
00:26:48,062 --> 00:26:50,724
it will go through the
step resistance capacity

569
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:53,826
because it is continuous in nature
and capacity is an open circuit

570
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:56,976
because F equal to 0 for a direct current.

571
00:26:57,193 --> 00:27:00,079
So the DC goes through there,
Alternative here

572
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:03,989
and there it is, we arrive on a
diagram complete assembly

573
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:07,346
which amplifies
The AC signals

574
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:10,576
while superimposing
them to DC components

575
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:14,493
and improving the assembly by
placing a decoupling capacitor

576
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:17,255
to eliminate the
effect of polarization.

577
00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:21,846
I come now on the same assembly

578
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:25,749
but I'm replacing
all that I have just seen before

579
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,488
by a current source.

580
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,087
so I remind you that this assembly
which has a current mirror,

581
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:37,764
this is identical to a
current source here

582
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:43,361
having a parallel impedance

583
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:47,483
which is equal to 1
on GCE of this transistor.

584
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:50,452
So it's a pretty high impedance

585
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,989
in parallel with a current source

586
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:54,579
whose value of the flow
of this current is this,

587
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:56,652
that's the Iref.

588
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:59,961
So we fall back on what has been
discussed and has been called

589
00:28:00,155 --> 00:28:01,968
the active load.

590
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:03,557
This part

591
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,982
I refer you to the course
on the mirrors of the currents,

592
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:09,625
it simply serves to impose Iref

593
00:28:10,948 --> 00:28:13,693
and which would
generate a voltage

594
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:17,118
VEB here who is copied the same here.

595
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:20,398
So it will spark this current
and impose it on the other side.

596
00:28:20,597 --> 00:28:21,878
And this transistor there,

597
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,465
it will have a delta V variation,

598
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:25,909
so I could put

599
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:29,072
in blue to talk about a variation.

600
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,583
And this change will
generate a current in delta I.

601
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:35,845
Here the delta I,

602
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:40,407
it will see as an open circuit
for the current source,

603
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:42,384
it will stay to it 1 / GCE

604
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:45,321
that is to say it will remain
to it a great resistance,

605
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:47,497
so it will realize a gain

606
00:28:48,322 --> 00:28:52,931
AV equals minus GM1.

607
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:56,184
If we consider that
this transistor has no

608
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:00,728
output impedance or
even if you consider it,

609
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:05,428
you would have drawn here an
impedance of a value 1 / GCE1,

610
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,275
1 / GCE1

611
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:11,841
and here we would have
written 1 / GCE2

612
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:14,150
and there I call it transistor T2

613
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:16,725
therefore the gain of
such an assembly

614
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:20,198
would become minus GM1

615
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:23,392
multiplied by the parallel setting.

616
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,033
You remember that I must
short-circuited VCC to ground,

617
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:30,454
so I would put 1 / GCE1

618
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:34,434
parallel to 1 / GCE2.

619
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:38,420
and this would
give me an AV gain

620
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:42,714
equal minus GM1

621
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:47,736
divided by GCE1 plus GCE2.

622
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:49,891
And this kind of installation,

623
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:53,480
we will also make a
simplified abstraction,

624
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:55,284
suppose that GCE1

625
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,608
is Iref

626
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:02,823
divided by the Early
voltage of transistor 1

627
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:04,722
and the other is Iref,

628
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:07,026
it is the same current in both

629
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:12,183
divided by VA2 which is the Early
voltage of the transistor 2.

630
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,579
And the GM1, this transistor

631
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,166
it has a current Iref
which passes through it

632
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:22,747
divided by UT

633
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:25,872
and look what will happen
with this kind of montage:

634
00:30:26,322 --> 00:30:30,388
if you consider that VA1 and
VA2 is the same value,

635
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,821
that the two transistors have
the same tensions of Early

636
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:36,973
and that the same currents
cross it therefore the Iref,

637
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:39,936
Iref, Iref will disappear.

638
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:42,760
Look at what's going on:
you end up with a gain

639
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:44,988
which is proportional to,

640
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:48,759
if we replace VA1 equal to VA2,

641
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:52,012
therefore you are
with 2 times, so that

642
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:59,474
the AV gain would
become less than 2 VA

643
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:05,551
divided by the
thermodynamic voltage UT.

644
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:08,521
And you can do what you
want with this assembly,

645
00:31:08,695 --> 00:31:10,009
you do not change the gain.

646
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:12,605
It depends on
the Early voltage

647
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,745
and you remember in
the bipolar transistor,

648
00:31:14,845 --> 00:31:16,641
it is linked to the width of the base

649
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,205
and it's not you who are going to do it,

650
00:31:18,317 --> 00:31:20,905
it is part of the characteristic
of your transistors

651
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,083
and the thermodynamic voltage
this is the 26 millivolt.

652
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:27,998
So here it is a constant
value at room temperature

653
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:32,175
and there it is a value
related to your transistor,

654
00:31:32,344 --> 00:31:34,394
so you can not change it,

655
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:37,491
it would give you
a fairly high gain

656
00:31:37,752 --> 00:31:41,061
independent of your design.

657
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:44,014
but then you will tell me: "It's great!"

658
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,197
Yes, it's great. It makes a gain.

659
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:47,628
As soon as you plug it in,

660
00:31:47,757 --> 00:31:49,456
technology that you would use

661
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:51,343
impose the Early voltage to you.

662
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:54,523
It is linked to the physical law,

663
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:57,278
you can not change it
and you get a gain.

664
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:58,985
And this gain is quite high

665
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:01,130
because you have at
the denominator 10 minus 3,

666
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:04,134
therefore there is a factor
1000 that will multiply

667
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,795
the ratio of VA / UT multiplied by 2

668
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,714
and the Early voltage is of
the order of hundred volts

669
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:12,810
for a low power transistor

670
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:15,215
and there it is
you find your self with a gain

671
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,645
that automatically is high.

672
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:21,134
And I repeat the comments:
that tension is not defined,

673
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:23,301
it is defined by what
you are going to

674
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:25,186
put behind this transistor.

675
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,543
To summarize what we
have just seen now,

676
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:33,992
I retraced again the use of transistor

677
00:32:34,422 --> 00:32:38,512
and I used the common
transmitter assembly to explain

678
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:42,494
and I demonstrated that when
I take passive components

679
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:44,407
to achieve an amplifier.

680
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:46,537
My amplifier, it needs

681
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:49,179
2 resistors to polarize the base,

682
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,742
it needs a strength in the
transmitter for imposing a current

683
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:56,167
in the transmitter and all
this independent of the load

684
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,688
because once you have added the load

685
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,960
plus the active component
which is the transistor,

686
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:05,060
you will need 3
resistances to polarize.

687
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:07,393
But unfortunately, the
fact of having polarize,

688
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:09,769
t was necessary to add also 3 capacities

689
00:33:09,952 --> 00:33:12,421
for your assembly can be used.

690
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:15,608
Therefore, a montage
by passive components

691
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:19,476
needs 3 resistors, 3 capacity

692
00:33:19,853 --> 00:33:22,953
To realize it and the capacities
And the resistors are components

693
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:25,228
large, bulky

694
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,232
when it is done with circuits
and discrete elements.

695
00:33:28,734 --> 00:33:31,334
If you take the same
assembly and you integrate,

696
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:32,688
you will need

697
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:35,688
a current source that is
realized by a current mirror,

698
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,944
so everything revolves
around the transistor

699
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:40,142
and becomes extremely

700
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:43,052
small size that can be
integrated on silicon

701
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:45,099
and make very very high gains

702
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:48,139
which would bring you later
to do counter-reaction,

703
00:33:48,314 --> 00:33:51,861
so use that in context
of a feedback amplifier

704
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:54,613
and adjust the feedback gain.
