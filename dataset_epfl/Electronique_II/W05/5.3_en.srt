1
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:09,101
So we will continue the
study of the voltage amplifiers

2
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,701
therefore we analyzed the assemblies

3
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:14,241
that will make gains in
voltage then we realized

4
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:16,881
it is mainly the common
emitter assembly

5
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:19,626
we had seen that the common
base does the same thing

6
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:20,939
but you will see today

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,810
we will try to put the two together
to do the following thing.

8
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:26,389
That is in this part of the course

9
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,550
we will realize that
there is a limitation

10
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:30,701
and these limitations are mainly

11
00:00:30,806 --> 00:00:32,831
frequency limitations.

12
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:34,913
One, we do it ourselves,

13
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:37,007
it's when we cut the DC component

14
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,644
that limitation in low frequency

15
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:43,134
when you put the coupling
and decoupling capabilities

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,153
and there we will realize that
there is a high frequency limitation

17
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:50,943
and frequencies are limited
by a parasitic capacitance.

18
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:55,951
We will first introduce the
phenomenon or the Miller theorem

19
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,301
which explains why a
parasitic capacitance

20
00:00:58,468 --> 00:01:00,693
between the input and the
output will have some high

21
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:03,626
frequency effect for
common emitter assemblies

22
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,725
and we will improve the
common emitter assembly

23
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:09,413
by passing to an assembly
that has already been studied

24
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,208
and these are the Cascode assemblies.

25
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,163
So we will pass through
the Cascode assembly

26
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:16,094
which in reality is the serialization

27
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,467
of a common emitter and
common base assembly

28
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:21,820
and we will end the set

29
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:25,201
by analysing the so-called output stages.

30
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:28,788
This is how to take an amplifier

31
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:31,796
whose role is not to boost the voltage,

32
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:36,676
but especially to make a buffer
between a voltage stage

33
00:01:36,876 --> 00:01:40,191
and an external load and avoid

34
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:45,019
having to degrade the gain of
a common transmitter assembly

35
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:47,486
or an assembly that achieves gain.

36
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:50,609
You'll see it will be the
common collector assembly

37
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:51,761
that will play the role

38
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,569
of a quintessential power amplifier

39
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:58,064
it'll be a voltage follower,
it follows the voltage

40
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:01,888
but it will amplify the current and
lower the output impedance.

41
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,238
And we end with an improvement

42
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:06,542
or some additional assemblies

43
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:09,888
that follow the common collector assembly

44
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,863
called the "push-pull",
you will see what it is

45
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:15,500
it's a little common collector

46
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,476
improved slightly for a superior dynamics

47
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:20,639
of this kind of installation.

48
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,913
To start ...

49
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:26,630
I will address this Miller theorem.

50
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,301
Miller theorem is a simple idea,

51
00:02:30,364 --> 00:02:32,101
if you take an amplifier

52
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:36,726
and chance is there an impedance

53
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:39,159
an admittance here
I speak of an admittance

54
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:43,738
So I remind you an admittance
is simply Y=1/Z,

55
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:46,576
it's the inverse of impedance.

56
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,091
If you have an impedance
which is between input and output

57
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,838
where there is a component that
comes between the input and the output,

58
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,688
we will bring it back to the
input and we'll see

59
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,695
that this component appears here

60
00:02:57,863 --> 00:03:01,526
it could be presented as
a load at the input.

61
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:05,075
And an equivalent load at
the input and the output

62
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,638
which is proportional to this admittance

63
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:10,861
and proportional to the gain.

64
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:13,176
We can see it simply by analyzing

65
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:15,117
what happens with the
current in this node.

66
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,626
If you take the node here

67
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:20,545
and you will see that in
the quadrupole which is your amp,

68
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:23,566
there is an input voltage
and an input current

69
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:26,338
so a component of this current

70
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,310
will pass through your admittance.

71
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,026
And will continue its way to the output.

72
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,751
But there is a gain between the two.

73
00:03:32,907 --> 00:03:34,744
That is to say, the output voltage V2,

74
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:37,692
it is much larger than
the input voltage V1

75
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:40,314
because there is the gain
which multiplies the voltage V1.

76
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:42,601
So the tension here and the tension there

77
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:45,228
are related by this A which
is between the two.

78
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,442
We will write this:

79
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:49,576
that is to say the current which
passes through this admittance

80
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:53,001
it is called I' it is the
value of the admittance

81
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:56,426
which multiplies the
difference voltage V1 - V2

82
00:03:56,582 --> 00:03:58,482
So V1 - V2

83
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,687
is this vector that you see here.

84
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:07,564
So if you change the value of V2

85
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:09,339
by the relationship we have here

86
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:11,888
So I replace V2 by A x V1

87
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,105
and well we fall on this:

88
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:14,764
we can take conspicuously V1

89
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:17,266
it will say that the admittance you see

90
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,538
between the input and output

91
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:23,361
will multiply the voltage
and your impedance

92
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:27,938
rather your voltage will be
multiplied by 1 - A.

93
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:29,711
So in reality, you have
to see it like this,

94
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:33,113
it is as if we took the
admittance that is there

95
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:37,589
and we replaced its value  by this,

96
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:39,342
so you have the equivalent

97
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:42,729
of which is between the input
and output but multiplied by 1 - A

98
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,389
and A is a gain.

99
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:47,038
A gain by definition is a high value

100
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:48,609
so if this gain,

101
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:52,085
we will take an example, you have
a gain that is for the order of 1000,

102
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:53,887
You have 1-1000,

103
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:56,876
1 with respect to 1000 can be neglected,

104
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:01,588
you will find yourself with -A
multiplying the value of Y.

105
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:04,251
So we will continue our reflection

106
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:08,188
if by chance A is a negative gain,

107
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,975
it is like an example of a common emitter,

108
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:14,425
So you'll find yourself with
Y minus minus something

109
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:17,401
it will give you the
impedance or the admittance

110
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:20,325
which will be multiplied by a gain

111
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:22,414
and this minus sign will disappear.

112
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,426
So we'll see it in practice.

113
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:26,976
Before looking at it concretely

114
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:30,840
I'd just like to show that you
repeat the same thing at the output

115
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:32,363
you will see that expression

116
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:35,489
so at the output you express the
current I'2 which is written here

117
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:39,325
according to the voltage
difference V1 - V2,

118
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:45,626
you will find that it's -YV2
multiplying (1/A)-1.

119
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:48,725
If A is high, this it tends towards 0,

120
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:50,351
you'll find yourself with the minus

121
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:51,971
and the minus here that will
cancel each other out

122
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:54,176
so it will give you a positive sign

123
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:56,888
and when you find yourself with

124
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,205
your admittance, which appears at
the output multiplied by this factor

125
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:04,214
it's like the equivalent
of your admittance tipped

126
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:07,351
it appears at the output
with its own value

127
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,943
in parallel with the output impedance,

128
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:12,214
remember that within the quadrupole

129
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:14,402
you will have an input impedance

130
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:16,851
and an output impedance of course

131
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,622
and that this input
impedance is still here

132
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,288
we don't see it we draw it here,

133
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:25,676
but you will see that in reality

134
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:27,726
at the input it's quite tricky

135
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:31,828
at the output it is the value itself,
more or less,

136
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,876
yet at the input it is
the value multiplied by -A

137
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:40,251
So your admittance had a sign

138
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,592
first positive, normal it's a
passive component

139
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:45,413
It will be found with a negative sign.

140
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,327
At the output it is the real admittance

141
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:52,313
that is at the output, so
that's what is most dangerous

142
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:53,451
because here there is a gain.

143
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:57,151
So we have boosted the
value of a component

144
00:06:57,476 --> 00:07:00,588
wich has been added between
the input and the output by the gain

145
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:04,187
the more the gain is increased,
the more this factor A increases,

146
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:07,301
the more the value of
the admittance is found

147
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:11,062
increased by the value of the gain
which is being increased with.

148
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:15,401
So I'll take an example of
a capacitive impedance.

149
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:18,126
I remind you the
impedance of a capacity:

150
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:22,266
it's 1 / JΩC,

151
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:25,300
if you are looking for the Z module

152
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:28,789
you find it's 1 / ΩC,

153
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:32,088
so the admittance Y

154
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:34,933
and 1 is equal to ΩC.

155
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,276
Imagine that you have a capacity

156
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:40,625
which is between the input and the output

157
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:45,612
and this capacity,
its admittance is Ω x C

158
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:49,588
and that Y one you write it here Ω x C

159
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:53,836
and your A gain is negative

160
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:55,639
if your gain is negative

161
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:58,235
you will find yourself with minus

162
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:02,596
minus the negative gain so you'll see here

163
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:09,448
the equivalent of A times that ΩC.

164
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,517
So it's like your capacity
has been multiplied by a gain.

165
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,738
It's A x C for the pulsation

166
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:19,333
to which you apply a voltage at the input

167
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,451
which has a variation
that has a given pulse

168
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:23,138
but then your passive component

169
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,376
which ended up between
the input to the output

170
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,517
that you have added or it ended up
as a parasite component,

171
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:30,701
it was multiplied by

172
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:33,618
a gain equal to A.

173
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,275
And the more you
increase the gain,

174
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,633
the more your capacity becomes greater.

175
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,638
Imagine that there you have

176
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,457
a value or an input resistor

177
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:45,651
and your capacity comes in
parallel with this resistance

178
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,824
and you end up with a capacity

179
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,541
in parallel with a resistance

180
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:54,270
and that, is the equivalent scheme.

181
00:08:54,488 --> 00:08:58,333
The capacity is ΩC,

182
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:02,924
it is found here at ΩC x A

183
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:05,826
So your capacity becomes huge

184
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,036
multiplied by the gain.

185
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:11,246
So you end up with that famous problem

186
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,226
that the Miller theorem seeks to express

187
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,977
pay attention, there is
a relationship between

188
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:19,413
the components that are
in counter-reaction

189
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:23,116
between input and output and
the gain you want to achieve.

190
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:25,663
It's true that this is not
very important to the output

191
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:29,213
even though your component
it appears at the output

192
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:32,226
but at the entrance, your
gain it will contribute to this.

193
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:35,042
And it's the case of a common
transmitter assembly.

194
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:36,725
Let's see this.

195
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:39,194
This is what I just explained,

196
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,971
and here is your common emitter.

197
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:47,576
The common emitter has a capacity
between base and collector.

198
00:09:48,226 --> 00:09:51,675
actually your transistor
has parasitic capacities.

199
00:09:51,863 --> 00:09:53,973
There is one between base and collector,

200
00:09:54,123 --> 00:09:58,867
one between base and emitter and
one between collector and emitter.

201
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:02,238
That is the reality of all
electronic components

202
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:04,329
there is capacities of a given value

203
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:07,494
that are not intended but
they are parasitic capacities,

204
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,600
so it is not capacities
we added ourselves,

205
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:12,857
they are found in the component
itself regardless of its value.

206
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,189
When you take your common emitter

207
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,238
and you'll put a load here,

208
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:19,890
this load I don't present it here,

209
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:23,512
it is simply to say it will be
used to give me a gain

210
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:27,568
A = - GN times the load resistance.

211
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:30,188
If this load resistance is very high,

212
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:33,189
typically a current source,
so it can be infinite

213
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,665
so you will have an extremely high gain,

214
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:38,535
and well your parasitic
capacity that is there

215
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:42,953
it is indeed between
the input and the output

216
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:47,588
and between the input and the output:
that is V1, that is V2, that is V1, that is V2.

217
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,701
The equivalent of this capacity,

218
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:52,851
according to Miller,
will appear at the input

219
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:57,757
multiplied by the amplifier gain and
the gain of the amplifier is negative.

220
00:10:58,313 --> 00:11:01,438
So you will multiply a non-visible passive

221
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:05,015
component, parasitic, by a gain

222
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:09,975
and the gain it's your own wish
when you make the amp

223
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,850
but this component,
it appears in parallel

224
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,800
with the common
emitter input impedance

225
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:18,950
which is in reality a
resistance of a value 1 / GBE.

226
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:21,608
So if you inject a current here

227
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:23,532
it finds itself on a path

228
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:27,739
it can go in the 1 / GBE,

229
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:30,479
a resistance

230
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:33,167
and it will also want to
go through that capacity

231
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:36,828
whose value of the parasitic
capacity may be of one pico,

232
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:40,380
but multiplied by a gain may
be a gain equal to 1000

233
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,508
it will end multiplied by
1,000 times the 1 pico

234
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:46,824
so you will have a capacity
equivalent to the input

235
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:50,094
in nanofarads in parallel with a resistor.

236
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:53,277
So the current that will pass through
the capacity will increase

237
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,913
due to the value that has
been boosted by the gain

238
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,653
and you limit the
bandwidth of your signal,

239
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:04,564
because this impedance will
pull down the voltage level,

240
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:07,959
so you find yourself with
an amplifier that has a pole

241
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:09,751
that appears towards
the high frequencies

242
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,735
and the more one increases the gain
the more this capacity will crack down,

243
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,521
it will drop our amplifier bandwidth

244
00:12:17,826 --> 00:12:20,626
and we can not do anything
with the assembly as it is

245
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:22,990
because we are not the
ones that added that.

246
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,134
This is related to the component itself.

247
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:29,321
I talked about high frequency limitation

248
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:34,814
so the Miller effect will
act on a high frequency pole

249
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:39,101
which is equal to 1 / GBE
parallel to A x CBC

250
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,683
And CBC c is the parasitic capacity
between the input and the output

251
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:45,376
that you find which is
given by the manufacturer.

252
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:48,576
So I'll go see the low
frequency capacities,

253
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:53,998
we will now look at the
low-frequency effect,

254
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:57,505
there are two capacities that
we have added ourselves

255
00:12:57,714 --> 00:12:59,853
possibly even a third
one if we will look at

256
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:01,759
what happens on that side

257
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,493
and we will imagine
that we put our load here

258
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:05,890
and we added a capacity.

259
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,872
The role of this capacity
is indeed to create

260
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:13,232
a limitation for low frequencies
because we would like

261
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,736
to contact an AC signal and
decouple the DC component,

262
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:20,358
so the component that has a zero
frequency we would like to cut it,

263
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,011
so we added this capacity.

264
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:25,852
If you look at this complete
common transmitter assembly now,

265
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:29,256
with this capacity taking the role
of bringing the transmitter to ground

266
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:33,472
and this capacity to
couple the AC component,

267
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:36,480
I considered that
the source resistance is 0

268
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:39,634
then this capacity what will it have?

269
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:42,817
If I put my hand on all the
assembly on this side there

270
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,275
and I consider that this
capacity is already acting,

271
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:48,744
so it has short-circuited the resistance,

272
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:53,007
this assembly we have already
calculated its input impedance

273
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:56,650
and we saw that the input
impedance is this expression there,

274
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:59,646
It is the parallelization
of R1 parallel with R2

275
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,597
parallel with 1 / GBE I see from here.

276
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:07,182
So all my assembly, it becomes
an equivalent resistance.

277
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:10,138
So if I draw under my equivalent circuit,

278
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:12,818
I'll find myself with a capacity C1

279
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:15,210
and an input resistance

280
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:17,926
and this input resistance is Rin.

281
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:21,720
And this is a RC circuit
of high pass nature,

282
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:23,664
so in a Bode diagram

283
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:27,307
it will create an H(jΩ)

284
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:33,088
that has a pole that will appear

285
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:38,405
at 1 / CRin.

286
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:43,810
So I find myself
with this pulsation

287
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,188
which creates me precisely
the limitation in low frequency.

288
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:50,549
Is it the unique capacity?
no, there is a second one.

289
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:53,694
This capacity, its expression is there,

290
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:57,800
So we see that the input
impedance is what I noticed here,

291
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:00,330
therefore the Rin is
what we calculated.

292
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:02,607
Of course I considered at that time

293
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:04,841
that the EC capacity is acting,

294
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:09,101
so I put the transmitter to the ground otherwise
I should have written in addition than that ...

295
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,843
that the expression 1 / GBE
R1 parallel with R2

296
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:17,708
parallel to β1 / GBE + βRE

297
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:22,535
but I considered that there is no
component in the resistance RE

298
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,851
that it is already short-circuited
by the capacity.

299
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:26,989
We are used to doing that,

300
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:30,317
that is to say, we decouple
when we solve this kind of problem,

301
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,654
the effect of two capabilities
that is of course an approximation

302
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:36,750
because if the two cutoff
frequencies are close

303
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:41,320
there is the contribution of one of the
capacities in relation to the other.

304
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:43,426
Given that we are interested

305
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:45,389
when we make this kind of amplifier

306
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,539
to the flat portion of
these characteristics,

307
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:48,863
it's when we have the gain

308
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:50,328
so we consider that

309
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:54,277
both the effect of this
resistance and this capacity

310
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:58,487
or all that resistance and capacity

311
00:15:58,715 --> 00:16:01,282
we assimilate it as if
one has already acted

312
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:02,857
and calculating for the other

313
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:05,640
and the two effects are superimposed
in a diagram of Bode.

314
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:07,785
Now if I have to apply the same

315
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,795
and look at the effect of that capacity.

316
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:14,953
The same ! I put my finger
where I have my capacity node

317
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,376
and all the rest of my circuit

318
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,118
I transform it into an
equivalent resistance.

319
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:23,925
So I have to watch the equivalent
resistance that I see from here.

320
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:27,571
Having obviously the assembly or
diagram equivalent to AC,

321
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:31,342
I know that without the
resistance RE I see from here

322
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:34,668
it's approximately of the order of 1 / GM,

323
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,553
otherwise there is  R1 parallel
with R2 divided by ...

324
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,666
sorry, R1 parallel with
R2 multiplied by β

325
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:47,370
that will also give me a resistor
that comes in parallel

326
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:51,663
but we consider that the 1 / GM
is the smallest resistance then

327
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:55,489
and when you put a resistor in parallel
RE must be taken into account

328
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,058
so if there is RE parallel with 1 / GM

329
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:00,479
parallel with the effect
of these two resistances

330
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,133
well you'll find an
equivalent resistance here

331
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,251
And that I think a student
who took the course so far

332
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:09,876
knows how to calculate the
equivalent resistance AC in a node.

333
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,479
In this example there,

334
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,519
it's the approximation that brings us
back to 1 / GM parallel with RE

335
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:19,866
and I neglected RE because quite often,

336
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:23,806
it is a much higher resistance
than the 1 / GM

337
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:27,400
So what dominates is the
smallest resistance it is 1 / GM.

338
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,463
So again, I have here

339
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:32,204
the contribution of 1 / GM
and the EC capacity

340
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,526
and I'll come up
with a second pole

341
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:38,138
the GM / 2 x π / E x EC

342
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:43,339
and I find here an effect
for low frequency,

343
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,001
here another effect
for the low frequency,

344
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:48,190
I bring back this in my Bode

345
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:52,307
and it will show me from what pole

346
00:17:52,497 --> 00:17:56,537
I'm getting in the
asymptotic diagram

347
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:57,888
the part that is flat,

348
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,192
so from where my amplifier

349
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:02,470
acts as a common emitter amplifier

350
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,200
with low frequency limitation due to
this this node and that node

351
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,850
and a high frequency limitation

352
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:13,031
which is due to the parasitic
capacity we just saw before.

353
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:16,924
So there, the bandwidth
of an amplifier like that

354
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:21,195
H (jω)

355
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:25,486
will have a gain here
which is proportional to GM

356
00:18:26,345 --> 00:18:28,445
times the load resistance

357
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:32,923
and which will have a contribution
here of these two poles

358
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,562
for low frequencies and here

359
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:40,413
the contribution of this
capacity for high frequency.

360
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,354
Thus the bandwidth is
delimited by these two poles

361
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:48,771
and by the pole which is due to this
capacity for the high frequencies.

362
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:52,108
And there it is, when asked to
look at the frequency response,

363
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:54,708
we calculate these two
poles and calculate the other.

364
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:57,500
So I draw your
attention that very often

365
00:18:57,726 --> 00:19:00,729
to calculate C1 and calculate EC

366
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:03,296
well it is necessary
to also make these calculations.

367
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:08,309
If we want to create ourselves
these low frequency poles

368
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:11,116
well it is necessary
to look at the value C1

369
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:13,429
when setting a value to FP1

370
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:16,525
Rin is known by the polarization

371
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,981
and so I think you
know very well calculate it

372
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:20,826
well it will give you the value of C1

373
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:23,853
and if you impose a value for ...

374
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:28,760
the pole that appears here,
well it is for you to calculate Ce

375
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:32,072
knowing the 1 / Gm that
you own from your assembly.

376
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:35,828
And here it is, this is how one calculates

377
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,266
the response during
low and high frequency.

378
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,823
It is exactly the same thing that would have
been done with the common base assembly

379
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,357
or common collector,

380
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,135
there is no difference, it is always

381
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:50,056
we put our pen at each
place or a capacity,

382
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:54,488
and we calculate the pole
where there is this effect

383
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:56,751
and  we do the same here to find

384
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:59,838
so we have a second capacity
we look at this node there,

385
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:02,229
everything else is down to resistance.

386
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,383
In this case, all the rest
consists of a resistance

387
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:06,595
and we calculate the
C times this resistance

388
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:10,534
or the C times the equivalent
resistance that appears in this node.

389
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:14,776
To improve the common
transmitter assembly

390
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,418
at least for this history
of Miller capacity,

391
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:21,751
we resorted to an amplifier which has
already been studied

392
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:23,962
it is called the Cascode amplifier.

393
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:27,348
the Cascode assembly as presented

394
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:29,205
just a few weeks back,

395
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:33,240
it is shown that I have a
common transmitter assembly

396
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:37,396
but I put it right after ...

397
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,898
I put immediately after the
common emitter common base.

398
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:44,421
This is among the most usual use
of the common base,

399
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:47,481
it is in the Cascode assemblies

400
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,854
that it will come after the common emitter

401
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,622
assembly

402
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,281
you can see it here or there,

403
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:58,321
Here you see your
common emitter

404
00:20:58,563 --> 00:21:01,400
it is in series with a common
base assembly

405
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:04,468
why common base? Because
the base is a fixed potential.

406
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:07,669
There I applied Vp2 so
that potential there,

407
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:11,608
and it is at mass that I created myself

408
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,101
and this is where I realize it.

409
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,141
I take the common base assembly,

410
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:18,321
I impose a fixed potential
through a resistive divider,

411
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:21,449
the same as I did for the
common emitter to polarize it

412
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:25,396
I calculate a DC
potential that I call Vp2

413
00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:30,288
I apply here, I usually also put
a decoupling capacity,

414
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:32,931
It is the same effect as this capacity,

415
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,801
it is a quite large capacity
that is used there

416
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,155
so that capacity when it is loaded

417
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,148
imposes a quasi stable potential

418
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,279
that does not move

419
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:44,752
here therefore it is practically
a source of DC voltage

420
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:47,576
we did the same for this potential

421
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:51,238
and we come to take
our common transmitter

422
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:53,159
and we put through this

423
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:56,502
the common base assembly
before coming to charge.

424
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,385
So in reality you see your load

425
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:02,649
instead of the load being
right on the collector,

426
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:05,967
it is found after the common base,

427
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,155
so in the collector
of the common base.

428
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:10,434
The output of the common transmitter

429
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:13,250
enters in the input of the common base,

430
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:16,144
you see the base it is in common
between the input and the output

431
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:19,011
as here the transmitter is in common
between the input and the output,

432
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:21,738
we already calculated
all this so you know it,

433
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:24,341
you know how to calculate
the input impedance,

434
00:22:24,504 --> 00:22:27,504
the output impedance and
the gain of this assembly.

435
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,954
I'll comment just now
on what it is and why.

436
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,411
Simply, I would like to draw attention

437
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:35,654
to those who have to do the polarization.

438
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,260
What will happen
with your collector

439
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:41,294
of the common
transmitter that is here,

440
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:44,735
it will be found with
a fairly stable potential.

441
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:48,732
When you impose
a potential VP2

442
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:53,476
based on your common
base, that's this VP2

443
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:58,145
You drop this voltage
by a UJ value,

444
00:22:58,564 --> 00:23:01,135
you end up with VP2-UJ,

445
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:05,201
so this VP2-UJ is not
supposed to move

446
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:08,788
it's supposed to be stable, so
the collector of your transistor

447
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,774
is not seeing a DCPS
signal which moves,

448
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:15,168
it is practically stable DC.

449
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:17,287
What moves in this story?

450
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,618
You put a voltage V1 there,

451
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:22,281
you convert it by transistor
effect in a current.

452
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:24,960
So your current that I will draw in blue,

453
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:27,285
that's this current Δi which is there

454
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:29,274
it is the same as there pretty much.

455
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:32,640
So when you vary V1, you vary i

456
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:36,163
and the current through
the common base assembly

457
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:37,671
which is a follower in current,

458
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,050
the current that goes into
the collector is the same as

459
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:42,776
in the emitter, it will be directly returned

460
00:23:43,013 --> 00:23:45,002
from conversion all this current

461
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:47,314
current current in the load,

462
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:50,438
so it looks like the load is
connected to the collector.

463
00:23:50,622 --> 00:23:52,335
But is the collector moving? No !

464
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:55,259
The collector, it is
almost stable, not moving

465
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:57,407
thanks to this polarization.

466
00:23:57,588 --> 00:24:00,247
What is the minimum value
that I can impose here?

467
00:24:00,463 --> 00:24:02,963
This minimum value of this voltage,

468
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,222
is equal to the voltage that

469
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:08,611
therefore generally this
voltage that you see there

470
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:10,917
when it is equal to this
tension which is here

471
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:13,989
your transistor is in
the saturation threshold

472
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:17,900
so the minimum
that I can impose on this VP2

473
00:24:18,397 --> 00:24:22,019
is when VP2 is equal to VB0 + Uj,

474
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:24,987
that's what I noted here,
that is really the minimum.

475
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:29,378
If you look at VP2 when you
impose a DC voltage here

476
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:33,295
if you have a voltage difference
there from here to here

477
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,387
equals zero

478
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:37,215
it is possible for a transistor,

479
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:40,375
it means your transistor is at
the saturation threshold,

480
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:44,229
you are going to have a voltage Uj
here and you find the voltage VP2

481
00:24:44,404 --> 00:24:51,609
So I noted there VP2 = AVB0 plus
voltage Ui we have from here to there.

482
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:53,690
and that is the minimum.

483
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:58,378
So this is why I write in
DC the value of this VP2

484
00:24:58,776 --> 00:25:00,170
according to VB0

485
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,463
if someone asks you to polarize it

486
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:04,403
when you impose VB0

487
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,269
you need at all costs
to comply with this rule

488
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:09,212
otherwise your transistor
will be saturated

489
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:11,356
it is therefore the minimum value

490
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:14,028
that can be tolerated in
this type of assembly.

491
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,635
Here is this assembly,
we will analyze it now

492
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:20,040
with the advantages it has with
respect to a common transmitter.

493
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:22,601
Knowing that its input impedance

494
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:25,924
is the same as the common
transmitter assembly.

495
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:28,404
When you put a resistor RC,

496
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:31,425
you will see a gain
that is quite similar

497
00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:33,328
to a common emitter assembly

498
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:36,388
then if the resistance is
naturally passive.

499
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:38,910
We will see later with
the (inaudible) active,

500
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:40,653
But then what is the benefit?

501
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:41,816
The output impedance,

502
00:25:41,984 --> 00:25:44,059
well the output impedance
is the one I see here

503
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:47,297
this is equivalent to Rc
as output impedance.

504
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:48,738
So finally what is it?

505
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:50,927
It looks like the same as
the common emitter?

506
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:55,674
No, it's the Miller effect which gives
the advantage to this assembly.

507
00:25:58,314 --> 00:26:01,026
The frequency response
of a common emitter

508
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:04,120
suffered by this parasitic capacity.

509
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:07,221
Listen to what I'll say,

510
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:10,083
it found itself between input and output

511
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,126
because the input was,
the output was there

512
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:15,807
and I found myself with
a parasitic element

513
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:17,638
that whenever I want to make a gain,

514
00:26:17,948 --> 00:26:19,671
this component appears to the unput

515
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,877
multiplied by the gain and limit
my amplifier bandwidth.

516
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:26,073
Come here.

517
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,816
If the gain remains the same,

518
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:31,572
the input impedance is the same,

519
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:33,379
the output impedance is the same,

520
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:36,845
but this capacity is no longer
between the input and the output,

521
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:38,738
I enter here, I exit there

522
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,132
and here I do not see a parasitic capacity

523
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,010
between this node and that node.

524
00:26:43,363 --> 00:26:46,589
Even if the transistor has a parasitic
capacity from here to there,

525
00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:49,342
But it is not going to be here.

526
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:51,404
Now will come the second benefit:

527
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:55,447
the common emitter here as
an assembly that you see

528
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:57,752
How is the assembly loaded?

529
00:26:58,025 --> 00:27:00,405
The impedance that I see there,

530
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:03,536
this impedance is 1 / Gm2,

531
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,829
by the way T2 and T1 are the same,

532
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:10,260
the test current which
traverses them is the same,

533
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:12,444
so the Gm of the two
transistors is the same.

534
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,708
the Gm is IC0 on Ut.

535
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:16,894
If it is the same IC0 passing in both,

536
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:19,531
it is the same Gm of the two transistors.

537
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,934
So this transistor has a
transconductance that is Gm1

538
00:27:25,115 --> 00:27:27,405
and this transistor has 1 / Gm2

539
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:30,050
and the gain of this
assembly, the lower one,

540
00:27:30,556 --> 00:27:32,169
the assembly gain

541
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:37,638
Av1 = -Gm1

542
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:40,766
times the resistance that sees in the load

543
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:43,783
which is 1 / Gm2.

544
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:48,207
if both of them are the same
so this equals -1.

545
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:51,717
The gain is equal to -1 and
we have just seen it.

546
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:53,272
You remember we said that tension

547
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:55,066
is equal to this voltage there in DC,

548
00:27:56,064 --> 00:27:59,619
so if it is in Ac it's a DC
potential which appears here,

549
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:02,708
so finally this voltage
modulate the current

550
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:05,867
that the transistor follows and
throws it into the resistance Rc,

551
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:10,101
it is converted into a voltage at
the output and which will act on V2.

552
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:12,007
Now what is the gain ...

553
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,768
so if the Av1 gain of this
assembly equals -1,

554
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:19,113
the gain of the upper stage I call AV2,

555
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:25,644
it is -Gm2 multiplied by
the resistance Rc or Rl,

556
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:29,684
so this gain is the same thing
as a common transmitter

557
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:31,335
multiplied by -1,

558
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:33,266
sorry there is a sign +

559
00:28:34,738 --> 00:28:38,018
thus the global gain of
the two t is Av1 times Av2,

560
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,313
it is exactly the same
thing as a common emitter

561
00:28:40,513 --> 00:28:44,466
but the Miller effect is
much less important

562
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:49,988
because this same capacity
multiplied by a gain is equal to -1

563
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:53,552
we recall that the
equivalent capacity Miller

564
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:55,254
which appears at the input

565
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:58,738
will be equal to this capacity

566
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:06,238
it's Cμ1 multiplied by 1 - A

567
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:09,417
and A equals -1,

568
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:11,913
therefore -1 with the minus
it becomes plus,

569
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:16,170
and it's not the total gain so
that capability is two times plus two times Cμ1

570
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:20,022
and it's not the total gain you
would have done with the assembly.

571
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:24,234
So we won largely in the
high frequency pole

572
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:26,054
or that capacity limits

573
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:29,708
but it really limits at
much lower values

574
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,933
than we would have obtained with a gain

575
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:35,164
carried out with the common emitter here

576
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:39,264
and the gain of the whole would
have multiplied the capacity Cμ.

577
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:41,505
So the frequency response
of the assembly Cascode

578
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,041
is significantly higher than
the common emitter one

579
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,212
and to our advantage when we want
to achieve extremely high earnings.

580
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:54,554
This benefit is seen when we
replace the active load.

581
00:29:54,738 --> 00:29:57,507
You remember that
when using an active load,

582
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:01,392
we are active loads for
impedance here

583
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:03,371
which is almost infinite.

584
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,889
If your common transmitting
assembly is a Cascode assembly

585
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:08,704
the one we have just analyzed.

586
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,000
And there the equivalent of that,

587
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:12,637
it is a current source
that is connected here.

588
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,940
So if you come to do that,

589
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:18,942
the gain it is really boosted

590
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:22,563
and that becomes very large
because the passive load is Gm x R,

591
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:24,132
but then the resistance,

592
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:27,329
it is the output impedance
I see since there

593
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:31,855
Rout is the impedance I see here

594
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:34,615
in parallel with the
impedance that I see there.

595
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,184
And this impedance I see here,
I let you go check,

596
00:30:38,476 --> 00:30:43,691
is β4 on Gce3 it's of this
order of magnitude,

597
00:30:43,888 --> 00:30:46,968
the one I see down
is β2 on Gce1.

598
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:49,723
So the parallelization of these two

599
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,856
gives you an extremely
high output impedance

600
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:54,937
compared to a common transmitter assembly

601
00:30:55,124 --> 00:30:59,187
where we would have not seen the β which
multiply the gain, we would have found 1 / Gce1.

602
00:30:59,564 --> 00:31:02,466
So in this kind of assembly
you see that we get

603
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:05,264
to really achieve
extremely high gains

604
00:31:05,751 --> 00:31:08,313
with an output
which is in current

605
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,800
because we have a very high impedance

606
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,599
and a gain which may
tend to very high values.

607
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:17,498
The input impedance is the
same as the common emitter

608
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:20,909
so the output impedance is
the one that will influence the gain

609
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:23,801
and what explains with this
one would make very high gains

610
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:27,358
this is called OTA
transconductance amplifier.

611
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:32,949
That's all that was related
to these kinds of stages,

612
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:36,220
we analyzed the common
emitter assemblies

613
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:38,858
and its improvement
by the Cascode mount,

614
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:40,237
so you've seen

615
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,598
that often under voltage gain we
talk about the common transmitter

616
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:46,215
or Cascode, you will see later

617
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:48,142
we can also talk about
differential mounting,

618
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,345
it will come next week

619
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:52,638
Nevertheless, when making
a voltage gain, in tension

620
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:54,714
I'll get back on the slide before

621
00:31:54,925 --> 00:31:57,541
and just report what we just
see and understand,

622
00:31:57,722 --> 00:32:00,442
when one wants to
make a very high gain,

623
00:32:01,013 --> 00:32:02,746
one is led to see the following thing,

624
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:04,112
look at this well:

625
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:06,110
here in this assembly

626
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:07,907
we find ourselves with a gain

627
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,075
whose output impedance is very very high

628
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:14,893
so if you want to put in
parallel with this assembly

629
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:16,439
a low impedance,

630
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,452
you will degrade its gain.

631
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:21,575
So imagine that someone will
come and connect to this node there

632
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:25,512
a low resistance which belongs
to a stage that would come after.

633
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:27,693
well this impedance
it would come in parallel

634
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:30,477
and immediately
your gain collapses.

635
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,544
This gain rather
it is very high,

636
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,899
we just plug it a low resistance

637
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:38,255
so it will immediately collapse and
you lose the advantage of this gain.

638
00:32:38,437 --> 00:32:40,433
So what we are going to do now

639
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:43,693
is take our stages of gains

640
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,017
and often when we do integrated circuits,

641
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:49,115
we realize gains, we call them infinite gains

642
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:50,713
very very large

643
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,912
and we have an amplifier
that made the gain In tension.

644
00:32:54,112 --> 00:32:56,797
So any stage we attach it here,

645
00:32:57,191 --> 00:33:01,703
if this gain there or this stage
there has an input impedance

646
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:06,917
which is going to be
here of a finite value

647
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:08,685
which comes to connect

648
00:33:09,105 --> 00:33:11,552
at the output of this assembly,
We have just seen that

649
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:13,578
the advantage is the load
resistance

650
00:33:13,762 --> 00:33:15,138
which allows it to get the gain,

651
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:18,319
you will totally degrade the
gain stage and it is not good.

652
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:21,921
So we need what is called an output stage

653
00:33:22,225 --> 00:33:28,905
which is characterized
by an input impedance

654
00:33:29,162 --> 00:33:30,742
which is supposed
to be very high

655
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:35,665
and especially if you want
to connect a low load here,

656
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,111
if you connect a low load here,

657
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,111
you will get back with

658
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:44,542
the gain realising by this stage,

659
00:33:44,786 --> 00:33:47,350
but when it turns into a voltage

660
00:33:47,537 --> 00:33:49,025
you must have an assembly

661
00:33:49,205 --> 00:33:51,927
capable of supplying the
current needed to that load

662
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:53,747
which allows the voltage

663
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:56,160
which appears at the output
not to be affected by this.

664
00:33:56,337 --> 00:34:01,100
So we would like, to have an
output called a voltage output

665
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,138
that is to say, the output
impedance of this assembly

666
00:34:04,904 --> 00:34:06,297
is very low.

667
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:08,783
and even if it does not do a gain,

668
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:12,233
so even if the tension there
and there are the same,

669
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,601
we would like that

670
00:34:13,776 --> 00:34:16,654
the output impedance
is low for not affect this.

671
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:19,250
And we would like that its input
impedance wil be very high

672
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:23,360
and the assembly that does it
is indeed the common collector.

673
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,082
It is characterized by
high input impedance

674
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:27,700
a low output of impedance,

675
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:30,263
so it's the assembly par excellence

676
00:34:30,463 --> 00:34:32,009
to achieve what is called

677
00:34:32,184 --> 00:34:34,221
the output stage or the output power.

678
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:35,900
So I repeat,

679
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:39,040
the input impedance should be
high to not affect the gain,

680
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:41,630
what is seen must
be very high,

681
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:45,172
the output impedance must be low in
order to be able to supply a current

682
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:49,144
without the resistance that
comes here limits this current.

683
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,899
And usually as everywhere

684
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:53,231
we would like a low consumption

685
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:55,878
and a very very wide bandwidth.

686
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,627
To remind you

687
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:00,578
what we studied before

688
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,740
concerning the
common collector amplifier,

689
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:06,821
It is the complete realization,

690
00:35:07,012 --> 00:35:09,424
that is to say it is
polarized as all assemblies.

691
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:13,190
this resistor is used to have a
current flowing through it,

692
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:16,424
we impose a DC potential on its base,

693
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:19,161
the increase is
coupled on the basis,

694
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,996
we can couple the output on the collector

695
00:35:23,175 --> 00:35:26,633
and generally here we impose
a fixed potential DC

696
00:35:26,885 --> 00:35:30,460
on the collector and we find ourselves
with this famous calculation

697
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:34,113
which allows us to impose
a constant current.

698
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:36,930
thus, presented as large signals,

699
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:39,559
the difference between
the voltage V1 and V2,

700
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,310
it is the tension that you see here

701
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:44,082
and which is the voltage Uj.

702
00:35:45,337 --> 00:35:47,744
So this tension and this one
are following each other

703
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,159
with a voltage difference Ube

704
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,062
which is of the order
of magnitude of UJ.

705
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:54,295
So that's what you
see on this curve

706
00:35:54,513 --> 00:35:57,638
this is the characteristic large signals,

707
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,269
it is that the voltage V2
as a function of V1

708
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:03,103
it is simply a straight line with a shift

709
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:05,807
compared to a straight that
would have passed in the center

710
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:07,378
so that would have been like that

711
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,560
so that it is a perfect follower

712
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:13,071
but it is shifted to Uj because it is
necessary to drive the transistor

713
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:15,599
and here are the characteristics AC

714
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,395
the input impedance is high

715
00:36:18,745 --> 00:36:21,157
because it is 1 / Gbe + β x Rl,

716
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:22,503
you will see,

717
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:24,900
next week we wil analyze

718
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:26,202
how one increases this β

719
00:36:26,387 --> 00:36:28,414
by a assembly that we
will call Darlington.

720
00:36:29,268 --> 00:36:31,489
The output impedance
is low is what we want

721
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:33,268
this is the lowest impedance

722
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,712
that we can have at
the output of a transistor

723
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:37,702
it is that which appears
from its transmitter

724
00:36:37,913 --> 00:36:40,126
and the gain is of the order of 1.

725
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:42,324
So this tension there and here will follow

726
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:45,150
in increase with a given offset of J

727
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:49,102
so this is a gain which
is 45 degrees slope.

728
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:52,083
And that's reminder of what
is the common collector.

729
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,923
Very quickly also,

730
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,161
you take the common collector assembly

731
00:36:58,337 --> 00:37:01,363
and we saw that everywhere we
can remove the passive load,

732
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:02,804
to an active load

733
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:04,986
So you put a current mirror here

734
00:37:05,186 --> 00:37:06,843
which have an impedance R0,

735
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,628
you find that the input impedance is

736
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:12,630
really boosted
to extreme values

737
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:15,818
because if R0 is very high,

738
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,492
you end up with 1 / GbE + βR0

739
00:37:19,725 --> 00:37:21,279
and then if R0 is equal to infinity

740
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,462
it is as if you are saying
that this is actually infinite

741
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:28,307
so the input impedance
becomes extremely high.

742
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,195
The output impedance will
depend on the load resistance

743
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:34,896
and parallel with 1/Gm

744
00:37:35,056 --> 00:37:37,504
and generally it's dominated by 1/Gm.

745
00:37:38,124 --> 00:37:40,680
We agree that the resistance Rs

746
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,596
it's if you ever have a
voltage source here

747
00:37:45,855 --> 00:37:48,855
having a resistance Rs which provides

748
00:37:50,462 --> 00:37:51,472
the increases.

749
00:37:51,634 --> 00:37:54,259
So that is the resistance Rs,
it is divided by the β

750
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,099
and all that parallel with R0,

751
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,934
R0 is very high,

752
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:00,592
So here when you put it is low,

753
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:05,282
it's Rs/β if the β is very
high compared with low Rs

754
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,805
So this term will disappear

755
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,905
so the Rout will tend often to 1/Gm

756
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:13,979
and finally the
gain is GmR0 / 1 + GmR0,

757
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,034
the GmR0 given that R0

758
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:20,738
is a very high resistance

759
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:24,079
there if you put infinite
so you neglect the 1

760
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:25,598
Gm Gm fall,

761
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:28,231
This gives R0 on R0
which is of the order of 1.

762
00:38:30,187 --> 00:38:32,366
Improved Push-Pull mounting

763
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,473
in specific applications.

764
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:38,428
If you take the common collector assembly,

765
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,959
while ago I showed you the
common collector assembly

766
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:43,037
you will imagine that
this part does not exist.

767
00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:44,733
This is a common collector.

768
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,071
I will enter on V1,

769
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:51,796
I'm having a transistor whose
collector is connected to +Vcc

770
00:38:52,237 --> 00:38:54,662
and I put a resistance against the mass.

771
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:58,472
But what happens if
I am applying voltage

772
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:01,862
which compared to the mass
can have a positive component,

773
00:39:02,062 --> 00:39:03,978
a negative component

774
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:08,075
and I am really having a mass

775
00:39:08,437 --> 00:39:10,784
and a positive value and a negative value

776
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:12,495
and well at that point we appeal

777
00:39:12,661 --> 00:39:14,239
to two common collector assemblies.

778
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,657
Look, this is a common
collector type NPN,

779
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:21,529
that's a common-collector PNP.

780
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:24,653
So here when I move up the tension,

781
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:27,687
the current is here when
the voltage is going up,

782
00:39:28,286 --> 00:39:30,334
the current here it will go up,

783
00:39:30,646 --> 00:39:33,207
This voltage V2 will go up with.

784
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:36,777
If now I am on the other
side of my component

785
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,587
So I'm compared to the mass here,

786
00:39:38,762 --> 00:39:39,987
I lower the tension,

787
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,816
if I drop down this tension here

788
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:45,039
I go down with this
value that I draw in red,

789
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:47,343
you'll see that this tension is going down

790
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:49,514
so this transistor will block

791
00:39:50,384 --> 00:39:52,982
And there I will have this junction there

792
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:55,828
which will increase in that
direction for a PNP transistor.

793
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:59,937
So it will draw a current
that I design in red,

794
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,018
I'll have the blue power

795
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:05,522
that enters through this transistor,

796
00:40:05,712 --> 00:40:07,799
it goes in that direction in my load

797
00:40:08,424 --> 00:40:11,523
and I'll have the red current that
will pass from the mass,

798
00:40:11,866 --> 00:40:15,379
it turns red here, it comes here,
it continues its path

799
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:18,733
and it goes to a voltage -Vcc

800
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:21,937
So he goes from 0 to -Vcc

801
00:40:22,137 --> 00:40:24,481
or it goes from +Vcc to 0.

802
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:28,093
So if you put a voltage of 5V and -5 V,

803
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:29,587
we understand very very well,

804
00:40:29,758 --> 00:40:33,283
it's from 5V to 0 as the current goes
down in the blue direction

805
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:37,526
and from 0 to -5 which
will pass to the -Vcc.

806
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:40,480
And then your positive
and negative alternating

807
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:43,841
I draw the input voltage V1

808
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,931
that I appliy here in blue

809
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,536
and I watch what happens
to the output voltage,

810
00:40:49,724 --> 00:40:53,912
look there is always a lag
between the two worth Uj

811
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,522
because when this
transistor will lead look at,

812
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,216
if I apply a voltage equal to 0,

813
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:01,807
I am here.

814
00:41:01,994 --> 00:41:03,857
It's none of those
transistors that will drive.

815
00:41:04,024 --> 00:41:06,565
So here I really have 0V.

816
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,710
There is no current nor
blue nor red, we see it here.

817
00:41:09,873 --> 00:41:12,236
It was said that there is
a common collector up,

818
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,714
a common collector down.

819
00:41:13,899 --> 00:41:16,804
Which explains that I have
a great signal characteristic,

820
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,093
common NPN collector up

821
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:23,230
and the common collector down so the PNP.

822
00:41:23,575 --> 00:41:25,349
And I put them both together

823
00:41:25,612 --> 00:41:27,433
and it will make me all these features.

824
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:29,505
If I have a voltage
V1 equal to 0,

825
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,125
I have nothing that
leads both are blocked.

826
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:34,503
When I increases
in one direction there,

827
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:38,787
I'll have a transistor that will lead

828
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:41,817
and it'll be the NPN and I will
have a gain equal to 1

829
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,785
like any common collector

830
00:41:44,947 --> 00:41:46,627
and I have the current that will pass

831
00:41:46,812 --> 00:41:49,873
so in this case the voltage V2
will follow the voltage V1.

832
00:41:50,149 --> 00:41:52,168
Same on the other side,
that is the blue part

833
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,985
but I all the time have the offset,

834
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:57,744
remember that 45 degrees
is this straight here.

835
00:42:01,537 --> 00:42:03,602
And what you see here,
there is always a lag

836
00:42:03,776 --> 00:42:07,026
and it is seen that it is voltage Uj

837
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:08,896
which is between the
input and the output.

838
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:11,110
What is very interesting
in this kind of assembly,

839
00:42:11,287 --> 00:42:12,640
I was thinking a little,

840
00:42:12,983 --> 00:42:15,807
you can if you get to
increase this tension

841
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,504
beyond the voltage Vcc.

842
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:21,838
So this tension, it becomes almost

843
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:26,200
Uj greater than a collector voltage.

844
00:42:26,536 --> 00:42:28,730
Well you will have this tension here

845
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:31,549
wich will almost comes

846
00:42:31,912 --> 00:42:33,795
to your transistor saturation limit

847
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,548
and this explains what is written there.

848
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:40,499
There I noted that
the input voltage V1 is Vcc

849
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:44,393
if you put UCEsat = 0,

850
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,975
you consider that the
saturation voltage is nul,

851
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:51,526
you see that you can increase
the voltage V1 to Vcc + Uj

852
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:55,374
and there we usually reach
to the supply voltage

853
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,428
but think about it by your side

854
00:42:57,566 --> 00:42:59,291
what happens if you move up this tension

855
00:42:59,456 --> 00:43:01,063
slightly greater than Vcc

856
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:02,991
so you put Vcc + Uj

857
00:43:03,162 --> 00:43:05,430
and you bring the
voltage V1 to Vcc + Uj.

858
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:08,146
You will see that if it is equal to 0,

859
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:11,132
you will see the voltage
V2 will reach Vcc

860
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,042
and that is the upper limit

861
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,220
which is the saturation
of your transistor.

862
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:18,638
Otherwise, if you can not go beyond

863
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:22,561
well the maximum
voltage you can reach here

864
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:24,889
you will have this voltage Uj.

865
00:43:25,554 --> 00:43:27,092
And if you go up

866
00:43:27,275 --> 00:43:29,267
you bring this tension to Vcc

867
00:43:29,684 --> 00:43:33,130
the output voltage
is always Vcc-Uj

868
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:37,643
So you will lose Uij
against these power rails.

869
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,578
So I introduced the assembly

870
00:43:41,649 --> 00:43:43,902
Push-Pull as presented,

871
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,055
the Push-Pull word comes from
the fact that we "push"

872
00:43:47,237 --> 00:43:49,214
we push the current

873
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,953
and draws the "push-pull"
current of this current

874
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:56,190
because there are
both current directions.

875
00:43:56,377 --> 00:43:57,574
Now we will analyze

876
00:43:58,649 --> 00:44:01,058
the same assembly when
you want to improve it

877
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,616
so we understood

878
00:44:02,812 --> 00:44:06,267
I have a voltage difference
to the positive component

879
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:09,671
I'll erase what is written.

880
00:44:09,851 --> 00:44:11,421
When I have a positive component,

881
00:44:11,737 --> 00:44:15,610
I have a voltage difference of a value Uj,

882
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:17,786
I see it here when I have
the positive component,

883
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:21,529
I always have a shift of Uj
between node V1 and node V2.

884
00:44:22,087 --> 00:44:24,568
And when I have a negative component

885
00:44:24,758 --> 00:44:27,558
and well I have an Uj voltage
difference in this sense,

886
00:44:27,924 --> 00:44:31,354
this is due to this
and that's due to this.

887
00:44:32,287 --> 00:44:34,794
So I have all the time a shift of Uj.

888
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:37,475
Could I absorb that Uj

889
00:44:37,662 --> 00:44:39,980
and shift these two straight
and align them?

890
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:40,907
Of course.

891
00:44:41,172 --> 00:44:45,669
if I'm able to add a
voltage source Uj here

892
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,814
or add here a voltage source Uj.

893
00:44:52,287 --> 00:44:54,381
If I make from one side or the other,

894
00:44:54,643 --> 00:44:57,582
I have this difference becoming zero.

895
00:44:57,775 --> 00:45:03,770
So I have +Ui-Uj and
+Uj-Uj and it'll vanish

896
00:45:03,987 --> 00:45:05,119
and I have these two voltages

897
00:45:05,293 --> 00:45:07,401
which are all the time trying to follow

898
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:09,243
exactly without shift.

899
00:45:09,424 --> 00:45:11,227
There the two voltages V1 and V2

900
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:13,753
are shifted by this component

901
00:45:13,925 --> 00:45:16,060
which is because there is no polarization.

902
00:45:16,207 --> 00:45:19,253
Can we polarize?
Yes it would give this.

903
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:21,893
That is the polarization.

904
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:23,215
What I just have to do,

905
00:45:23,379 --> 00:45:25,186
I told you I will create a shift

906
00:45:25,363 --> 00:45:27,257
of the order of magnitude of Uj

907
00:45:27,757 --> 00:45:29,707
for a positive component, here.

908
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:31,849
I added a diode

909
00:45:32,511 --> 00:45:33,812
So here I have a Uj

910
00:45:34,504 --> 00:45:37,166
and there I also added another diode

911
00:45:37,872 --> 00:45:39,655
and there I have a voltage Uj.

912
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:41,626
When this transistor will drive,

913
00:45:41,797 --> 00:45:43,618
it will also impose a tension here

914
00:45:43,798 --> 00:45:45,715
the order I should have done it in blue,

915
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,753
what I'm going to do quickly.

916
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:52,301
So this transistor will drive with Uj

917
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:55,728
and this will impose Uj,

918
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,594
Now if you look at the
difference from here to there,

919
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,347
this difference is 0.

920
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:03,209
Check this is equal to this

921
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:05,450
and that equals that.

922
00:46:05,776 --> 00:46:09,388
So when one or the
other transistor will lead

923
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:12,361
it's ok you have a
voltage difference equals 0.

924
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:14,946
So it is a voltage follower,

925
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,428
what we had as characteristic

926
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,103
has complement aligned
by this straight one

927
00:46:19,284 --> 00:46:22,745
admitting that this voltage
is exactly equal to this one,

928
00:46:22,935 --> 00:46:24,491
it is exactly equal to that one.

929
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:27,218
Is this the case in practice?
No. Not quite.

930
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,611
There is a lag

931
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:30,832
Is there an opportunity
to improve this?

932
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:32,817
We will have a course
on the output stages

933
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,790
that I call power amplifiers,

934
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:38,809
I'm going to review this kind
of assembly a litle bit more

935
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:42,421
And you will see that there are
solutions that are used to improve

936
00:46:42,596 --> 00:46:43,836
this kind of pairing.

937
00:46:44,022 --> 00:46:46,319
Now when you look at this
assembly, you say it's true

938
00:46:46,497 --> 00:46:48,072
that it's a follower in tension,

939
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,728
I remember its role,

940
00:46:50,672 --> 00:46:52,708
the current that you take from here,

941
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,466
this current is a current that passes
in the base of one or other.

942
00:46:56,885 --> 00:46:59,595
The current that you draw from
the other side is β times

943
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:01,767
if it is a IB current,

944
00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:05,092
there it is a current β x IB.

945
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,038
so we took very little current

946
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:09,190
we sent much more current,

947
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:11,930
100 times, 200 times, 300 times
of current from the other side.

948
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,503
So I see the impedance from here

949
00:47:14,689 --> 00:47:17,277
is much larger than the
impedance that I see there,

950
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:18,959
this is a low impedance.

951
00:47:19,147 --> 00:47:21,691
And this is really what
we do with this assembly,

952
00:47:21,853 --> 00:47:24,092
we will use it as power stage.

953
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:28,172
If I put behind that side,
a voltage amplifier,

954
00:47:28,697 --> 00:47:30,823
the voltage amplifier
will amplify the tension,

955
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,675
it will come to follow
this tension, it follows it.

956
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:35,367
The input and output are the same,

957
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:36,642
but then in terms of current,

958
00:47:36,824 --> 00:47:38,911
it takes little current to
inject a lot of current.

959
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:42,521
Why ? Because the current comes
from there, from the power supply.

960
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:45,459
the current is being drawn
from the power supply

961
00:47:45,621 --> 00:47:47,697
or drawn from the negative supply

962
00:47:47,885 --> 00:47:50,447
finally sent back to the negative supply,

963
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:52,853
it is not taken from
the floor which is above.

964
00:47:53,054 --> 00:47:55,572
And you will see that we
will replace these transistors

965
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:58,413
later by an assembly called Darlington

966
00:47:58,594 --> 00:48:02,944
and the β will be much higher
than the β of a single transistor.

967
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:05,066
Can we improve this assembly?

968
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:07,314
We can do the next thing.

969
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:11,271
We can use a kind of counter-reaction.

970
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:13,110
Before commenting this assembly,

971
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,062
you know that an operational amplifier

972
00:48:16,247 --> 00:48:19,849
is a gain A which is infinite.

973
00:48:22,056 --> 00:48:23,621
This is a follower,

974
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:25,380
So a follower assembly

975
00:48:25,555 --> 00:48:27,891
do not make a difference between
this tension and this tension,

976
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,497
both voltages are the same,

977
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:31,809
this is the current which is amplified.

978
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:33,762
So if the tensions are the same

979
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:35,962
this stage there if you take it as it is,

980
00:48:36,135 --> 00:48:37,521
you put it inside your amp,

981
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:39,112
your amp does not change.

982
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:42,002
So if I draw it conceptually

983
00:48:43,285 --> 00:48:45,284
I would have seen
something quite like that.

984
00:48:46,197 --> 00:48:49,810
I forgot the buffer between the two.

985
00:48:52,247 --> 00:48:54,887
And I look at my amp
that is well and truly a follower.

986
00:48:55,069 --> 00:48:58,148
The tension I put here,
appears at the output here,

987
00:48:58,459 --> 00:49:00,417
not this stage it added nothing,

988
00:49:00,697 --> 00:49:02,397
it just followed up in tension.

989
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,671
What is its advantage?

990
00:49:04,218 --> 00:49:06,165
Well it still took little
current from the amp,

991
00:49:06,335 --> 00:49:07,918
sent a lot of current in the load.

992
00:49:09,183 --> 00:49:12,808
And linear perspective when
I said V1 is equal to V2,

993
00:49:13,234 --> 00:49:15,506
and well I linearized my assembly

994
00:49:16,009 --> 00:49:18,715
by the counter-reaction

995
00:49:18,913 --> 00:49:22,525
and we can watch it by analyzing
what I have written about it.

996
00:49:23,196 --> 00:49:26,703
If you look at V2 voltage
compared to V'1,

997
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:29,034
there is a lag for an alternation

998
00:49:29,637 --> 00:49:31,683
on one side or the other,

999
00:49:31,854 --> 00:49:34,038
that's Uj and that's Uj.

1000
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:36,519
So when we drive up or down,

1001
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,409
there will have this lag.

1002
00:49:38,585 --> 00:49:40,534
So this voltage when it rises,

1003
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,472
it has an offset of +Uj
relative to this voltage

1004
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,797
and when it goes down it has an offset

1005
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,088
of -Uj relative to this voltage.

1006
00:49:48,269 --> 00:49:49,281
Then I noticed here:

1007
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:53,156
if V2 = V '1-Uj, I'm talking about
the positive alternation.

1008
00:49:54,834 --> 00:49:56,810
Now I look at this amp,

1009
00:49:57,166 --> 00:50:00,253
the amp takes V2 it puts it here,

1010
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:02,018
So this is V2 too.

1011
00:50:03,526 --> 00:50:09,089
the amp is (V1-V2) A = V'1.

1012
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:10,768
This is what makes an amp.

1013
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,233
So it takes the voltage difference

1014
00:50:13,899 --> 00:50:16,002
(V1-V2)A

1015
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:18,847
and it will put it to the output.

1016
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:22,304
Now if I have V'1 which is equal to this

1017
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:25,261
and I've V2 that I have just expressed

1018
00:50:25,447 --> 00:50:28,807
I can express V'1 and
replace it by its value here

1019
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:32,532
so I take V'1 by
its value, I put it there,

1020
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:36,261
I express what comes out
of these two relations,

1021
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,386
it will give me V2 = AV1-AV2-Uj

1022
00:50:40,574 --> 00:50:42,438
that I write according to V2

1023
00:50:42,634 --> 00:50:44,819
otherwise taking A highlight,

1024
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:50,660
it's AV1-Uj / 1 + A.

1025
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:53,731
So if I neglect this
with respect to A x V1

1026
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,536
and the 1 according to A,

1027
00:50:56,723 --> 00:50:59,856
it will give me V2 is equal to V1.

1028
00:51:00,147 --> 00:51:02,870
Why ? Because it's a A, which is very high

1029
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,630
therefore the infinite relative to 1 is A

1030
00:51:05,905 --> 00:51:09,717
and infinite time V1-Uj is again AV1

1031
00:51:10,259 --> 00:51:13,163
and A will disappear so
that gives me V2 = V1.

1032
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,125
And when you take
this kind of assembly

1033
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,629
and you don't put the
two diodes I reported

1034
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:20,660
with paths for current to polarize them

1035
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:21,813
well you find yourself

1036
00:51:21,984 --> 00:51:25,057
with a characteristic that
is almost the one in red

1037
00:51:25,257 --> 00:51:28,036
and what you put, the part ...

1038
00:51:29,135 --> 00:51:31,316
V1 which is in blue dashed line

1039
00:51:32,075 --> 00:51:35,509
and the voltage V2 which
is in red dashed line

1040
00:51:35,822 --> 00:51:37,708
is absolutely confused

1041
00:51:37,943 --> 00:51:41,018
it is simply V'1 that will be shifted

1042
00:51:41,259 --> 00:51:43,778
of a Uj value relative
to the output voltage

1043
00:51:44,163 --> 00:51:46,145
to +Uj or -Uj.

1044
00:51:46,322 --> 00:51:49,187
It depends how you look when
there is a positive alternation

1045
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,926
or a negative alternation.

1046
00:51:52,062 --> 00:51:53,833
Of course you can also
add the two diodes

1047
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,007
So the two solutions
may be accumulated,

1048
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:59,059
add here two diodes and
do the counter-reaction,

1049
00:51:59,237 --> 00:52:01,438
and get both for linearity

1050
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:04,228
which will be increased
to such an assembly

1051
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:06,920
which acts as an output stage.

1052
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:08,999
Here there is a great
advantage compared to the first,

1053
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:10,323
is that if your amp

1054
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:14,915
here has an infinite impedance,
this current is equal to 0

1055
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:18,247
and the stage which carries the
voltage gain which is above

1056
00:52:18,421 --> 00:52:20,035
really sees an infinite impedance,

1057
00:52:20,222 --> 00:52:23,042
so it's great to achieve
the output stages.

1058
00:52:23,947 --> 00:52:26,960
I would like to summarize what we have
just seen throughout this week.

1059
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:28,963
In my opinion this is
one of the chapters,

1060
00:52:29,135 --> 00:52:31,030
the most important to
understand how to use

1061
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:32,907
the operational amplifiers

1062
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:35,680
because we saw all components

1063
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,835
that we will study in the next week

1064
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:42,041
and that will show us
that an operational amplifier

1065
00:52:42,547 --> 00:52:45,646
are stages that we're going
to put one after the other.

1066
00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:47,403
So we realized that there is

1067
00:52:47,648 --> 00:52:50,710
a stage for excellence that
makes the voltage gain,

1068
00:52:50,897 --> 00:52:52,478
it is called common emitter

1069
00:52:52,705 --> 00:52:55,901
which improve by putting
a common base in series

1070
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,577
because we make the Cascode Assembly

1071
00:52:57,947 --> 00:53:00,685
and that we need the
common collector to follow

1072
00:53:01,518 --> 00:53:02,920
after the common emitter.

1073
00:53:03,102 --> 00:53:04,927
On one side it does not degrade the gain

1074
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,934
and on the other side
it allows for a buffer

1075
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:10,372
so that the output is reached
to provide a high current

1076
00:53:10,545 --> 00:53:12,270
in low loads.

1077
00:53:12,937 --> 00:53:13,901
Next week

1078
00:53:14,076 --> 00:53:16,301
I make a small introduction
to the chapter ahead.

1079
00:53:16,475 --> 00:53:18,367
Next week it will be a summary

1080
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,766
virtually of all what we saw,

1081
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,357
I'll just introduce at
the beginning of my chapter

1082
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:26,106
what I call the differential amplifier,

1083
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:29,674
it is an important element
for the operational amplifiers

1084
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:33,372
and you'll see the rest is
doing stages that will follow

1085
00:53:33,563 --> 00:53:36,362
and we are at the stage
of synthesizing circuits

1086
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,549
to reason in terms
of functional block

1087
00:53:38,725 --> 00:53:41,982
and it will be a summary
of what we have seen until now

1088
00:53:42,162 --> 00:53:43,522
in this electronic course.
