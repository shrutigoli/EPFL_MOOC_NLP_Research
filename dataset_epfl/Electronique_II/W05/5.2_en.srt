1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:08,305
So in the continuation of
what we have just seen,

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,789
we will now analyze a real
implementation and analysis

3
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:15,952
of this emitter-common mounting

4
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:19,258
with the components we have
just seen which are essential

5
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:21,600
for the use of this amplifier

6
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:25,534
when it is realized as an AC amplifier.

7
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:28,615
So let's look at how do
we analyze an assembly

8
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:31,565
with 3 resistors and 3 capacities

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,182
we would have added for the
coupling and decoupling

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,561
and the polarization that will
be the subject of this part

11
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:40,856
and then we continue with
the analysis of what is called

12
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,336
he elbow break mounting which is
an improvement of this assembly

13
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:49,715
voltage amplifier realized
using a common emitter.

14
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:53,102
So as presented that

15
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:55,521
it always revolves around
the common emitter

16
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,883
also presented as it will turn
around this polarization there,

17
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:01,924
here to the right,

18
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:04,569
you have the famous full scheme

19
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:06,970
which was presented just before

20
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,283
and we saw the 3 capacities
which had to be added

21
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:15,109
and we had seen that the difference
between this assembly

22
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:16,951
and its small signals

23
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:19,236
scheme

24
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:21,262
and the fact that this capacity

25
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:23,761
allows to connect the
transmitter to ground

26
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:25,718
and that this capacity,

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,559
it brings us back to what
we had already studied before

28
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:32,898
and the input impedance and
the output impedance, the gain

29
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,366
this is what is now
known by any student

30
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,417
who had taken the course
from the beginning.

31
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,586
In the center,

32
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,748
I present what I call the
great scheme signals.

33
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:45,208
The major pattern signals is that
you take the common emitter

34
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,293
and connect between the base

35
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:51,606
and ground a source of DC voltage,

36
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:53,851
so I insisted on the fact that

37
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,925
this is a DC source.

38
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:00,509
And I vary

39
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:03,509
the DC voltage from 0,

40
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:06,476
therefore the voltage V1 I vary from 0

41
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,934
to VCC

42
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,162
and you will see that
your  transistor count

43
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:13,288
voltage V1 equal to 0,

44
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,669
so this is short-circuited here
the transistor is blocked.

45
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:20,457
And when a transistor
is blocked, no current flows

46
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:23,720
therefore this tension equals to this one.

47
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:25,995
When there is no current which
passes through this resistance

48
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:28,451
there is no voltage drop at the
edge of this resistance,

49
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:31,349
this node will copy the voltage VCC.

50
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:36,482
And if you start to
increase the DC voltage here

51
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:38,162
you will see that

52
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:40,884
the transistor comes
out of the blocking

53
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,953
around the junction voltage

54
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:47,543
and after you are going to have
the exponential transistor law

55
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:51,472
precisely because we plugged
in the transmitter to ground.

56
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:54,793
We call this type of representation

57
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:59,128
large signals pattern
or it is called DC analysis

58
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,994
when you make a "spice" simulation

59
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,575
to see the same thing

60
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:05,308
you must go to see a DC analysis

61
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,610
by putting a source
of DC voltage at the input.

62
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:12,904
If we rather want to look at this,
it will be necessary to put an AC source

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,480
and if you take the complete pattern

64
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:17,949
and you take away the capacities,

65
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:21,328
the DC analysis is by plugging
a DC voltage source here

66
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:23,829
instead of those 2 resistances

67
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:27,131
and the AC analysis is by
putting an AC source here

68
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,393
and looking at the change in this node

69
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:31,309
which corresponds to an AC node,

70
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:33,683
but the pattern small signals of C2

71
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:37,772
if the decoupling capacity
CE is well calculated,

72
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:41,331
it would amount to the same
assembly therefore that gain one.

73
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:44,270
So in this chapter I will go through

74
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:47,822
the analysis in detail of this assembly

75
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:50,590
and go step by step to understand

76
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:55,078
all the laws that allow
us to dimension it

77
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:57,559
in any case analyze it through

78
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:01,374
the 3 modes of DC analysis
point of operation

79
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:03,860
followed by large signals analysis

80
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:07,948
therefore DC and terminated
by the small signals scheme.

81
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:09,846
Here it is !

82
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:11,609
The first thing,

83
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,865
that anyone who sees
a pattern of that style

84
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:16,424
having known values

85
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:20,163
R1, R2, RE, RC, everything is given,

86
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,830
you can immediately calculate

87
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:27,101
all the parameters needed
to analyze this scheme.

88
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:30,468
The potential VB0,

89
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:32,375
as analyzed before,

90
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,488
we hide the assembly
and we consider IB0

91
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,879
almost negligible

92
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:38,715
therefore it is neglected,

93
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:40,358
we can neglect it

94
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,783
provided that

95
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,193
we imposed a current IR1

96
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:48,404
significantly higher than IB0,

97
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:50,095
it has already been explained.

98
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:53,179
So if you take IR1 of the
order of ten times IB0,

99
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:54,617
you can safely

100
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:58,109
consider that this is anything other
than a conventional resistive divider.

101
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:01,824
Hold you take the voltage VCC,
you lower it to VB0

102
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:05,225
by putting two resistors R1,
R2 of your choice

103
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:07,740
and these two resistors must obey

104
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:10,011
the fact that the currents
passing through them,

105
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:12,891
it is still 10 times higher
than the current

106
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:14,501
that your assembly will take.

107
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,316
And it allows you to
write after this VBO law

108
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:20,582
and you put the ...

109
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,373
so you choose your VB0

110
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:25,733
and you write the relationship
of a resistive divider.

111
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:27,753
Now the VE0 voltage,

112
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,817
it's the same thing that VB0

113
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,592
dropped of UJ

114
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:35,217
which appears between base
and emitter of this transistor.

115
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,550
That's it ! This transistor

116
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:40,988
contains everything needed

117
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:44,267
to obtain a current IE0,

118
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:48,119
this current IE0

119
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,119
which is the same as IC0,

120
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:54,317
we get it through this resistance.

121
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:57,985
So VB0 minus UJ divided by RE

122
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:01,725
gives us the IC0 current,

123
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,729
and there we can deduce
what is the current IB0

124
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:08,854
and it would give us this relationship.

125
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:11,299
Of course one must know
the beta of the transistor.

126
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:14,381
And that's it, we have the value of VC0

127
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,339
because IC0 is given.

128
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,856
We have the value of
the load resistance,

129
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:22,250
it gives us directly
what the potential VC0 is.

130
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:25,589
Someone who has done this
systematic approach knows,

131
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:27,882
there is nothing to do, it's called

132
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:32,062
the operating point or the
resting point of this assembly

133
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,904
and by analyzing it

134
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:38,592
if we have the values,
it is traversed in this way.

135
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,553
If we do not have those values,

136
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:42,781
we have to go in that direction.

137
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,258
It is necessary to impose IC0,

138
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,247
know the current that
will be used to polarize

139
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:48,917
and make the steps in this direction.

140
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:50,185
That is what will give us

141
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:52,742
what is the tension
that we need to impose

142
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,389
and in this case
calculate R1 and R2 values

143
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:56,762
such that their sum

144
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,676
allows a current

145
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:02,150
which traverses them IR1
to be higher to 10 times IB0.

146
00:07:02,616 --> 00:07:04,136
But once we did that,

147
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:07,826
we can pass on AC analysis.

148
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:09,843
The AC analysis means

149
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:12,926
you need to know everything
that concerns your transistor

150
00:07:13,353 --> 00:07:15,473
when you take it off
and you put in place

151
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,170
a small signals diagram
we will see just now,

152
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,395
it is the GM, the GBE and the GCE

153
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:24,473
which depend on this IC0 we just imposed

154
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:26,918
and analyzed by this scheme

155
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:30,006
otherwise UT is known 26 millivolt,

156
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,059
beta of the transistor is known,

157
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:34,833
VA is the Early voltage,

158
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:40,176
Therefore the GM, GBE, GCE arise
from the fact that IC0 is imposed.

159
00:07:42,197 --> 00:07:44,849
We will analyze the
characteristics and large signal

160
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,995
of such an assembly. So I repeat

161
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,179
here you have the point of operation,

162
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:52,377
here you have the AC
settings of your transistor

163
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:55,777
and we will look to what is
happening with this montage

164
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:58,595
if there has not been this
resistance which is there,

165
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:01,391
so I'll erase the
resistance that is here.

166
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:03,543
This resistance

167
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:08,694
which is here we will delete it

168
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:12,421
and same for the resistance of the top,

169
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:16,151
it does not exist and
we will replace them,

170
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:19,318
this resistive divider by a real ...

171
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,013
by a real assembly

172
00:08:25,232 --> 00:08:27,667
with a voltage source
that will connect here.

173
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:31,555
So I'm going to draw
a voltage source

174
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:33,618
but I'm going to
eliminate these capabilities

175
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:35,206
because they are useless

176
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,499
and we will look

177
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:41,569
at what will happen
with all that variation

178
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,982
of potential content of
this transistor when

179
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,099
a DC type voltage source
is connected there,

180
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:51,775
so I plug here

181
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:54,762
a DC voltage source

182
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:56,893
and this DC voltage source

183
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,313
I call it

184
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:05,037
VB because it is directly connected
to the base of this transistor.

185
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:09,236
And I will vary the voltage
source from 0 to VCC

186
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,119
and observe what will
happen with VE, VC

187
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:16,693
in VB we known that
is the source itself

188
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:20,134
and that, it allows us
to see the large signals,

189
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:22,731
the characteristics large signal

190
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:25,698
or in other words, the test
analysis of such a assembly.

191
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:27,608
Of course the capabilities,
they can remain

192
00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:29,587
or be eliminated
it doesn't change anything.

193
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:32,292
Because these capacities
face to face a test variation

194
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:34,473
does not intervene at all

195
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:36,968
on what we will see on that
node then that node or that.

196
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:40,269
We come to the assembly as seen

197
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:44,152
with an input VB, an output VE,

198
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:46,237
these 2 tensions follow on another.

199
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:49,349
Everything you put on the VB,
it copied them on the VE

200
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,106
with a voltage drop is equal to UJ

201
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:54,464
So you have a voltage drop here:

202
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:56,143
of the UJ

203
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:58,272
and this voltage
of variation account,

204
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:00,125
come up or down

205
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:03,163
that it absolutely follows
is what we see here.

206
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:04,898
It is necessary
that the transistor

207
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,892
must be greater than VB UJ

208
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:10,688
so that the transistor
comes out of blocking,

209
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,511
so there my transistor is off,

210
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:14,054
here my transistor is off

211
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,415
and then after VE
will absolutely follow

212
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:19,954
the variation of VB.

213
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:23,594
So this is a right
that has a slope of 45 °

214
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:26,008
because VB and VE are ...

215
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:29,917
we also call a follower transmitter

216
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,233
because the transmitter
follows the variation

217
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:34,812
of what they put
him as voltage based.

218
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:37,583
We'll now pass

219
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:40,205
to observe what will happen with VC.

220
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:42,767
I repeat the same pattern,

221
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:47,605
and I look at the potential VC.

222
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:48,896
We saw VE

223
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:51,201
and we want to
see what happens with VC.

224
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:53,571
How it behaves this transistor?

225
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,520
So you remember that I already

226
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,432
erased my resistance,

227
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:02,429
my resistance no longer exist,
these resistors there are erased,

228
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:04,458
I remake on this new slide

229
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,407
not to disturb you,

230
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:07,822
I delete it,

231
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:11,443
there is no such resistance
and then I replace

232
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:15,464
by a voltage source VB.

233
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:18,207
And I quickly added

234
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,547
my voltage source here

235
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,303
which is VB and I'll observe

236
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:28,262
what will happen to the output

237
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:32,514
to know on VC because the
output is considered VC,

238
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:34,283
I go out on the collector.

239
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:38,475
I go out on the collector,
I see here a slope

240
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:40,648
which corresponds
to the following:

241
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,781
when you have a VB voltage
here that starts from 0,

242
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,996
VE will follow her,

243
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:50,117
I increase the  VB voltage

244
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,001
I will have the transistor
which comes out of the blockage

245
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:56,707
So VE copy VB,

246
00:11:57,488 --> 00:11:59,562
we see him increase

247
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,598
at the same time
he will be a current IC

248
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:06,921
which will start in the transistor
and the more I increases

249
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:09,732
the voltage VB,

250
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:12,188
I'm increase VE

251
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,891
so I'm trying to increase IC with, why?

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,412
Because it's VB minus UJ
divided by RE it gives IE

253
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,420
and this IE is exactly IC so I have

254
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,656
a voltage which rises
at the same time,

255
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:26,855
this current then increases
at the same time.

256
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,489
So this current here, it is currently
increasing at the same time.

257
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,575
Look, when you increase the IC current

258
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:35,658
what's happening with
this tension beside RC?

259
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,904
so the voltage VC decreases with,

260
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:41,490
more IC increases, the VC
voltage approaches the ground.

261
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:42,929
So if you measure

262
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,726
the voltage VC with
respect to ground

263
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:49,185
this is usually done, we put
a voltmeter with a tip here

264
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:52,468
and observed VC and we will
see that VC is diminishing.

265
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:56,437
so we will see that
most VB increases,

266
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:59,509
IC increases, VC decreases,

267
00:12:59,656 --> 00:13:01,478
which is why we
have the minus sign

268
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:03,847
in a transistor when
looking at his gain,

269
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:06,997
we say that VC is in
the opposite sense that VB,

270
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:08,390
there is a delay

271
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:12,212
of 180 ° when is about
a sinusoidal voltage.

272
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:13,634
And look what is
happening there.

273
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:16,759
I see VC coming down that goes
down and it goes down until when?

274
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:21,409
You see VE increases,
VE is going up

275
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:23,859
and VC is going down

276
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:25,911
and there we  have a
transistor between the two,

277
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:29,567
a transistor when
VC equals to VE,

278
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:31,686
it saturates.

279
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:33,991
And in reality, in practice, it saturates

280
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:37,126
before VC equals 0,

281
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:40,522
but there VC will go down, VE is going up

282
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:43,464
and it will reach the
saturation of this transistor

283
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,030
and when a
transistor saturates

284
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:49,117
the linear region using
your amp does not exist.

285
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:53,482
There, any variation
in VB versus VC,

286
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:57,316
apart from the fact that it is
a negative sign, we just explain

287
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,458
and well we see that there is a linearity

288
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,490
well this  linearity is a gain

289
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:05,197
with a negative sign
that has some value.

290
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:06,937
But as soon as
the transistor saturates,

291
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,281
this tension becomes
like a circuit there,

292
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:11,495
short circuit, it is
short-circuited here,

293
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:13,215
so he has no more this effect.

294
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:16,549
We'll see VB and VE
which continue to follow,

295
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:19,283
but your transistor will see  RC and RE

296
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,172
at the exit that affect

297
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,455
and you have an IC current here

298
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,329
which will be dominated by the
current flowing through the base.

299
00:14:27,276 --> 00:14:28,282
So this current,

300
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,699
it can not  more grow,
he continues on his way,

301
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:35,220
it adds to IB the current
so IE is not equal to IC

302
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:38,679
on the contrary because it is more
IB which will increase the current

303
00:14:38,804 --> 00:14:40,785
RE in resistance rather than IC.

304
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:42,244
But what I would say,

305
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:45,798
the transistor go
from a blocked situation

306
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:50,953
and it will reach the situation where
the transistor is saturated.

307
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:56,398
And right now, I
would put everything flat

308
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:59,202
and look at what happened
with my assembly

309
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:04,690
the layout editing
here showed me

310
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:08,163
all that will happen with my
transistor conducts and impose

311
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:11,369
DC voltages, there is no variation,

312
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:14,723
I am not at all interested
with an AC signal.

313
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,344
I am especially interested

314
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,984
at a DC behavior of this transistor

315
00:15:20,345 --> 00:15:23,036
and in this case,
there is a particular point,

316
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:26,198
that is this transistor
then when I realized

317
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:29,533
I put a resistor
R1 and R2 to polarize

318
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,498
and I found the VC0 tension
there, that's the VC0 voltage,

319
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:35,558
for voltage VC0

320
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:40,768
of course I have a voltage VE0

321
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,917
on this curve there

322
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:45,992
which corresponds to a current
flowing through my transistor.

323
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,309
And there is a variation in VC
compared to VB which is a straight,

324
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:56,028
what is the slope of this
line? This is - RC / RE

325
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,574
so the exercise we treated

326
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,937
outside this video

327
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:05,163
on RE on RC which demonstrating that
the gain is equal to RC / RE seen here.

328
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:09,380
I, I've mentioned before to say
the gain equal to - RC / RE.

329
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,445
Well this is a gain

330
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:14,364
fairly linear because It is
a ratio of 2 resistances,

331
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:18,259
if you put RC larger than RE,
it is a gain as seen here

332
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:19,709
with a negative sign

333
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:24,011
because there is the fact that VC
decreases as VE increases,

334
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,528
Sorry, forgiveness
that VB increases.

335
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,828
And this is the behavior
of this transistor:

336
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:31,936
I'll show you what's happens with,

337
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,570
if I add a signal here
which arying at the input

338
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:37,509
so here I plug a signal,

339
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:39,468
this is my editing,

340
00:16:40,012 --> 00:16:42,328
this is my DC analysis
of my editing

341
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,115
and there I took my editing
and I have varied

342
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:47,239
at a low frequency of course

343
00:16:47,368 --> 00:16:49,306
to prevent the capacities to do anything

344
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:52,237
so I connected a voltage source here

345
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,590
I did varied like that

346
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,945
and I looked at the behavior of VC,

347
00:16:57,177 --> 00:16:58,299
I see that,

348
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:02,667
then I applied a very low f
requency signal on VB,

349
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:07,081
I see that the same signal is
on VE with a shift of UJ,

350
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:09,723
this UJ which is between
the 2 is shown there,

351
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:12,080
it is between these two there.

352
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:14,104
So what's interesting in there

353
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,773
is that the voltage
VC that I see here,

354
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:20,544
I have voltage VC  nonlinear

355
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:23,132
because this VC
when the transistor is off,

356
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,292
he stuck to VCC.

357
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:28,553
And when VC reaches VE,

358
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:32,106
So you see when VC reaches
VE is in those points,

359
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:36,050
my transistor is saturated,
the VCE is equal to 0

360
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,622
and we see these
nonlinearities that occur,

361
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:41,147
a low frequency sinusoidal
voltage is applied,

362
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,010
I insist on the word low
frequency to say that

363
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,333
it really is a change in
the extremely low frequency

364
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:51,752
to be seen as if it had
been a DC variation

365
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:53,806
and we seen that the signal

366
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:57,308
that rises and falls like a sinusoidal

367
00:17:57,614 --> 00:18:00,002
gave a signal which is
absolutely distorted,

368
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:03,617
when transistor typed
account, he blocked.

369
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,485
Here we found VCC that does not vary

370
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,770
and when the transistor saturated,
we saw the effect of saturation

371
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,329
so we walked on this straight line

372
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:17,448
and we put a VB variation which
surpassed the dynamics of this.

373
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:20,267
And here, I used the term: the dynamics.

374
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:23,607
So I was putting a tension much larger

375
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:26,888
so that my transistor
saturates or blocks

376
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,003
and that is what will define
what we will call the dynamic.

377
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:33,770
So this curve allows me to see

378
00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:39,510
what is my transistor operating range

379
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:40,982
when it's linear

380
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:44,732
and I can say that for
such value equal to VB

381
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:47,482
and this tension there,

382
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:52,128
I have a linear area
having a slope -RC / RE

383
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:54,807
and it will give me
what I'll call after

384
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,283
the gain of this assembly

385
00:18:58,152 --> 00:19:02,765
with respect to a continuous
signal as imposing upon entry

386
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,821
and I do vary at low frequency.

387
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:08,182
I continue the analysis of this assembly,

388
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,375
I eliminated the resistance
that I added here

389
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:15,900
just so you do not put it
back in parallel with RC

390
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:18,716
otherwise if I said there
must be considered

391
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,206
RC that is in parallel with
the impedance was there

392
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:25,923
but then I have to
put what is blue

393
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:28,314
because I would
like to analyze in AC

394
00:19:28,873 --> 00:19:31,262
what is happens with my
assembly so I take a

395
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:33,640
variable source in
time having a frequency

396
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,948
sufficiently high that this capacity
is shorted-circuited

397
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:40,920
and all this behaves
as a high pass filter

398
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,369
and that this also

399
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:45,973
allows current to
flow in this capacity

400
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,952
I calculated adequately

401
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:50,005
for it creates a short circuit here

402
00:19:50,587 --> 00:19:54,091
and I take this circuit
and I do his AC model here.

403
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:58,301
The AC model of this assembly,
that is what we had learned before,

404
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:01,507
so I short-circuit which is
connected to ground,

405
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,753
so the resistance RC comes here

406
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:05,631
and watch the RE resistance

407
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,972
once short-circuited by this
capacity it will disappear.

408
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:12,300
The two resistors R1 is
in parallel with R2

409
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:15,341
because they brought VCC
and was shorted-circuited

410
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:17,060
and I keep my transistor,

411
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:20,549
we agree that this is
a symbolic representation

412
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:22,407
in order to apply the AC model,

413
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:24,847
otherwise you can
remove this transistor

414
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:27,929
and replace the model small
signals we had studied before.

415
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:31,149
And the calculation here
is a very simple calculation,

416
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,885
it has been done before,

417
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,440
it shows that I have
a gain equal to -GM

418
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,719
multiplied by the parallel

419
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:43,163
of 1 / GCE parallel with RC.

420
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:45,991
And the impedance
seen at the input,

421
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,434
it is the paralleling of
these two resistors

422
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,837
parallel with 1 / GBE

423
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,167
and that is what
is written here.

424
00:20:52,306 --> 00:20:55,614
Therefore the input impedance is known,
the output impedance is known,

425
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:58,970
and the voltage gain is known.

426
00:20:59,129 --> 00:21:01,419
So the fact of having added this capacity,

427
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:05,440
it allowed me to fall
on the gain expression

428
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:07,207
that had been found
for a common transmitter

429
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,802
because well and truly your
transmitter is in common,

430
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,426
it has been connected to the ground

431
00:21:12,712 --> 00:21:16,092
and it has become in common
between the input and the output.

432
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:18,228
Look, with this capacity

433
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:20,332
and found expression of the gain

434
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,880
what we had to analyze
a common emitter.

435
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,477
So a common emitter

436
00:21:25,677 --> 00:21:29,013
after polarization
needs this capability

437
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,309
and this capacity
will allow us then

438
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,575
to impose a potential VE0

439
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:37,300
will remain fairly stable.

440
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,839
This capacity, she is
so great in his choice

441
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:42,729
We shall study later how
it is properly calculated,

442
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,885
but this ability is so great

443
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:48,031
and imposes a
constant VE0 potential.

444
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:50,272
So finally, your transistor,

445
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:53,801
it will be stuck by the
VCC voltage and VE0.

446
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:56,812
And there I come to
the most important point

447
00:21:56,968 --> 00:21:58,631
of the transistor of use,

448
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:02,923
is that we wanted him
applying a variable voltage here

449
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:05,464
and there find the exit

450
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:09,019
and was presented and
was told that there is a gain,

451
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:11,477
but it is a gain that
does not mean anything.

452
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:15,998
If your signal is distorted,
ie if your signal

453
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:18,918
is which is the output

454
00:22:20,286 --> 00:22:21,363
which has a dynamic,

455
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:23,512
this is the important
word I would use

456
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:26,112
which is within this range
there, watching my 2 fingers

457
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:29,601
my 2 fingers to see
a DC voltage VCC

458
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,653
so a direct voltage VE0

459
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:34,331
if we consider that C
the capacity is infinite

460
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:38,258
and the voltage VC here can rise

461
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:41,895
there all your tension,
it can rise up here

462
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:45,142
And it will go down to here
and that is the maximum

463
00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:49,325
Why ? Because if you
bring it to go beyond that,

464
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:50,851
your signal can not

465
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,771
And if you ask him to go lower than VE0,

466
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:55,093
your signal can not.

467
00:22:55,414 --> 00:22:57,217
So if you ask this
question to someone,

468
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,090
there is a ceiling and a floor

469
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:01,491
and you want to make
sure that there is something

470
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:04,253
which is between the 2
having the maximum of dynamics,

471
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:07,745
therefore the maximum
opportunity to swing in,

472
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,498
This person will tell you then choose VC0

473
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:12,605
In the middle of these 2.

474
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:17,121
So if you set VC0
to VCC - VE0 / 2

475
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:19,130
you have answered the question

476
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:23,157
that your signal dynamics
is the greatest possible.

477
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:26,325
And that is the most important
parameter in the design,

478
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:27,886
this is the dynamic,

479
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:29,622
this is not the gain,

480
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:34,034
because VC0 tension,
I'll write it elsewhere,

481
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,859
the VC0 tension,

482
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,129
this tension from
here to there in DC,

483
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:40,524
I should do it in red,

484
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:44,534
this tension from here
to there in DC what is it?

485
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:48,804
This is  IC0 multiplied by RC.

486
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:52,670
So this voltage I0 x RC.

487
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:54,858
look I'll write something in the gain here

488
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:56,670
I'll replace GM with its value

489
00:23:57,215 --> 00:23:59,794
GM with its value or
rather I will write here

490
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:09,769
GM is worth less IC0
divided by UT Multiplied by R out

491
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,928
and R out in this case is RC here

492
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:15,589
if we neglect the 1 / GCE
therefore multiplied by RC.

493
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:19,237
So that, we have neglected this

494
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:21,290
it gives this value

495
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,740
IC0 RC

496
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:27,054
well that's what I wrote here.

497
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:29,174
So I can write the gain very well

498
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:31,171
as being less,

499
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:34,475
we'll call it HRV

500
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:38,467
minus VRC divided by UT.

501
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,183
And that HRV is the voltage
from here to there, DC

502
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:44,696
and it is this tension then

503
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:49,405
that generally you had
to choose equals VC0 - VE0

504
00:24:49,932 --> 00:24:51,972
for that and it is the same,

505
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:56,194
therefore as soon as the dynamics have been
chosen, we have imposed the gain as well.

506
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:58,725
So this is the
The most important

507
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:01,471
that a circuit designer
should pay attention,

508
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,934
is choosing the operating point

509
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,065
such that VC0 is In
the middle of that beach

510
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:10,363
And once we chose this,

511
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:13,034
this is one ignores it

512
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:14,974
and falls on the fact that

513
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:18,449
the gain depends on
this dynamic too.

514
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:21,459
I would like to comment

515
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:25,471
on the so-called load lines,

516
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,827
straight with S because
there are two lines of loads.

517
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:31,299
There is the charge line
Which is due to the fact

518
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:34,372
that in DC,
capacities are involved.

519
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:38,062
That's what we did when we
put a DC voltage source here.

520
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:40,491
If you vary the tension there

521
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:45,282
and you watch what happens
on the voltage VC0,

522
00:25:46,032 --> 00:25:48,970
So I bring this voltage VC,

523
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,708
you'll see this line,

524
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:54,232
this line corresponds to the variation

525
00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:58,617
of current with respect,

526
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:03,603
I hear the voltage VC with
respect to the current IC.

527
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:07,969
By increasing the voltage
VB, you increase IC

528
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:12,275
and you will fall
or raise this potential

529
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:15,458
and we find what is called
the line of static charge.

530
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:18,444
do not forget that at that time

531
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:22,451
The resistance RE will act because
this capacitance has no effect

532
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:24,943
it is as if this capability
does not exist.

533
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,906
And if you look at the
slope of this straight line

534
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:30,810
it will depend on RC and
RE at the same time,

535
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:34,408
but if you put an AC signal

536
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:35,939
having a frequency

537
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:39,371
Which causes this capacitance
to be short-circuited,

538
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:43,295
so your RE resistance is short-circuited,

539
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:46,974
you end up with your
issuer that is pulled to ground

540
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:50,285
and the load line will
depend solely on RC,

541
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,793
you straighten your static straight.

542
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:56,439
The fact of removing RE

543
00:26:57,343 --> 00:26:59,017
connected to the right then

544
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:02,088
Statically speaking
to a DC signal,

545
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:03,943
the fact of bringing an AC signal,

546
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:07,435
suddenly your gain increases,
that's what we had seen earlier

547
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:10,135
and this is what makes
the load line it will increase

548
00:27:10,232 --> 00:27:11,397
and this load line

549
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:14,272
this is actually the
speech I had done before,

550
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:16,850
it will depend on this VE0 tension

551
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,895
and this voltage VCC

552
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:23,198
and its mid-point it must be VCC0

553
00:27:23,938 --> 00:27:26,434
which is also the
intersection of 2 straight

554
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:29,402
because on the rest VCC0 does not vary

555
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:31,951
it is dynamic or static,

556
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:33,899
we will see here the VC0.

557
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,344
But once you put an AC signal,

558
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:38,369
we see the disappearance of RE

559
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:42,039
and the gain and increased
load of the line straightens

560
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:45,658
it will give us what is
called dynamic load line

561
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:49,579
and the point of
intersection of the lines 2

562
00:27:49,765 --> 00:27:53,317
corresponds to this potential VC0

563
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:55,858
of this assembly.

564
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,732
So this choice VC0
is absolutely important,

565
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:03,457
must be distinguished
Use AC and DC

566
00:28:03,623 --> 00:28:04,653
and it is necessary to know

567
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:06,455
that when using
this kind of editing

568
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:08,445
which depends on a signal AC

569
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:10,859
and we gain by the fact that

570
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:13,071
it removes and boost gain

571
00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:15,903
and it is necessary to
choose adequately

572
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:18,246
the potential VC0.

573
00:28:19,194 --> 00:28:21,595
And the summary of
what I just said is there.

574
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:23,435
Static load line

575
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:27,904
does not see the effect of the
capacity that allows for RC and RE,

576
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:29,100
this is what we see here.

577
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:31,174
The right dynamic load

578
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,922
see especially the
resistance RC

579
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,091
because RE it's do short-circuit

580
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,670
and the dynamics,

581
00:28:39,354 --> 00:28:44,165
that is, all that part from there to there

582
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:47,775
or from here to there.

583
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:49,845
If by chance,

584
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:53,749
someone has chosen VC0 - VE0,

585
00:28:55,395 --> 00:28:56,665
very close to each other,

586
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:59,805
your transistor will
saturate it before it crashes.

587
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:04,051
So why make a
transistor saturates

588
00:29:04,504 --> 00:29:06,325
before it blocks?

589
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:10,967
So your signal at the output is
already distorted by the saturation.

590
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:15,098
So the best choice
is to have saturation,

591
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:17,977
That beach and that beach is the same.

592
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:21,692
and we called dynamic
whole excursion,

593
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:25,334
that for which your
signal is not distorted.

594
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:28,482
So it will take, if delta U1
is from here to there

595
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:31,019
Delta and U2 is
from here to there,

596
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:34,483
if you have delta
delta U1 equal to U2,

597
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:39,833
you have a dynamic that is
equal in Delta V1 to exit 2 times

598
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:43,661
delta delta U1 or U2

599
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:45,168
or...

600
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:48,012
if by chance you have a delta U1

601
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:51,972
lower than delta U2,
you choose the lowest,

602
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,509
you multiplied it by 2 and
you say it's my dynamic,

603
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,323
because it is useless to ...

604
00:29:57,507 --> 00:30:00,119
to speak of a signal at
the output if it is not linear,

605
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:04,000
therefore we choose the value
the lowest of these 2

606
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,476
and multiplied by a factor of 2

607
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:08,850
and we say the dynamics is equal to that

608
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:11,367
or in other words if you
take this right then

609
00:30:11,532 --> 00:30:13,082
and you're good at designing,

610
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:16,479
you choose this, this,
absolutely equal to this

611
00:30:16,622 --> 00:30:19,337
and your dynamics will be
what I have drawn in blue here

612
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:21,815
and at that time
If VCEsat is equal to 0

613
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:25,948
therefore it is considered: your
momentum is equal to all this

614
00:30:26,386 --> 00:30:28,048
VCC - VE0.

615
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,540
And that's really the
most important thing

616
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,827
when we doing circuit design

617
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:35,447
is to come to respect
and to increase

618
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:38,629
the signal dynamics at the output.

619
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:43,338
Finally, I take my
amplifier with active load,

620
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:45,394
we have already analyzed,

621
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:46,901
you know it, the gain,

622
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,335
I have already calculated
it before and I wrote it
I have already calculated
it before and I wrote it down.

623
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:49,375
I have already calculated
it before and I wrote it

624
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:51,914
so what is the dynamic here?

625
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:54,396
The dynamic here
is maximum. Why ?

626
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:57,104
Because it will depend
on the saturation of this

627
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:58,746
and saturation of this.

628
00:30:59,994 --> 00:31:02,771
So, just now, we had to

629
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:05,599
lose a certain amount
when there was resistance

630
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:07,057
in the transmitter.

631
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:11,058
There I can normally go up to VCC

632
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,352
and down to 0.

633
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:15,011
And this potential here,

634
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,467
he is determined by the
stage which follows,

635
00:31:21,086 --> 00:31:25,464
so if the next floor
does not block this tour,

636
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:28,932
we have what we
call a "rail to rail"

637
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,139
because this is feed rails

638
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:34,424
and is said to be a
rail-to-rail assembly

639
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:37,004
because it is capable of

640
00:31:37,173 --> 00:31:39,848
Change the potential up to VCC

641
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,685
If the saturation voltage is
close to 0 and drops down to 0

642
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:46,580
and dynamics of
active load mounting

643
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:47,903
is much higher

644
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,998
Than the resistance
mounting dynamics

645
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:55,234
for the same voltage levels VCC

646
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:57,274
and for the same power.

647
00:31:58,351 --> 00:31:59,616
I have just finished

648
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,043
the presentation of
simple common emitter

649
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:04,861
with resistance

650
00:32:05,463 --> 00:32:08,423
concrete, passive and active

651
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:11,571
we address the most
important problem of designing

652
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,250
which is called the momentum.

653
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:14,935
I insist on this aspect

654
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,014
and someone who understood what
is a dynamic assembly,

655
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:21,161
will understand very well that this
is the most important aspect

656
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,289
when you make a circuit design,

657
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:26,235
it's to get to realize the maximum dynamic

658
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:30,181
you will see later that even
get a mounting performance

659
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:33,362
quite high, it's thanks to the response,

660
00:32:34,323 --> 00:32:36,361
at the output that is get

661
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,291
to achieve maximum dynamic

662
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:41,239
also answer your
question that the assembly

663
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:44,947
has an optimized and
maximum performance.
