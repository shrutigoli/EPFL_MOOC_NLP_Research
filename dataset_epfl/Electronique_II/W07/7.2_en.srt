1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,024
In this video, we'll study

2
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:07,192
voltage references.

3
00:00:07,386 --> 00:00:10,667
So with stabilized power supplies,
we saw that there is a need

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,700
for a steady voltage and that steady voltage

5
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:18,050
should be independent
of all sorts of variations,

6
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:21,325
namely the entire fluctuation
of the unregulated voltage

7
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:24,112
that we also used to supply

8
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:26,609
this reference voltage,
in any case to start

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,386
should in no way

10
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:32,080
influence the voltage level
of this reference

11
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:35,827
and especially the thermal drifts
and many other considerations

12
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:38,155
that we'll see throughout this video.

13
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:42,200
<i>We'll start with the reference
voltage at Zener diode.</i>

14
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:44,950
<i>So that the component
who is a zener diode,</i>

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,711
<i>This is a component
which is very well known</i>

16
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:49,521
<i>in discrete and
integrated electronics.</i>

17
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:52,661
<i>We can impose in this diode,</i>

18
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,329
<i>which is connected in the
reverse direction of a normal diode,</i>

19
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:59,586
<i>a current and this current
will generate a stable voltage</i>

20
00:00:59,823 --> 00:01:01,411
<i>which is the Zener voltage</i>

21
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:03,569
<i>which is due to the
avalanche phenomenon</i>

22
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:04,969
<i>in the Zener diode.</i>

23
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:08,168
<i>So the best way or
the simplest say</i>

24
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,368
<i>to generate a Zener voltage,</i>

25
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:14,568
<i>is to polarize with two voltage levels.</i>

26
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:18,880
<i>We have a tension here which
is may be not be controlled if it</i>

27
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:21,768
<i>and another Zener voltage
that will be a reference.</i>

28
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:24,186
<i>So between the two
we put a resistance of a</i>

29
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:27,886
<i>and this resistance will impose
the Iz current flowing in there.</i>

30
00:01:28,086 --> 00:01:32,549
<i>We will look at the stability
of the Vz voltage versus</i>

31
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:35,449
<i>of the instability
of the voltage V1.</i>

32
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:37,910
<i>So a Zener diode,
if you want to replace it </i>

33
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:42,161
<i>with a "large-signal" model,
that model is summed</i>

34
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,361
<i>to the following thing:</i>

35
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:49,499
<i>the model of the diode
becomes a fixed voltage</i>

36
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:51,974
<i>wich will be the Zener
voltage vacuum</i>

37
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:54,065
<i>plus a resistance called</i>

38
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:57,174
<i>the differential resistance
of the Zener diode Rz.</i>

39
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:00,324
<i>That's a simple model
that pays enough ...</i>

40
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:04,699
<i>with my sore precision
the reference voltage</i>

41
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:09,059
<i>and we will consider the
effect of the differential resistance</i>

42
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,834
<i>of the diode which is added in
series with the voltage source.</i>

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,273
<i>So any voltage variation
will be reported here</i>

44
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:17,823
<i>on this variation that.</i>

45
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:19,626
<i>So we will interest
to the derivative.</i>

46
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:22,046
<i>We have to watch the ΔVref</i>

47
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:28,569
<i>and see ΔVref effect compared
these two resistances, R and rz.</i>

48
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:31,769
<i>So if we look for ΔVref derived,</i>

49
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:34,399
<i>we find the model "small signals"</i>

50
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:38,874
<i>because it replaces V1 by
the voltage variation</i>

51
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:42,379
<i>and we will iterest at the
variation in voltage here</i>

52
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:44,793
<i>by replacing the
voltage source here</i>

53
00:02:44,993 --> 00:02:46,665
<i>by a short circuit
we shown here</i>

54
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:48,874
<i>because it is a model
"small signals".</i>

55
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:50,974
<i>So in the model "small signals"
for a Zener diode,</i>

56
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,274
<i>this is equivalent to the differential
resistance of the zener diode.</i>

57
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:56,941
<i>And there we has a
resistive divider.</i>

58
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:59,691
<i>The resistance that we
added to polarize</i>

59
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:01,964
<i>is the differential resistance
<of the zener diode</i>

60
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,636
<i>and we can write immediately</i>

61
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:07,874
<i>ΔVref as a function of ΔV1
And that's what we're interested in.</i>

62
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:12,036
<i>This ΔVref voltage depends on ΔV1</i>

63
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:15,236
multiplied by the resistance ratio

64
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:18,436
<i>So rz, the resistance to the
terminal  which we look</i>

65
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:22,199
<i>ΔV1 the effect divided by
the sum of these two.</i>

66
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,236
<i>And we can approximate it
for the simple reason</i>

67
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:28,436
<i>that the differential resistance
of a Zener diode</i>

68
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:32,023
<i>is very very very low compared
to the polarization resistance</i>

69
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:34,343
<i>that we have added
to impose the current</i>

70
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:35,350
<i>in the Zener diode.</i>

71
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,458
<i>So we find ourselves
with a reference voltage</i>

72
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:41,611
<i>that fluctuates according
to the fluctuation</i>

73
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:44,811
<i>of the unregulated function ΔV1</i>

74
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:47,399
<i>multiplied by the ratio of
the differential resistance</i>

75
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:49,435
<i>and divided by the resistance R.</i>

76
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:52,562
<i>So we see indeed
that the bigger ,</i>

77
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,765
<i>the better the behavior of
this ΔVref tension.</i>

78
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:59,493
<i>It goes to 0 when
R tends to infinity.</i>

79
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:01,953
<i>And we know that
resistance to the infinite,</i>

80
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:03,039
<i>is a current source.</i>

81
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,039
<i>So an improvement of such concept</i>

82
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:10,049
<i>would be replaced by
a polarization resistance</i>

83
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:13,249
<i>with a true current source
that we will see right away.</i>

84
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:17,448
<i>Here is a diagram
of the zener diode</i>

85
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:20,498
<i>when it imposes a current source I</i>

86
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:23,698
<i>in this Zener diode
and is supposed now</i>

87
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,636
<i>give us a reference
voltage and will show</i>

88
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:29,811
<i>that the reference voltage,
and she quite decoupled</i>

89
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,011
<i>of the unregulated supply</i>

90
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:35,448
<i>thank's to this current
source that absorbs</i>

91
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:37,324
<i>the variations of the voltage.</i>

92
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:39,970
<i>So it will be necessary to
realize a current source</i>

93
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,910
<i>you all know how to do it.</i>

94
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:47,048
<i> we could be done by
putting the following scheme:</i>

95
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:51,436
<i>this scheme and the
following diagram.</i>

96
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:54,636
<i>I take a PNP transistor.</i>

97
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,836
<i>I polarizes a fixed voltage on its base.</i>

98
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:01,036
<i>The example I give here
also uses a Zener diode.</i>

99
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:04,236
<i>It is obvious that if I take</i>

100
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:05,836
<i>a resistor and a Zener diode,</i>

101
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,848
<i>I get a voltage Vz
based on a transistor</i>

102
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,548
<i>that I will use to apply,</i>

103
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:16,611
<i>Once I removed the
junction voltage Ui</i>

104
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,811
<i> of my transistor
here, it will stay me</i>

105
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,010
<i>the current through
this resistance I,</i>

106
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:30,123
<i>So the current I multiplied
by the resistor R2 gives me</i>

107
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:32,298
<i>the voltage drop here,</i>

108
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:34,316
<i>what I have written here.</i>

109
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:38,773
<i>The voltage less this
one is equal to this one </i>

110
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:43,123
<i>and that's what is written
there. So Vz - Ui = I x R2.</i>

111
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,623
<i>In other words, I can
express the current I</i>

112
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:49,523
<i>which is proportional to the
voltage of the Zener diode, thereof,</i>

113
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,572
<i>minus the voltage drop due
to the junction of a transistor</i>

114
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:55,235
<i>divided by the resistor R2.</i>

115
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,384
<i>Now this current,</i>

116
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:58,957
<i>it is the current that
I will impose my diode,</i>

117
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:02,522
<i>the one that I will use to
extract the reference voltage.</i>

118
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:05,444
<i>So we know this circuit
because we just do it.</i>

119
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,380
<i>So resistance we used,
a Zener diode just before</i>

120
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,723
<i>to show that this voltage
Vz really depends </i>

121
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:16,912
<i>or ΔVz fluctuation depends
on the differential resistance</i>

122
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:21,192
<i>of the diode divided by R1
and I'll rewrite this relationship</i>

123
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:26,705
<i>to extract the ΔVza
over ΔV1 as follows:</i>

124
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,717
<i>If this describes what happens
when the variation of tensions here,</i>

125
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:35,767
<i>this voltage variation then,
when I report to the exit,</i>

126
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:38,967
<i>I'm interested in
the variation ΔVref</i>

127
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,167
<i>which  also depends of course
on what this ∆I will be </i>

128
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,905
<i>in the differential resistance.
This time, I mean</i>

129
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:48,917
<i>of the Zener diode, which
also has a differential resistance</i>

130
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:53,792
<i>I call rz on this side</i>

131
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:57,667
<i>and I would call rza
the differential resistance</i>

132
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:59,042
<i>of this diode here.</i>

133
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:04,215
<i>that I see ΔVza there</i>

134
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:11,065
<i>which is equal to ΔV1 rza
multiplied by the ratio divided by R1.</i>

135
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:12,716
<i>That's what we had seen before.</i>

136
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,029
<i>Now I want to bring this
to the other side.</i>

137
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:18,229
<i>I bring it over ∆I.
So ∆I,</i>

138
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:20,954
<i>it is dependent on ΔVza</i>

139
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:24,629
<i>that I substituted by ΔVza / R2</i>

140
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:27,829
<i>and then a this point the ∆I
I inject it </i>

141
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:30,257
<i>in the differential
resistance of the diode</i>

142
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:32,966
<i>Once I replaced by equivalent.</i>

143
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,319
<i>So this diode becomes for
me a differential resistance rz</i>

144
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,192
<i>in series with a voltage source</i>

145
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:43,392
<i>corresponding to the voltage Vz.</i>

146
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:45,038
This voltage source,

147
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:47,288
<i>I take it off in from a
pattern "small signals".</i>

148
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:50,888
<i>It will remain for me rz
and I look .DELTA.I in rz</i>

149
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:53,763
<i>which gives me immediately
ΔIrz equal to that.</i>

150
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:58,063
<i>And we note that the reference
voltage that we see there,</i>

151
00:07:58,263 --> 00:07:59,862
<i>compared to what we
had seen before,</i>

152
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:00,687
<i>which was this one,</i>

153
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:03,999
<i>is divided by R1 x R2.</i>

154
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,199
<i>So what is the product of
two differential resistances D2</i>

155
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,092
<i>divided by the product
of the two resistors. </i>

156
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,798
<i>It is enough that the two
resistances are very very large </i>

157
00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:14,486
<i>and here we come to
reduce this greatly.</i>

158
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:16,114
<i>So we are very happy with that.</i>

159
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:19,314
<i>Unfortunately what happens
with this kind of circuit,</i>

160
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:22,514
<i>we needed a voltage VZA.
So this tension then</i>

161
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:28,064
<i>compared to a
power rail equals VZA.</i>

162
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:31,264
<i>Suppose your transistor is biased</i>

163
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:33,926
<i>at the saturation point.</i>

164
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,664
<i>That is to say, here you
put a voltage of about 0 volts</i>

165
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:41,826
<i>to keep 0.7 volt from here to
there and be sure your transistor</i>

166
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:43,392
<i>acts as a current source.</i>

167
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:46,592
<i>So I have Uj from here to there
and from there to there Uj</i>

168
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,394
<i>so I have 0 volts there.</i>

169
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:52,106
<i>The difference of these two
voltages is equal to the time</i>

170
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:55,106
<i>it more thereof. So I cannot give</i>

171
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,832
<i>my supply voltages</i>

172
00:08:57,144 --> 00:09:00,968
<i>to get out a reference voltage
based on this concept then</i>

173
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:05,144
<i>beyond VZA + Vref.</i>

174
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,747
<i>So this is what will give me</i>

175
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,530
<i>the relationship of the
minimum usable voltage.</i>

176
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,841
<i>And this is a handicap.</i>

177
00:09:11,141 --> 00:09:13,774
<i>When you want to use
very very low power</i>

178
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:16,974
<i>and have a reference
which is independent</i>

179
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:20,536
<i>of the fluctuation of the voltage
To obtain a characteristic</i>

180
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:24,299
<i>also good but unfortunately I
have to use two zener voltages</i>

181
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:27,499
<i>series to get this, which gives me</i>

182
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:31,461
<i>a minimum voltage
limited by the Zener voltage</i>

183
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:34,385
<i>that I own in the
technology that I'm in</i>

184
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:35,863
<i>to realize my circuit.</i>

185
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:40,250
<i>So when I'm talking about
the Zener diode reference,,</i>

186
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,163
<i>Unfortunately, I will suffer
of this thermal stability</i>

187
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:47,363
<i>of the Zener diode. It will also
be necessary to make circuits</i>

188
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:48,546
<i>to compensate them.</i>

189
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,036
<i>I have not spoken in this circuit.</i>

190
00:09:51,663 --> 00:09:55,542
<i>There is the noise associated
with the Zener diode is known</i>

191
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:57,538
<i>due to the avalanche</i>

192
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:00,738
<i> who will also give me
a source of noise at the output</i>

193
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:03,318
<i>and I'll find myself with what
I have just explained</i>

194
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:07,741
<i>associated with this minimum
voltage of the Zener voltage.</i>

195
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,605
<i>If I have to put two is
much more disabling</i>

196
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:13,455
<i>but if I have even put one
Zener voltage levels</i>

197
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,643
<i>proposed in the technologies
are relatively high so</i>

198
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:19,542
<i>when there is a voltage
"low voltage",</i>

199
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,580
<I>, I am annoyed</i>

200
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:24,992
<i>by the voltage levels that I have.</i>

201
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:29,006
<i>And finally, not all technologies
of the integrated circuit</i>

202
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:31,507
<i>give available zener diodes.</i>

203
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:35,617
<i> So it's a voltage reference
that is not badly used</i>

204
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:38,909
<i>in discrete circuits or
certain integrated circuits</i>

205
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,396
<i>typically bipolar.
In the MOS transistors,</i>

206
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:44,653
<i>we do not easily Zener
diodes available.</i>

207
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:49,008
<i>So we will learn to
make a reference voltage</i>

208
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,208
<i>which is called the
reference voltage of Band-Gap.</i>

209
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,022
<i>A reference voltage Band-Gap,
that is the combined use</i>

210
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:58,715
<i>two physical phenomena.</i>

211
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:01,054
<i>The first phenomenon is a voltage</i>

212
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:03,434
<i>across a junction Pn</i>

213
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:06,013
<i>or is the voltage across a diode</i>

214
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:10,618
<i>because we know that
Vbe voltage of a transistor</i>

215
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:15,358
<i>used as a diode
drift -2 millivolts per degree.</i>

216
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:18,191
<i>And if we take another phenomenon,</i>

217
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,979
<i>another phenomenon such
as the thermodynamic potential</i>

218
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:22,541
<i>we know is Ut,</i>

219
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:25,398
<i>which is proportional to
the Boltzmann constant</i>

220
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:29,474
<i>multiplied by the temperature
divided by the electron charge,</i>

221
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:34,978
<i>has a drift over 80
microvolts per degree.</i>

222
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:37,730
<i>So if we can combine the two</i>

223
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,727
<i> so that one compensates
the other if both</i>

224
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:44,130
<i>are made
with electronic circuits</i>

225
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,330
<i>so the addition of both means that</i>

226
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,805
<i>the same temperature
applied to the two leads us</i>

227
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:53,730
<i>to a temperature
drift which is equal to 0.</i>

228
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,120
<i>And we will do
as follows: So first,</i>

229
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,617
<i>I'll take a Pn junction.</i>

230
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:00,807
<i>I take a transistor,
I connect it in diode.</i>

231
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:02,271
<i>I imposes a current to him.</i>

232
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:07,189
<i>The Vbe voltage is a voltage
between 0.6 and 0.7 volts.</i>

233
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:12,501
<i>So I have a fixed tension here
in the junction voltage</i>

234
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:18,214
<i>which will drift -2 millivolts
to each variation of one degree.</i>

235
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:22,763
<i>Now I'll get another
circuit which is that.</i>

236
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:25,651
<i>This is a circuit we will learn
to achieve that is called</i>

237
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:30,051
<i>the thermodynamic
voltage generator Ut.</i>

238
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,863
<i>We will find the 26 millivolts</i>

239
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:35,725
<i>that derives on 80
microvolts per degree</i>

240
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:38,851
<i>and I'll try to multiply it
by a gain.</i>

241
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:43,401
<i>This gain I see here is a
gain that I have to calculate.</i>

242
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:47,839
<i>I have to make sure
that the gain A</i>

243
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:53,538
multiplied by the voltage Ut
compensate the thermal drift

244
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,341
<i>of -2 millivolts.</i>

245
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,264
<i>So what I'll do,
I'll calculate the gain</i>

246
00:12:58,574 --> 00:13:01,494
<i> by looking at the sum
of these two tensions</i>

247
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:05,044
<i>and deriving the sum of
these two voltages</i>

248
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,662
<i>for the thermal drift
to be equal to 0.</i>

249
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:11,537
<i>So I'll do that right now.</i>

250
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:15,062
<i>That's the tension that
I will see at the exit.</i>

251
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,365
<i>So I'll find a voltage Vref.</i>

252
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:17,683
<i>It is worth what tension Vref?</i>

253
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:22,325
<i>It is worth this 0.6 volt,
finally 0.61 or 0.62, </i>

254
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:24,842
<i>it depends on the
tension that I find here,</i>

255
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:29,880
<i>the more the gain that I will calculate
that multiplies 26 millivolts.</i>

256
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,875
<i>Now, I am interested
in this voltage</i>

257
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,875
<i>as an absolute value which
is the sum of the two,</i>

258
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:36,280
<i>so it will tend
towards the magnitude</i>

259
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,829
<i>of 1.2 volts. Vbe is 0.6.</i>

260
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:42,680
<i>That you'll see that I need 24.
So 24 x 26 millivolts</i>

261
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,880
<i>will give me this factor
also in the order of 0.6.</i>

262
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,755
<i>So we will find the
order of 1.2 volt at the output</i>

263
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:54,092
<i>and i'll have to find
the derivative of both to be 0.</i>

264
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:59,065
<i>This is indeed the case because
if I multiply the 24 times 85</i>

265
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:00,492
<i>since it's going to be 24</i>

266
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:03,692
<i>and I add whit the 2 mV,</i>

267
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:05,924
<i>both will give me a
derivative compared</i>

268
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:09,139
<i>at the temperature equal
to 0, and here it is.</i>

269
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,617
<i>The derivative, the ΔVref / DT,</i>

270
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:18,917
<i>its ΔVbe / DT which is
2 millivolts per degree</i>

271
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,353
<i>and the derivative of A x 85</i>

272
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:27,531
<i>which is A that I do not
know what time millivolt 0085.</i>

273
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:32,193
<i>Well I'll find for this
term to cancel A = 24.</i>

274
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,496
<i>If we can make a gain equal to 24</i>

275
00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:37,218
<i>that multiplies a thermodynamic
tension extractor</i>

276
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,295
<i>from a circuit,</i>

277
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:41,964
<i>we get a reference
voltage equal to 0.6 volts</i>

278
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:45,164
plus 24 x 26

279
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:49,326
<i>which would give a
voltage of the order of 1.2 volts</i>

280
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:53,413
<i>which is very close to
the voltage of Band-Gap Silicon.</i>

281
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:57,542
<i>That is the goal of this
part and we will learn</i>

282
00:14:57,751 --> 00:15:01,607
<i>to achieve this extract
and this multiplier voltage</i>

283
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:04,457
<i>and then, after making a
reference voltage of this style.</i>

284
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:08,308
<i>The technique for
performing multiplication</i>

285
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:12,921
<i>or extraction of the
bed is to make a loop</i>

286
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,121
in which I have 2 junctions

287
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:20,108
<i>base transmitter and base
transmitter of 2 transistors.</i>

288
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:24,146
<i>I relate the difference
between these two voltages</i>

289
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:25,988
<i>to Ohm's law.</i>

290
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:29,326
<i>So I have to see here a
current times resistance</i>

291
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:31,385
<i>which is proportional to
the difference of the two.</i>

292
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:33,949
<i>And we will have to prove it now.</i>

293
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,149
<i>If you take the power
from there to there,</i>

294
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:39,112
<i>the one here,</i>

295
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:40,127
<i>you can say</i>

296
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:44,127
<i>= Vbe1 Vbe2 + (I2 x R3)</i>

297
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:45,882
<i>what is written here.</i>

298
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:48,831
<i>= Vbe1 Vbe2 + (I2 x R3).</i>

299
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:51,807
<i>And I replace the junction
voltages values,</i>

300
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:55,999
<i>I know the exponential law which
links the current tensions</i>

301
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:57,072
<i>and I write it.</i>

302
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:59,797
<i>So the current, the voltage Vbe1,</i>

303
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,859
<i>it's Ut ln (I1 / Is 1).</i>

304
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,920
<i>I1 is the current through
the transistor.</i>

305
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,495
<i>Same for the second.</i>

306
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:11,406
<i>In the second part of that
side, I must add I 2 x R3.</i>

307
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,370
<i>So as I said earlier,
if I can bring here</i>

308
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,283
<i>the difference between
the two junctions, I win</i>

309
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:19,695
<i>because it will be proportional to Ut.</i>

310
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,042
<i>If you move it to this
side of the equality,</i>

311
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,892
<i>so I have a difference
between two voltages,</i>

312
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:30,458
<i>and express yourself and
you have similar transistors</i>

313
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,717
<i>that is to say Is1 = Is2,</i>

314
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:35,917
<i>you fall back on a variation</i>

315
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:38,729
<i>Or rather a difference
between two junction voltages</i>

316
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:43,585
<i>that are reported on a resistor.</i>

317
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:47,904
<i>So the difference between
these two junction voltages</i>

318
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:52,821
<i>brings me back to a
ratio of ln (I1 / I1)</i>

319
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:54,770
<i>because here Is1 and
Is2 are the same.</i>

320
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:58,324
<i>Once I brought it,
the log has the right</i>

321
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:01,367
<i>to transform me the difference in
division and that will give me</i>

322
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,275
<i>the report logarithm current</i>

323
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:07,015
<i>I1 to I2 which is equal to I2 × R3.</i>

324
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:09,837
<i>And see the extraction
of the Ut. I see it here.</i>

325
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,295
<i>So I pass this logarithm below</i>

326
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:14,525
<i>and it gives me I2 x R3.</i>

327
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:17,388
<i>So I just have to think
now in terms of current</i>

328
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:20,818
<i>I1 and I2 and replace
it by the components</i>

329
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:23,306
<i>that I can resize
myself in the circuit.</i>

330
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:27,632
<i>So the basic construction
of the extraction of Ut,</i>

331
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:32,034
<i>of a simple way, can pass
through a current mirror</i>

332
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:35,234
<i>that we call Widlar
current mirror.</i>

333
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:40,808
<i>The first part of
building my Band-Gap</i>

334
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:45,096
<i>Is to take the 2 currents
that interest me</i>

335
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:46,224
<i>that are in the denominator,</i>

336
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,654
<i>whose report is in the denominator</i>

337
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:52,541
<i>and injecting them into
two resistors R1 and R2.</i>

338
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:55,614
<i>So I think Ut is equal,</i>

339
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:57,689
<i>what I have demonstrated just now,</i>

340
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,532
<i>(I2 x R3) / ln (I1 / I2).</i>

341
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:05,007
<i>I'd like to replace it
I1 / I2 by another term</i>

342
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:08,019
<i>which will be dependent of
resistance that I have dimension</i>

343
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:09,998
in a circuit that would lead me after

344
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:13,198
<i>to calculate the values
​​of my resistances</i>

345
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:18,548
<i>and move towards the
famous ratio of 24 or 24 gains</i>

346
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:20,515
<i>to get my reference voltage.</i>

347
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:24,215
<i>So to do that, I will
impose a tension here.</i>

348
00:18:24,415 --> 00:18:26,715
<i>And I will impose the
following manner:</i>

349
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:31,125
<i>I take a transistor
similar to this.</i>

350
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:33,602
<i>So I take the same
transistor I used there</i>

351
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:34,650
<i>and I put it here.</i>

352
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,273
<i>I imposed the same
current as the transistor,</i>

353
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:40,174
<i>that it will generate
a tension that is the same</i>

354
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:41,026
<i>thereof.</i>

355
00:18:41,238 --> 00:18:43,476
<i>So I can write Vb1 = Vbe3.</i>

356
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:46,147
<i>But look what will happen
with this transistor.</i>

357
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,089
<i>This transistor is the transistor T2,</i>

358
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:52,991
<i>it is at its base with a Vbe1 tension.</i>

359
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:55,305
<i>It is found here</i>

360
00:18:55,905 --> 00:19:00,018
<i>with Vbe3 = Vbe1.</i>

361
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,866
<i>So this same voltage is
here and there on each other,</i>

362
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,822
<i>on its collector and its base.</i>

363
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:07,564
<i>So like I'm saying</i>

364
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:09,981
<i>that this voltage is the voltage</i>

365
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:12,656
<i>therefore the voltage
difference here is equal to 0.</i>

366
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:16,484
<i>So, I did a short circuit
for the same effect.</i>

367
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:18,638
<i>there I do not need to make
a short circuit because</i>

368
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,893
<i>I copied tension there
and I imposed here</i>

369
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,543
<i>in an external way with this.</i>

370
00:19:24,674 --> 00:19:26,443
<i>This is what I have done</i>

371
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,181
<i>and I express it and show it</i>

372
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:31,400
<i>with an arrow that says the voltage
difference from here to here</i>

373
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,775
<i>=is equal to 0.</i>

374
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,005
<i>I will continue my reasoning.</i>

375
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,558
<i>Let's see what will
happen in this cell here.</i>

376
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,317
<i>This voltage is equal
to the tension.</i>

377
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:40,779
<i>This voltage is equal
to the tension.</i>

378
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:43,908
<i>So obviously, this voltage
is equal to the tension.</i>

379
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:46,830
<i>So I can say I1 x R1= I2 x R2,</i>

380
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,398
<i>I'll note right away.</i>

381
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:51,097
<i>I1x R1 = I2 x R2</i>

382
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:54,226
<i>So I found a report I1 / I2</i>

383
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:57,863
<i>I1 / I2 proportional to R2 / R1
resistance.</i>

384
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:01,063
<i>So in that expression, I brought</i>

385
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,651
<i>the ratio of two currents
I do not know</i>

386
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:06,271
<i>at a ratio of two resistors
that I have to choose.</i>

387
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,607
<i>So this report then it
is for me to size him</i>

388
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,240
<i>according to R2 and
R1 which I will use.</i>

389
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,958
<i>It will stay that
expression I2 x R3</i>

390
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:16,759
<i>that I must also bring it to something</i>

391
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,942
<i>that I can design with my circuit.</i>

392
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:22,226
<i>So let's analyze what
we just saw here.</i>

393
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:24,820
<i>I copy this.</i>

394
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,955
<i>I place it here.</i>

395
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:28,639
<i>So this is the expression,
the same thing that I saw here.</i>

396
00:20:29,951 --> 00:20:33,651
<i>So I can write I2 x R3,
the one that interests me,</i>

397
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:38,044
<i>as the Ut x ln (R2 / R1).</i>

398
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:41,781
<i>Now, when I look at
the reference voltage,</i>

399
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:44,743
<i>that I want to read
from here to there,</i>

400
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:46,460
<i>it is what this reference voltage?</i>

401
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:48,583
<i>It is worth this tension</i>

402
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:52,068
<i>thereof. So I the sum
of these two voltages</i>

403
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,257
<i>that I noticed here.</i>

404
00:20:53,457 --> 00:21:00,457
<i>The reference voltage is
Vbe3 + (I2 x R2).</i>

405
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:03,411
<i>That's it. I2 x R2,</i>

406
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:05,547
<i>I'm interested in I2R3.</i>

407
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:09,684
<i>Easy! I just have to
multiply it by an R3</i>

408
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:12,501
<i>and I divide by R3</i>

409
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:17,743
<i>and this is my I2 x R3
as I try to get</i>

410
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,767
<i>and replace here.</i>

411
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:25,287
<i>In writing this,
I 2 x R3 x (R2 / R3),</i>

412
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:28,750
<i>and I2 x R3 is the term
that we calculated earlier</i>

413
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,438
<i>that depends on Ut multiplied
by a certain ratio.</i>

414
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:36,199
<i>So I replace this
term by its value here</i>

415
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:39,133
<i>and I find myself with
a reference voltage,</i>

416
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:41,501
<i>exactly what I was seeking,</i>

417
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,701
<i>a junction voltage Vbe3</i>

418
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:48,929
<i>plus what I copied from here,</i>

419
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:51,678
<i>So Ut x ln (R2 / R1)</i>

420
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,218
<i>that multiplies the R2 / R3.</i>

421
00:21:54,418 --> 00:21:57,073
<i>And that's it, I have a multiplier</i>

422
00:21:57,273 --> 00:22:00,850
<i>of thermodynamics
Ut voltage by a factor A</i>

423
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,050
<i>that should be equal to 24.</i>

424
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,574
<i>And the Vbe3 voltage,</i>

425
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:09,774
<i>which is a transistor that
I imposed a stream in,</i>

426
00:22:09,974 --> 00:22:12,699
<i>so it is a junction
voltage of a transistor</i>

427
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:16,174
<i>that will derive from
-2 millivolts per degree</i>

428
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:20,795
<i>and this, it will divide by
+ 26 millivolts per degree</i>

429
00:22:20,995 --> 00:22:22,308
multiplied by 24

430
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,287
<i>and I find myself with
the reference voltage</i>

431
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:26,913
<i>whose absolute value
is in the order of magnitude</i>

432
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:30,113
<i>that I said earlier, so 1.2</i>

433
00:22:30,313 --> 00:22:33,780
<i>and the derivative compared
to the temperature approaches 0</i>

434
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:36,792
<i>If I correctly dimensioned
all these parameters</i>

435
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:38,608
<i>and if I have a technology
where all my transistors,</i>

436
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:43,560
<i>I control in terms of technology
that is available to me.</i>

437
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,685
<i>Can you make this a little
more elegantly circuit?</i>

438
00:22:46,885 --> 00:22:48,311
<i>Yes, we can.</i>

439
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:51,511
<i>This is usually done
with a against reaction</i>

440
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:53,097
<i>that way one.</i>

441
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:56,340
<i>In order to create
the same phenomenon,</i>

442
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,540
<i>that is to say have
the difference of two junctions</i>

443
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,352
<i>attached to the
terminals of a resistance</i>

444
00:23:03,552 --> 00:23:10,117
<i>so that the voltage
of this pn junction</i>

445
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:13,317
<i>less this Pn junction is
equal to the one I see here</i>

446
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,517
<i>I create a feedback
against an Op amp.</i>

447
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:18,939
<i>So if you remember
what a Op amp fact,</i>

448
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,231
<i>it creates a voltage difference
here is equal to 0.</i>

449
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,262
<i>When it is in the linear region,</i>

450
00:23:23,462 --> 00:23:25,537
<i>these two voltages are the same.</i>

451
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,100
<i>So I am with V1 = V2</i>

452
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,915
<i>and if I say V1 = V2, the
voltage U of 1 equal to 0.</i>

453
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,465
<i>So the tension
I see in this cell here,</i>

454
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,002
<i>is (I2 x R3) + = Vbe2 Vbe1,</i>

455
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:41,349
<i>what I have written here.</i>

456
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:44,909
<i>This voltage then equal
to this more thereof.</i>

457
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:50,169
<i>This is the same as a
Widlar current source.</i>

458
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:52,982
<i>This is exactly the same thing
that brings me back to retrieve</i>

459
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,182
<i>the same story.
The thermodynamic potential,</i>

460
00:23:56,382 --> 00:23:58,236
<i>it is proportional to the current,</i>

461
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:03,497
<i>rather this tension
I2 x R3 / ln (I1 / I2).</i>

462
00:24:03,697 --> 00:24:07,157
<i>My reference voltage,
it is found at the exit</i>

463
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:08,820
<i>an Op amp.
This is an advantage, that.</i>

464
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,335
<i>So, I can draw some power on it,</i>

465
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:14,535
<i>on the Op amp, without disrupting</i>

466
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:16,559
<i>the reference voltage.
Which is a good thing.</i>

467
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,946
<i>If I look Vref,
it is this tension there.</i>

468
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:21,872
<i>So it is from here to here</i>

469
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:22,822
<i>and from here to here.</i>

470
00:24:23,022 --> 00:24:26,022
<i>And I can read it by different paths.</i>

471
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:27,683
<i>So what is this tension
from here to here</i>

472
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,883
<i>and it is 0 per Op amp,
by reaction against.</i>

473
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:34,083
<i>There I Vbe1 + I1 x R1.</i>

474
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:37,577
<i>Again, I Vbe1 / I2 x R2</i>

475
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:39,379
<i>more I2 x R2,</i>

476
00:24:39,941 --> 00:24:41,205
<i>and I can read it from that side</i>

477
00:24:41,402 --> 00:24:46,977
<i>as I2 + I2 x R2 R3 + X Vbe2.</i>

478
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:49,398
<i>And I will write my reference voltage</i>

479
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:52,598
<i>I have to say is the
Vbe1 from here to here</i>

480
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:55,305
<i>more I1 x R1</i>

481
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:57,730
<i>and I also rewrote Vbe1</i>

482
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,930
<i>more this tension there, I2 x R2.</i>

483
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,464
<i>And as I take it, I multiply by R3</i>

484
00:25:04,664 --> 00:25:06,976
<i>and I divide by R3</i>

485
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:10,250
<i>and I end my term as earlier</i>

486
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,148
<i>I2 x R3</i>

487
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:16,697
<i>which is here, I'm seeing as there</i>

488
00:25:16,897 --> 00:25:20,234
<i>and I substituted Ut x ln (I1 / I2).</i>

489
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:25,133
<i>And as I have I1 / I2 which
is the resistance ratio R2 / R1</i>

490
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,333
<i>which is also written here.</i>

491
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:31,249
<i>I replace this report
by the resistance ratio</i>

492
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:34,799
<i>and I develop. I have exactly
the same expression as earlier.</i>

493
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:37,950
<i>So I have a reference
voltage that depends</i>

494
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,329
<i>a junction voltage, thereof,</i>

495
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:43,267
<i>plus a multiplier of voltage Ut</i>

496
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:47,135
<i>which is equal to A. And A = 24.</i>

497
00:25:47,335 --> 00:25:49,078
<i>So we are left in
the same condition</i>

498
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,772
<i>still with an amplifier that
achieves counter reaction</i>

499
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:55,241
<i>and that allows me
to draw a current here</i>

500
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:58,228
<i>without disrupting what
happens to that side</i>

501
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,641
<i>through the power of
this operational amplifier.</i>

502
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:07,979
<i>Let's see a complete scheme
now that everyone knows</i>

503
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:09,852
<i>how we make a power.</i>

504
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:14,750
<i>I took a simplified diagram
of a circuit known family</i>

505
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,670
<i>manufactured by Texas Instruments</i>

506
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,819
<i>and I looked at the internal patterns.</i>

507
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:22,019
<i>So you remember,
we analyzed the power</i>

508
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:24,045
<i>is based on a transistor</i>

509
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:27,245
<i>which is located between
an unregulated voltage</i>

510
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:30,445
<i>and a regulated voltage.
Here this transistor.</i>

511
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:32,638
<i>It is carried out by a Darlington.</i>

512
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:34,073
<i>The advantage of Darlington,</i>

513
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:38,300
<i>is I'm going to find with
a β is very large.</i>

514
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,600
<i>So this is a big advantage
over the current</i>

515
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,582
<i>I draw here</i>

516
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:43,554
<i>and compared to the
output impedance I see there.</i>

517
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:47,531
<i>There is a current
limitation circuit we've seen</i>

518
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,792
<i>in the previous video</i>

519
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:52,010
<i>which drive the transistor</i>

520
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,787
<i>to start deriving
the current command</i>

521
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:59,412
<i>the bypass transistor
and the series transistor.</i>

522
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:03,743
<i>When starting to overcome
excessive current,</i>

523
00:27:03,943 --> 00:27:06,588
<i>it was a reaction against
to an Op Amp.</i>

524
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:09,205
<i>This op amp is achieved
by a single OTA,</i>

525
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:11,616
<i>So perdif with an active load,</i>

526
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:16,311
<i>and there I will add what
is in this circuit</i>

527
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:19,511
<i>in terms of voltage
reference and here.</i>

528
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,236
<i>The reference voltage that is
generated at the entrance of this amp Op,</i>

529
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:28,829
<i>So all that part corresponds
to the amp Op,</i>

530
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:32,029
<i>against his feedback
and the follower stage</i>

531
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:35,067
<i>and this part here is
the Band Gap voltage</i>

532
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:38,932
<i>In this circuit family,
they used a Band-Gap.</i>

533
00:27:39,132 --> 00:27:41,437
<i>It acknowledges. This is
the Band-Gap we just study here.</i>

534
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,587
<i>You should know one thing:</i>

535
00:27:44,787 --> 00:27:46,831
<i>if we want to achieve
this Band-Gap,</i>

536
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:50,031
<i>we have to start
the Band-Gap</i>

537
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:53,166
<i>because it will take
still there is a current</i>

538
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:54,359
<i>that goes in there</i>

539
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,532
<i>for the reference voltage
is established</i>

540
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:57,995
<i>at the entrance to the circuit.</i>

541
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:01,188
<i>This manufacturer has
proposed the following solution:</i>

542
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:05,331
<i>he used part he calls the start.</i>

543
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:08,810
<i>The boot is a Zener diode,</i>

544
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,660
<i>It has a Zener diode in
its bipolar technology</i>

545
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,574
<i>where he realized this IC,</i>

546
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:16,655
<i>which ignites it.</i>

547
00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:19,822
<i>When you take an
unregulated voltage here,</i>

548
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:23,022
<i>there is a voltage Vz will appear here.</i>

549
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,787
<i>As soon as this voltage
Vz appear here,</i>

550
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:28,437
<i>in the fall of 0.7 volts,</i>

551
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:30,679
<i>So, I have a voltage drop Ui,</i>

552
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:33,773
<i>and it will appear on the resistive divisor.</i>

553
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:37,383
<i>So here I have a Vz voltage fraction is</i>

554
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:42,323
<i>and he arranged the manufacturer
to make the differential pair</i>

555
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:45,523
<i>of our Ta</i>

556
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:47,797
<i>and take one of the transistors
and replaced by a transistor</i>

557
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:50,576
<i>which starts at the beginning
and then after, it will disappear.</i>

558
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:51,278
Why?

559
00:28:51,478 --> 00:28:54,478
<i>Because if I choose a
starting voltage of the transistor</i>

560
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:56,908
<i>So this transistor
then does not work</i>

561
00:28:57,108 --> 00:28:57,743
<i>there is another instead</i>

562
00:28:57,943 --> 00:28:59,899
<i>that binds a reference
voltage which is one.</i>

563
00:29:00,116 --> 00:29:02,188
<i>Not that we do with the Band-Gap,</i>

564
00:29:02,388 --> 00:29:03,826
<i>that's another reference voltage</i>

565
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:06,739
<i>equal to some Vz - Go</i>

566
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:09,483
<i>but he arranged for this voltage level</i>

567
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:11,244
<i>is always less than the reference voltage,</i>

568
00:29:11,444 --> 00:29:13,221
<i>that he wants to get in the end.</i>

569
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:15,501
<i>The advantage of doing like that,</i>

570
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,357
<i>is that my differential pair I see here,</i>

571
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:22,855
<i>before it is controlled by an
input that comes from Vref,</i>

572
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:25,135
<i>it will start. So suddenly,</i>

573
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:29,524
<i>the differential pair begins
to establish a current that passes.</i>

574
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:32,399
<i>The tension here,</i>

575
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:34,334
<i>she comes from a reference voltage</i>

576
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:40,625
<i>and the output of my regulated
voltage begins to regulate themselves.</i>

577
00:29:40,825 --> 00:29:42,394
<i>So I begin to have a V out.</i>

578
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:44,235
<i>This V out there, it is regulated.</i>

579
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:46,306
<i>It is a tension of its
own not like this one.</i>

580
00:29:46,506 --> 00:29:50,542
<i> I start on this tension
not clean, the one that fluctuates.</i>

581
00:29:50,742 --> 00:29:53,742
<i>After I take this clean output voltage</i>

582
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:57,931
<i>and I use to bias my Band-Gap.</i>

583
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,131
<i>So my Band-Gap is feeding</i>

584
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:03,155
<i>with a clean output voltage</i>

585
00:30:03,355 --> 00:30:04,387
<i>that the fluctuation is low</i>

586
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:06,882
<i>and I start with a circuit</i>

587
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:09,243
<i>as soon as the reference
voltage appears here,</i>

588
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:12,443
This voltage then, is less
than the reference voltage

589
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:15,558
<i>So I do it by building
less than Vref</i>

590
00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:17,720
<i>so that this transistor
one will disappear.</i>

591
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,312
<i>There will be blocked immediately</i>

592
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:22,112
<i>and come back with
the transistors of the perdif.</i>

593
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,006
<i>So all this part and
light blue or cyan,</i>

594
00:30:27,206 --> 00:30:32,881
<i>all that part is simply
used to start my circuit</i>

595
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,627
<i>and switches off electronic use</i>

596
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:37,461
<i>and my circuit is reduced to that.</i>

597
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:40,661
<i>I have a regulated
voltage I use to feed</i>

598
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:43,315
<i>my Band-Gap. I have a
reference voltage generated</i>

599
00:30:43,515 --> 00:30:45,679
<i>which is independent
of the temperature variation</i>

600
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,161
<i>then after, classic story</i>

601
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:51,269
<i>who realize my regulated
power supply series.</i>

602
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:54,499
<i>And it is about a diagram
that you find in the market,</i>

603
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,468
<i>in a circuit with three legs</i>

604
00:30:56,668 --> 00:31:00,137
<i>which receives an unregulated
power supply with a mass</i>

605
00:31:00,337 --> 00:31:02,739
<i>you and generates a
regulated voltage at the output</i>

606
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,939
<i>which has a certain value
depending on these reports R1 / R2</i>

607
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:09,718
<i>which are added by the
manufacturer within its circuitry.</i>

608
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:15,043
To close this series on cleaning supplies,

609
00:31:15,243 --> 00:31:20,631
we have the set of components
that allow us to build

610
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:23,768
a series regulator.
This is an excellent example

611
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:27,162
on regulation and this is
a great example that shows

612
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:29,571
all you can do with a transistor

613
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:33,418
or with functional blocks
based on bipolar transistors

614
00:31:33,618 --> 00:31:36,618
or other, of course,
and that allows us to

615
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:40,196
One of apthe plications which
is the series voltage regulator.

616
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:42,536
So it's an advantage
to see regulators

617
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:45,854
because it is a test voltage,
roughly, to the exit.

618
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:48,354
Of course, if we push
the studies a little far,

619
00:31:48,554 --> 00:31:51,554
we have to make very intensive
analyzes in terms

620
00:31:51,754 --> 00:31:55,394
of bandwidth usage, which is
not the objective of this course.

621
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:58,031
Because when you start putting charges

622
00:31:58,244 --> 00:32:05,599
whose current variation is very
demanding in terms of frequency,

623
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,111
it means I have a current
that varies at very high

624
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:11,818
frequencies  as a micro controller
that works at megahertz,

625
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:13,857
well , at this point we're led

626
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,881
to look at the problem differently
and begin to complicate

627
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:18,290
the analysis of this circuit.

628
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,761
I just settled on showing you
the construction

629
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:24,609
of a stabilized power
supply to use it as

630
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,878
a classic example of using functions,

631
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,202
based on transistors.
