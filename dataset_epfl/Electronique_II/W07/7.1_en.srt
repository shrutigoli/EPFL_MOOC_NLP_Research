1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:05,757
Well Hello everyone.

2
00:00:05,916 --> 00:00:09,439
Today we'll tackle a lesson

3
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:12,495
which is an excellent presentation

4
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:15,549
of the bipolar transistor use.

5
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:18,358
We will study the steady supplies.

6
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:20,829
We will not go through
all the techniques

7
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:23,378
that allow us to make a
regulated power supply,

8
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,512
we will settle with what we call

9
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,892
the series control supply.

10
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:32,160
So this is an example where
we will use a single transistor

11
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,437
to regulate a non regulated voltage ,

12
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:35,579
we'll see what it is

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,607
and get from it an
ideal voltage source

14
00:00:38,768 --> 00:00:40,426
with a current limitation

15
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:42,428
and we will see the implementation details

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,190
of this kind of supply.

17
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:48,502
A controlled  DC series power supply

18
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:52,108
is generally one of the mostly used circuits.

19
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:54,635
You know very well that we have

20
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:59,008
a sinusoidal supply type
provided by the sector,

21
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:01,837
that starts from an
electrical outlet,

22
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:05,486
we have this sinusoidal voltage level

23
00:01:05,637 --> 00:01:08,863
of the order of 130 V,

24
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,849
with a transformer
we get to reduce tension,

25
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:15,373
then we use a diode bridge

26
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:18,836
whose objective is to
make a full-wave rectification.

27
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:23,190
So we seek with this with this 4 diode circuit

28
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:26,003
the absolute value of a sinusoidal voltage.

29
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:27,207
In other words,

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,765
the sinusoidal voltage that
appears at the entrance

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,962
is found on the other
side entirely positive,

32
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,823
the negative part of the sinusoidal
voltage appears rectified.

33
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,105
Then we put a filter

34
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:42,366
based on a capacitance

35
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:44,723
and this capacitance
is intended to

36
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:48,461
to charge itself through
the sinusoidal voltage

37
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,828
and then after discharge
from the other side

38
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,792
in what is called the charge,

39
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:56,760
if the charge on this side is
the part where the user

40
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:59,517
plugs his electronic devices

41
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,809
like you have a computer

42
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:04,266
that you want power with DC

43
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:07,385
or you have a radio or you
have any electronic device

44
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:09,445
which receives a DC voltage.

45
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,727
From that side we
have what is typical

46
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:16,654
with a voltage that is rectified and filtered

47
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:20,322
what we call this voltage
corresponding to a portion

48
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:24,969
of the end of the exponential
that appears here

49
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:29,318
after a discharge of the
capacitor through the regulator

50
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,258
to provide power to the charge

51
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:34,639
and we have this residual ripple

52
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,624
so the value of this ripple

53
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:41,563
depends heavily on the current
we draw from the other side

54
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:43,882
So if you want to
regulate this tension,

55
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:46,131
this is the non-regulated voltage,

56
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:49,884
this is what we known at
the exit of this kind of circuit,

57
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:53,347
we put a voltage regulator

58
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:58,682
and the voltage regulator should
receive the unregulated voltage in blue

59
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:01,005
and give us a continues voltage

60
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:04,784
and behave as an ideal
voltage source that side.

61
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:09,241
The DC voltage
at the output,

62
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:12,009
it is always and necessarily

63
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:14,228
lower than that at the input.

64
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:16,164
So our regulator

65
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:21,084
is seen with a non-regulated
voltage which is the blue voltage

66
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:25,014
and the voltage in red that
is a DC voltage at the output

67
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:26,923
and the difference
between the two

68
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:31,227
is the voltage which is between
the input and the regulator output

69
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:33,644
the subject of our lesson today

70
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:36,368
which we will put in an electronic function

71
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:39,441
which transforms this
tension like this

72
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,619
in a perfectly DC voltage

73
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,275
and provides power to the charge.

74
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:48,503
So the difference

75
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:52,104
of the tension is fully
embedded in that block one.

76
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:53,827
So we absolutely understand

77
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:56,295
that there will be
current entering here

78
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:59,046
this current then provides

79
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:02,268
a current which goes through the regulator

80
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:04,478
and the current will
come out the other side

81
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,956
and it will be the power
we use in the load.

82
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:09,937
Here the voltage
is unregulated,

83
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,002
Here the voltage is regulated,

84
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:14,030
and the current is approximately

85
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:16,332
if we neglect the necessary consumption

86
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:18,802
in the controller to operate

87
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:20,963
and although this current is
the scepter height of greatness

88
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:22,356
of what comes out of the other side.

89
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:25,165
Against by the difference of the voltage

90
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:28,870
must depend on the arrow,
that means we see it

91
00:04:29,032 --> 00:04:32,288
when the voltage goes
through a maximum here,

92
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,406
we have this quantity
which increases

93
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:37,461
otherwise when it passes
through a minimum,

94
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:39,516
we have this quantity becoming lower,

95
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,779
it does not prevent that all
this amount of voltage variation

96
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:46,848
is supported by our regulator.

97
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:49,278
So the more this difference is high,

98
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:53,477
more is high power is dissipated inside

99
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:57,906
What he will have within it?

100
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,164
So we said the difference
between this voltage,

101
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,998
I call V1NR,

102
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:06,311
NR is for non-regulated

103
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:08,432
and the voltage V Out,

104
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,987
V Out is DC voltage red to exit

105
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,981
and drop this difference
by the controller.

106
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,587
Well it will be between the two,

107
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,292
it is a simple transistor.

108
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,958
We will enjoy

109
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:23,274
the characteristic
of the transistor,

110
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:25,807
the one that now you
know very well

111
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:30,469
for as to regulate the current
flowing in this transistor,

112
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:34,870
it is taken from a non-regulated voltage,

113
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:37,851
It is returned to
the regulated voltage

114
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:41,944
and the voltage difference is made
by this characteristic we saw

115
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:44,860
This tension is all the time changing

116
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:48,683
between the node and then knot
and we know that a transistor

117
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:52,216
it is capable of passing current
more or less the same

118
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:55,841
if it regulates the current or the
base-transmitter voltage

119
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:58,172
and the voltage between
collector-transmitter

120
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:02,274
is not intended to affect its
behavior in this transistor

121
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,871
because the UCE output voltage,

122
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,692
once we regulate from the base

123
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:11,774
keeps the same current
in the same component

124
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:15,389
without being affected by
the voltage variation.

125
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:19,110
This characteristic,
we will use it to achieve

126
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:21,374
what called the series regulator

127
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:25,557
because the transistor which
is connected in series

128
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:28,933
between the non-regulated voltage
and the non-regulated voltage

129
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:33,638
manages the current flowing
from the source that is

130
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:35,215
and the output
which is here.

131
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:39,410
So I pay your attention that
the input of this circuit

132
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:42,095
it is here the output is here.

133
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:46,129
So we enter a voltage,
it outputs a voltage

134
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,411
and is used a circuit inside

135
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,728
that I'll go through step by step

136
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,082
but before going further to see it,

137
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:56,875
we find that there is this
famous transistor called ballast

138
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,386
it is called in English the bypass,

139
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:03,447
it is called the series transistor
or the voltage regulator

140
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:06,118
which is controlled by a counter reaction loop

141
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:09,662
made with an operational amplifier
and a feedback against.

142
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,615
And we use a reference voltage

143
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,874
that we generate inside

144
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:20,524
for that voltage then by this
setup against feedback

145
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:24,396
allow us to guarantee that
the voltage V Out is a DC voltage

146
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,890
proportional to the
reference voltage

147
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,287
multiplied by a gain
that we will study now.

148
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,603
Let's go through
the series transistor,

149
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,460
the one who is between
the input and the output,

150
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,362
I repeat my explanation,

151
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:41,753
if the current that enters here

152
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:44,675
is found at the output,

153
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:49,221
the current we take comes
from a non-regulated source,

154
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:51,506
as in the example I have shown,

155
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:55,171
this is nothing but
the power of 220 V

156
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,848
followed by a rectifier
followed by a filter,

157
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,808
and we take the current inside there

158
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:03,419
and here is a resistance
which is often variable

159
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:07,113
because it about charge,

160
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,490
this charge here could be a
computer, may be a radio

161
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,150
or whatever you want to
plug in that side,

162
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:14,737
so this is a radio,

163
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:17,492
it depends on the power
you use to the output

164
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,339
This means that
this current,

165
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,250
it is all the time being modified.

166
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:22,724
What we wish,

167
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:26,829
is that this voltage here be
absolutely stable, constant,

168
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:30,242
regardless of the variation in current

169
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:32,566
therefore regardless of
the nature of the load.

170
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,872
I forgot to say

171
00:08:35,203 --> 00:08:37,390
this charge here appears
as a resistance,

172
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:39,388
we'll talk all the
time of resistance

173
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:42,693
but it could be an
inductive, capacitive

174
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,305
or any complex charge
which is the case

175
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:47,897
today of our devices
that we connect.

176
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:51,259
Now I will now take my transistor

177
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:54,853
and add on it the famous
operational amplifier

178
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:58,232
that we call the error amplifier.

179
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:01,507
It uses the name error
amplifier because it has a role,

180
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:04,479
that role is to read
the tension here

181
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:06,307
watch well what I will do,

182
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:10,545
I'll take my operational
amplifier,

183
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:12,984
connect a reference
voltage,

184
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,687
so if this is really an ideal
operational amplifier,

185
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,601
This current here is null

186
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:24,173
so we're not going to take power from in here,

187
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,434
so that it is a reference voltage.

188
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:29,584
We will learn to realise a
voltage references

189
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,876
in the following video,
we'll see what's inside

190
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:37,181
Now from this side,
we'll read this tension,

191
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:39,633
divide it with a divisor

192
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:43,427
and return it back and compare
all the time in this reference

193
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:46,056
hence the name error amplifier

194
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:48,381
because it is all the time
trying to regulate

195
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:50,100
for these two voltages
become the same,

196
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:52,135
which is the role of an amplifier

197
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:54,043
to stay in the linear area.

198
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:57,272
So it amplifies or it is sensitive,

199
00:09:57,592 --> 00:09:59,357
it variations what happens

200
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,263
to regulate the current in transistor

201
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:06,194
and keep constant voltage at the exit

202
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,226
thanks to its very high gain

203
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:12,938
and the capacity to regulate the
two voltages at the same value.

204
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,898
Let's see how we
will read it. So here

205
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:20,884
I'll take here a resistive divisor

206
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,731
and I will use the voltage V Out

207
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:26,778
that I divided by a report

208
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,565
and then I compare to
this reference voltage

209
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,375
and that, it will give me what I call

210
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:35,309
the DC voltage regulator

211
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:37,797
as we just defined.

212
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,912
The power element is this,

213
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:41,614
it's the one that absorbs more

214
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:44,136
and increased
the value of current.

215
00:10:44,388 --> 00:10:46,738
There was very little
current flowing

216
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,637
and generally we power our
operational amplifier

217
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:54,364
with a tension which comes
from this non-regulated voltage

218
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,587
and our amp is powered
by the unregulated part

219
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:00,786
and that have the mass here

220
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:02,398
and this voltage V Out,

221
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,667
it is compared with
the reference voltage

222
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,873
through the counter reaction.

223
00:11:08,387 --> 00:11:12,440
I take something that
probably you know.

224
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,228
I'll draw something here,

225
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:17,404
if I take a normal
operational amplifier,

226
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,500
I make it a reaction against,

227
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:28,280
and I add a stable voltage source

228
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:32,726
that I call V ref, a reference voltage,

229
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:35,812
and I look at the voltage
that appears here

230
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:39,561
compared to the tension
that I put there and 2 resistors

231
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:44,179
one of the resistors I call it R1,
the other resistor R2

232
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,748
and that is the voltage V out.

233
00:11:47,404 --> 00:11:50,610
I can easily write this
voltage according to V ref.

234
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,980
Say V Out

235
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:59,427
equal  to 1 plus the ratio of
the R1 on R2 resistance ,

236
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:03,459
all that multiplies V ref.

237
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,937
That we know this
basic instalation

238
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:08,645
a non-inverting amplifier

239
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:11,803
which gives us this
kind of characteristics.

240
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,353
There I took this amp and I
put behind a push-pull setup

241
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:21,408
So I inserted here a
push-pull installation

242
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,085
and this push-pull installation
is designed to have a gain equal to 1.

243
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:26,903
It takes the tension here

244
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,470
and brings it back to its output multiplied by 1

245
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,068
and it is capable of being supply

246
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,438
by an external supply what we see here,

247
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:39,964
So it picks it from the
non-regulated voltage

248
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:44,031
and the non-regulated voltage
allows it to provide a current

249
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:46,308
and the charge connects here,

250
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:50,033
So here is the RL.

251
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,794
If that's RL,

252
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:55,055
we understood that the push-pull
level which has a gain 1,

253
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:58,347
we can well imagine that
it is part of the amp,

254
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:02,242
it is simply a power level and that
he was carried with 2 floors.

255
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,160
First, let's ask the question,

256
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:05,800
do we need a push-pull?

257
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:07,786
When do we use the push-pull?

258
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:10,934
It is used when there is
a current that can enter

259
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:15,272
and a current that can come
out from our amplification level.

260
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:18,514
In our case here, we need

261
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:21,640
a supply voltage positive
all the time V Out

262
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,112
or all the time negative

263
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:24,882
therefore a transistor is enough.

264
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,318
So I can transfer

265
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:29,594
in the case where the current must pass
through the load in that direction

266
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:33,105
having a positive voltage
V out all the time,

267
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:34,794
I can turn the transistor which is here

268
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:36,137
what I'm going to do right now.

269
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:38,382
So through our scheme

270
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:41,365
we just saw and I draw differently,

271
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:46,752
we will see that the common
manifold instalation output

272
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:50,476
has a unique role:
to be a voltage follower,

273
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,286
allows me to do against a feedback

274
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:55,274
between the output and
the input of my amp.

275
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,693
The amplifier achieves a
voltage gain that will be infinite,

276
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,276
this one gives me a voltage
gain equal to 1,

277
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:05,877
2 realize an instalation

278
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:08,303
with amplifier and a feedback against

279
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,927
which taking this tension there,

280
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:14,217
multiplied by the
resistance ratio R1 / R2 + 1,

281
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:15,804
returns it to the exit

282
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:19,715
and that is the DC
voltage regulator series

283
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,955
that we have presented

284
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:25,169
which is nothing else like classic diagram

285
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:28,268
of which a transistor

286
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:31,428
the interface between
the non-regulated voltage

287
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:33,419
and the regulated
voltage at the output.

288
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,411
So this is not rocket
science as a type of circuit

289
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,630
for someone who knows a
little bit of electronics,

290
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:42,794
he sees what the amplifier is used for

291
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,679
to maintain a constant voltage

292
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:47,780
and each changing of this voltage

293
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,385
has an effect on the output

294
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:52,143
and we do the counter-reaction
on the output.

295
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:55,151
Now if you look at
this pattern here,

296
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,642
I will go to the
implementation of our

297
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,335
operational amplifier,

298
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,101
what there is inside here and
what there is inside there

299
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:02,453
and that is what
we will study.

300
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:04,870
That's the basic component,

301
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:06,991
this is the series transistor

302
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,796
and this is the component
that I have to make as well as this

303
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:13,348
and it will be

304
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:17,508
what we'll study next in
the videos that follow.

305
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:21,804
When you make
a voltage regulator,

306
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:23,816
I would like to regulate
an output voltage

307
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:26,391
so I'm achieve by a voltage regulator

308
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:27,793
an ideal voltage source

309
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:30,394
So is this what I'm doing.

310
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:32,952
I want to make a voltage source

311
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:37,425
whose resistance series is very low.

312
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:40,339
So that is the voltage source

313
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:44,659
V Out I would like to have here

314
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:47,357
and I would like this
series resistance

315
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,623
to be very very low and I get it by

316
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:52,863
a very high gain
counter-reaction amplifier.

317
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,303
Therefore for this voltage to be
the same as the latter,

318
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,616
it must be almost zero,

319
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:00,844
so I put it this way:

320
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:04,309
I say I can draw a current I Out

321
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,125
and even if this current
I delta Out becomes variable,

322
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:12,542
it should have very
little effect on V Out

323
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:16,367
and that, that brings me to
the effect of a variation in load

324
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:19,938
Because my charge is something
that would come to hook up.

325
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:24,692
This is your charge,

326
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,081
this is what we just realized
within our circuit.

327
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,011
And we hope that when
the resistance variations,

328
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:35,258
therefore it impacts the
variation of this current,

329
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:38,849
I would like this delta V Out
being the lowest possible

330
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:43,341
and that in reality it is the output
impedance of this level there.

331
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:47,423
So we always try to minimize
the output impedance

332
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:49,963
and as you have seen
that it about a mounting

333
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,994
when I go out on the
transmitter to my transistor,

334
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:55,680
So this is the lowest
impedance that I can see

335
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:59,505
for a transistor that
I would see on R Out.

336
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,175
now on R Out, there are other effects.

337
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,776
There is the effect of the
non-regulated voltage,

338
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,879
Remember that your
supply or your regulator,

339
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:12,443
it is powered by the
non-regulated voltage.

340
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:15,202
We hope that this
non-regulated voltage

341
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:18,774
has very little effect on
the variation of output,

342
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:20,705
So that brings us back to see

343
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:24,478
the quality of our reference voltage

344
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:28,728
multiplied by the
gain of our amplifier

345
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:34,532
and of course the amplifier should
have a very good PSRR,

346
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:37,191
it is to said a Power Supply
Rejection Ratio

347
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,946
which is very well done

348
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:42,714
to does not pass

349
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:45,614
from the disturbance of
the unregulated supply

350
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,909
to the voltage which must
be specific to the output.

351
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,505
And finally we also want V Out

352
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,281
to be independent of
the temperature variation

353
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,057
and this often comes
from the quality of V ref,

354
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,781
the reference,

355
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:02,347
if V ref has a temperature effect,
we will see the exit.

356
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:05,337
So when we call a voltage regulator,

357
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,947
we look V out, V out, V out,

358
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:10,821
we look at the facts

359
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:14,578
of the current from the output V Out,

360
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:17,882
the effect of the non-stabilized voltage

361
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:21,519
which should become
stabilize acording with V Out

362
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:24,632
and we look at the effect
of temperature on V Out

363
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:27,207
and it gives us the 3
parameters that we call

364
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,198
the effect of the variation of the charge,

365
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,647
the effect of a variation
of the input voltage,

366
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:34,714
and the effect of a
temperature variation.

367
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,682
These are very
important settings

368
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,985
whenwe receive a stabilized power supply.

369
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:44,579
Well there is another
parameter that will appear.

370
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:46,549
If you take your transistor

371
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:49,075
just say it's a power component,

372
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,822
so it's a transistor designed

373
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,319
to see a variation in voltage

374
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:57,068
and it is traversed by a current

375
00:18:57,256 --> 00:18:59,696
and we know that the
power that runs through it,

376
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:04,235
is UCE that multiplies I out.

377
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,525
So this is the variation ...

378
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:09,585
the variation of the voltage
or it is rather UCE

379
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:12,908
which quantity of tension it
is between here and there

380
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:14,610
and what is the current
flowing through it?

381
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:18,222
Well it will give us the power
dissipated in this component.

382
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:22,765
If you go from a non-regulated voltage

383
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:24,972
and you move towards a V Out voltage,

384
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,756
the less this voltage is high,

385
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:34,489
so this is V1NR minus V Out,

386
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,740
less this voltage is high,
it is the UCE of the transistor,

387
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:42,018
less is the power dissipated
in the transistor.

388
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:44,936
So we try to make power

389
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:47,363
where this tension is quite close to it,

390
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:49,111
of course the ideal is 0,

391
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,166
if you have 0 that is mean there,
there is no power

392
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,712
and we talk about LDO
type series regulator

393
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:59,026
or in English Low Drop Out voltage.

394
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:03,441
So when you make a voltage where
the regulator is extremely close

395
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:06,937
de celle-ci qui dissipe très très peu
qui a un excellent rendement,

396
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:10,209
it means we managed to
have very little voltage variation

397
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,220
between the collector and the
transmitter of this transistor.

398
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,117
Now what happens

399
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:18,351
if someone comes to the
output of a voltage source

400
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:20,031
and creates a short circuit?

401
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:21,505
So he takes this resistance,

402
00:20:21,713 --> 00:20:24,363
it puts such a low resistance it is 0,

403
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,119
So it creates a short circuit
between this and that.

404
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,353
And if you create
a short circuit,

405
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:33,958
the V1NR voltage compared to V Out,

406
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:35,377
I will give you an example,

407
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:39,049
you have 12 V unregulated

408
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,931
and you are looking
to have 8V regulated ,

409
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:46,003
therefore the difference between
the two is of the order of 4 V

410
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,167
and why that V Out instead it being 8V
it becomes 0?

411
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:52,389
The 12 V appear here,

412
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:57,190
therefore we has a whole V1NR voltage
of about 12 V on average value

413
00:20:57,726 --> 00:21:00,878
which appears across my
transistor instead of 4 V.

414
00:21:01,113 --> 00:21:05,169
So this is the power dissipated
in my transistor will be excessive

415
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:07,891
because it's instead of 4 x I out,

416
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:11,450
I end up with 12 x I out.

417
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:14,206
So suddenly, I have a lot of power

418
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,733
and that we can not tolerate it.

419
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:19,809
So what we need to do
is to limit this current

420
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:23,904
and have a current I called Max Out

421
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:27,842
to limit the current at the output

422
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:30,142
and it is an integral part

423
00:21:30,263 --> 00:21:34,308
of the embodiment of a voltage regulator

424
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:37,223
because it is with this maximum current

425
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:39,790
that we know what is
the power dissipated

426
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:41,477
and we choose the transistor

427
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:44,231
according to the dissipated
power in our ...

428
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:47,774
in our transistor and depending
on this current I out max.

429
00:21:49,345 --> 00:21:53,095
Before watching this and see
how are we going to limit it,

430
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:56,797
I'll take you gradually into
the internal structure

431
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,817
of my series regulator.

432
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:03,288
It must be said, there is
the output transistor,

433
00:22:03,428 --> 00:22:06,808
there will have after a limitation,

434
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:09,604
there the amplifier,
there is the against-reaction,

435
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:11,411
there is the reference voltage.

436
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:16,780
Just take an example of
a very simple amplifier,

437
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:20,214
is the famous differential
pair with active load

438
00:22:20,702 --> 00:22:24,531
and as you have just learned
in previous lessons,

439
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,983
is that it is a theoretical gain

440
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,958
if that resistance is very high,

441
00:22:29,968 --> 00:22:31,543
we find ourselves with a gain

442
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,169
extremely high, I do not speak of
the burden of that side there,

443
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:38,415
So I'll find myself with a GN
times the impedance,

444
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,698
if it is infinite and good,
it's would be an infinite gain.

445
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:45,323
So if we start with a simple structure

446
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:47,943
of our amplifier which is foolishly

447
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:49,987
the perdiff with active load

448
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,308
and we put a resistive divisor here

449
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,168
which takes the V Out voltage

450
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:57,986
which multiplies by the resistance
ratio if he bring it back here,

451
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:03,473
so this is V out by R2 / R1 + R2 will
be the tension that I see there.

452
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:07,255
On one side, I have the voltage V Out,

453
00:23:07,461 --> 00:23:08,566
I would now like

454
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:11,903
to put on the other side a voltage
to which I compare

455
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:15,323
and this is the perdiff which
will compare the two voltages

456
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:18,199
and ensure that the gain
of the amplifier is still constant.

457
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:22,487
Remember that after perdiff
I have a voltage follower.

458
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:26,849
I leave since the exit of my perdiff
where I made a voltage gain,

459
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,722
it amplifies the difference
between the 2,

460
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:31,920
after I have a gain equal to 1 which
is made by this instalation there.

461
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:36,116
From that side,

462
00:23:36,636 --> 00:23:39,209
I have to plug my reference voltage,

463
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,395
So there will be after a
zener diode or a bandgap,

464
00:23:43,512 --> 00:23:45,292
we will study it just now

465
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:51,497
and we will see that any
variation in voltage,

466
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:53,294
it is always returned here

467
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:55,075
and I'm always looking for

468
00:23:55,182 --> 00:23:56,719
that voltage equal to this voltage

469
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:59,472
as it happens in my operational amplifier

470
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:01,913
because all that level can be brought

471
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:04,900
to a diagram of an operational amplifier.

472
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:11,234
The gain V Out function of V ref,

473
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,200
is when I equalize that expression

474
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:15,731
to that expression,

475
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:19,187
because my differential
pair is in balance,

476
00:24:19,895 --> 00:24:21,531
so it'll give me that equal to it

477
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,510
and I find myself with this
relationship that I see here

478
00:24:25,695 --> 00:24:28,447
that V Out is really
proportional to V ref,

479
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:31,276
so if I want to have comparative
to a constant V ref

480
00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:33,598
I only have to change
the resistance ratio here

481
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:35,628
and I'll have a diet

482
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:38,250
whose the output
voltage is variable.

483
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:45,036
we has just seen the
regulator of our structure,

484
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:49,068
we have just seen
that the output current,

485
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,864
it is the current that flows like this,

486
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:56,334
therefore the current that
passes in that direction

487
00:24:56,463 --> 00:24:59,388
will be the current I Out comes from there.

488
00:24:59,576 --> 00:25:03,307
This transistor then will
take a current in the base

489
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:07,652
and it will come out a current in
the collector and transmitter

490
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:10,609
that beta times the current
that I send in the database.

491
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:14,441
You remember how is works the perdiff

492
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:17,391
when you put him a
current source as active load.

493
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:20,444
You know that perdiff, it is in balance,

494
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:22,830
is to said it should in the linear zone

495
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:25,401
compare this voltage to the voltage

496
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:27,556
and stay in the linear region.

497
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,118
Now, more you ask the perdiff

498
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:34,899
to make variations on
the operating point,

499
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,605
more current flows

500
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,186
more in a branch to ...

501
00:25:40,526 --> 00:25:41,701
and less in the other

502
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:44,274
until all your current source

503
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,335
passes through a transistor
and not in the other.

504
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:49,443
So I'll take this extreme case.

505
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:52,501
When I begin to lower
the voltage V Out,

506
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:54,210
I lower it to the point

507
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:57,141
where I get out my perdiff of
the linear region.

508
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,141
The style that I get this
voltage compared to there

509
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:04,671
and all the power source

510
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,060
pass throught in this transistor,
so my perdiff is unbalanced.

511
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:12,307
It is not in the linear region and
of course there is no regulation,

512
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:14,819
we get to the saturation
of the differential pair.

513
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:17,871
All power who was in
this current source

514
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:20,176
will pass in this transistor.

515
00:26:20,374 --> 00:26:23,787
it will be multiplied by the beta
of this transistor which I called beta S

516
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:26,815
and provide me with the output
current so there is at somme point

517
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:28,552
I reach this maximum current,

518
00:26:28,707 --> 00:26:31,644
I could not in this configuration one

519
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:34,539
overstep this maximum
current that clearly written

520
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:39,820
I out max, it is proportional
to the quantity of current

521
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:42,404
that I have put in there

522
00:26:42,575 --> 00:26:45,842
multiplied by the beta of the
transistor which has a fixed value,

523
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,626
so I get to I max out.

524
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:52,823
then of course in this situation
when the perdiff is no longer works,

525
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:55,959
we are already in the perdiff saturation,

526
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,790
so this voltage is then
no longer regulated,

527
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,368
may continue to fall,

528
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:03,264
you can even go up
to make V Out equal to 0

529
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:07,326
and then I fall back in the situation
that I described at the beginning.

530
00:27:07,555 --> 00:27:08,997
If it's I out max

531
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:12,767
and if this voltage then equal to 0

532
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:15,463
So I really have a short circuit here

533
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,775
So the tension V1R

534
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:20,819
its this voltage which is then
the same as that one,

535
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:25,814
it is also the VNR.

536
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:29,406
So I have a voltage V1NR

537
00:27:29,568 --> 00:27:31,566
Which appears at the
terminals of my transistor

538
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:34,954
and this transistor is driven
by the current I out max.

539
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:38,659
And there, I can reach a limit

540
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:40,760
where this transistor may suffer

541
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:43,635
in terms of power
dissipation and even slam

542
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:46,299
because of the heat
which is dissipated in

543
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:49,987
and I would avoid
this situation.

544
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:53,887
So what we do as limiting circuit

545
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,622
the output current,

546
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:59,183
is that we will add
strength that we call

547
00:27:59,752 --> 00:28:01,755
in this example here R lim.

548
00:28:02,177 --> 00:28:04,432
I am in this condition,

549
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:08,104
I reach to a maximum current
I want to establish its value.

550
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,189
How do I establish its value?

551
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:14,015
Establish its value against a
resistance that I would put here.

552
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,996
I will arrange to make
a comparator here

553
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,811
like put a component

554
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:23,929
Which will read the voltage
at the terminals of R lim

555
00:28:24,113 --> 00:28:26,716
and when I reach to
the value I max out,

556
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:29,403
interrupt function
inherited from this

557
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:32,436
to avoid that I continue to
draw a current in this way

558
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,685
through the TS transistor,
I want to prevent that.

559
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:37,501
So how will I prevent that?

560
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:41,072
If the current flowing in
the base of this transistor,

561
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:42,947
I succeeded in deviating it elsewhere,

562
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,798
this transistor then he
is no longer going to suffer

563
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,416
By this excessive current
which will go to the end.

564
00:28:48,955 --> 00:28:51,955
And if I can limit that
tension one to a value

565
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,371
I determine myself

566
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:56,697
and I have to make
a comparator

567
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:58,668
which reads this value and stop it.

568
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,415
And I do it in a very simple way,

569
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:03,300
I do it at once with a single transistor,

570
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:05,802
a single transistor could

571
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:07,408
come

572
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,628
read a voltage.

573
00:29:09,823 --> 00:29:10,827
What kind of pressure?

574
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,415
Look at a simple transistor,

575
00:29:12,532 --> 00:29:15,326
we had seen that a transistor
begins to conduct

576
00:29:15,426 --> 00:29:18,781
when the base-transmitter voltage is
of the order of magnitude of UJ.

577
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:23,385
So I just have to fix me so I x R lim Out

578
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,668
is of the order of magnitude of UJ

579
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:27,751
for this transistor to starts conducting.

580
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,862
I neglects the current flowing here

581
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:32,741
I consider the current which
pass in that branch then

582
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:36,363
is low enough that I Out here
it's the same that I see here:

583
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:38,055
I Out x R lim,

584
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:42,133
the moment where I Out x R lim
gives me a tension here

585
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:44,799
who causes the transistor
which is of the order of UJ

586
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:48,378
well look at I2, it will be like this

587
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,202
the small portion
that would go there,

588
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:56,499
we begins to bite in there
and move it in that direction.

589
00:29:56,722 --> 00:29:58,139
So this transistor here,

590
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:00,583
could no longer regulate one side

591
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:03,999
and on the other side, it
is not drawing current

592
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:08,518
beyond this current that will be I max Out

593
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:13,230
which will be proportional to
that UJ which appears here

594
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:16,278
multiplied by...

595
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,264
sorry, divided by R lim

596
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:21,297
and that will give us the maximum
of current that I withdraw.

597
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:25,547
And it is a supply that
has at this moment

598
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:27,906
a current limitation and as we said

599
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:29,844
it was absolutely essential.

600
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:31,224
Let's see it!

601
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:35,627
The same explanation
presented in a simple way

602
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,672
I Out = UJ / R lim,

603
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,127
That was the idea.

604
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:42,365
I just have to say: what is
the maximum current?

605
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:45,566
And the maximum
current it depends

606
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:49,408
on the power that I can
dispel in the transistor TS

607
00:30:49,703 --> 00:30:52,703
because it is I Out x UCE

608
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,008
that will allow me to
see this maximum current

609
00:30:56,131 --> 00:31:00,871
and this will be even
up until V Out 0,

610
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,776
it is as soon as
I reached this value then

611
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:04,766
even if this voltage is equal to 0,

612
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:10,684
so it will give me the V1NR
tension from here to there

613
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:14,124
minus UJ because I would
have lost that UJ on it,

614
00:31:14,243 --> 00:31:15,580
one can almost overlook it

615
00:31:15,765 --> 00:31:18,653
compared to a full voltage
level from here to there

616
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:21,484
will give me the UCE
voltage of the transistor,

617
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:22,854
I multiply by I Out

618
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:26,007
will give me the power I'll
dispel in this transistor

619
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:29,629
and this is the expression
of the current limitation

620
00:31:29,817 --> 00:31:33,103
I Out is equal to UJ divided by R lim.

621
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,389
And the characteristic of such
of supply become thereof :

622
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:42,113
regulated supply.

623
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:45,550
that's your charge at the output,

624
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:50,287
as long as your transistor,
I come back to the slide before,

625
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:54,932
As long as your transistor
is blocked, it's does not exist

626
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,970
I can remove it completely.

627
00:31:57,578 --> 00:31:59,881
Although I have the I Out
who's continues his way,

628
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:02,511
I lose a little of this resistance

629
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:04,609
as voltage drop

630
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:10,970
until I tend to value where
I Out R lim equal to UJ

631
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:14,595
and this transistor starts to conduct.
So when does it happen?

632
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,277
It happens at this moment!

633
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:21,334
It happens when you
look at the resistance

634
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,678
and you continue to draw current,
look this is the current axis.

635
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:26,982
When you get to
this I max out

636
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:29,390
So here, in this point one,

637
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:32,468
this is where you have
I Out max = UJ / R lim,

638
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:36,590
your transistor T3 which was
orange in orange color

639
00:32:36,856 --> 00:32:39,978
will start driving and
immediately after,

640
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:42,103
You will no longer be able
to increase the current,

641
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:45,110
you want to increase the current,
you increase very little,

642
00:32:45,476 --> 00:32:47,620
it is because we took
an UJ approximation

643
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:50,550
but the transistor begins to
conduct perhaps around ...

644
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:53,953
less than 0.65 or 0.7,

645
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,459
it begins to drive and there you're going

646
00:32:56,586 --> 00:32:58,374
to have the output
voltage which will drop

647
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:01,086
until we reach to a
short-circuit current

648
00:33:01,224 --> 00:33:04,236
and then we can say that
the output voltage is 0.

649
00:33:04,374 --> 00:33:05,733
And we are inside there!

650
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:11,802
We are at R lim which lead

651
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,564
and when R lim is currently driving,

652
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,335
we may continue to fall

653
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:19,764
and then we will move
towards an output voltage

654
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,144
which will be even equal to 0

655
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:24,766
and we end up with
a short-circuit current

656
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:26,664
close enough to I Out max

657
00:33:26,827 --> 00:33:30,716
because everything will turn
around this detection of 0.7 V

658
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,405
with the junction of the transistor

659
00:33:32,556 --> 00:33:36,002
and we will have a characteristic
of a voltage source

660
00:33:36,393 --> 00:33:40,140
which is great until I Out max

661
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:41,984
and quickly collapses

662
00:33:42,378 --> 00:33:44,979
even until the output short circuit.

663
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:48,518
But then I still drawn
this current short circuit,

664
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:50,729
it continues to move
in my transistor

665
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:56,350
of bypass, so the series transistor
between the input and the output,

666
00:33:56,575 --> 00:33:59,400
we still keep them,
it continues to have exactly

667
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:02,233
the same quantity of current
and dissipate power.

668
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:05,689
This is something we do not like,
we should improve it.

669
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,028
To improve it, there are
the following diagram,

670
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,288
instead of imposing a voltage:

671
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:16,520
only read the UJ voltage
to terminal of R lim,

672
00:34:16,692 --> 00:34:18,760
we will do this:

673
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:22,674
we'll add our resistive divider,

674
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,304
the one that ...

675
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,715
more so another resistive divider will...

676
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:32,110
we keep our R Lim

677
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,152
we add

678
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:36,194
two large resistors
preferably large resistors

679
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:38,405
for that current flowing through
them will be very low,

680
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:42,055
for it ... all the current
flowing in there or in there

681
00:34:42,272 --> 00:34:44,844
it will be subtracted from I Out
and that we do not like.

682
00:34:45,074 --> 00:34:46,140
So it is stirred

683
00:34:46,302 --> 00:34:49,302
and we will take
our earlier transistor

684
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,861
which is there
to limit the current

685
00:34:51,982 --> 00:34:53,343
and instead to simply  put it

686
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:56,265
as comparison across to R lim

687
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:59,434
we will also use the term of V Out inside

688
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:01,231
by putting the resistive divider.

689
00:35:01,604 --> 00:35:03,158
This resistive divider,

690
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,421
if R lim is very low

691
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:08,369
and the voltage drop is negligible,

692
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:10,094
it is as if V Out is there

693
00:35:10,617 --> 00:35:12,911
and we neglect the voltage drop here

694
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:14,441
you will see that  V Out like here,

695
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,036
So, I have a divider that
will make me appear

696
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:19,919
a proportion of V out like this.

697
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:25,339
I would see an alpha
voltage, I call  it V Out

698
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:28,978
such that V' Out is
I Out R lim + V Out

699
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:32,902
and I will  now add my
transistor here

700
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:36,294
I'll add my transistor here

701
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:40,429
therefore UJ voltage
or the control voltage

702
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:42,496
transistor appears

703
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,436
between this node
and that node

704
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:49,007
and I will write the
expression of the tension ...

705
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:52,120
the maximum
current at that time.

706
00:35:52,438 --> 00:35:56,559
So the VBE voltage of the
transistor sees all this mesh,

707
00:35:57,634 --> 00:36:01,569
in this maille, I see I Out R lim,

708
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:03,711
it's that's I Out

709
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:05,207
And there ...

710
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:10,127
And there is also the voltage
that is a proportion of V out

711
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,987
which is alpha V 'Out

712
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:16,335
and alpha comme from a resistive divider,

713
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:20,390
it is a relationship between
the resistors R3, R3 + R4.

714
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:23,575
So the voltage V 'Out,

715
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:27,098
it's like I'd just say it's
the tension I lim R Out

716
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:29,148
plus V Out I have noted here.

717
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:32,409
I use these two words together

718
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,085
to put them outside Out

719
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,307
and it will give me this:

720
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:41,686
VBE3 this is actually the UJ,

721
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:45,537
the voltage which is from here to there

722
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:47,320
which operates my comparator

723
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:50,100
and begins to drift current

724
00:36:50,223 --> 00:36:52,731
which should go into the base

725
00:36:52,915 --> 00:36:55,098
and I find myself with
a current R Out

726
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:59,962
equal to UJ plus alpha V Out
divided by 1 minus alpha R lim.

727
00:37:00,347 --> 00:37:01,992
Analyze this together.

728
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:05,801
Earlier when I had not put this,

729
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:09,012
le I Out max depended on R Lim,

730
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:11,904
So there I am saying that

731
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,350
I Out max exist

732
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:18,390
but it may be also have a I Out CC,

733
00:37:18,524 --> 00:37:19,395
so short-circuit,

734
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:22,261
is when this tension and
this tension are the same

735
00:37:22,404 --> 00:37:23,455
So when there really

736
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:26,183
V Out equal to 0 when I bypasses,

737
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:28,405
when that term equal to 0

738
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,545
So this term falls

739
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,576
so you can have a maximum current

740
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:36,269
and still have your
circuit which regulates

741
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:38,941
with a V Out finite and known

742
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:41,775
and you go after
to want to regulate

743
00:37:41,974 --> 00:37:43,728
and you continue to lower V Out

744
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,349
until V Out equal to 0 and has 2 values.

745
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:51,528
There is a value for the I out max
and one value for the I out CC

746
00:37:51,694 --> 00:37:53,783
So it is when V Out equal to 0.

747
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,061
So we will see that this expression

748
00:37:56,672 --> 00:38:00,019
has the following thing I
can describe it as this,

749
00:38:01,386 --> 00:38:04,586
your regulator regulates
the voltage as it is usual,

750
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:06,988
there is no effect

751
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:08,975
due to ...

752
00:38:09,276 --> 00:38:11,837
it's a T3 transistor
because it's always blocked

753
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:14,150
and it's like it does not exist.

754
00:38:14,348 --> 00:38:16,159
And you get to a point

755
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:20,474
where your T3 transistor
will want to conduct

756
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:24,302
and you continue to draw current,

757
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:28,555
more you draw the current,
so the more you lower V Out

758
00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:30,969
which tends to 0,

759
00:38:32,486 --> 00:38:34,175
that will go to 0,

760
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:35,759
when V Out equal to 0,

761
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:39,090
you will end up with UJ
divided by a report,

762
00:38:39,502 --> 00:38:42,022
it will give you what is going
to happen with your characteristic

763
00:38:42,178 --> 00:38:43,315
that we call

764
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:47,340
a stabilized power supply with
input characteristic,

765
00:38:48,154 --> 00:38:51,723
in other words we have a regulation characteristic

766
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:55,553
and after more we draw current,

767
00:38:56,015 --> 00:38:58,545
the more we want to draw more current,

768
00:38:59,664 --> 00:39:03,127
it becomes impossible
because it no longer regulates

769
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,460
so the voltage drops down,

770
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:06,304
look at the voltage it is going down,

771
00:39:06,473 --> 00:39:08,828
but at the same
time I draw less current,

772
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:11,232
the opposite of
what I had done early

773
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,167
when I'm here

774
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:16,304
in the first simple limitation,

775
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:19,993
I still found myself with a
current equivalent to I Out max,

776
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:22,586
here I am with a current I Out CC

777
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:25,008
in which this term here has disappeared

778
00:39:25,182 --> 00:39:30,069
and it led me to this term equal to 0
so UJ over 1 minus alpha R lim.

779
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:31,912
So I have a less current

780
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:35,154
that's the max and that's
the short-circuit current

781
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,774
so I have less power,
so less dissipation

782
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,037
in my transistor
that is in series.

783
00:39:41,438 --> 00:39:45,451
Let's see with a little more
current which increases.

784
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:46,630
Here,

785
00:39:47,572 --> 00:39:49,246
See now here is what happens

786
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:50,872
when you reached

787
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:53,704
the point of resistance,

788
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,772
a minimum output

789
00:39:55,898 --> 00:39:57,993
which brings me to
the maximum current

790
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,606
beyond that I no longer regulate

791
00:40:01,426 --> 00:40:03,833
and this is what I get

792
00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:07,737
when actually my
output resistance is equal to 0.

793
00:40:07,953 --> 00:40:09,782
When my output
resistance is equal to 0,

794
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:11,463
I have a lower current

795
00:40:11,644 --> 00:40:14,833
and we get this limitation
characteristic

796
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:18,753
the output current of incoming Nature

797
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:22,111
which is much more interesting
than we had seen at the beginning

798
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:25,074
for several reasons and mainly

799
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:28,599
for the power dissipation
in my series transistor.

800
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,950
This is the final figure,

801
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:35,084
I'll let you analyze it

802
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,177
and see the difference
between the two currents

803
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:40,492
and see that everything will depend
of course on my alpha parameter

804
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:44,393
which also depends on my ratio strength

805
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:47,452
that I just choose to
do this kind of circuit.

806
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,262
I would like to compare what will
happen with my transistor here

807
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:56,058
when I foolishly put a resistance

808
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:58,929
and I make a simple
characteristic like this.

809
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:01,404
Suppose that your transistor,

810
00:41:01,613 --> 00:41:03,895
it has a power characteristic

811
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:08,238
which is stop us or prevents us

812
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,656
to have U x I in the
transistor so if I am here,

813
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:16,868
here I am with a voltage UCE which is this

814
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:20,458
and a maximum current
which flowing through it

815
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:25,135
Which brings me to have
dissipated  power in my transistor

816
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,731
perhaps superior in
this example, I am not the limit

817
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:31,934
that the maximum
power of this transistor.

818
00:41:32,044 --> 00:41:33,206
So any

819
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:36,113
additional current I
start wanting to draw

820
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:39,333
if I fall into the short circuit,

821
00:41:39,547 --> 00:41:43,376
the output voltage is equal to
0 I'm in the prohibited zone

822
00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:45,594
where the manufacturer
forbids me

823
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:49,004
to dispel beyond an quantity
that depends of course ...

824
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:51,315
the housing my transistor
and its radiator.

825
00:41:51,946 --> 00:41:55,483
So if I have a current
limiting incoming Nature

826
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:56,799
like that,

827
00:41:57,955 --> 00:42:01,936
I can continue to have
the regulated voltage

828
00:42:02,122 --> 00:42:05,431
and draw more and more current
look I have a current I Out

829
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:06,788
much higher

830
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,595
given that after

831
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,106
the current

832
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,368
it will drop down

833
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:15,168
when the voltage goes to 0

834
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:16,960
So see the area

835
00:42:17,506 --> 00:42:19,169
that I can not go into it

836
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:22,436
because my transistor
does not allow me to do so.

837
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:24,195
In that example one,

838
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,857
I absolutely can not do it,

839
00:42:25,994 --> 00:42:28,867
if the control or the output limitation

840
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,227
do not let me draw more current

841
00:42:32,213 --> 00:42:33,861
because I enter the prohibited area,

842
00:42:34,063 --> 00:42:38,636
there by the incoming inclined
shape of this characteristic,

843
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:40,950
I can draw more and more current

844
00:42:41,077 --> 00:42:43,966
and continue to regulate
with the same circuit

845
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:47,877
while having a limitation
which go to this value then

846
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,069
which is the I Out max because
I succeeded to differentiate

847
00:42:52,293 --> 00:42:55,475
the maximum current than
the short-circuit current

848
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:58,110
which are there and there
for this characteristic.

849
00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:04,918
We have seen the
implementation of a series feed

850
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:06,594
a series regulator,

851
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:09,816
This regulator series
is an excellent example

852
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,968
to show us
the first use

853
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:15,424
Of the differential pair that
makes us the basic amplifier

854
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:19,451
followed by an transmitter-
follower setup type

855
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:23,158
In which a low output impedance

856
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:25,688
In which one can get out
a low output impedance

857
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:28,319
and it was analyzed
that a transistor used

858
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:30,695
almost in switching as a comparator

859
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:33,442
but really very simple

860
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:37,109
where the fact lead
is a very useful tool

861
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:39,161
in stabilized power supplies

862
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:42,324
And which would allow us
to limit the output current.

863
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:45,545
So with this kind of setup,

864
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,708
it gives you some applications
of bipolar transistors

865
00:43:49,908 --> 00:43:53,650
and we'll see in the video
that follows immediately

866
00:43:53,848 --> 00:43:55,913
How do we make a voltage reference?

867
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,340
And in there, there will also
have circuits with transistors

868
00:43:59,528 --> 00:44:03,668
And we would have seen a whole
set of applications around transistors

869
00:44:03,876 --> 00:44:07,439
which represents an important chapter
for those who want to go beyond,

870
00:44:07,615 --> 00:44:10,502
to understand how the transistor works
and begin to understand

871
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:12,997
analog electronic systems that use

872
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:16,012
regulation for example,
or other functionalities

873
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:17,561
with the transistors.
