1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,750
Good morning everyone,
today we will discuss

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,450
how we will use this small
signals model which we have

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,420
already derived from the non-linear
characteristics of the transistor.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,230
So we have seen that
once we have linearized

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,000
our transistor, that is,
we have simply polarized

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,160
our transistor and we will take the slopes

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,800
of the tangents on these characteristics,
we get

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,260
a linear model and
the linear model is called

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,570
small signals model .It is very powerful as

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,050
a model because it's about components we

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,360
know, when placed in circuit
there is no non linearity.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,550
This means we will use
three types of set that we

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,800
called small signal configuration.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,270
You will see, we will take
the transistor, we will take

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,620
its model and we will turn it
around its three terminals:

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,200
transmitter, collector and base.

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,390
And we'll talk about the common
transmitter, common collector

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,070
and common base. And we'll finish after

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,000
with a global vision of the value
of these three assemblies

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,850
that will make the puzzle
of linear electronic circuits.

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,386
To begin, I will take again
the transistor model.

22
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:18,080
I put arrows

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,440
that show in blue the small signal
diagram and I have

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,090
set vectors there that show
a red color, which

25
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,620
will first show that this transistor will all

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,010
the time coexist an AC or variable

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,280
so-called increments, which is

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,780
drawn in blue and it will
have fixed potentials who

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,460
will be the polarization
of this transistor.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,100
So when you take that component,
we will make the first

31
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:49,560
operation which is polarization.

32
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,000
This polarization operation
will be part of a specific chapter.

33
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,580
Once we have polarized
the transistor, that is

34
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,450
we've managed to get this from
our transistor, we managed to

35
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,810
apply a fixed current called
polarization current.

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,340
And that's it our transistor will have a

37
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,620
DC current that passes
in both the base in

38
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,000
the collector with the link
we saw earlier through the β.

39
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,370
And there we make the approximation
to say, between base and

40
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,630
transmitter simply we have
a voltage drop that is called

41
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,373
UJ junction voltage and
is approximated at 0.7.

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,260
So for the polarization operation we simply

43
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,140
accept this model, but once
this model is obtained we will

44
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,800
move to this model.

45
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,253
That's when the transistor is in AC mode.

46
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,210
So here we are in the DC polarization

47
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,320
and here it is in the use
of what we call AC.

48
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,580
If your polarized transistor has

49
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,000
an IC0 current that you
applied yourself and

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,660
you realize that you have
analyzed the transistor and

51
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,160
you know that it is not blocked
or saturated and you

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,550
have managed to ensure that during it use

53
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,640
when Ic, in blue, Ib in blue and

54
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,220
ΔVbe vary, that your transistor
is neither saturated or blocked,

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,000
you can remove this transistor
in the diagram and

56
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,220
replace it with equivalent small signals.

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,213
This equivalent small signals
was derived from

58
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:35,780
non-linear characteristics.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,830
I remind you that we found your transistor,

60
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,580
if you do a ΔIb / ΔVbe you'll find GbE.

61
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,000
ΔIc and ΔUce,

62
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,110
you find Gce and the transistor works like

63
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,000
a transconductance,
that is it checks the

64
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,240
ΔVbe variation, it brings it to
the output with ΔIc and we

65
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,470
model it by a current
controlled source and this

66
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,620
controlled current source
is this symbol here and we call it

67
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,550
ΔIc or Ic which is equal to
the transconductance of our

68
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:14,090
transistor multiplied by the variation.

69
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,880
Therefore was converted
the voltage variation in a

70
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,360
current variation, which is
the role of the transistor.

71
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,700
But this model is a model
that represents only linear components.

72
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,860
So we take this symbol
and replace it by this and we

73
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,320
will see later how we will
change the rest of

74
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,570
the diagram because it works in a world
in which everything was derived.

75
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,420
So just to remind you, wherever you have

76
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,780
fixed voltage sources
the derivative of a fixed voltage

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,860
is zero, similarly if  you have
a fixed current source,

78
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,333
the derivative of a constant current
is equal to infinity.

79
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:53,490
So if you have a fixed voltage source,

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,300
you replace it with a short circuit.

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,530
If you have a power source,
you replace it with an open circuit.

82
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,890
Now we come to the essential.

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,890
The point is that the components that we

84
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,730
derived, it is this Gm GbE Gce,
their value is absolutely known.

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,293
It depends on what is in red,
which comes from this diagram here.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,746
This pattern then allowed us to fix IC0

87
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,010
and after looking at the other parameters.

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,440
And these other parameters
are related to the physical, it is

89
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:25,350
not related to the circuit that
you are making.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,653
The Va is this voltage here it is called
the voltage early.

91
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,250
Remember when extracted on

92
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,800
the output characteristic Ic Uce,
we found that there

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,840
is a slope and this slope
then affects the current source

94
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,460
outside and it'll give you
this conductance

95
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,930
Gce or its inverse, it depends
on whether you're looking at the

96
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,640
voltage to current or current to voltage
relation, it is equal,

97
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,653
you can write Gce or 1 / Gce.

98
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,960
Now if you take Va and say "this

99
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,080
voltage Early is of the order
of a hundred volts "

100
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,480
you take the voltage Ut,
the voltage Ut is called the

101
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,230
thermodynamic voltage,
and this tension then is 26 mV

102
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,140
at room temperature and
you have the β of the transistor.

103
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,000
So be aware that this is proportional
to the device, the

104
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,220
component that you have.

105
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,550
The β is by fabrication
that you get it, it's

106
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,250
the manufacturer who has
given you the β.

107
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,090
The thermodynamic voltage
is the laws of physics

108
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,400
So that's 26 mV. This you have it
by the manufacturer too.

109
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,920
And look at this relationship.

110
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,640
This relationship shows you
there are three laws or rather

111
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,660
three magnitudes and these
three magnitudes are don't depend

112
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,150
at all on your design it is Ut, 26 mV.

113
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,010
Sure, if you have a β equal
to 100 or 200, you

114
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,200
have 100 to 200 times this Ut,
so this term is more

115
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,700
bigger than this, and if you
take the voltage Early that

116
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,240
is about one hundred volts,
you will see that

117
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,013
26 mV.100 is significantly
less than a hundred volts.

118
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,950
Now if you normalize all these

119
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,170
to IC0, IC0, IC0 you find
what we saw here.

120
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,933
So the voltage Va / IC0
is nothing that1 / Gce.

121
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,866
The β value Ut / IC0
is nothing more than 1 / GbE

122
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,240
and Ut / IC0 is nothing more than 1 / Gm.

123
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,370
And that's it you have this relationship.

124
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,090
So it is clear that in this small signal

125
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,880
signals diagram, if you determine IC0

126
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,380
from this diagram, that's it,
all the rest you can get them.

127
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,760
So the ultimate aim is to polarize, to take

128
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,730
the value and it is upon you to do so
it's up to you to impose

129
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,850
the IC0 value. But once you have this IC0

130
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,213
you have the Gm which is known,
the GbE is known, and

131
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:56,350
Gcu is known because
the manufacturer gave

132
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,910
the β and the Va, and you have the Ut.

133
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,430
So if you look at this diagram
then all these values

134
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,720
are absolutely known.
So you take this model, you

135
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,120
put it in place in the global diagram
of your

136
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,453
circuit and you will solve a

137
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,230
linear system as you learned
in the basic lessons

138
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,453
how to simplify or calculate a linear system.

139
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,630
Then you were taught to do the next thing.

140
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,800
You were told "if you have
a linear system that you

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,906
put in a box, you call it a quadruple  ".

142
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,346
A quadruple is

143
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,290
a black box, you have an input voltage and

144
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,880
an input current, an output voltage
and an output current.

145
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,040
And you were told
"your black box, when you

146
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,330
apply a voltage to it at the input, it will

147
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,010
transform it into a voltage
at the output, similar to the

148
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,350
current versus output current and you will

149
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,770
connect yourself your charge
and you will connect

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,220
your own source.
"If your source is a real source,

151
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,590
it means that your source has a value of

152
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,510
an ideal source, and there
is a defect due to a

153
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,140
series resistance, it depends
on your source so there

154
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,000
is a series resistor with it.
And you were told that

155
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,680
this same box, it can remain
the same, but when you

156
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,380
take it, you can see the source, you can

157
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,413
transform it to
its Thevenin-Norton equivalent.

158
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,640
So a series of voltage source
with a resistor

159
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,850
may be presented by a current source

160
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,660
in parallel with a resistor.
If someone gives you

161
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,180
a closed box and tells you
"look at the entrance of

162
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,540
your closed box,
you have an equivalent resistance. "

163
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,850
If this resistance is known,
this is it, you can

164
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,000
absolutely know D1 and I1
and what happens if a

165
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:52,200
current passes through your resistor,
you can calculate

166
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,293
the voltage drop in it.

167
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,000
Like, if you know the Rl charge
and someone tells you

168
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,860
"there is a resistance
that would be put in

169
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,910
parallel ", called the output resistance,

170
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,920
you have quite the ability to say
"Rl will be

171
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,000
parallel to the internal resistance
that is here "

172
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,720
same on the other side. And this

173
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,280
Thevenin-Norton conversion helps
to simplify the circuit and

174
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,280
see it according to what
we put as the source type.

175
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,560
Now consider the same vision
and go a little

176
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:25,680
into practice to understand
what that means.

177
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,120
If your closed box is an amplifier,
we will take the example

178
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,026
of an audio amp,
and if the load is a speaker,

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,870
what you have here so it means that you have

180
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,660
a voltage amplifier.

181
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,160
Here you have a source.

182
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,000
If that source is a cable
that brings an audio signal

183
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,000
and this audio signal is generated
from a microphone or

184
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,800
a digital file with analog output

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,380
from an mp4 or mp3 code, what you want, so

186
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,110
you have a signal here is going to arrive,
the input resistance

187
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,460
this is where there is a plug that is here.

188
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,660
When you connect your microphone,
your source what

189
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,500
will this microphone show? It will show
the input resistance,

190
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,520
one that appears here.
So anything that is like

191
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,030
electronic inside come down
to the input resistor.

192
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,540
Same here you have
this speaker that would come with

193
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,640
an output resistor.
We can take another example here.

194
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,850
When you transmit from
an infrared transmitter,

195
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,700
it will send a light in
the infrared band and here

196
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:38,850
you have what is called
a transresistance, we'll see

197
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,250
later, that is, the light will be

198
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,120
converted with a diode into a current.

199
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,653
So you have here a current I1.

200
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,400
This current I1, you put
a transistor circuit

201
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,890
that is a quadruple, that's it,
at the output you can read

202
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,880
the data that is sent in coded light,

203
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,890
converted into a current to
an output current and this

204
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,080
output current sent to
a resistor, becomes a voltage .

205
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,020
So it's up to you if you want to take a

206
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,000
voltage,  convert it to voltage
and we talk of voltage gain,

207
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,730
if you have a current you want

208
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,630
to convert voltage or current,
and we will talk here

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,640
of a current input, a current output, a

210
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,186
current input, voltage output.

211
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:26,730
Or the same, we can put
a voltage input , a current output .

212
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,600
So all these are conversions
which we know how to do

213
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,740
very well because there is Ohm's law that

214
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,320
facilitates the transition
from one to another.

215
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,000
Our quadruple that we see here and we said

216
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,630
it comes down to the input
by an input resistor and

217
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,000
at the output by an output resistor,
the relationship

218
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,720
that describes the input resistance
defined like this: if

219
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,370
you want to calculate
the input resistance

220
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,670
that appears here or measure
this input resistance, you have

221
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,600
to create a relationship between V1 / I1.

222
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,130
But to properly measure Rin,
you must keep your charge.

223
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,360
So if there is an audio amp,
you must keep the

224
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,250
speaker connected,
if the speaker is connected,

225
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,670
your speaker keeps its impedance,
everything will depend

226
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,060
on what is inside, because sometimes the

227
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,010
speaker can affect the input resistance.

228
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,650
So when you put that and we say
"with RI", it means

229
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,000
your quadruple,
you must keep your resistor

230
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,280
at the output when you measure
the ratio between V1 and I1,

231
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,740
that's the definition
of the input resistance.

232
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,570
The output resistance,
it is set to a source

233
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,270
zero, so you remember a while ago,
we had

234
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,490
a voltage source which
supplied our signal

235
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,226
to our amplifier.

236
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,130
Here when we say the source,
it should be canceled,

237
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,946
it is as if you are going
to erase this source,

238
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,026
So it's like this.

239
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,330
In other words, you are not
at all in the process of implementing

240
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,310
an increase, so if you have
connected a microphone,

241
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,020
you must do everything not
to make noise,

242
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,710
not to generate an AC signal at the input.

243
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,100
So the source is equal to 0,
that is, there is no

244
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,050
AC voltage source, but you should
keep your microphone

245
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,930
connected, that's what requires
the fact that the internal resistance

246
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,390
of your microphone should
be plugged in, but you

247
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,410
must not increase
or rather apply a sound source

248
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,900
for your microphone to generate
an AC signal and affect

249
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,900
the output, so it cancels the source,
but we keep the source

250
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,020
connected so the input impedance
of the source, if

251
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,530
ever the output resistance
depends on the input resistance,

252
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,173
we would see it in the expression
that appears in place of Rout.

253
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,480
So after we'll have Rin, we will have Rout,
and here we know

254
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,000
exactly what the impedances are
at the input and

255
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,693
output of such a quadruple.

256
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,390
So this concept is a basic concept that we

257
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,820
all know, and with that,
we will go further to

258
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,860
see how we put
a transistor diagram inside

259
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:18,370
and how are we going to use it.

260
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,880
If you take the quadruple, you can

261
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,220
break it into different types
depending on what you want

262
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,226
make of your quadruple.

263
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,290
If you take the earlier example when I

264
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,600
gave the example of the
audio amplifier, I said there

265
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,200
is a voltage V1 and a voltage V2,
I also said "I would like

266
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,000
to take V1, multiplied by
a gain and send it back

267
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,800
on a speaker. "You remember,
when it's about

268
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,670
an audio amp,
so it is a voltage amplifier.

269
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,620
A voltage amplifier is an amplifier that

270
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,410
takes power and multiplies
it by a gain, so it is

271
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,660
very convenient to present
a voltage amp like this.

272
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,500
The input resistance,
which we had already set,

273
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,240
the output resistance we had
already defined are not here.

274
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,820
Now I take a controlled
voltage source, the

275
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,780
V1 voltage I see here,
it is multiplied by a voltage gain.

276
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,000
So it is with that you use
to increse or reduce

277
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,410
the volume of your amp,
so you are increasing

278
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,740
or lowering the gain of your amp,
and this is a

279
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,190
way to represent
a voltage amplifier quite

280
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,250
adequate for voltage amplification.

281
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,370
So if you remove the resistor R,
that is to say,

282
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,000
you look at it it's empty, we remove this,

283
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,650
So I remove all this it's empty, then the

284
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,590
output resistor does not affect it at all,
there is no more

285
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,480
current flowing here,that is,
the voltage V2 is

286
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,610
what I see here, it is called
the open circuit voltage.

287
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,500
Now I take another way to present, you

288
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,450
see what we have here,
a voltage source in series

289
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,000
with a resistor,
I can well replace it with a

290
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,260
current source in parallel
with a resistor, so

291
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,040
this Thevenin-Norton transformation,
this duality exists.

292
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,590
So I can take it and
use it like this, it's

293
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,370
a current amplifier .

294
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:20,200
I would like to take the current
I1 I generated with

295
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,580
a current source which
is not ideal, with a

296
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,240
parallel resistor with the source, I1, I

297
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:30,000
multiply it by a gain,
then I'm interested in what

298
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,480
we call the current amplifier.

299
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,910
We'll see it later,
we will see later we will

300
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,400
make voltage follower in whic
the gain  V2 is equal to

301
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,490
V1, but I take I1 and
multiply it by a gain, and

302
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,790
i refer it to the output,
i transform it into another

303
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
current which is much larger,
and I call

304
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,070
it current amplifier.

305
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,740
So it is more convenient
to use a controlled current source

306
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,550
that describes that
the current I1 is multiplied by

307
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,910
a gain which I call Ai that
I find at the output

308
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,620
affected by the output resistor.

309
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,000
So this resistance is always
the one that was determined before.

310
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,280
So looking at the behavior of this view,

311
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,390
I see it with the voltage gain and

312
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,520
the current gain is
the equivalent diagrams

313
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,340
of a quadruple presented in
one way or another.

314
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,440
I speak of the open circuit
voltage gain is when my

315
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,260
resistor that I had connected
here has dissappeared, so that's

316
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,500
resistance, I'm make it disappear,
here I'm talking about

317
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:38,610
the open voltage gain,
it is when RI is equal to infinity,

318
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,800
which is the case now.

319
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,280
Here, when I look for a current amplifier,

320
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,710
what I call the short circuited
output current gain,

321
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,930
it means I take the output and I

322
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,940
create a short circuit,
so i put zero resistance

323
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,820
in parallel with RI and
I will cancel RI and  Rout.

324
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:04,213
So you see your current source I2
is equal to Ai0

325
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:07,640
multiplied by I1,
that means the current that is

326
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,750
generated by your current source
here is the current

327
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:12,920
you see in the short circuit, it's how we

328
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,480
could measure this current source.

329
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,230
So when you talk about
open circuit voltage gain, you

330
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,850
remove the charge, you end up
with the voltage V2

331
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,520
that is generated by it,
is equal to this voltage source,

332
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,810
your Rout does not affect it,
likewise when you look at the

333
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,400
short circuited output current gain,
Rout and Rl will

334
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,400
disappear and you will end up with only

335
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,820
Ai0, that you'll measure, so you find

336
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,530
directly your gain which is
the ratio of this short circuit current

337
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,100
divided by this input current.

338
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,790
Now if you do not do that, but you charge

339
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,470
your circuit, that is, you return to

340
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,730
this situation, you put
back RI and put RI here.

341
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,780
There you have a resistive voltage
divider, so your

342
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,250
divider, you have a voltage
source which sees two

343
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,930
resistors Rout and Rl.

344
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,750
So it's as if you took
the voltage gain that

345
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,180
we have here,
and you multiply it by two, the

346
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,440
division ratio RI divided
by the sum of the two,

347
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,460
as noted here, and it allows you
to immediately see

348
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,850
the gain V2 / V1, called voltage gain

349
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,110
with charge.

350
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,910
Same when you add here
Rl in parallel with Rout,

351
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,290
that's it, you take this here

352
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,290
and you have to multiply it
by the current divisor

353
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,310
which is formed by
RI in parallel with Rout.

354
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,130
And now two terms for two configurations.

355
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,520
A configuration called transconductance

356
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,706
and another called trans-resistance.

357
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,186
Transconductance means, you put V1 here

358
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,500
you want to convert V1 into a current that is

359
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,210
equal to the transconductance
multiplied by this voltage,

360
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,000
So we want to convert
voltage to current , look it is

361
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,630
a controlled current source here,
controlled by what?

362
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,413
By voltage.

363
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,910
We call it transresistance,you took a

364
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,680
current at the input and turned it into a

365
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,890
controlled voltage source  by the current.

366
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,070
That's each variation of
this current changes

367
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,890
into a voltage which is equal
to this value that you'll

368
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,460
have to calculate, called transresistance,
Rm0 which multiplies this.

369
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,386
Same here, each change in voltage
is multiplied by this Gm.

370
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:46,510
What we will overuse later in

371
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,910
this course is this diagram here,
and you will see that

372
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,880
the transconductance diagram
is indeed the electronic component

373
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,100
we made with the transistor.

374
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,810
The transistor itself is
a transconductance,

375
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,400
we said that already, we will repeat it.

376
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,190
It'll take your voltage and convert
it into a current, that's it.

377
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,730
So if you measure in short circuit
the output, if you

378
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,280
take the transconductance
and you want to see if

379
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,750
we have current here,
if you pass it through

380
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,653
a short circuit, this current here,
is exactly the gm0 V1,

381
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:25,510
V1 which is a current and it's called

382
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,790
transconductance, you are absolutely

383
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,440
measuring the transistor effect
by the Gm of the transistor.

384
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,540
If now, you look at what will happen with

385
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,260
your Gm when you remove
the short-circuit that I just

386
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,740
added, and you put your charge,
you just need

387
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,490
to multiply it by the ratio of these
two resistors that we added.

388
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,690
Same in a transresistance,

389
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,000
we first begin by eliminating Rl
therefore it is removed,

390
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,940
we make it infinite, and
here we are watching the

391
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,620
voltage here, which is equal to this here.

392
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,010
And the transresistance
with a charged output, i connect

393
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,020
the resistor and there
are two resistors which form a

394
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,380
resistive divider and
the divider here, you simply

395
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,630
need to calculate V2
considering Rl resistance ratios

396
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,190
divided by the sum of both.

397
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,890
So I repeat, this is the diagram
in which we will all

398
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,600
come back to all the time,
and it is with that we will learn

399
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,330
how to take our
small signal configurations and

400
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,710
convert it into an equivalent diagram
of this, and you

401
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:32,266
will see, it will always pass
by calculating Rin, Rout and gm0.

402
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,820
I will summarize what we just saw.

403
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,560
We showed that the ultimate goal is to

404
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,320
generate the equivalent of
what is called a quadruple.

405
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,400
In this quadrupole, we would l
ike to see something

406
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,430
that looks like a Rin,
Rout and a source of

407
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,000
open controlled current,
we have gm0 which multiplies the

408
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,590
voltage and converts it into a current,
that is the

409
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,250
vision we would like
to have every time we have a

410
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,140
transistor with a symbol,
which we converted

411
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,550
a transistor into
a small signals diagram, we placed it in

412
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,800
a circuit, you will see immediately what

413
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
follows thissmall signals model
of our transistor, it

414
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,480
will enable us to calculate
Rin, Rout and lGm0.

415
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:25,810
So we begin by calculating
these three parameters.

416
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,200
Once we have that, we qualified
our quadruple, we

417
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,110
take our quadruple and place
it with a source and a charge.

418
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,510
We can calculate the charge gain,
the ratio V2 / V1,

419
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,470
which is always equal to Gm
times the output resistance,

420
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:49,080
and that once you have connected
an external resistor

421
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,170
Rl, just put Rl parallel with Rout and

422
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,310
imagine that you have
a current going through

423
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,630
the parallel setting of the two,
look at this, you have Rout and Rl

424
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,130
in parallel, and you have a current source

425
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,813
that begins in these two resistors,
the equivalent resistance is this

426
00:25:08,946 --> 00:25:14,560
and the gm0 is the short-circuit
transconductance you'll find here.

427
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,860
You will find expressions in which it will

428
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,910
have settings that are here.

429
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,280
You will find Gm, GbE, Gce
or 1 / Gm, 1 / GbE, 1 / Gce

430
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,540
and inevitably, you remember
we have always done

431
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,050
approximations that allow us to say

432
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,730
the least is Gce and
will become increasingly large

433
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,580
until we get to the Gm
or the inverse, 1 / Gm is

434
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,520
the smallest after 1 / GbE,
and then after 1 / Gce

435
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,690
which becomes the largest.
And finally, at the end of

436
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:50,050
this week we will make a summary of what

437
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,520
we'll later call small signal configurations

438
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,310
with basic editing,
and you will see, we will have

439
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,500
a very synthetic vision,
we can even fit it in

440
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,440
a table that will show us
that with three base set ups,

441
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,200
we get to solve everything
in linear circuits,

442
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,670
and this is the goal of the end of this

443
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,620
chapter or the end of what
we are seeing in

444
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,813
the series of videos
we are watching this week.
