1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,190
We have already seen that this
is a common transmitter setup,

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,080
common collector common base.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,380
We analyzed small signals
diagrams where were extracted,

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,910
from the transistor itself
by replacing it

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,533
with is model, a vision in quadripole form.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,500
We now understood that
the quadripole is the

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,150
way which simplifies the calculation
of a whole circuit

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,490
because we have to look only
at what is there as input impedance,

9
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:34,250
output impedance, and see
what is the trance conductance.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,540
With this, we directly have
the gain in voltage or

11
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:38,860
in current or anything you wish.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,900
Now, at the end of this week we will

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,240
just make a summary of
the three setups and see that

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,040
we can have a very synthetic view.

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,830
Once we finished this,
we will do a small example

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,720
to show how an electronic circuit is built

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,850
when you have the three basic setups.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,810
To start, here is a summary of
all that we have seen this week.

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,740
You have three setups, common

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,700
transmitter, common base
and common collector.

21
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,850
On this sheet, we can see
the three things we

22
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,350
extracted during the first
two sections of this chapter.

23
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,760
You look at the input resistance.

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,780
There's the common transmitter
input resistor, common base

25
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,910
and common collector,
same for the output resistance,

26
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,800
also the transconductance.

27
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:45,950
Then I added a column where
you can see what is the voltage gain

28
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,350
of the three setups.

29
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,530
I will summarize what is
on these three columns.

30
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,640
You see, it is extremely easy
to understand the usefulness

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,880
of each of these setups.

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,700
The most important thing
is to remember the following things,

33
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,880
you have the input resistance.

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,790
The input resistor in
a common transmitter setup,

35
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,440
I noted below, this is
an average value, so it is

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,200
neither great nor small.
What is average, what

37
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:13,870
is great, what is small?

38
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,053
We'll see later when I start to recall

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,130
the numerical example we saw earlier.

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,310
You have an input impedance
of a common transmitter setup

41
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,733
that is 1 / GbE and
the output impedance, 1 / Gce.

42
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,300
For a common base setup,
the input impedance that

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,400
will see just now,
will be proportional to

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,190
what will happen
with the charge resistance.

45
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,650
Same for the common base,
we'll see that the output impedance,

46
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,700
when you look from here,
the impedance of

47
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,610
the source will strongly influence
what is going to happen

48
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,000
with this output impedance.

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,000
The common transmitter
will show us something

50
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,000
that depends on what
you put as the charge resistance

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,000
on the exit of the common collector.

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,330
You will see that the β
of the transistor is

53
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,050
a very important parameter
because it will multiply this resistance.

54
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,870
The common collector shows
at its output an output impedance

55
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,080
which is 1 / Gm plus
something which depends on the

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,240
source resistance.

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,546
I remind you what is a resistance source.

58
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,000
The resistance of a source
is that you'll connect

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,010
at the input to a voltage source
that supplies your

60
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,230
quadripole and which
can be a series resistance.

61
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,930
If this series resistance is large or small,

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,140
it will be reduced or divided
by the β of the transistor.

63
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,320
I would like to comment on what will
appear on the column transconductance.

64
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,410
In fact, when we look at this

65
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,000
transconductance column,
we will see that all the time

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,750
only open  transconductance,
which is when the transistor is

67
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,270
not charged or the quadripole
is not charged, there is

68
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,410
no Rl resistor, Rl=0 if

69
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,320
we consider it current source at
the output.

70
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,230
You will see the gm0
of the transistor, this is

71
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,870
your transconductance transistor.

72
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,820
See, in the case of
a common transmitter setup,

73
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,420
the short-circuit transconductance,
when you

74
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,370
short-circuit Rl replacing it
with an Rl equal 0,

75
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,920
you find that for the common
transmitter, the gm0 equals Gm.

76
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,320
For the common base,
there's just one less front.

77
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:35,930
For the common collector
is as common transmitter.

78
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,826
This is of the order of magnitude of -gm.

79
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:40,050
This column, there is no surprise.

80
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,220
It is simply positive when
it is a common transmitter

81
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,660
and it is negative and negative.

82
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,140
It is always the same value
which is the transconductance

83
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,390
of the transistor itself.
As I added an additional column

84
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,370
that describes the gain, we call it

85
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,340
an intrinsic setup gain
this is when your resistance is infinite.

86
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,960
It is when the resistance RI,
that you charge your

87
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,740
setup with, you remove it completely,
it is equal to infinity.

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,680
This resistor RI does not exist.

89
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,106
At this moment, we have
what is called an intrinsic gain.

90
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,370
If the transistor does
not have an effect early, if

91
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,020
really it is an ideal
current source and the

92
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,560
Gce, which is the output conductance
which is due to this

93
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,460
Early effect, which is IC0 divided
by the voltage Va which is

94
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,200
the early effect at this moment,
the gain of your

95
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,660
transistor would be absolutely
intrinsic to the transistor

96
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,506
because it's the transconductance ratio

97
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,800
of the device itself, of the component
itself divided by the

98
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,190
output conductance
or multiplied by the resistance of

99
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,320
the internal output transistor.

100
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,820
If this Gce is 0, the gain is small.

101
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,280
If there has been
no output conductance, at this

102
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,020
point you can say that
your amplifier has a tiny gain.

103
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,680
Unfortunately, there is
an early effect which imposes a Gce.

104
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,130
Same here. In the common
transmitter setup

105
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,470
and common base,
the gain is exactly the same.

106
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,213
It is GmRl / 1 + Gce.Rl.

107
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:26,660
It's the same here.
The intrinsic gain is once again

108
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,930
negative for the common transmitter
and once positive for the common base.

109
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,520
In both cases, you get a voltage gain.

110
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,880
So it is a voltage amplifier because

111
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,290
it takes an input voltage,
it multiplied by a

112
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,000
certain gain which is equal
to Gm.Rl, if the resistor RI

113
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,110
you have connected here
is well below 1 / Gce.

114
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,700
At this point, you can
ignore this and you can

115
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,050
neglect this, and you find
yourself with a gain

116
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,560
equal in the common transmitter setup

117
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,760
-Gl.Rl, And the common base, + Gl.Rl.

118
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,120
When you have a setup of
the type common collector,

119
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,740
your gain is simply equal to 1.

120
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,300
This is a voltage follower.

121
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,460
This sheet will help you to understand

122
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,550
the behavior of your setup when

123
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,690
you replace it with a quadripole,
which in this

124
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,380
quadripole, it becomes simply
the represented entry

125
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,080
by a resistor R in and the output,

126
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,020
either a voltage source
or current source, but

127
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,620
as we said generally we use
a controlled current source,

128
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,110
you have at the output an output
resistance

129
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,410
R out, and like this,
when you know it is a

130
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,440
common transmitter or common base
or common collector,

131
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,660
all you have to do is to
take the equivalent

132
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,270
of your quadrupole, copy the value

133
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,320
inside and to put it in R out, R in,
put it with the numerical values.

134
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,570
You replace the entire setup
by an equivalent of this

135
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,240
style which is an equivalent
quadripole of each of these

136
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:11,570
setups with the values ​​found in the columns.

137
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,350
Now consider a numerical example.

138
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,000
I think now, with what you see in this

139
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,450
sheet,
you'll quickly understand what i mean

140
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,420
by one average input impedance,
a high input impedance

141
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,220
high or a high output impedance.

142
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,860
If you look at the three setups
and you say what

143
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,160
happens if I polarizes with the same
current the three setups.

144
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,330
I chose the same transistor.

145
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,870
This means the same transistor.

146
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,810
You have the same β and
the same voltage early you

147
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,050
used to make a common transmitter,
a common base

148
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,570
and a common collector.

149
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,030
You load all three setups
with the same resistance,

150
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,493
an output resistor end  Rl = 1 kΩ.

151
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,530
You have a source that will
supply the input of your

152
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,680
quadripole with an internal
resistance of 50 ohms.

153
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,653
We have three quadripoles.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,470
The first realized with a common
transmitter, the second

155
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,270
a common base,
third, a common collector.

156
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,060
We polarize the three setups
with the same current.

157
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,573
I will calculate each box here
and calculate R in, R out and gm0.

158
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:32,550
Here, you look at what happens here

159
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,320
because it will absolutely
give you a clear idea, it

160
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,660
will set you ideas
on what it means the use

161
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,800
of setups and the magnitude of these

162
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,700
input resistors, terminating resistors.

163
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,300
To begin and before going
too far in the calculation

164
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,580
or even comment on all this,
know that as Gm, it is

165
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:57,680
the same for the three setups.

166
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,490
I note for the three setups of the Gm

167
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,133
of the transistor is equal to IC0 / Ut.

168
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,080
IC0 is given. Ut is
the thermodynamic potential.

169
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:14,853
You have a value that is equal to 38.46.

170
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,020
We can write this column
it right away because it is

171
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,940
the same for the three setups.

172
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,160
The gm0 is 38.46.

173
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:28,180
The only thing that will
make a difference, I am

174
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,290
on this column, so my Gm

175
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,290
has no negative sign before.

176
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,750
However, for the common base,
I have to keep the negative signs.

177
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,910
To the common emitter,
there is a negative sign.

178
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,540
I'll start looking at
the input impedances

179
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,090
of each of these setups.
Let's start with the input impedance

180
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,840
of a common transmitter set.

181
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,400
Its input impedance is 1 / GbE.

182
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,000
Simply calculate the 1 / GbE
with these values ​​and

183
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,120
you will fall on  2.6 kΩ.

184
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,880
This is what I call a medium resistance.

185
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,720
It is neither large nor small,
compared to 100 kW.

186
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,940
The same setup,
if you look at it the exit,

187
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,910
since its collector, you'll see
that the impedance or

188
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,813
output resistance is equal to 100 kΩ.

189
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,210
We see that I called it
the average input resistance.

190
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,380
There, I qualified it as
a high output resistance.

191
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,550
I look at the common base.

192
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,786
The input impedance
and input resistance is 26 Ω.

193
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,170
This input impedance is of the order of

194
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,110
magnitude of 1 / Gm, is equal to 26 Ω.

195
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,893
That's low. This is the lowest value
of the three setups.

196
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,270
When I look at an input impedance here,

197
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,380
here and here, I find that
when I use a common base setup

198
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,260
and look from the input,

199
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,760
I still have an RI output resistance
that is equal

200
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,050
to a given value of 1 kΩ, which

201
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,413
will be multiplied by the inverse of
the intrinsic gain, so the inverse of Gm / Gce.

202
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,466
It is a very small term.

203
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,546
It gives you something you can
approximate.

204
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:25,040
This you neglect in relation to this.

205
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,293
You find that it is 1 / Gm
parallel to 1 / G2.

206
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,090
Given that 1 / Gm is very,
very low, it will stretch towards

207
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,693
1 / Gm with respect to 1 / GbE.
In this setup, the 1 / Gm is 26 Ω.

208
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,506
1 / GbE, is what we just calculated
here are 2.6 kΩ.

209
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,720
This in parallel with this, it is

210
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,580
of course this that will prevail
and that's what we will be left with.

211
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,690
Therefore a common base input
impedance is of the order

212
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,300
of magnitude of 26 Ω.

213
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:54,630
I qualified it as low.

214
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,660
The output impedance  or
the output resistance in this case,

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,690
depends on Rs.
Le Rs in this example is 50 Ω.

216
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,300
If you calculate, you come across
an output  resistor

217
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,000
of the order of magnitude of 292 kΩ,

218
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,093
about the order of magnitude of 300 kΩ.

219
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,580
This is more than what I get
with a common transmitter

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,740
although the gain remains the same.

221
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,000
One has a minus sign, and a

222
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,520
another has a plus sign.

223
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,400
I speak of Gm. When I look
at it in terms of gain, it

224
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,000
will give me once a negative gain
and once a positive gain.

225
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,350
This means that if you bring
a signal to the input

226
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:48,106
of a common transmitter,
it will get you the opposite output.

227
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,900
If it is a sinusoidal voltage, you

228
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,426
end up with a 180 degree phase shift.

229
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,946
however, in a common  base setup,

230
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:01,200
input and output are in phase.

231
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,390
The absolute value of
the gain remains the same.

232
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,630
It was found that
the common base setup has a

233
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,030
low input impedance and
a relatively high output impedance.

234
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,790
This output impedance
could really become very,

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,650
very great because it is dependent,
it is related to the resistance Rs.

236
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,240
If by chance, instead of having
50 Ω of source resistance,

237
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,760
you put something that gives you an

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,560
input impedance or
input resistance of the order

239
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,090
of megohms, know that
this value will explode.

240
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,120
Since this value is what
determines the vacuum gain,

241
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,430
when we don't charge with an output
resistance

242
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,780
you make gains with a common base setup

243
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,080
which can be extreme, provided that the

244
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,550
source resistance is very high.

245
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,760
We will use this feature later.

246
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,900
Let us analyze the common collector setup.

247
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,450
The input resistance is high.

248
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,380
It's a hundred kΩ.

249
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,790
This is the highest of the three.

250
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,950
The output resistance is
the weakest of the three.

251
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,640
The gm0 is the same.

252
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,560
When you calculate it with
a resistance the R out  = 26 Ω,

253
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,200
you will see that you will have
a gain of the order

254
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,450
of magnitude of 1.
So the voltage gain is 1.

255
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,180
It means that the input voltage
is equal to the output voltage.

256
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,220
There is no phase inversion
because this is equal to +1.

257
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,090
What is the benefit of using it?

258
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,230
The benefit of using it,
it is this very high impedance

259
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,440
at the input.
Imagine plugging something

260
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,213
here that will have a hundred kΩ.

261
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,830
What you plug here,
it will draw a current in

262
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,770
your quadripole proportional
to this resistance, so

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,670
virtually little current.

264
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,800
But at the output, you have
an extremely low output impedance.

265
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,870
This setup is the equivalent
of what we studied in

266
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,070
electronics 1, we called it
the voltage amplifier follower,

267
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,466
where we had a similar
setup of this style.

268
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,900
We said if you take
an operational amplifier,

269
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,400
you plug it the follower,
the current flowing here

270
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,120
is almost zero, and the current
coming out of here, it's a

271
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,610
current that comes from
the supply voltages, which

272
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,370
is high despite the voltage
here and here being the same.

273
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,260
A common collector type
of setup is used to

274
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,420
to make a buffer or a setup pad that we

275
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,570
copy the input voltage to ù
the output and we provide

276
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,050
a current much higher compared to that

277
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,410
which we are drawing from the base.

278
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,350
Analyze this input impedance in

279
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,010
this common collector column.

280
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:12,000
We see that it is 1 / GbE + B.Rl.

281
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,830
There are ways to make
an input impedance, very

282
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,620
high if your Rl resistance is very high.

283
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,280
If you increase either the RI
or the β of the transistor,

284
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,450
you will have a R in that is going
to be very, very big.

285
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,300
You will see later, we will exploit this

286
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,520
feature to just get to make

287
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,000
extremely high input impedances
by choosing

288
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,210
transistors with high β or make a

289
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,890
setup that we will call
Darlington in which

290
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,240
we use two transistors to boost
or increase the value of β.

291
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,910
Otherwise, it is possible
to replace the resistor RI by

292
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,070
infinity, an infinite resistance,
RI = ∞, when,

293
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,850
in the place of your resistor,
you put a current source.

294
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,950
It is an infinite resistance.

295
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,580
It's as if you did not have Rl, but you

296
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,960
replaced it by an open circuit.

297
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:14,620
RI becomes equal to infinity,
R in equals infinity.

298
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:19,946
The value you see as R in will be very high.

299
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,030
You fall in this situation.

300
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,826
There is virtually no current entering.

301
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:25,810
One can draw a lot of current at the output.

302
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,030
What we'll do with all this, every time we

303
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,380
need an average resistance
at the input, we use this setup.

304
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,720
If you need a very low resistance
at the input,

305
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,920
we use this setup. If we want
to have a very high resistance,

306
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,740
we use this setup.

307
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,510
Same for the output resistance.

308
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,010
But, given that we have linear circuits,

309
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,150
we can align quadripoles,
we said each one

310
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,370
behave as a quadripole,
so we'll have fun,

311
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,380
later to put quadripole
which follow each other.

312
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,940
If you take for example
a quadripole which has a

313
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,000
common transmitter and you
follow it with a

314
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,760
quadripole which has
a common base, look at what you get.

315
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,200
You get an input impedance
of this magnitude.

316
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,000
You get an output impedance of this order.

317
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,150
We said a common base
when there will be a

318
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,146
impedance before the common
base source, it becomes this setup.

319
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,280
If your output impedance is very

320
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,330
high, the common base will give
you very, very high

321
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,780
impedance R out.

322
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,250
We will do it as an example,
at the end of this video.

323
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,450
You will see we make gains

324
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,200
in extreme voltage with low
impedance at the input

325
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,226
and a very high output impedance,
which will be the common basis.

326
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,400
If we take a common collector and place

327
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,760
it behind, we can drop the output impedance.

328
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:56,190
We make with this something
that is not far from an

329
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,820
operational amplifier, but you will have
the opportunity to see all this.

330
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,590
Now consider the same table and try to say,

331
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,900
in spoken language, in French,
the utility of each.

332
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,750
If I talk of a common transmitter setup,
I can

333
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,373
say with no difficulties that
it is a transconductance amplifier.

334
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,420
This is an amplifier whose input
is a voltage and

335
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,400
whose output is a current.

336
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,680
If I want to take a voltage
to the input, make

337
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,250
it change, take a current
at the output, converting it to

338
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,080
voltage across a resistor,
I only have to take an

339
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,680
amp transconductance. This is perfect
common transmitter setup.

340
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:43,050
It has a high output resistor

341
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,700
and an average input resistance.

342
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:46,660
This is what we just said.

343
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,560
We're  formulating it
in spoken language, French.

344
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,830
If I have to say the same
for the common base,

345
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:55,810
I write something.

346
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,146
You will understand it right away,
as soon as I have finished this part.

347
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,320
I'll show you what is a cascode.

348
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,870
The word cascode comes from
the fact called,

349
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,770
put in cascade a common transmitter setup

350
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:15,573
followed by a common base setup.

351
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,830
And putting the two in cascade, we called it

352
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,450
a cascode,
it is a word we inherited when we

353
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,690
used vacuum tubes before
transistors existed,

354
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,210
when we put in cascade two setups

355
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,380
resembling those two and
we inherited this word

356
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,840
called cascode.
And there's going to bring us to realize

357
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,720
output resistors that can be very high.

358
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,230
We manage to have
the biggest output resistors

359
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,090
a setup can do and it is typical what we

360
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,380
need  when we have power sources,
when we want

361
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,340
to make the current sources we use
by default

362
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,440
this cascade,
a common transmitter cascade,

363
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,320
common collector because
we want to make sources

364
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,230
with very high output impedance,

365
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,300
made by this setup,
while having an input resistor

366
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,220
a little low or medium which is
the common transmitter setup.

367
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,840
Then we have
the common collector setup to

368
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,200
qualify it, it is a voltage follower,
it is also called a transmitter follower.

369
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,740
It has a low output resistor

370
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,710
this is typical of what we need when we want

371
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,590
to make voltage outputs.

372
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,946
If you want a voltage source,

373
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,853
that is to say somewhere
that Rout resistance is almost zero.

374
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:41,510
Here you have a way to make it as low as

375
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,490
possible and it is made by stages

376
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,630
of the common collector style.

377
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,840
So if you put at the end of
your quadripole amplifier chain

378
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,220
setup of a  common collector style, it is

379
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:58,270
as if you are putting the lowest resistance

380
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,120
at the output and there you can draw the

381
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,573
current in your external charge without ...

382
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:11,100
So I can be very high, without having a

383
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,610
voltage drop on the internal
resistance which will be high.

384
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,270
And here, the input resistance here,
it could be very high.

385
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,333
Why could it be?

386
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,190
It depends on RI and β,
that we discussed earlier.

387
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,310
So just choose high βs.

388
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,720
I always take the same table
and i would like

389
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,800
to show it to you presented like this.

390
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,946
So if I have to synthesize
the three columns,

391
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,710
this column here does not serve
me much because it is

392
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,053
the same, with adifferent sign.

393
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:46,410
This column, I'll keep it.

394
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,730
What I keep here is that when I want to do a

395
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,040
voltage gain, the expression of a voltage gain

396
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,720
in absolute value, look at it, it is written here.

397
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,540
There it is written as -Gm.Rl so if I

398
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,610
approximate that Gce Rl and Gce

399
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:14,660
RI is negligible compared to 1,
because of Gce

400
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,160
that is very, very low,
I can immediately say that this

401
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:26,760
equals -Gm.Rl and it equals + Gm.Rl.

402
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:28,570
So when it comes to calculating

403
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:33,180
a gain of a transistor setup whose

404
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,640
output is charged by a low RI resistor

405
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,000
compared to Gce, i do not hesitate
a moment and write

406
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,780
the gain equal to Gm.Rl,
it's negative for a common transmitter,

407
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,730
positive for a common base.

408
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,800
And the third setup here, we learned that the

409
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,800
common collector is a voltage follower.

410
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,133
So this column we have chosen it.

411
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:58,120
This column then comes down
to this and this and 1.

412
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,000
So that's easy to remember.

413
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,480
We're left with this, this, this.

414
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,950
And there is a summary here.

415
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,626
And to make it very visible,
and the three setups at once,

416
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,680
we saw that the collector

417
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,080
of the transistor is an output.

418
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,950
The transistor transmitter is an exit.

419
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,020
The transistor base is an input
so you can enter

420
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,560
a transistor, one has just to vary

421
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,813
the voltage here and observe
what is happening with the current

422
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,070
and that is based on either
the common transmitter setup

423
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,550
where I vary base transmitter
or common base,

424
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,010
I therefore vary base transmitter
so we're in both cases,

425
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:47,893
varying these two voltages.

426
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,610
And here it is the supplement
base transmitter so it's

427
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,680
again varying base-transmitter in
the case of the common collector.

428
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,850
But when you look at it like that,
the output impedance

429
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,110
of a common base mounting, so I'm here,

430
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,150
what will it depend on?

431
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,950
It will depend on what we put
as resistance

432
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,520
of the source so it will depend
on what we put in its transmitter.

433
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,000
Look, we enter without the transmitter.

434
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,000
So if the resistance,
the output resistance

435
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:24,500
here, if the resistance Re is equal to 0
so you move here

436
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,260
to this column and
you will see that in the calculations

437
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,290
we made, detailed for the common base,
the resistance it

438
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,173
will be of the order of 1 / Gce.

439
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,000
If now the resistance
you put into the transmitter

440
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,640
of the transistor is very high,
it will tend towards β / Gce.

441
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:46,933
If I want to analyze the input
from the base, here or here.

442
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:53,546
In that example the transmitter
is earthed, it will show 1 / GbE + β.Re.

443
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,880
But here Re = 0. So I think
1 / GbE, it is drawn out

444
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,790
or it is written here.

445
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,260
Now i just watch what happens with

446
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,620
the common collector type setup.

447
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,773
I enter also in the base and
it will depend on what I put on Rl.

448
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:17,310
RI is the resistance
that is put into the transmitter

449
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,146
of the transistor, it is here.

450
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:23,650
So we see that when I look
from here, it is 1 / GbE

451
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,973
from the base c'est + β. the resistance
that i put in the transmitter,

452
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:28,706
is this that i see here.

453
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,770
So i see this expression
directly appear here.

454
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,410
So if you take this way of viewing
and you put

455
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,650
it before you, practically the table
here is no longer useful.

456
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,000
You have selected this column
and this column and what

457
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,580
is here it shows you what
is in these two columns.

458
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,800
So this image,
you also find it in the MOOC,

459
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,860
i will put it so that you can put it

460
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,490
before you, it is an excellent
summary of the different

461
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,390
input and output impedances
of this kind of setups.

462
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,410
To end this week we will analyze

463
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,130
what we'll see now with a real setup.

464
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,100
You remember, we took
the transistors and then

465
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,400
transformed it into an equivalent
diagram, a quadripole and here

466
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,430
i will use it, i will introduce the use

467
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,360
of a setup, called the cascode, i

468
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,150
talked about it earlier. If you are taking
a common transmitter setup,

469
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,730
this is a common transmitter setup,
the transmitter

470
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:35,720
is to ground. We enter between base
and transmitter, and

471
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,580
we output a currentin the collector.

472
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,200
I put  just behind the cascade

473
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,530
a common base setup.

474
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,270
Therefore the base is connected
to a fixed voltage,

475
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,160
I called it Vb0.

476
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,390
Remember that the common base notion,

477
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,350
is a  Small signal diagram,it is when the

478
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:06,320
base is found connected
to ground and the ground is

479
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,330
the derivative of DV / DI and as the

480
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,850
DV / DI is equal to 0
when one puts a voltage source,

481
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,340
as if you're connecting
the base to the earth.

482
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,920
So this is equivalent in an AC diagram,
if we make the AC equivalent

483
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,920
of our setup this is
an AC equivalent of our setup.

484
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,900
This AC diagram means wherever
i have voltage sources,

485
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,860
i replace them with a short circuit

486
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,640
to the ground and when i have
current sources i remove

487
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,000
them completely,
and that's what i see here.

488
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,850
Here i have two current sources
so i do not see them.

489
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,800
Here i have my transmitter of
my transistor  connected

490
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,830
to ground, i see it.

491
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,506
i enter the transmitter of
the transistor T2

492
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,700
and i replace the
Vb0 voltage source by a

493
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,390
short circuit connected to ground .

494
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,250
And there i have a common transmitter
and have a common base that

495
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,350
cascades and gives me this famous
cascode and we will analyze this.

496
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,870
What methods can we do to analyze it?

497
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,630
There is a simple method which we had

498
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,900
started the course with,
that is "the equivalent of a

499
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,920
transistor, if i take this transistor,
it would give

500
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,020
1 / GbE between base and

501
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,200
transmitter, a controlled current source

502
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,693
between collector and transmitter.

503
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,380
And the early effect
i modeled by 1 / Gce ".

504
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:50,386
So it gives me 1 / Gce here and
here i have a current Gm Vbe

505
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:59,700
and here I have 1 / GbE
as the input resistance.

506
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,260
This the base, this is the transmitter
and this is the

507
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,090
collector of my transistor and
this are the different

508
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,710
components of this transistor.
So if you take this

509
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,570
setup and then you want
to replace it here, you will

510
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,300
have taken it and placed it as it is.

511
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,070
If you now want to replace
the common base diagram

512
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,120
by the equivalent of this
you need to put the input

513
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,540
on the transmitter and you have
to put to put this knot to ground

514
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,690
and we output in the collector.

515
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,880
So we have to draw
the small signal diagram

516
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,030
of each of the transistors
and it would give us the following.

517
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:43,810
You get this diagram,
so this is the real diagram,

518
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:48,500
this is the model and
this is the replacement

519
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,470
of this transistor by its equivalent
circuit diagram and this transistor by

520
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:57,370
its equivalent circuit.
And there was a diagram which

521
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,120
we analyse by the theories of the circuit.

522
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,030
This is a linear circuit,
we has only to simplify

523
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,190
it to find what is the input
resistance, what

524
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,250
is the output resistance and
what is the gain V2 / V1 if

525
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,010
I would want to see this as a quadripole which

526
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,000
has an input V1, an output V2
and there is an intermediary voltage

527
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,330
between the two, that which
appears here, which

528
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:22,320
is between the two.

529
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,800
So i can spend my time doing this.

530
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,640
You'll do it in the form of an exercise.

531
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,050
This takes time, there is
a lot of calculations to do

532
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,520
and this is a calculation
that we have already introduced

533
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,030
how to turn this into a quadripole
and this into a quadripole.

534
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:43,050
And when you put the two
quadripoles together we have the

535
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,440
two quadripoles which will give
us an immediate calculation

536
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,000
and very simple because we already
calculated input impedances,

537
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,750
output impedances of each
of the quadripoles.

538
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,640
We only have to draw it
this way and that's how

539
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,800
henceforth we will address this.

540
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,140
You just need to move
from this diagram to this and

541
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,680
after remove each and put in place
what we had

542
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,670
studied in the preceding tables.

543
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,700
And here's the result.

544
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,930
A first quadripole is this,
it's a true copy

545
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,570
to what is in the table.

546
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:21,950
A common transmitter is a quadripole
which has its input

547
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,920
1 / GbE as input resistor,
an output resistor

548
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,066
of 1 / Gce and a short circuited
transconductance equal to Gm.

549
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,810
A common base is a quadrupole which has

550
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,620
an input resistance which is
approximately of the order of

551
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,830
1 / Gm, a controlled current source,
look what

552
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:50,146
Gm means in this direction and -Gm

553
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,340
So in this direction there were
two current directions

554
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,530
to qualify the quadrupole achieved
with a common base setup.

555
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,100
And here we see that the output
impedance is extremely

556
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,866
high and is β * (1 / Gce).

557
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,410
Why does it gives the extreme value (CRA)?

558
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,640
Because the impedance that is here,

559
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,013
of this setup, so this setup has
an output impedance of 1 / Gce.

560
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,700
And you remember in the table we said

561
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:28,320
if a common base setup encounters

562
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,780
a voltage applied with a resistance

563
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,220
source which is very high,
which is the case here because

564
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,500
we said that 1 / Gce is
a very high resistance

565
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,840
relative to the input impedance
seen here which is

566
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,373
1 / Gm, which is the lowest,
at this point the impedance

567
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:49,200
i see from here, if you look in the table

568
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,180
or on the drawing I made as a summary,
you

569
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:56,340
will see that this output impedance
is of the order

570
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,800
of magnitude  of β (1 / Gce)
of the transistor.

571
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:06,030
Can we may say that the Gm are the same?

572
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,906
Of course Gm are the same because
it is two

573
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,790
transistors in series,
they both have the same

574
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,920
current flowing through the base,
if we neglect

575
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,960
the base current it is the same
current going through

576
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:17,120
both so it's the same Gm.

577
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,000
Are we may say that
the early voltage is the same?

578
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,490
If you choose the same transistors,
you can

579
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,770
also say that the early voltages
are the same because

580
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,460
Gce that gives about the same thing

581
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,630
knowing that the Vce is
not probably the same for

582
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,010
both, but as a first
approximation we can say

583
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,400
even Gce of transistors are the same.

584
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,260
So when you look at it, and I tell you
"analyze this circuit."

585
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,480
You take the table, the famous
table we summarized,

586
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:54,040
you saw that gain here is known,
the input impedance,

587
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,746
the output impedance of each is known.

588
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,320
So let's do just one thing.

589
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,750
I look when I plugged the common base
behind

590
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:06,110
the common transmitter, it is as if
I put the input impedance

591
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,370
of the common base quadripole
in parallel with the output impedance

592
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,220
of the common transmitter quadripole .

593
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,020
So 1, the common base has
an input resistance

594
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,533
1 / Gm and the common transmitter
output resistance is 1 / Gce.

595
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,380
If you remember well,
this I can overlook it because

596
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,860
1 / Gce is a large resistance,
the 1 / Gm is a small resistance.

597
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:33,000
Therefore a large resistorin
parallel with a small

598
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,000
I only have to delete it.
I will be left with 1 / Gm.

599
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:42,220
So the common transmitter
is charged  by a resistor

600
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,600
charge  that is equal to 1 / Gm.

601
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:49,220
You have a Gm.V1 current source
that is charged by

602
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,950
a resistance which is equal to 1 / Gm.

603
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,920
What does it give you?

604
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:02,306
It gives you a gain of this circuit to V1 = -gm

605
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,170
times the resistance charges
a common transmitter.

606
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,910
And what is the RI resistor charge?

607
00:37:09,586 --> 00:37:15,280
This resistor of Rl charge
is nothing more than 1 / Gm.

608
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:18,270
It is the charge resistance.

609
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,270
The source sees nothing
other than 1 / Gm.

610
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:26,130
So you see the tension V'1 there,

611
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,190
compared to V1, so the gain
of this circuit is Gm. (1 / Gm)

612
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,000
therefore the gain is equal to -1.

613
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,880
You have a common transmitter,
which in this case,

614
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,460
does not give you gain,
it gives you a gain of -1.

615
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,740
You remember the gain
of a common base setup,

616
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,250
we saw that the gain of
a common base diagram,

617
00:37:50,213 --> 00:37:55,013
the gain here is equal to

618
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:02,373
the impedance or
the transconductance Gm is Gm +

619
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:07,000
multiplied by the output resistance
since  here i charged

620
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,430
by a current source so the resistance seen

621
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,770
here is equal to infinity.
So it becomes the intrinsic gain

622
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,500
of this setup, that is to say it is the Gm

623
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,340
multiplied by its output resistance R out.

624
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,370
And the output resistance is β.Gce2.

625
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,820
So this is the gain of the stage 2.

626
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,010
If you multiply this gain times
this gain it gives you

627
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,610
the gain of the set and immediately
we were able to calculate

628
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:39,546
that the overall gain is therefore
-1.GmR out so it is -GmR out.

629
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:42,860
This is the same as
a common transmitter,

630
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,290
put aside that the output impedance
we will calculate it because

631
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,060
R out, that you will see, is
the output impedance of a

632
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,350
common base which is
extremely high and that, that

633
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,440
will give us a very,
very high gain and it is one of

634
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,050
the advantages of this kind of setup
called the cascode.

635
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:08,146
I take the example with
a polarization of 1mA

636
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,690
and I use the same transistor for both.

637
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,350
I redo the same diagram as earlier and i draw

638
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,450
the output resistance of
the common transmitter that

639
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,870
comes in parallel with
the common base input resistance,

640
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,640
practically invisible to say
that it is this that dominates.

641
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,690
So that we redo the same calculation.

642
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,000
The ratio of  V'1 / V1 is

643
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,000
GmV1 / GmV1 that gives you -1

644
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,900
Because of this 1 / Gm.
The second is Gm + times

645
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,510
output resistance of the common base.

646
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,666
All this is in your table
and it is β2 / Gce2.

647
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:56,600
And I put the numerical values.

648
00:39:57,373 --> 00:40:01,306
I take the β here, I take the IC0 / Ua.

649
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,060
So the Gce2 ... So this is just
to remind you that the

650
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:12,320
Gce2 equals IC02 / Va.

651
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,930
So Va it is 100V, so it gives you

652
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,280
the Gce2 you multiply by
the β to find R out.

653
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,360
You find that it is equal to
10MΩ, which is huge.

654
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:31,310
And the input impedance of
a common base transmitter setup

655
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,720
is ... Here there is an error.

656
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,640
The resistance is of kΩ.

657
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,306
So that's  kΩ, it is not Ω.

658
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,350
So it is the order of
the magnitude of 26kΩ, it is the

659
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,480
resistance that I see here.

660
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,690
And I multiply both gains
using the digital values

661
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,440
I own and watch.

662
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,653
I get a gain of 384,615,

663
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
it's amazing, it's an almost
infinite gain and this is

664
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,210
very high gains.

665
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:05,200
And if you remember when we said that

666
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,410
an operational amplifier has an open loop

667
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,830
an infinite gain, it is achieved
through setups of this

668
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,240
style then putting a current source here, and this

669
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,550
we will learn later, is that if you put a

670
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,900
source here you are getting
extremely high gains.

671
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,460
Finally this week, we saw setups

672
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,760
or rather the three basic setups: common transmitter,

673
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,410
common base and common collector.

674
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,740
We gave each of them a qualification
in terms of input impedance

675
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,280
and output impedance and gain.

676
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,940
And showed a concrete example
where we took a

677
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,770
common transmitter, it was followed
by a common base setup.

678
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,530
We could have very well
put a common collector setup

679
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,580
to show that we keep with it
an extremely high gain

680
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,090
because this is what we demonstrated that

681
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,720
the common transmitter, common base
gave us a very high gain.

682
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,270
All you need is to plug a common collector

683
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:07,790
behind and that's it you have
an almost operational amplifier

684
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,786
whose input impedance is average,
the output impedance

685
00:42:11,853 --> 00:42:14,810
will be low and the gain is very high.

686
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,020
And we saw that has to do Lego
between the three

687
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,690
setups,
it depends how we put them in which order

688
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,040
to get linear functions and it is what we're going

689
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,370
to do the rest of this course.
