1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,260
And here we come to
the critical part of this

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,940
lesson this week, it is the analysis
of the three basic setups.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,390
This part of the course is going
to seem a bit tedious

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,780
because there are a lot of calculations.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,110
But believe me that at
the end of this week you will

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,773
see, we will draw highly
relevant conclusions,

7
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:28,220
that are very easy to understand.
So, there will be

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,330
a lot of calculations,
but I will not go into

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,213
details of calculations,
it is almost boring.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,090
I'll try to do the minimum possible.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,680
And I will let you continue
these calculations on your own.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,010
I also let you check,
there will be all that

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,210
you need to calculate
on your own, but I will

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,360
try to look into the necessary conclusions

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,240
for you to get the message
that there are three

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,400
basic set ups: common transmitter,
common collector, common base.

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,000
And with these three basic set ups,
there will be features.

18
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,800
These characteristics describe
the input resistance, the

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,880
output resistance, the gain and
especially the use of the set up.

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,080
You will see when we begin
to synthesize what will

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,900
come out of this part,
that I inform is a bit hard.

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,060
You see it will become extremely
simple and that will

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,480
allows us to synthesize relatively
complex electronic circuits.

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,370
I go back in this vision of things.

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,370
I will repeat it again.

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,400
Here is the transistor symbol.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,170
I put in red the polarization.

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,653
I put in blue what helped us
to get this diagram here.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,140
When we took this path, it is once we did

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,080
the abstraction that there is
direct current and direct voltage.

31
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,460
And we polarized our transistor
and then said, we will

32
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,650
forget the polarization.
We will focus on a

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,420
transistor where finally
we know IC0 because

34
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,920
it was imposed and it is a choice, so it's

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,180
its designer who will decide.
We take it and we

36
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,310
will turn it to create
three configurations.

37
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,710
We will start with the configuration
called common transmitter.

38
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,530
So common transmitter, it means
I'm going to put the transmitter

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,870
in common between
the input and the output.

40
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,680
Look that's what I'll get.

41
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,413
I'll make a quadrupole.

42
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,910
This quadrupole, it will allow
me to have, in common between

43
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,010
the input and the output, the transmitter.

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,300
I'll extract as decided earlier

45
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,760
in the first video of this week that I finally

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,400
am interested in the input resistance
and output resistance

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,720
and the transconductance value .

48
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:47,110
So, I'll calculate it
and I'll extract the Gm.

49
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,420
When I look at the small signals diagram

50
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,540
of my transistor, it corresponds
absolutely to take this diagram,

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
put it in the quadrupole
as it is and find a

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,920
configuration in which
I apply a charge here.

53
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,380
If the AC point of view transmitter,
it does not move.

54
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,130
The ΔV rather the potential here
is absolutely stable.

55
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,410
And I share it between
the input and the output, I

56
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,020
get a quadrupole which is this
and the transmitter is common.

57
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,110
So we will see later
how we will do with the

58
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,780
transistor itself to impose
a potential here which of

59
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:30,020
the AC point of view, it does not move.

60
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,360
It becomes a DC potential.

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,040
So DC means it is a fixed potential
and we

62
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,180
get it and it is called
common transmitter.

63
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:39,253
So now, look.

64
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,000
When we find the quadrupole, we said
"we will come connect a source."

65
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,420
We will come connect a charge.

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,110
We said we are interested in what
I see at the input of my quadrupole.

67
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,230
It is here my quadrupole.

68
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,430
I put my fingers here.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,570
I see V1. I see I1.

70
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,386
I see that between the base and
transmitter I have V1 that gives me Vbe.

71
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:01,690
And I see that the current
entering the base

72
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,066
transistor is in fact the current I1.

73
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,040
So from here to there, I see
the V1 and I1 I have to do the

74
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,570
ratio between V1 and I1.

75
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,053
And find the 1/GbE.

76
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,430
So I put my fingers here,
and I say what is the

77
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,960
resistance I see here, I see 1/GbE.

78
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:22,670
So in that quadrupole,
the input resistance will

79
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,200
be 1/Gbe of a transistor as it is.

80
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,773
So the 1/GbE of this ΔVbe/ΔIb.

81
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:34,680
I will do the same at the output.

82
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,000
I look here. I put my fingers here.

83
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,120
I say "I have the voltage V2 and
have the current I2 that enters here."

84
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,580
What is the value of
this impedance I see between

85
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,610
the two or this resistor.

86
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,760
It is V2/I2. And I see the Gce.

87
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:52,250
I remind you that when
we calculated output resistance,

88
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,820
we said "it short circuits the input".

89
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,786
So we put the voltage source ΔVbe = 0.

90
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,050
So this Vbe here will be zero.

91
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,430
So that, it will disappear.

92
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,570
And I end up with 1/Gce and therefore

93
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,090
the source will disappear.
This will give a 1/Gce.

94
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,000
So start from this and do with this
the next step

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,080
I'm going now with exactly
what I explained.

96
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,226
That is, I took the 1/GbE.

97
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:22,866
I said this is my input resistance.

98
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,866
And there is V1/I1.

99
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,653
And I know it's 1/GbE,
we had calculated it, it is βUt

100
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,310
on the polarization current.

101
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,570
The output resistance Rout,
it's V2/I2 with

102
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,466
Vs = 0 so I short circuit this.

103
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,460
So the ΔVbe = 0 therefore
the power supply will disappear.

104
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,226
It will remain V1/Gce.

105
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,510
And the Gm of the transistor,
that means I create a

106
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,000
short circuit here.
I plug this here and this here.

107
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,160
And I'll end up with the resistor RI
which will be

108
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,500
zero and Gce will be short circuited.

109
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,680
So the current of short-circuit
that goes through the current I2,

110
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,866
it is absolutely equal to GmVbe.

111
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,770
So this Gm I see here that
I wrote in capital letters,

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,560
it is nothing but the Gm
of the transistor so I have

113
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,030
the Gm of the transistor
that I know is here.

114
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,920
And now I have determined
a quadrupole where

115
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,190
I know its input impedance which
is here, its output impedance

116
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,190
which is here and
the transconductance which is here

117
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,010
and I just have to put this
in the context of a circuit,

118
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,360
I have all values. Observe this.

119
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,810
IC0 is the polarization current
which we determined before.

120
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,530
This is the trickiest part
of the circuit design,

121
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,670
it's determining the polarization.

122
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,080
So there you have this current DC.

123
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,500
You remove your transistor,
you replace it with this

124
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,146
that gives you the quadrupole (inaudible).

125
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,260
You know the input impedance because β
depends on the β of transistor.

126
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,910
The 26mV for the thermodynamic
potential, IC0, it's your choice.

127
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,146
You also have Rout which is 1/GbE.

128
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,200
And you have Gm. Look,
there is only IC0 which is your

129
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,000
choice and everything else depends
on your component.

130
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,680
So we see how important the choice of

131
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,253
determining IC0.

132
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,020
Now once we saw the three Rin, Rout and

133
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,910
Gm0, I'll do a little exercise with you by

134
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,330
calculating the real numerical
values ​​in an example

135
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,466
just a case study to put
a polarization value.

136
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,800
They will say: you applied IC0 = 1 mA.

137
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,426
And we will provide values ​​for RI and
we will provide values ​​for Rs.

138
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,470
So we know everything about it and we will

139
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,900
calculate with this what
we get as set up type.

140
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,110
Here are the same diagrams.

141
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,890
I copied the input impedance,
output impedance and the

142
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,160
the Gm0 and I took a numerical example.

143
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,093
I applied a current IC0= 1mA.

144
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,066
So you have your polarized
transistor by putting 1 mA.

145
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,830
I took a transistor in
the early voltage, Va = 100 V.

146
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,710
It has a β equal to 100.

147
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,660
This is not your choice,
it is the component.

148
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,480
And you plugged an
Rl charge resistor.

149
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,040
I chose 1kΩ. And you have
connected a source here Rs

150
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,950
equal to 50Ω. And
I will replace these values ​​here.

151
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,826
I find Rin, with these
values, equals 2,6kΩ.

152
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,800
I find Rout equal to 100kΩ.

153
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,560
And I find that the Gm of
the transistor in this Gm0

154
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,373
is 38.46 mS or mΩ or 1 / mΩ as a unit.

155
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,860
What can I qualify this?

156
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,170
I can say that a common
transmitter is a set up where I

157
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,346
managed to put the transmitter
in fixed voltage AC.

158
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,040
It is in common between
the input and the output, its

159
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,210
input impedance, for polarization current

160
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,460
relatively small not that big, is of the order

161
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,813
of 2,6kΩ so it is not very large,
it is a few kΩ.

162
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,780
However I found that
the output resistance of this

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,860
set up here is a resistance
which is one hundred

164
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,370
kΩ, it is quite large.

165
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,200
Therefore the output resistance
is quite large, which

166
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,730
clearly shows that I have a current source

167
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,740
controlled in parallel with
a resistor 1/Gce and

168
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,030
1/Gce is 100kΩ so
this is a power source that

169
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,720
has a large output resistance.

170
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,820
And the transconductance
it is this value we calculated.

171
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,746
Let's see my quadrupole.

172
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,906
The analysis that had been done
before, it was our quadrupole

173
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,330
we have the values ​​of each component,
I plug my

174
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,090
Rl resistance, I take my source
with a resistance

175
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,160
of 50Ω and I will do a gain calculation.

176
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,110
I want to see how it will behave.

177
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,770
We saw that when you take
this quadrupole, we

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,480
call transconductance quadrupole,
you calculate the vaccum gain.

179
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,180
So if you want to look the gain
without putting Rl

180
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,860
you find that the voltage V2
depends on what current

181
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,250
will be converted into a voltage
in the Rout resistance.

182
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,390
This current has a negative sign.

183
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,600
Why ? Because the current
it goes up in this direction.

184
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,560
And you have V2 in this sense
so we have current and

185
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,370
voltage in the opposite direction.
In the configuration or

186
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,920
rather in Switzerland standards,
we consider

187
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,010
these two vectors in the opposite direction,
which gives us a minus sign.

188
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,330
This sign you see here is a negative sign

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,380
and when connecting
the resistor RI in parallel with

190
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,210
Rout, namely in
this example you have Rl equal

191
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,070
to 1kΩ and Rout equal to 100kΩ,
so 1kΩ in parallel with

192
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,070
100kΩ, I remind you
that when you put a small

193
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,186
resistance with a resistance
100 times greater  it is

194
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,510
the smal that will dominate
in parallel so it's like

195
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,110
you neglect the Rout resistor.

196
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,450
So you will end up with
Gm0V1 that will pass

197
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,650
through the resistor Rl.

198
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,130
So if you apply the simplification
that I have

199
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,530
shown you is that you've found
this R out as neglected.

200
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,630
The internal resistance of
the transistor (inaudible)

201
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,333
compared to RI so you find Gm.Rl.

202
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,540
This is really the expression
of the gain of a common

203
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,360
transistor emitter it's equal to Gm.Rl,

204
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:45,080
the gain is equal to -Gm times

205
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,130
resistance Rl you put if the resistor RI

206
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,306
is small compared to the output
resistance of your quadrupole.

207
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,640
And you do the math, you find that Gm is

208
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,910
of the order of magnitude of 38.

209
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,010
It was 1kΩ*38.46 mS, it gives you

210
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,000
the order of magnitude of 38
with a minus sign, that is to say,

211
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,850
the tension that you find here is reversed

212
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,670
compared to the voltage you put there.

213
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,600
If there is a sinusoidal voltage,
there is a

214
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,330
180 ° phase shift and this
is a voltage amplifier.

215
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,480
And we just realized with
a common transmitter setup

216
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:22,340
a gain that is equal to this times this.

217
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,533
If you now write the set up like this:

218
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:31,373
-(Ic0/Ut).Rl you

219
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,040
know that the Ic0 it is your choice,
it is you who

220
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,200
selected it when you polarized.

221
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,260
Rl is a part of the data and the

222
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,690
thermodynamic voltage it's physics.

223
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,950
So Ic0.Rl is a DC voltage, Ic0.Rl

224
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,150
is a voltage drop
of a resistor connected to

225
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,230
a collector when talking
about polarization, but we'll

226
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,050
have the opportunity to see it later.

227
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,610
But what I want to close
with this set up, we saw

228
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,500
our quadrupole exists,
we could write these

229
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,533
relationships,
we calculated the impedances.

230
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:06,770
The impedances depend mainly
on a choice and physical

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,730
settings so everything is known
and we know all about

232
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,910
the AC behavior of our set up.

233
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,550
I will now take the same setup and I will

234
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,230
use the base, but I'm going
to put it in common between

235
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,190
the input and the output.

236
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,150
Remember, this is
the small signals diagram

237
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,650
of the transistor out of circuit.
Now I would like

238
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,460
to turn this transistor and
put the base on a fixed potential

239
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,340
and I will enter between
the transmitter and base and

240
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,910
exit between collector and base.

241
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,940
So this is what I would like
to put on the earth ground.

242
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,010
So I would draw the diagram
and it would become like this.

243
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,100
So the 1/GbE would come here

244
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,820
then I would put the base here and this

245
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,020
would become the transmitter, after
I have my controlled current source

246
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,050
in parallel with my

247
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,660
1/Gce or Gce, it's as you want,
if you talk in

248
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:08,600
terms of resistance you need
to stay in resistance or in

249
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,210
conductance, and here
you have the collector, you will

250
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,090
have current passing through
here and you will have the input here

251
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,110
and we would like to have
the common base between,

252
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,180
this is the Vbe voltage and

253
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,733
that's always the base and
here I have the voltage Vbc,

254
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,640
if I draw like this, where
Vcb depends, that's Vcb.

255
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,680
And I found this.
Here it is quite interesting.

256
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,880
What is happening,
we see that when I take the

257
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,210
resistor RI and I look from here
the impedance, I

258
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:56,413
see Rl will interact with the input voltage

259
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,060
because look, the current going through

260
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,140
here, will continue its path
and go through here.

261
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,586
So the RI value has an effect.

262
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,020
That is why we said "input impedance

263
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,400
is defined with pluged Rl ".
Same when I cancel the

264
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,650
source, this source does not exist,
Rs would be

265
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,000
parallel with 1/GbE
so I have Rs parallel with GbE and

266
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,370
you see it depends on
the value of Rs: if Rs is

267
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:24,573
very, very big, it can be removed
with respect to 1/GbE.

268
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,750
But otherwise it is Rs that
can dominate, otherwise if they have the

269
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,470
same order of magnitude it is necessary
to calculate two resistors in parallel.

270
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,210
I will now think about
what will happen with

271
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,240
my setup in the quadrupole.

272
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,190
What would I like to do?

273
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,740
I would like to calculate what is
the resistance that I see

274
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,010
here, that is to say I would calculate
V1 / I1 and I would like

275
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:51,986
to calculate V2 / I2 to
take into account Rout and Rin.

276
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,590
I would like to express I1.

277
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,110
So I1 is the current that enters here.

278
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,786
Look at this current here, the GmVbe.

279
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,860
This is Vbe and the current
will enter the base

280
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,080
of the transistor,
it will have this direction.

281
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,620
The current enters the base,
it comes out in the transmitter

282
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,440
so it's a current flowing in this direction.

283
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:19,060
Vbe as the voltage, Ib is the current

284
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,520
that is in this direction and
this current I1, where there is a

285
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,640
mistake I will immediately correct,
it is not equal to Ib.

286
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,840
So that, does not exist.

287
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,260
This current I1 is proportional to what?

288
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,480
It is proportional to this -GbeVbe.

289
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,920
That's -GbeVbe, that's Vbe, that's Gbe.

290
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,133
GbeVbe is a current,
it is this current here.

291
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,840
This current here gives this expression,
it has a negative sign

292
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,120
because this current plus
this current, plus this

293
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,330
current is equal to 0.

294
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,900
This current that comes from here,
it is GmVbe so we

295
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,080
see it here, there is always
a minus, of course, because

296
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,700
it is a current that enters the node.

297
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,660
Now I would like to see
the current flowing here.

298
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,090
This current flowing here depends on what?

299
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,613
It depends on the voltage V2-V1/Gce

300
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:22,800
if I want to take account of
this plus sign I put

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,973
in place of what I just said,
I must say (V1-V2) .Gce.

302
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,120
So there I have expressed
the current I1.

303
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,140
I would like to express the voltage V2.

304
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:38,120
The voltage V2, there is resistance
that will have to pass

305
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,040
in a current I2, so it's -RlI2.

306
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,690
The direction of the voltage
is positive in this direction, the

307
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,500
current is positive in that direction
so there is a minus sign to add.

308
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,800
And this same current I2
is the current leaving here.

309
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,000
That's the current I2.

310
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,890
And there I can express it as
they had done before so it's

311
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,000
the current I1-GbE so I have

312
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
to consider this current.

313
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,170
This current then will be equal
to, I replace I2

314
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,570
with the two currents that arrive
so this node here, with

315
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,333
the correct sign it gives I2 + GbeVbe.

316
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,260
And I remember that V1
is simply equal to -Vbe ...

317
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,330
Here too there is an error because
there is a minus.

318
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,460
V1 is positive in this direction,
Vbe is positive in this

319
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,800
direction here so I have to take
into account what appears here.

320
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,000
So now I have everything
you need to express

321
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,010
the input resistance, the output
resistance and the value

322
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,030
of the transconductance
to normalize this diagram here in

323
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,360
relation to this
quadrupole diagram we studied.

324
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,000
We talked about the input impedance
so we found all the

325
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,060
relationships that allow us to do so.

326
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,790
Now I am correcting
the same mistake just now

327
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,100
with this and I'll add the minus

328
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,120
I had forgotten in my diagram.

329
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:08,546
Let's move to this side.

330
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,520
I would watch the output
resistance so it's

331
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,826
V2 / I2, I will calculate V2.

332
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:18,290
V2 is the voltage that I see
from here to here so if I

333
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,800
take this mesh it is like this.

334
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,040
This is V2 which is equal to the

335
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,110
sum of this voltage across Gce and

336
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,390
V1 voltage, but the current I2
flowing in that direction

337
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,420
will be proportional to
this current GmVbe plus

338
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,530
what was calculated as current in the Gce.

339
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,200
The Gce is seen carrying
a current that is equal to the

340
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,150
difference of the voltage, V2-V1,

341
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,450
taking into account the signs
multiplied by Gce, that's what

342
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,050
allows me to calculate the current in Gce.

343
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,380
And here I express the current I2
because we were told that it is

344
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,730
the current that passes through here
and it comes out on the other side,

345
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,790
it's always the same. This is also I2.

346
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,060
Once it has passed here it comes
out on the other side I2 so it

347
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,340
depends on the current flowing
in the GbeVbe with

348
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,466
a minus sign and the VeRs, why?

349
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,186
Because here I said Vs = 0.

350
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:25,680
So if you cancel this voltage source, so you

351
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,800
replace it by a short circuit
and we said that the

352
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,740
output resistance is calculated
at the source equal to

353
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,390
0, but we keep the source
we cancel the increase,

354
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,240
but we keep the source
so that the resistance Rs of the

355
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,413
source if it has an effect on the output
resistance this effect appears.

356
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,420
So the resistance Rs
would occur in parallel

357
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,410
with this resistance
and we see it directly, the

358
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,910
paralleling of the effect of
Vbe and Rs is

359
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,130
as if we had brought the resistance
and put it in parallel with Vbe.

360
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,460
So we have all we need to calculate

361
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,200
input resistance and
the output resistance therefore I

362
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,670
will make a simplification.
As I told you I

363
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,300
will not do it here because
I have to do V1 / I1 and

364
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,140
V2 / I2, this is what will give me
the following relationships.

365
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,170
The relationships we'll get for Rin, in

366
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,200
putting V1 / I1, while keeping RI,
we will find

367
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,066
this expression here: Rout is V2 / I2

368
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,733
canceling Vs.
We will find this expression here

369
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,260
and the Gm0, I short circuit here
and I look at the current passing through.

370
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,520
I'll find Gm + GbE with a minus sign.

371
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,000
There, we'll get into this
simplification game.

372
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,973
I told you at the beginning,
there is always the Gce

373
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:02,000
which is much smaller

374
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,220
than the Gbe which is much
smaller than the Gm.

375
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,200
When I see a Gce which
sums up  with a Gm I want

376
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,700
to say, this is much bigger than this.

377
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,120
So after when you look
at a very small Gce which

378
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,746
multiplies a resistance RI, I mean this,
it will tend towards 0.

379
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:25,840
The Gce, it is really small.

380
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,370
So It will remain a 1.

381
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,840
So I'll find myself with a Gm + GbE.

382
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,060
So the Gbe in relation to Gm,
I will remove it.

383
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,000
And here the same, such as I simplified
Gce by Rl, I will also remove it.

384
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,813
All this will come down to 1 / Gm
after these simplifications.

385
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,640
So we will find that the
input impedance of this

386
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,333
set up, look at this set up here.

387
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,030
When you look at it from here, it's like

388
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,510
you plugged a resistance
equivalent to all this.

389
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,860
There is 1/Gm, that's what interests me.

390
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,000
I will now look at the output impedance.

391
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,660
Same, we will make simplifications.

392
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,906
We will find that 1/Gce, G1 + 1+ Gce

393
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,586
over this expression here.

394
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,820
If you expand it a little and you do some

395
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,770
approximations, you come
across this relationship.

396
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,790
Here, I'll take the time
to think with you.

397
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,740
I think this is something that is
of the order of magnitude.

398
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,253
The impedance that I see
here is of the order of 1 / Gce.

399
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,853
Here I have 1 + GMRS. 1 + GbeRs.

400
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:40,580
If by chance this term here, you have

401
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,150
a term Gbe and you have
a term Rs that multiplies.

402
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,010
In reality what happens
when one wants to see

403
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,900
the output resistance,
the source is canceled.

404
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,000
So, I replace it by a short circuit.

405
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,546
This source, it will disappear.

406
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:56,790
What happens with it?

407
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,290
Watch the Rs resistance.

408
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,410
We'll put it in parallel with GbE.

409
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,580
So I put Rs in parallel with GbE.

410
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,740
If by chance, you have
a resistor of a source

411
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,380
of what you connected yourself
which is much more

412
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,340
greater than 1 / GbE,
you have a very high resistance

413
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,530
parallel with a much smaller resistance.

414
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,940
You're going to neglect
the resistance that is greater.

415
00:24:21,986 --> 00:24:23,373
Everything will move towards 1/GbE.

416
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,050
And that's what I would like
to express here.

417
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,130
If by chance your Rs resistance is much

418
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,240
greater than 1 / GbE,
what will happen with that relationship?

419
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,220
This relationship, first it's like I'm

420
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,760
saying Rs is huge.

421
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:44,230
Rs is very large.
So this terme and this terme

422
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:49,000
which is a product of Rs times
a value, Rs times

423
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,190
a value is extremely high, I can say that

424
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,180
I can overlook the 1 which adds.

425
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,946
This term is large because of Rs.

426
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,910
Now if I neglect the 1 GMRS / GbeRs,
I can say

427
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,986
I simplifie Rs at the numerator,
the denominator, that gives me Gm / GbE.

428
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:11,530
And Gm / GbE is simply

429
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:17,146
this term Gm / GbE, it is a β.

430
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:21,000
Gm / GbE equals β of the transistor.

431
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,360
So I find that if I can put a

432
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,540
source whose resistance is in
series of the source which is

433
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,730
extremely high, I will find that
the impedance of

434
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,710
the output is boosted. It is boosted by a

435
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,200
β / Gce it becomes β.1 / Gce.

436
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:45,630
Now for the Gm0 when

437
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,930
we look in short circuit,
we'll see that really

438
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,700
the output current, it is this GbE
which modulate over Gm

439
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,940
but we see that the sign here
is equal to a minus sign.

440
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,470
So it's a -Gm.

441
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,880
I would like to go back a little
and remind you

442
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,293
aside what I found with respect
to the common transmitter.

443
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,230
Here I tackled the common base.

444
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,733
And I found that the input impedance
of a common base is 1 / Gm.

445
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,826
The output impedance of
a common basis, is β / Gce.

446
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:20,420
And I just found it is like
a common transmitter, the

447
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,320
transconductance in short-circuit
is equal to Gm, but with a minus sign.

448
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,720
And I'll do the case study with values

449
00:26:28,773 --> 00:26:30,706
and I'll keep the same thing we had

450
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,700
made with common transmitter.
That is to say, keep the same

451
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,413
IC0 current that we had chosen for
the common transmitter, it has 1 mA.

452
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:43,120
I'll keep the same thing and see if I polarize

453
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,440
1 mA, what are
the numerical values ​​of these

454
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,590
settings and bring them to
the quadrupole, the input resistance,

455
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,000
the output resistance and
the transconductance and we will

456
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,760
see what happens.

457
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:03,160
This is a pretty charged slide,
but then we need to look

458
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,030
at the digital data.

459
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,640
I have to apply a current of 1 mA
and we keep the

460
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,740
same resistance and we used the same
transistor as the common transmitter.

461
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,270
But this time, I put the base in common
between the input and the output.

462
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:19,060
Look what I found in terms of value.

463
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,920
The input impedance,
I note it next or I note it here.

464
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,893
And I frame it, it is 1 / Gm.

465
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,333
So this is a Ut / IC0.

466
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,933
It is 26 000 mV divided by 1 mA.

467
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,860
It is 26 Ω. The output impedance,

468
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,190
it is the voltage Early.

469
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,550
And there, I have not chosen an
Rs which is very large.

470
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,000
Rs is 50 Ω.

471
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,410
It is not much larger than the 1 / GbE.

472
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,840
1 / GbE, it was calculated,
it is in the order of

473
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,893
2,4 kΩ in parallel with 50 Ω.

474
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,013
So it is relatively low.

475
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:01,666
But I observe that the output
resistance is still 292 kΩ.

476
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,666
And Gm0 with a minus sign is the same as

477
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,170
I had found for common transmitter.

478
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,160
What can I say about the common base?

479
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,250
When I processed the common transmitter
with the same

480
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,330
values, I found a Rin

481
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,950
that is equal to 1 / GbE.
And we said, it is of the order of

482
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,030
2.4 if I remember correctly.

483
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,600
It's something around 2,4 kΩ.

484
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,130
And there I found it, it's 26 Ω.

485
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,950
So if you replace, for the common
transmitter the same

486
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,150
values ​​and you take the Rout
of a common transmitter,

487
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:46,760
we found 100 kΩ.
Here I found almost 300 kΩ.

488
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,370
So that's three times greater.

489
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,430
Here is , I think this is 2.6 if I am

490
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,520
not wrong, check it.

491
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,360
So when you look at the report
I can say that the impedance

492
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,500
input of a common base setup
that is much more

493
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,820
smaller than the input impedance
of a common transmitter circuit.

494
00:29:07,773 --> 00:29:11,160
The output impedance of
a common transmitter circuit

495
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,590
is smaller than the output impedance
of a common base.

496
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,600
So the common base has
an output resistance

497
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,070
quite high compared to
the common transmitter.

498
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,890
And of course, if I had put Rs
with the discussion we

499
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,510
had made before,
if Rs was big enough, there we took

500
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,000
50 Ω, if I had put maybe
a megohm , you'll see

501
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,780
it immediately becomes much larger
than the common transmitter.

502
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,390
So this term, it will explode.

503
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,710
This technique is called
the amplification of the impedance

504
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,440
output, it is called in English
gain boosting

505
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,120
for output resistance and
is used in setups where

506
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:52,730
we want to make extremely high gains.

507
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,550
I look at the Gm0.

508
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,870
I find it's the same value
as the common transmitter

509
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:04,000
that was found, 38.46, but

510
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:10,586
something that is without the minus sign.

511
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:11,666
Here, there is a minus sign.

512
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:12,973
Here, there is a plus sign.

513
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,280
So it's the
same transconductance, but then

514
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,670
the input impedances and
the output impedances, there

515
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,290
are things to do.
And that's what would

516
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,090
allow us later to use a setup
in the place of the other.

517
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,210
It is these values ​​that
you are noting and

518
00:30:28,253 --> 00:30:30,420
it is those values ​​that
you will consider later.

519
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,586
So when I plug Rout and
I see these 292 kΩ,

520
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:37,373
and I connect a parallel
resistance of a kΩ,

521
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:41,180
I can, without hesitation,
replace  or say this

522
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,860
resistance, I can overlook it.

523
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,700
It's like it does not exist.

524
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,770
I have a resistance Rl.

525
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,430
So this current one, it is converted
to voltage by Ohm's law.

526
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,590
A current that flows into
the resistance, but remember

527
00:30:53,733 --> 00:31:02,493
not only in this case, you have
the Gm equal to -Gm.

528
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:03,460
So I have a minus sign.

529
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,750
Watch the tension,
it is positive that way.

530
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,500
I have the current that has been
defined, by convention,

531
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,200
positive in this sense.

532
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,910
I have a Gm sign . So here
when I put -Gm and I write

533
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,700
this Gm equals -Gm.
So this gain is equal to

534
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,160
+ Gm.Rl

535
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,630
and I say approximately because
it's Rout, I have not considered

536
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,510
this impedance I just erased.

537
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,540
And we find that the gain of
a common base setup and

538
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,390
common transmitter setup
is exactly the same.

539
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,260
One inverses, this is the common
transmitter and another that has a

540
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,680
positive gain of the same value,
with the same values

541
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,890
of components and the same polarization
which is equal to 38.

542
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,510
So we begin to understand
what it will serve all this

543
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,800
and begin giving qualifications

544
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,310
of electronic nature of these setups.

545
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,070
Let's find the common collector setup.

546
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,670
The same story. I will use
exactly the same thing.

547
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,720
The common colector setup,
the small signals diagram

548
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,620
of the transistor and the ability
to replace the transistor,

549
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,160
but putting this time
the collector to ground.

550
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,650
I'll put the collector in common
between the input and the output.

551
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,110
I'll enter between the base and

552
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,350
collector and exit between

553
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,210
collector and transmitter,
definitly you will see, we will

554
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,360
put a fixed potential on the collector.

555
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,790
And we'll see when the output
is on the transmitter.

556
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,270
So we will later, put a fixed potential

557
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,026
and here, we put our charge RI.

558
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,200
And we will connect our source
here between the base and

559
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,390
the collector, so every increase here is

560
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,690
exactly that which will appear here,
but we will have the opportunity

561
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,760
to see it later.

562
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,480
I take this pattern and then I draw.

563
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:04,680
Look at the transmitter, it is here.

564
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,910
The collector, it is here.

565
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:11,120
So that, I pivoted to rotate it
and draw it like this.

566
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,860
Current flows from the collector
to the transmitter so it is GmVbe.

567
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,670
The input current, there is always
the same error that

568
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,400
I will immediately correct, here too.

569
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,453
So it's just, it's I1 equal Ib .

570
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,960
So there, the current through
the base, I1 equal to Ib.

571
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,020
And I see again a setup equivalent to

572
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,680
the common collector setup
that I will take and make

573
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,090
in place of this standard quadrupole
with an input resistance

574
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:41,460
I defined as V1 / I1, an output impedance

575
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,590
I defined as V2 / I2 and
I have to calculate the

576
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,110
transconductance which appears here.

577
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,450
I go in my calculation.

578
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,920
So I have this diagram here.

579
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,910
Again, I have to calculate
the current I1, express it.

580
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,500
I see this current one,
it is a base current.

581
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,750
That is Vbe and that's Gbe.

582
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,360
Therefore the current flowing through
a GbE conductance is equal

583
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,540
to Gbe multiplied by the voltage Vbe.

584
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,910
I note it. This same current,
it comes from here.

585
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,530
So that's the same current I1.

586
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
This current here, will be proportional
to this current and

587
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,620
the current flowing to both sides.

588
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,000
So I express it.

589
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,290
So this is the GmVbe, what I see here
with a minus sign.

590
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,530
And the voltage I see
at the terminals from here

591
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,380
to here, this voltage here to here,
I express it as a function of this.

592
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,500
This voltage here, I take this mesh.

593
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,186
I have here the Vbe
and there, the voltage V2.

594
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,770
So I express V1 - Vbe,
it gives me the voltage V2.

595
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,320
Look at my two fingers here.

596
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,000
This voltage here,
it is proportional to what

597
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,746
I see from here to here and it is equal
to this voltage V1 - Vbe.

598
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,680
Therefore, V1 - Vbe.

599
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:01,660
So that will give this component
that I see here, that I express here.

600
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,340
And it will end in parallel
with the parallel implementation

601
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,530
of two resistors, 1 / Gce parallel with Rl

602
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,190
I can write it in terms of conductance.

603
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:16,560
This is Gce + 1/RI. Here, I expressed I1

604
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:18,146
depending on this.

605
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,050
I'll redo the same for the current I2

606
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,640
by replacing Vs by a short circuit.

607
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:30,660
And I will calculate whether the GceV2,
so it takes into account the

608
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,580
current through here.

609
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,770
This takes into account current
flowing through here and it will

610
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,010
reflect this current that passes
by neglecting

611
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,450
the series implementation of Rs with GbE
and I end up with this expression.

612
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:50,546
And when I short circuit the source,
I see that Rs appears here.

613
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:52,930
So you remember when

614
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,770
this circuit is short circuited,
you have Rs which comes here

615
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,266
and here we are reading Vs = 0
because we're looking at

616
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,020
the output impedance that appears here.

617
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,340
So it gives me this relationship.

618
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:11,226
And I have all it takes to derive the V1 / I1,

619
00:36:11,493 --> 00:36:14,830
V2 / I2 and what am going
to share with you now.

620
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,426
These are expressions of
Rin, Rout and Gm0.

621
00:36:21,586 --> 00:36:23,230
It's always like we did it all the time.

622
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,790
So I do V1 / I1 that will
give me an expression in

623
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:32,453
which will appear in
Rin the output impedance.

624
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:33,493
Do you remember ?

625
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,690
When you look from here,
we do not remove this resistance.

626
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,900
If anywhere, this resistance
contributes to the expression

627
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,150
of Rin, it is why we need to keep it.

628
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,310
We see it here. Here we are in
a common collector setup.

629
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,620
When connecting a charge
on the transmitter, you

630
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:57,133
see that this charge impacts
on the input resistance.

631
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,773
Look Rout, you will see Rout when

632
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,550
you short circuit this source, there that Rs

633
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,610
that will appear here, and
you will see that will

634
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,100
show of course,
it will contribute in the Rout.

635
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,070
The Gm is like the common transmitter
and common base, it does not change.

636
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,520
There is a minus sign it is like
the common base it's equal to -Gm.

637
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,940
And here are the three expressions.

638
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:28,110
We see what is in pink
that depends on the transistor itself.

639
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,226
It is these small signals parameters
of the transistors that it impacts.

640
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,190
We did however see that
the input impedance, it

641
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,653
is strongly affected by the resistor Rl.

642
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,290
So if by chance you come
into a common collector setup

643
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:45,310
and you plug an infinite resistance called

644
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,010
a power source, it is as if you are

645
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,000
putting an infinite resistance
to the input.

646
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,110
It's like if you really take
a quadrupole where there

647
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,430
is no resistance, the resistance
is infinite, it's great.

648
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,950
So if your Rl resistance is very,
very big here,

649
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,760
it is already multiplied by β.

650
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,290
So if you put a resistance
of the order of RI equals

651
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:11,100
one MΩ, you have a β equal
to 100, you will

652
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,310
have an input impedance equal to a hundred

653
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,570
MΩ plus a little thing that is a few kΩ

654
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,110
that we can practically not talk about.

655
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,900
Therefore, input resistance,
the common collector setup.

656
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:30,560
The higher the charge resistance is,
the higher the impedance is.

657
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:35,026
So you can see an input resistance
Rin = β.Rl.

658
00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:38,380
That's why I kept
the pink color that depends

659
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,400
on transistors and I put the components
that the user

660
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:42,850
can connect by himself from the outside.

661
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:47,706
Same for the output resistor,
which is not here.

662
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:50,660
It is a small order of strength

663
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,680
of magnitude of 1 / Gm.
If you remember, 1 / Gm is

664
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,560
of the order of 26 Ω
if you polarize to 1 mA with

665
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,386
calculation, but it depends on Rs / β.

666
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:06,520
So of course if
your β is very large and Rs

667
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,870
is low, you will end up with an impedance

668
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,150
output that is very, very low.

669
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,740
And Gm does not change.

670
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,950
It is a history of signs to be compared.

671
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:22,880
Do the math. Take this polarization of 1 mA

672
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,360
and the same transistor that was used,
the same charges and the same source.

673
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,380
Use the expressions transmitting values.

674
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,280
Look at Rin, 100 kΩ in this example.

675
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,226
With about 50 Ω as a load,

676
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,600
you end up with an input impedance
of the order of

677
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,100
100 kΩ, so it's really one of

678
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,150
the highest we've ever found
with the other two setups.

679
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:56,210
The 100 kΩ as an input impedance that

680
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,320
we'll see at the input of
a common collector setup is the highest.

681
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:06,866
The output impedance when
it tends towards to 1/Gm is 26 Ω.

682
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:07,680
It's low.

683
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,000
And when it is low, so it has
an output impedance

684
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,470
here I see relatively low and

685
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:15,280
the transconductance,
it's the same as the others.

686
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,180
I will now calculate
the parallel implementation

687
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,450
of the output resistance
in parallel with our charge.

688
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,340
It was 1 kΩ here for
the resistor RI and we put

689
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,700
in parallel a resistor of 26 Ω.

690
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,190
So when you put a resistor RI of 1 Ω

691
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,440
with a small resistance of 26 Ω, you can

692
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:39,626
almost neglect the resistor RI
in parallel with it.

693
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,853
So there, it would become a Gm0 V1

694
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,590
multiplied by Rout divided by V1.

695
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,690
And it would give you a gain of about 1.

696
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,270
So a common collector setup is not a

697
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:58,910
voltage amplifier such as
the common base or common transmitter.

698
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,210
In both cases, we found a gain which
was of the order

699
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,740
of 38 with a positive sign
this time for the common base,

700
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,740
negative for common transmitter.

701
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,320
There, we find that
it is a voltage follower.

702
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,560
What we put here, we'll find it
in the output voltage.

703
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,210
However, in terms of current, ah no.

704
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:21,570
In terms of current it is an amp
that takes in the base, a current Ib.

705
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,630
It'll send to the transmitter
a current β times this current.

706
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,000
So it has a current gain that is very high.

707
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,580
What I am saying now on

708
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,010
the characteristics of these setups
is very important.

709
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,400
And that's what will ensure
or give me the ease

710
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,000
to make the right choice between
the common collector,

711
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,000
common base or common transmitter setup.

712
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,650
And I think the example
I gave and these values

713
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,210
that every time I have commented,
this is the most important

714
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,630
to give orders of magnitude to someone who

715
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,260
would use that and later gradually as

716
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,780
we advance in the study
of transistors, we'll make

717
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,573
the right choice among
the three to create complexes

718
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,010
circuitries with the set.

719
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:06,000
We just completed this week the

720
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,050
essential part of the use of three setups.

721
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,100
How do we addressed that?

722
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,950
We took the small signal diagram
and a transistor.

723
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,000
It was turned around itself
and each time it was

724
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,580
made common one of the legs
of the transistors either the transmitter,

725
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,340
or the collector or the base.

726
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,430
And it was extracted with
a quadrupole which shows an

727
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,533
input impedance, an output impedance
and a controlled current source.

728
00:42:33,546 --> 00:42:34,740
From now on, we have a

729
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,040
tool that has become very,
very powerful because we

730
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,940
still calculated an approximation
of the input impedances

731
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,780
and the output impedances
for each of these setups.

732
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,620
And here we will do a summary with this.

733
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,620
And you will see with this summary,
we can go very far

734
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,030
trying to juggle the three setups and

735
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,100
put one before the other.
Create with this

736
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
voltage gains, current gains,
circuits that have

737
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,550
low or high input impedances.

738
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,320
And same for the output impedances.

739
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,830
And it gives us a very, very powerful tool

740
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,400
for synthesizing electronic
circuitries based

741
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,440
on transistors that later
will give us the operational amplifier

742
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,410
when we correctly use the cascades of

743
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,790
these different stages
we have just studied.
