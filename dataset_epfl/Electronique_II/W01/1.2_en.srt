1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,740
We saw the transistor in its transfer
characteristics

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,000
that is Vbe F(Ic), so the

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,880
input voltage and the output current.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,290
We have seen the relationship
between Ib and Ic which gave us the

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,500
Î² of the transistor.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,290
Now we will study the transistor effect,
that is,

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,700
this current source
that man wanted to create

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,540
to make electronic circuits.

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,270
We will pass on to the output
characteristic of a bipolar transistor.

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,700
If you look at this feature here

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,090
and you look at what's on the axes,
let's come back to this diagram.

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,020
Here I have Ic and here I have Vbe and

13
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,260
I am looking at Vce.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,500
I'd like to see what will happen with the

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,150
transistor when Vce will vary.
All our attention is

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,360
on this Vce, since we have already
demonstrated that Ic is controlled by Vbe.

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,930
We've seen that this current
is controlled by this.

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,310
How this transistor effect is and what are

19
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,860
the characteristics that allow us
to analyze what will happen to the output?

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,800
Remember, the output

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,620
will often be between the collector
and transmitter or transmitter or

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,850
collector, it depends on which
side we will connect our charge.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,940
This is the IcVce law.

24
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,040
But look what I noticed here
in the constant voltage

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,620
I just put a Vbe4 voltage,

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,210
I called it 4, it is equal to 665 mV.

27
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,050
So, for a voltage here of the order
of magnitude of Uj,

28
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,290
but of course Uj we said
it was the exponential

29
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,010
and it is a value taken on the exponential law.

30
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,340
When you look here, you see that the current has

31
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,380
been absolutely independent of the

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,120
the voltage variation Uce.

33
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,060
You vary Uce as you desire.

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,820
So you vary Uce throughout this range,

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,060
you will see that Ic is not
at all affected by what happens.

36
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,780
So it is a source of current.

37
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,120
The current is fully controlled
by it because if

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,910
you now vary Vbe, if suddenly you put

39
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,770
another voltage Vbe, look what happens.

40
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,460
I put a slightly lower voltage and I lowered

41
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,020
the current that is controlled by it.

42
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,150
This voltage, I lowered it,
the current will

43
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,380
follow it according to the famous
exponential law we had seen.

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,550
If you keep doing the same thing,
you change Vbe

45
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,920
and you again put a lower voltage.

46
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,640
But when I say lower,
look at the difference it

47
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,140
is always around the same value.

48
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,020
Remember that the control of IcVbe
is an exponential law,

49
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,190
so we just need a little variation on this

50
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,130
Vbe so that the current
varies exponentially in

51
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,060
relation to this and that's what I'm doing.

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,660
I'm going to lower it again,
so I get to a certain value of Vbe.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,290
Whenever I move this tension here,

54
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,250
the current changes with it.

55
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,490
So I increase the voltage, I lower the voltage and

56
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,710
I have current sources.

57
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,620
It's called controlled
current sources that will

58
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,840
follow the variation in the voltage Vbe.

59
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,290
I insist on the fact that when you look at the

60
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,680
Vbe variation, remember
that it is controlled by

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,640
an exponential law,
so very little variation here

62
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,260
induces a lot of variation on the current here.

63
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,590
This is why I have variations between

64
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,220
629 mV to 665 mV which varies the

65
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,580
current of something of the order
of 2.5 mA to 10 mA.

66
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,290
It is this tension that has no effect,
but look carefully,

67
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,380
when the voltage Vce
gets somewhere in this

68
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,290
area called the saturation zone,
we  will explain it,

69
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,290
and especially when Vce
goes to 0 and close to 0, this

70
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,140
superb power source
and this constant value

71
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,890
of the current Ic is not
as constant than we imagine,

72
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,000
it starts to fall. When Vce is equal to

73
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,850
0,in first approximation the transistor enters

74
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,730
something we call saturation.

75
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,900
And I'd like to emphasize
this before moving on

76
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,220
to another explanation.

77
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,280
It was said that Vce does
not affect the current Ic.

78
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,510
I'm saying if and only if Vce

79
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,410
is equal to 0, this affects.

80
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,740
This is simply confined
to that condition that

81
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,480
we lose the transistor characteristic
in current source.

82
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,370
The value of current we have
is controlled by the Vbe.

83
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,460
This is the famous electrons tap
that allows this

84
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,520
transistor as Vce is not equal to 0 to stay

85
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,830
in normal running.

86
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,550
I just added an extra word and a second

87
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,860
word also, I speak of a transistor
that conduct, but

88
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,200
when it conducts, it has two states.

89
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,220
A state called normal is what will

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,070
be of interest to us in analog circuits,
and a state

91
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,080
we call saturation is when the voltage Uce

92
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,330
becomes 0. Please retain these two

93
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,530
things and remember
that ultimately Ic controlled by

94
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,580
Vbe has no longer this law
that interests us when Vce is 0.

95
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,820
Who will decide that Vce is 0?

96
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,040
It is you who will decide, it is your circuit.

97
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,070
If by chance you put a resistor in which

98
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,730
you move the current (at) Ic,
the higher the current (at) Ic

99
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,230
increases, the more voltage drop at
the edge of this resistance will increase.

100
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,430
So you risk saturating the transistor.

101
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,190
This is not a proper
transistor characteristic,

102
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,260
it's up to you in your circuit
to ensure that Vce

103
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,060
is greater than or strictly greater than

104
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,230
0 to ensure that your transistor is

105
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
in normal operation. It is as if you were

106
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,280
saying "I want to use
the transistor from here to

107
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,720
certain values",
that's up to you to decide.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But make sure that Vce
does not come here because I

109
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,120
do not have this behavior I see here.

110
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,790
I'd like to start now to introduce

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,940
the modeling of what we presented so far.

112
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,930
I told you of linear large-signal model, we will

113
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,900
call it large-signal.

114
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,500
I repeat, we will talk about
a DC mode, that is

115
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,720
we are in the world of direct current
and direct voltage.

116
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,470
We will talk of this model
and this model will be

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,500
fully differentiated from this model called

118
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,230
linear model small signals.
We will talk about AC.

119
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,740
The fundamental difference
between one and the other,

120
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,060
it will help us always to polarize the transistor.

121
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,120
This will allow us to use the

122
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,070
transistor for amplifying signals and allow

123
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,670
linear signals using the transistor.

124
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,400
Remember, the transistor can be blocked.

125
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,440
And remember that the transistor can be saturated.

126
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,710
These two words we selected earlier,
blocked

127
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,320
and saturated, are the two key words
that will guarantee us

128
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,890
if the transistor is not
blocked or saturated, I can

129
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,200
use it and here I'm talking
about small signal linear model.

130
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,340
But you have the opportunity
to better understand this with examples.

131
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,770
When I take the linear large-signal model,

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,400
remember that the base-transmitter
junction for the

133
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,530
transistor conducts should
be in the order of magnitude of EG.

134
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,320
So I'll use this model.

135
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,000
Believe me, this is the model
you are going to use all the time

136
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,270
when you put your transistor in a

137
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,000
set-up and you put voltages and direct current

138
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,030
before superimposing anything as

139
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
variable signals we'd like to amplify.

140
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,370
We are in a purely DC world and we will use

141
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,070
this model, it is of tremendous simplicity.

142
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,600
Your voltage, if you can guarantee
that Vbe

143
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,650
is of order of the magnitude of Uj,
know that the transistor will

144
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,120
conduct, so know that you will have
current in the transistor.

145
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,570
What is the value of this current?

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,740
Nobody knows, you will
have to put it in a circuit.

147
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,260
But there is one thing,
if there is a current in the

148
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,550
transistor, you can immediately
replace Vbe by Uj.

149
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,290
This is an approximation
and it is an approximation

150
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,570
just because you replaced
the exponential by this.

151
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,110
I take the transistor and say
"If I do not have Vbe is

152
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,630
equal to Uj, so I'm in somehow
a lower position", know

153
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,460
that there is no current flowing
in either the transmitter or in the base.

154
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,690
It is at the limit, if you are here,

155
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,500
and you remove the transistor from
the circuit and you will not see anything.

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,470
It has two operating conditions
that give us immediately

157
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,340
a voltage that can be used,
saying "The transistor conducts.

158
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,530
I have observed that there
is a current in the collector.

159
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,540
So there could be current
in the base since

160
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,280
both are linearly proportional."

161
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,880
At that time, I will say
"Vbe is equal to Uj and this

162
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,220
curve shows it to me. "

163
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,800
The law that shows us what
is the largest linear model

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,150
in DC slot comes down to this part

165
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,140
of this curve and this part.

166
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,620
No current, a non defined current
but which exists,

167
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,180
but especially when it exists,
there is an AUj voltage.

168
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,790
I would like to take
the small signals linear model .

169
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,040
Look what I drew here and
look what I drew here.

170
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,320
Here, I do not draw this, this I will use

171
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:19,430
just to simplify the calculation and

172
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,860
to say Vbe is equal to Uj
is all I'll get out of this.

173
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,690
I will now move on
the real exponential law.

174
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,230
I insist on the fact that
you will see that the law

175
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,440
itself will serve me analytically, but it's rather

176
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,950
the derivative of this law
that will serve me that the law itself.

177
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,900
If you guarantee me that
the transistor conducts, so

178
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,540
that you are here, and this voltage
is equal to this, so you're here.

179
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,380
If anyone can verify that Vbe
is equal to Uj, of order

180
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,460
of magnitude it's 0.6; 0.65; 0.71;
all this means that

181
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,760
it is of the order of magnitude
of the junction voltage.

182
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,280
Know that your transistor is currently conducting.

183
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
So you're somewhere here.

184
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,340
As it was approximated by a straight line,
here I take the real exponential law.

185
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,460
There is a current flowing through

186
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,580
your transistor and this is the Ic current

187
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,570
for which there is of course
a voltage of the order of Uj.

188
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,640
But then if you now
superimpose this voltage

189
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,250
which is here, which is of course
not the latter because it is

190
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,220
a rough approximation,
if you put that point

191
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,540
in the exponential law, you are on an

192
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,350
operation point ,
hence the name operating point.

193
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,560
There is a continuous current
and a voltage Vbe0

194
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,730
of a given value.

195
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,650
Know that your transistor is on this law or

196
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,800
on this exponential slope
of the relationship Ic Vbe.

197
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,000
What is happening here ?

198
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,480
What will happen when you take

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,540
this law and this explanation I just gave and

200
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,790
you take the point that
we just saw a moment ago

201
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,230
with a direct current, a direct voltage.

202
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,770
And you come here, and
superimpose a small variation,

203
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,930
we call it increase.

204
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,000
I remind you when we looked at
the output characteristic,

205
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,880
we were talking of mV

206
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,180
there, so if you take
a few variations of Vbe

207
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,420
few mV, you will see a change

208
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,210
in the current following it. Remember that Vbe is the

209
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,020
tap that controls the current flowing, and we fixed

210
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,290
a point and then started moving around

211
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,200
the fixed point in order to control
a current, and

212
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,000
that current, will give us a current in the

213
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,420
collector which is in
the image of this voltage.

214
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,940
This is the transistor: it took Vbe,

215
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,720
it transformed it into a current Ic.

216
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,300
And if this law and this are linear, you

217
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,870
have found, what we will call
trans-conductance

218
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,710
later on, that is, the approximation
of the exponential law

219
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,000
around these two points we extracted

220
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,720
from these that we applied to this curve one.

221
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,750
And we take another point and if you vary

222
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,730
this voltage then
between base-emitter, it will

223
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,750
control you the current in the collector.

224
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,250
And the one that say that
I have current in the collector of a

225
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,650
given value,
you just need to put this current

226
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,110
in a resistor,  it becomes a voltage.

227
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,940
So I converted a Vbe voltage into a current.

228
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,130
If I put this current,
which is the image of Vbe,

229
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,560
I find a voltage which is
the image of this current.

230
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,550
And that is done through the resistor.

231
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,640
So what I'd like you to remember of this

232
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,810
curve here: when I speak of
an AC model is that

233
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,910
I have surely already used the DC model.

234
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,410
And when I used the
DC model, I applied an

235
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,220
approximation, but I do not know
the exact value I applied.

236
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,000
But when I apply this and
I do a DC calculation, it will

237
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,380
allow me to know the values
ââthat will come out here.

238
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,010
And values from here will allow me to

239
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,670
make the approximation that here,
I'm on the exact law.

240
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,220
But from this exact law, what should I take?

241
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,740
Should I take this whole curve?

242
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,090
Not at all ! I could just accept,

243
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,000
approximating a small
portion of this curve,

244
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,750
which is tangent on this point
and I do the approximation

245
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,530
that the slope of the tangent
I'll call the Gm is

246
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,000
the conversion of Vbe
into a current, we will call

247
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,590
the transconductance, that means I'm in AC

248
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,600
and I just have to know the value
of Gm and that will

249
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,760
be a goal in itself,
on how to extract the Gm of a

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,060
transistor, so what is the slope
of the tangent that

251
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,630
we see here on this feature and once

252
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,000
we have it, you will see
the door of the use of

253
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,730
linear models is wide open, it will

254
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,870
allow us to consider that
any change in voltage

255
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,440
is transformed into a variation of current.

256
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,750
And that this current could change if one

257
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,640
wishes or keep it in current, or put it in

258
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,410
a resistor and convert it into voltage.

259
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,680
We would have made with that,
a voltage amplifier:

260
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,690
I will take a base-transmitter
variation and I'll watch

261
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,160
its image in current with
the output current and I will

262
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,420
put the output current in a resistor so I

263
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,590
convert it into an output voltage
and it will be the

264
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,620
first amp that we will study later.

265
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,890
I would like to now take these different

266
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:43,830
things and use the transistor
in the normal world.

267
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,400
I would also repeat that we said when a

268
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,370
transistor conducts, there is a risk
of being saturated, that is

269
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,760
when Uc is zero.

270
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,680
So I would like to differentiate the two:

271
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,330
the transistor conducts as soon
as I said that the transistor

272
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,820
is conducting, I can immediately say,

273
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,680
when a transistor conducts,
the base-transmitter junction

274
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,320
is of the order of magnitude of Uj.

275
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,890
That, I think everyone now understands

276
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,270
that the linear model by segment
in which I made

277
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,740
this vast abstraction,
that there is no exponential,

278
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,340
and I have two parts which
describe the exponential.

279
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,120
Here, when I am told that there is
an Ic current, I will

280
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,950
tell you, "yes the Vbe voltage
is of the order of Uj.

281
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,340
What will happen with this junction here?

282
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,950
So, the transistor, it has: collector, base, emitter.

283
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,380
I'll write vectorially what happens with

284
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:47,480
Vce I will write: Vce = Vbe + Vcb.

285
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,350
So these three vectors, it is a vector addition.

286
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:58,380
Vce is from here to here,
Vcb is from here to here.

287
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,420
So this vector is equal
to the sum of this plus

288
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,960
this and this is what I noted here.

289
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,630
Knowing that, I just said:
"When the transistor

290
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,480
will conduct, I have all the time,
in the order of magnitude of j."

291
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,820
So that, I'm not going to change it.

292
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,370
That's going to remain like that.

293
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,860
So, what's up with Vcb?

294
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,190
Vcb is less than Uj, why?

295
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:25,140
The transistor is in normal mode when the

296
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,470
voltage from here to here
is positive in all time.

297
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,690
So if I put my two fingers there,
the potential there

298
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,120
is above the potential here.

299
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,320
This potential is then fixed.

300
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,910
So the difference between this and this,
it must be

301
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,180
positive in that sense.

302
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,080
So that's a positive Vcb junction therefore,

303
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,230
Vbc, it must be negative and less

304
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,590
than Uj,
once the junction begins to reverse,

305
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,000
therefore, when the junction begins
to be positive in

306
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,440
that sense, it can not go beyond a

307
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,160
voltage Uj, why?

308
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,250
Because I'm having a
PN junction here, as a

309
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,390
diode, a PN junction here as a diode.

310
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,870
And a diode, it also imposes
a voltage Uj and Uj.

311
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,720
So we take in first order,
if this equals this, therefore,

312
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,180
Uce will be zero.

313
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,350
So if this equal

314
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,190
to -Uj, remember that this is Vcb, so

315
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,940
Vbc is equal Uj, so Vcb equal to -Uj, both

316
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,320
things will be zero and there, we will

317
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,460
find ourselves in the saturated mode.

318
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,490
So to ensure that my transistor is

319
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,700
fully in the normal mode,
I must at all costs

320
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,030
ensure that Vbe equals to Uj

321
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,560
and Vbc less than Uj,
which induces that Vce

322
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,950
is greater than zero,
then it is a positive voltage.

323
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,750
So it's sure that the collector potential can

324
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,460
decrease below the base potential and can

325
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,950
approach zero and at that moment,
this junction

326
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,350
becomes positive in the other direction
and my transistor will be saturated.

327
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,240
At that time and only for this mode of

328
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,410
operation, I can say that the current Ic is

329
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,500
linearly proportional to Î².

330
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,880
And the current Ie,
it's the two currents entering

331
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,590
my transistor, they are summed
and come out by the transmitter.

332
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,280
So Ie = Ib + Ic.

333
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,870
So if you change the Ic,

334
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,700
here by Î² times Ib,

335
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,330
you can write it like this:
you have a current

336
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:56,460
Ie which is equal to Ib
which multiplies 1 + Î²,

337
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,400
the Î², we said, is something quite

338
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,320
large, that is of the order
of 100, 200, 300 + 1.

339
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,720
So, the 1, I can overlook it
and I endup  with the

340
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,490
current Ie is almost equal to Ic.

341
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,380
This is an approximation that makes sense,

342
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,890
this current here, it is so small
compared to this,

343
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,310
this one, it is 200 to 300 times higher,
which makes

344
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,720
Ie approximately equal to the current Ic.

345
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,590
And all that under normal condition
because we were able

346
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,600
to ensure that the Vcb junction
is positive in this

347
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,380
direction and that Vce remains
at that time, strictly positive.

348
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,870
So the tension from here to here
is all the time positive.

349
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,220
Now we will see what will happen with the

350
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,560
transistor when it is saturated.

351
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,020
Here is what happens with
a saturated transistor,

352
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,780
this line and this line are the same.

353
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,330
The transistor conducts, in both cases,
the transistor conducts current.

354
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,050
So when it conducts current, we saw that

355
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,280
Vbe is automatically equal to Uj.

356
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,230
And then there is a mistake, "S"
has no place here.

357
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,180
So here you have the UBE is equal to Uj.

358
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,340
But we have seen that,

359
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,920
if you take Vce which is equal to

360
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,520
Vcb + Vbe

361
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,920
and you put here Uj and you put here -Uj,

362
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,820
this voltage is then equal to zero.

363
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,620
If this is zero, that is to say,
from here to there, I have a

364
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,650
voltage where my transistor
starts to conduct, finally

365
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,460
rather, this junction has
a positive voltage in this

366
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,790
direction and this junction
has a positive voltage in

367
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,760
this direction, Vce is zero
and there is the condition

368
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,440
for which your transistor is saturated.

369
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,760
So, what happens with
a saturated transistor?

370
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,680
A saturated transistor,
you've violated this law.

371
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,850
This law is no longer correct.

372
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,130
You can't talk no more about
the relationship between base current

373
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,720
and collector current,
on one side and

374
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,000
in the output characteristic,
you can no longer

375
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,190
talk of a current source.

376
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,400
So this transistor,
here, the base-transmitter voltage

377
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,150
controls the collector. Here,
the base-transmitter voltage won't

378
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,190
control no more
the collector current when Vce

379
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,890
equals zero and we can't talk
of a transistor

380
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,820
which could be used in the analog circuit.

381
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,150
You will see it is
a transistor that could

382
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,280
be used in a digital circuit.

383
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,550
So I would like us
to make the difference between

384
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,950
the two and later we will see
that saturating a

385
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,620
transistor is connected to the circuits,
it has no effect

386
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,680
on the transistor itself,
this is not related to its

387
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,050
characteristics, that is linked to
the circuit in which we have

388
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,570
placed it at a given time where
the current is increased in a

389
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,560
way that the voltage Vce
will become zero and

390
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,350
at that moment, we can
not talk of this no more.

391
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,650
We must, at that moment say
that Ic is different from

392
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,020
Î² times Ib and here we talk
of a saturation current

393
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,520
and we say the saturation current in the

394
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,670
base will be, of course,
greater to this law we

395
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,010
found here Î² times Ib or
Ic equal Î² times Ib, this

396
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,300
current can be increased and
there is nothing that will prevent it

397
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,260
if you do not brake it
with strokes of resistor.

398
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,630
So, I think we analyzed what's happening

399
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,090
with the transistor when it conducts
and when it

400
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,290
is in the normal mode and
in the saturated mode, and

401
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,460
on the left we can use
the transistor in a linear set-up

402
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,050
it behaves as a current source.

403
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,940
On the right, it will depend
on what we put as

404
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,630
limitations, but it is
a transistor that is no longer

405
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,400
used in an analog circuit.
