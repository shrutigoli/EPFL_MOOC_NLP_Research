1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,960
Well to end this introductory course on

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,880
transistors, let's take a look on

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,940
equivalent diagrams where we will
propose a diagram that

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,740
represents the transistor according
to each mode of use of this transistor.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,210
So we have seen that there
are three modes: blocked, the

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,540
blocked transistor,
if we simply remove it from the

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,660
circuit, it will disappear,
we will see how we

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,000
replace the transistor
when it is in normal mode

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,730
and we will end by replacing
a transistor with an

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,720
equivalent diagram when it is saturated.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,660
These are equivalent diagrams called

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,520
large-signal equivalent diagrams
that will be useful especially for

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,210
a transistor when it is used
in the so-called "Analog" circuit.

14
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,170
So that's the transistor symbol, I think

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,540
now you understand,
there is a junction voltage

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,710
in the base-transmitter,
there are three currents that

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,600
fall within the three pings
of this transistor so that

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,550
the Vce voltage, we will make
a focus on the value of Vce.

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,050
Because as we have seen,
the normal mode, is really

20
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,050
when the transistor is in a world
where it conducts, that is to say,

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,620
we have the base-transmitter voltage
which is a voltage of the order

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,830
of magnitude of the junction voltage
and the voltage between

23
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,390
collector-transmitter is strictly positive.

24
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,000
If we were able to verify that
the transistor conducts and

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,370
that this voltage stays positive
at this moment, it is possible

26
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,520
to remove this symbol and replace it with
an equivalent diagram which is the following.

27
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:34,880
We replace the voltage

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,600
between the base and transmitter
by a voltage, or a source of

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,490
voltage, called Uj,
it is an approximation.

30
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,880
And now we have the famous
transistor effect, that is to say,

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,230
the famous transistor effect,
the transistor behaves

32
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,230
as a current source where
the current flowing in

33
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,640
the collector, which is drawn
into the collector, will

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,480
go out through the transmitter,
it is proportional to β x IB, which

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,700
will draw a small Ib current
in the base that would be

36
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,300
multiplied by β and this is
the diagram we might

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,080
simply ... if someone tells me,
your transistor conducts

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,670
and you verified that
the collector-transmitter voltage

39
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,520
is positive, you remove this pattern and then

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,360
you replace with this instead.

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,840
And I just repeat to say, when a transistor

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,760
with low power, in normal mode,

43
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,950
which draws a current IC,
we can simply do this

44
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,780
approximation that
the current IC+ IB that will give the

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
current IE, here you write like that, and you

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,750
replace the current IC by βxIB
and you bring to light IB,

47
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,290
you will find that it is β + 1, we can

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,140
neglect the 1 relative to β
which is usually very, very big.

49
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,910
So we can always say that Ie
approximately equals

50
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,030
Ic, it is as if we're cancelling

51
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,790
the base current,
this is what we're saying, this

52
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,480
current is almost negligible,
so it's approximated by one

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,416
current approximately equal to 0.

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,600
That is the normal mode.

55
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,620
It focuses on Vce.

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,690
We will now focus on VCE again, but this

57
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,640
time, when Vce is equal to 0.

58
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,400
When your transistor is
placed in a circuit,

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,504
we will see just now how we
get to saturate a transistor,

60
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:32,090
you apply a

61
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,600
collector-transmitter voltage,
I mean, you apply because

62
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,320
it's the user in his circuit
that brings the

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,890
transistor to saturate and
the voltage between

64
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,340
the collector-transmitter is equal to 0,
that is to say the

65
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,512
current source,
it will disappear and the transistor

66
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,568
will become a real short-circuit
as a collector-transmitter

67
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,760
and there, there is no longer
the transistor effect that we

68
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,320
are interested in in the analog circuit,
that is when

69
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,490
the transistor operates
as a current source.

70
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,670
And you will end up with
a short-circuit between

71
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,350
the collector and transmitter,
there is no longer

72
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,144
the current source effect,
so we can not say Ic = β x Ib,

73
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,530
you are dependent on a diagram.

74
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,740
And this diagram we have
the transistor conducting, therefore, the

75
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,140
junction voltage remains the same.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,520
The collector-transmitter
is a short-circuit, it is replaced

77
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,120
in this model
by a short circuit, so if you

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,310
check if Vce = 0, you remove
your transistor, you

79
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,672
replace your transistor by
this diagram you see here.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,520
And then you end up with
a link that will tell you

81
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,670
clearly, as here, Ie is the sum of

82
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,240
Ic + Ib,  the two currents
enter by the two pings,

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,530
exit through the transmitter,
besides the arrow here indicates

84
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,250
the current leaving the transistor
and you see it here,

85
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:50,050
but the fundamental difference
is that you can not

86
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,960
write this relationship.

87
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,480
So you are to say it is Ic, we add SAT.

88
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,260
We're out of power source,
there is a current

89
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,280
that may be proportional
to a saturation current that

90
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,736
we'll see how we calculate it later,
but then the more critical is IbSAT.

91
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,540
As the relationship has disappeared
here, so we can not say

92
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,060
that this IbSAT is linked to Ic.

93
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,190
And Ic is a constant current,
or a current controlled

94
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,820
through a power source,
you can increase

95
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,770
IbSAT, remember that here you have
a junction that ... a diode.

96
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,900
And this diode, the more you increase
the base transmitter,

97
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,264
the more the base current will increase
and we talk of IbSAT.

98
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,400
So you will end up with
an IeSAT that will be

99
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,690
proportional to IbSAT that,
it can increase.

100
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,640
So that current can increase,
another current

101
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,960
IcSAT will add itself, this current,
we will see that it will be quite limited

102
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,700
often by a resistor, so you will have a

103
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,136
current that is no longer
proportional to IcSAT.

104
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,890
And you must be very careful,
if by chance you

105
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,530
continue to increase this current,
you may damage

106
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,180
the base-transmitter junction,
because you're going to

107
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,810
apply to it a current which
increases with voltage

108
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,150
that remains on an exponential curve
of the order of

109
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,510
Uj, so the dissipated power
in the junction will be

110
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,690
of the order of U multiplied by IbSAT,
but if IbSAT

111
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,450
increases, the power increases
and you can click the

112
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,270
base-transmitter junction,
which often happens when

113
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,460
we increase, or go into saturation,
and the base transmitter

114
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,160
voltage wraps up, or increases.

115
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,870
What I just explain
here is absolutely valid

116
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,190
for a PNP transistor,
that is why we do not spend

117
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,790
time showing the PNP and NPN, because if I

118
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,740
take the same thing and I now apply it to

119
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,580
a,PNP transistor, I find myself with a

120
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,540
transistor, I take the symbol,
instead of talking

121
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,700
of Vbe as junction voltage, given that

122
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,792
the current enters the transmitter
and it exits through the base

123
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,890
and leaves through the collector,
this is the opposite direction of what

124
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,768
you see here,
well I speak of a Veb voltage.

125
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,460
I have to continue after,
when I talk about normal mode,

126
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,530
it's the same condition,
but instead of saying Vce must be

127
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,390
positive, this time I must say
Vec must be positive.

128
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,150
And saturation is the same,
because here it is equality

129
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,300
with 0, then I reverse
the direction of arrows in

130
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,840
this transistor, which always
leads me to exactly the

131
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,360
same rules that I apply.
As well here and there you

132
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,300
find the same laws,
you invert the direction of

133
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,510
the vectors base-transmitter,
transmitter-base and as for the

134
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,580
current direction,
and the same for output currents

135
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,600
therefore the current of the
collector-transmitter and voltage

136
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,912
between transmitter and collector.
There you go.

137
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,740
So we will not talk all the time of duality

138
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,880
between the two transistors
knowing that this transistor is

139
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,136
just a transistor whose laws are the same,

140
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,550
but simply the directions of voltage
and current are different.

141
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,150
The bipolar transistor
could be used also in

142
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,710
logic circuits.

143
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,460
Here, we will talk of the transistor
in the blocked state and the saturated state.

144
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,810
We have seen that saturation
can happen to this

145
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,620
transistor and it behaves
with a short-circuit,

146
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,520
rather there is a voltage between
the collector-transmitter equal to 0.

147
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,960
So it's like a closed switch.

148
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,808
It is said that there is a
short-circuit between collector and

149
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,300
transmitter, it is equivalent to say that
the collector-transmitter

150
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,470
voltage is equal to 0
and when one locks the

151
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,000
transistor, the transistor
is simply where you can

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,860
remove it, if  the Vbe voltage
is lower than a voltage

153
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,832
junction, your transistor
is completely useless.

154
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,390
You can remove it from
your system, so it is

155
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,030
symbolized by an open switch.

156
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,580
So then, as we talked
about NPN transistor, we can

157
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,368
also talk of the PNP transistor.

158
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,740
And we end up with the same thing we had

159
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,890
presented just before,
instead of saying Vbe,

160
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,144
we say Veb and as for the ec voltage
instead of saying ce

161
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,690
but the modes of operation do not change.

162
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,510
We block a transistor
by applying a voltage

163
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,080
less than J, we saturate it
on the condition that its output voltage,

164
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,780
we circulate a current in a way

165
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,400
that the collector-transmitter
voltage drop stretches towards

166
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,480
0 and the transistor
behaves like a closed circuit.

167
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,910
And it allows me to use
the bipolar transistor in

168
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,620
digital applications.

169
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,520
So we may have logic gates, besides the

170
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,840
bipolar transistors were
the sources of the TLT gates

171
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,300
transistor logic transistor, before the

172
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,180
MOS transistor came to replace it to make

173
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,232
logic circuits that are much more efficient.

174
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,590
Why ? Because in this case,
there is a current

175
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,120
base and in the MOS transistor,
there is no base current,

176
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,648
therefore the control voltage
is sufficient to close,

177
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,584
or open, an MOS transistor.

178
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,930
However here, when closing
a transistor, so when

179
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,580
we stand here, it continues to draw
current as we had seen before.

180
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,450
And that is a current that is wasted.

181
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,350
It serves no purpose,
there is a power loss in

182
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,950
keeping the transistor closed.

183
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,930
To end this week's classes, I would ike us

184
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,050
to look at an example.

185
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,460
Through this example,
you'll see that we will

186
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,480
master the three modes of transistor uses and

187
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,220
show that a transistor,
in a diagram, may

188
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,190
be blocked in normal and saturated mode.

189
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,608
And all this is related
to what we put as resistance.

190
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,350
For example in this diagram,
I have put a resistor

191
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,000
in the collector and
I put a resistor in the base.

192
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,750
The transistor,
when it is used in the so-called

193
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,910
large signal model,
we had this approximation here.

194
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,220
We said, when we want to mention
the exponential law

195
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,560
of a transistor, it could be approximated
by blocking, or conduction.

196
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,080
So if you take the mesh that is here so

197
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,910
this mesh here, this one here,

198
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,560
you'll see that the voltage V1 is
equal to the voltage

199
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,704
which is there, which is Ib x Rb

200
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,950
to which I add the tension here

201
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,700
and this, we will approximate it to Uj.

202
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,320
It was this approximation, so I can

203
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,544
easily in this mesh which is created by

204
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:50,000
V1 = RbIb + Ube, since here
I have a linear law,

205
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,650
so this is Ohm's law and
there is an exponential law.

206
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,310
This exponential law,
if the transistor conducts,

207
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,540
put Uj, if the transistor blocks,
well this

208
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,900
voltage, I mean, it is not an

209
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,720
Uj voltage it is the Vbe voltage.

210
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,544
But what will happen with this mesh here?

211
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,890
We have seen that if I am here, on this law,

212
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,850
so I have a VBE voltage
which is less than UJ,

213
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,700
I'm here, it can not be an Ib,
the transistor is

214
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,000
blocked, no current flowing
in either Ic or in Ie or in Ib.

215
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,730
So voltage V1 here is the same
that I would see here.

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,920
If Ib is 0, if you put Ib = 0,
then IbRb = 0

217
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,300
therefore this voltage drop is equal to 0,
therefore the

218
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,520
potential difference
that you see here is the same

219
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,848
potential difference here.

220
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:44,000
And that condition is achieved when your

221
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,490
transistor does not meet
a junction voltage

222
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,000
allowing it to conduct, and that's it.

223
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,160
If Vbe is less than Uj,
at that time, you can

224
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,730
just remove what I noted and

225
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,470
we will see what happens
with this transistor.

226
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,610
That is if your transistor is here, you can

227
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,610
simply fall into the condition
where the transistor is

228
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,000
blocked and blocked mean,
the model, the transistor

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,270
disappear, I remove it,
it's a blocked transistor.

230
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,800
So the model of a blocked transistor
is nothing at all

231
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,900
it is ... we are here, there is no Ib,

232
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,580
there is no Ie, there is no Ic,
it has justbeen erased.

233
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,560
So if you put your fingers here to see the

234
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,016
Voltage V2, well V2 is nothing
other than Vcc.

235
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,930
And if you look V1, well V1 on this side or

236
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,450
that side is the same
given the current here is 0.

237
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,870
And like that, when we say,
a transistor in a blocked state,

238
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,570
it is simply an equivalent diagram,
it is removed from the circuit.

239
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,830
Therefore the blocking of
the transistor when Vbe is less than

240
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,728
Uj, that's what I just said,
Ic = Ie = Ib = 0.

241
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,170
And V1 is less than Uj,
this voltage drop is zero.

242
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,890
This voltage and this same voltage
here are the same because

243
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,600
Ib = 0 so this potential
is equal to this potential and

244
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,000
we said just now, and we have seen that V2

245
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,770
is equal to Vcc because
there is no current flowing

246
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,790
thus the current that passes
Ic through the Rc resistor or

247
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:24,752
this voltage drop here,
that's VRc = 0.

248
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,910
Therefore this voltage is equal to this

249
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,870
voltage here.

250
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,816
We will now start looking at when
Vbe is of the order of Uj.

251
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:39,000
So your transistor begins to conduct.

252
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,088
If your transistor begins to conduct,
the more you raise V1,

253
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:46,070
the more the current Ib will increase.

254
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,940
The more you will have
a current Ic that increases with

255
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,040
more Ie which is equal to Ic, so we're

256
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,030
looking at this transistor as
if there are two

257
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,560
mesh and that's how it should be analyzed.

258
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,950
So if someone shows you
a diagram as this, you

259
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,408
must look at what is on this side
compared to what is on the other side.

260
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:09,090
That is the entrance to your

261
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,820
transistor, this is where you control it.

262
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,740
This is the output of your transistor
where you observe

263
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,390
the voltage V2 which is proportional
to the voltage VRC,

264
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,200
of course, because the sum
of the two is equal to VCC.

265
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,350
So if you look at this transistor, you always start

266
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,000
by the control junction, or by the part where

267
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,490
we're .. we said it is an

268
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,910
electron tap, so that's where I'll control the tap.

269
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,184
So this is where I'll change
this voltage VBE

270
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,648
for a current to begin flowing.

271
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,480
Of course, the change
in Vbe is extremely low,

272
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,336
it is of the order of UJ, but we are talking
about changes of millivolt.

273
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:51,670
This is less than UT, and UT is

274
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,940
26 millivolts, so the thermodynamic
voltage of the transistor.

275
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,660
So when we vary VVE with very little

276
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,390
variations, well we will
observe the following.

277
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,800
So when Vbe is equal to UJ,
I'll take the mesh

278
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,940
here and I'll write

279
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,930
V1 equal, it is a vector, at Ib

280
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,848
multiplied by RB, the more
I'll make this approximation,

281
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,680
the VBE order of magnitude will be

282
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,256
of this approximation in
large-signals equal to UJ.

283
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,910
When you look at this,
you will say, of course,

284
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,100
when my transistor begins
to conduct, it will have IB.

285
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,640
Well IB will pass, it will generate
a current IB.

286
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
So there we analyzed
what happens to this side.

287
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,090
We will again look at it in  more details.

288
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,192
This is what I just calculate,
V1 = IbRb + UJ.

289
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,410
And there I can talk about
a current IB, and this current IB

290
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:08,368
depends on V1 and
this approximation UJ divided by RB.

291
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:11,552
Of course, the resistance RB
is extremely important.

292
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,710
If we would not have put RB here,
we would have ended up

293
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,830
controlling the voltage V1
that comes directly

294
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,430
in base-transmitter,
it is impossible to do because you

295
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,020
have an exponential variation of
the current with respect to this voltage.

296
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,540
But when we look
at it here we're saying

297
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,410
Ib is equal to the voltage V1 minus

298
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,840
some constant UJ.

299
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,610
And it remains the law of ohm RBIB
that we see, so it's Ib

300
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,460
this voltage divided by the resistor Rb.

301
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,280
And here I can talk of this
law provided that I

302
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,130
verify that V2 is necessarily
greater than 0.

303
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,590
If I do not check it, well I can not write

304
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,736
this law, that means
that my transistor is saturated.

305
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,610
If I made such a calculation
and I check, I can

306
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,140
even put the numerical values
​​I have here and

307
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,600
see what the current going
through my transistor is

308
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,660
with respect to a given voltage.

309
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,460
We said we analyze what is
on this side and

310
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,190
now we will analyze
what is on the other side.

311
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:17,500
So we looked at the control part,
we will look

312
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,904
at how the transistor output, V2,
which is nothing other than Vce.

313
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:27,400
In this case, it's

314
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,976
V2, it is between collector and transmitter.

315
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,040
So this voltage here, V2,
I only have to take the

316
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,460
vector Vcc from here to here,

317
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:49,600
which is equal to IcRc,
so here I have IcRc + V2.

318
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,744
And that's what I wrote here,

319
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,056
So Vcc = IcRc + V2.

320
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,432
In other words, V2 = Vcc-IcRc.

321
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,490
And I know that this current Ic,
if my transistor

322
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:08,656
is in normal mode,
is proportional to β x Ib,

323
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,180
that's what I'm doing here, I replace it.

324
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,140
Sure I can write, if V2 is greater than 0,

325
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,830
so it is in the condition
that C2 is strictly positive.

326
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,670
And once I have that, I can replace Ib

327
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,390
that I have just calculated,
Ib was calculated

328
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,240
in this mesh, we are bringing
it back towards

329
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,490
the exit through Ic and there,
I really wrote all

330
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,170
I can draw as Kirchoff law
that allows me to write

331
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,290
all voltages and current in an

332
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,160
operation mode with the output
voltages in respect to the input voltage.

333
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,448
Remember that in Ib hides

334
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,350
V1 and that's what I'll do now.

335
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,540
This is what I wrote at the beginning
for this mesh and

336
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,650
for this second mesh here, I just wrote this.

337
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,830
And we saw that the current Ib
is the link between the two.

338
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,540
This is what connects the output
to the input because it will

339
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,900
be at the output multiplied
by β to give Ic and I

340
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,000
will replace it here and
I get a relationship

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,336
in which I see that V2, F2V1,
which is my goal.

342
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,660
I would like to do
a transfer function in which

343
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,500
I put a voltage V1 and I want
to see the voltage V2

344
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,830
with the transistor which
may be in all these modes.

345
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,480
So I replaced this by this and I get this.

346
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,808
So once replaced Ib in there,
it gives me the relationship.

347
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,360
I'll let you check, you're going

348
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,700
to end up with a relationship
in which you have

349
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,430
β values, remember
that it is a given transistor,

350
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:55,140
So we gave a β = 100,
we were given a resistance

351
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,600
value of 10 kilohms
and a collector resistor

352
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,660
of 1 kilohm and we supply with
a voltage source of 5 volts.

353
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:13,520
And we get a voltage
V2 = Vcc - 10 V1 -J =
V2 AVce.

354
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:16,610
It is this voltage here,
collector transmitter, and

355
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:21,550
we would like to check what
value of V1, or what

356
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:27,200
is the limit value of V1
for which V2 is not equal to 0.

357
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,000
What I'm saying is
extremely important because

358
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
now in reality we see,
what will happen

359
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,510
with your layout, if you write
that law and you

360
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,100
replace with the values
​​we have here βRcRb by their

361
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,000
value, you find V2 is equal to Vcc,

362
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,860
remember that this is 5 volts,
10 x UJ, so it's

363
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,496
10 x 07 volts

364
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,240
and - 10 x V1, it will depend
on the value of V1.

365
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,568
And all this will give you the Vce voltage.

366
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,910
Obviously, if you have some

367
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,670
V1 that you put in here
that gives you this equal to 0,

368
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:20,112
it's the limit value,
so VCE becomes equal to 0 if V1 = 1.2.

369
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,690
So less than 1.2, you are sure that your

370
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,400
transistor has a strictly positive V2 voltage.

371
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,480
If you have V1 = 1.2 volts, you will get a

372
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,180
relationship in which
the voltage V2 will be equal to 0.

373
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,850
And who did it? It's you.

374
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,456
Because you chose a resistor RC
which is 1 kilo ohm.

375
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,520
You applied voltage here.

376
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,000
If you put a vector here, you say

377
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,410
this vector is Rc x Ic that gives you the

378
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,860
VRc voltage, know that

379
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,520
this parameter RcIc,
which is equal to VRc,plus

380
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,400
Ic increases, look at
what happens with this vector.

381
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,120
You are about to increase
this current, voltage and

382
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,840
the current in a resistor follows.

383
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,832
Look, this voltage increases,
increases, increases.

384
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:18,910
During that time, the voltage V2

385
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,680
drops, drops, drops, drops, until you

386
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,840
apply on V2 = 0, and you push
your transistors in saturation.

387
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,700
As long as you are with
a voltage IcRc which

388
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,410
allows this tension
not to crush the voltage V2

389
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,420
so that it becomes 0, you are sure your

390
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,696
transistor is in normal mode.

391
00:23:39,712 --> 00:23:42,144
So your transistor gives
you a current source, here.

392
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,510
Ic remains a source of current.

393
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,060
It was said that if I want
to replace this diagram by its

394
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,950
earlier model, I only have to take a source

395
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,730
voltage I call UJ.

396
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,490
I refer you to the table
that had been drawn before.

397
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,152
We place a
controlled current source, here.

398
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:05,792
And this controlled current source
is the source of your current.

399
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,448
Here you have Ie.

400
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:15,584
And here you have a current Ic = β x Ib.

401
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:18,350
Look, if you remove this transistor and you

402
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,120
put this in its place,
you will see what happens with

403
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,220
your circuit in normal mode.

404
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:28,270
But the more you increase Ib,
the more you will increase

405
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:32,000
Ic, the greater the voltage drop
across Rc increases.

406
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,600
And it will push V2 to stretch to 0.

407
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,950
But when you have crushed, V2 is equal to

408
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,784
0, know that your transistor,
is no more this.

409
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,050
You can remove it and replace it with the

410
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,420
famous diagram that we showed too, that I will

411
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,952
show right after.

412
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,000
There is a short-circuit
between collector-transmitter.

413
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,550
And then if you look at what is happening
in this mesh here, whenever

414
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,040
you increase V1, you will increase Ib.

415
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,500
Ic no longer follows,
there is no more this relationship.

416
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,550
So Ie will increase, of course.

417
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,650
And as you continue to increase,
Ib increases, and you are

418
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,060
just in this mesh that will push Ib

419
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,280
to increase, and you no longer
have a transistor effect,

420
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,736
it is replaced by a short-circuit.

421
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:20,450
Therefore the saturation of
a transistor is not a fact related

422
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,340
to the transistor,it is the circuit in which you

423
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:27,936
have set it , and the values ​​of elements
that impose this saturation.

424
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,480
I would like to draw your attention
to this factor of 10, that

425
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,110
I see here, with a minus sign in front.

426
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,780
So if you look V2F2V1, what we want to

427
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,136
get, is a DC component.

428
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:44,864
This, is 5+7.

429
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:50,810
So we have here a completely
DC component, it will not change,

430
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,064
it's always like that.

431
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,952
- 10 x V1.

432
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:56,960
So every time you increase

433
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:03,360
V1, you subtract from that amount
an amount 10 x V1.

434
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,416
But remember this 10 x V1.

435
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:11,740
Thus, V2 is associated with 10,
in absolute value,

436
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,050
compared to V1, and that's
what we will call later

437
00:26:14,112 --> 00:26:16,144
the gain of your transistor.

438
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:20,110
And this is where your transistor
will work as an amplifier.

439
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,670
We will see it afterwards.

440
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,240
Here is your transistor.

441
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,190
If you did what I said just now,

442
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,490
you have increased the current
such that V2

443
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,720
is short-circuited by the fact
that Rc has become very large.

444
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:40,080
So V2 = 0 = Vce,
your transistor is indeed saturated.

445
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:42,790
And if your transistor is in saturation,

446
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,010
what will happen in
this mesh is it's no longer an

447
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,300
Ic control mesh.

448
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,500
You are obliged to add
the concept of saturation,

449
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,144
saturation, saturation,
and you find yourself in this.

450
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,390
You are with your
saturated transistor, and

451
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:07,488
there, I SATRb + UJ, this,

452
00:27:07,488 --> 00:27:09,600
you must always remember
that the UJ approximation

453
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,790
always works, because
it is the exponential that is

454
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,984
always in the order of UJ.

455
00:27:14,288 --> 00:27:17,712
So you write IbSAT = V1 - UJ / Rb.

456
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,230
And then, instead of your transistor, you take

457
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,790
the model that was right before,
and replace

458
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:29,500
your transistor by a short-circuit
between the collector

459
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,150
and transmitter, and between the base

460
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,392
and transmitter, you have a voltage UJ.

461
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,720
So you take this, you put
in the place of your

462
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,500
transistor, and you will end up with

463
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,610
UJ between the base-transmitter ,
and you write this law here.

464
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,720
Whereas, on the other side, when you have a

465
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,608
short-circuit between
collector and transmitter, look at

466
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:56,200
this transistor, it's a short-circuit here.

467
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:59,184
So that V2 = 0.

468
00:27:59,536 --> 00:28:02,192
So there is, between Vcc and the ground,

469
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,208
just the resistor Rc, which is
traversed by this current IcSAT.

470
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,928
So it comes here, and we have
IcSAT x Rc = Vcc.

471
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,000
And that's what I write here.

472
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,180
So the current IcSAT, it will become
constant, it can not increase.

473
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,890
It is no longer controlled by
the base current, it is

474
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,440
equal to a constant which
depends simply on the value

475
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,450
of Rc and power supply, finally inversely

476
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,592
proportional to Rc
and the supply voltage Vcc.

477
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,620
In this law, there is no more equality.

478
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,220
And here you can make
the same calculation as earlier

479
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,700
and find that when V1 is higher than 1.2 volts we

480
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,104
calculated with respect to the voltage V2,

481
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:47,290
you find V2 = 0
when V1 is greater than a

482
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,170
voltage which is proportional
to the values ​​that we put here.

483
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,690
And your transistor can
no longer be used in an

484
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,230
analog circuit,
it is rather in a digital circuit,

485
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,192
because it gives zero voltage beyond

486
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,232
a certain value.

487
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,130
Finally, I take the same circuit, and I

488
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,150
begin to analyze in the three cases.

489
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,750
If the Vbe voltage, is there, that is

490
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:21,696
proportional to V1, so if
the voltage Vbe, there ... sorry,

491
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,856
if V1 is less than UJ,
there is no IB current,

492
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:29,000
your transistor is blocked .

493
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,910
And we said at that time,
the equivalent diagram

494
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,170
of your transistor is really this.

495
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,340
You remove it,
that's in the case you are here.

496
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,016
Here there is an error.

497
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:46,640
It is the voltage V1, not the voltage V2.

498
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,100
So if the voltage V1
is lower than UJ, you

499
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,352
end up with a model of
a transistor, we remove.

500
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,690
Then after, we will look
at what will happen when

501
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,460
one begins to make the transistor conduct.

502
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,540
So it is here, in this part,
between the blocking and

503
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,360
saturation, there is a part here.

504
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,160
There is a linear relationship between
V2 and V1, and we calculated it.

505
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,730
The linear voltage between
V1 and V2, I will continue to

506
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,300
correct the typo, that's V1.

507
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,270
So when V1 exceeds the voltage UJ, your

508
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:30,160
transistor, starts to conduct,
and it is in normal mode.

509
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,504
So this is a current source.

510
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,864
And just now, we released
this expression, if you recall.

511
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,660
And I emphasized the concept
of 10 x V1, with a minus sign,

512
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,730
and it can be seen here.

513
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,080
So you will end up with a voltage V2

514
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,940
proportional to -10 x V1
plus some constant.

515
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,390
This is what makes the line
you see here

516
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,840
don't pass through the origin,
because there is a DC component.

517
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,810
Still, it has a slope that is equal to - 10.

518
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,080
Therefore the voltage V2
with respect to V1, is, there is a

519
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,410
minus sign, when one increases,
the other decreases.

520
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,500
And it multiplies the voltage V2 = 10 x V1.

521
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,696
It's awesome. We made an amp.

522
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:12,670
So what you put here,
you find it 10 times,

523
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:18,096
multiplied by what is in this diagram,
at the output V2.

524
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:19,350
And you find it reversed.

525
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,130
So if there is a sinusoidal voltage,
there will be

526
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,850
a 180 ° phase shift which
is due to the minus sign.

527
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,370
Now, when you arrive,
you continue to increase V1.

528
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,360
Then, the voltage V2 decreases,
there is the minus sign.

529
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,170
The voltage across Rc increases until

530
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,992
you get a voltage in which V2 = 0.

531
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:47,130
So your transistor is short-circuited.

532
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,380
If it is shorted-circuited, V2 = 0,
we are here, and your

533
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,020
transistor is saturated.

534
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,880
And when your transistor
is saturated, here we

535
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,472
can no longer bind Ic to Ib
because Ic is proportional

536
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,192
to a value Ic x Rc = Vcc.

537
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:05,264
This is what we just saw.

538
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,830
I would like to take the time
and insist on the

539
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,840
three modes seen here.

540
00:32:12,256 --> 00:32:17,150
Blocking, the so-called analog part of operation,

541
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,920
wherein we had an amplifier,
wherein the output voltage

542
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,330
is multiplied by a constant
which depends on the

543
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,260
Rc and Rb values,
which multiplies voltage V1.

544
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,590
This is where we will use the transistor

545
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:35,024
as an amplifier, and later we have
the transistor that is saturated.

546
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:38,340
So when I see this diagram here,
and I want to talk about a

547
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,810
transistor that is used as an amplifier,
that we will see

548
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,910
all along the course, later, always

549
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,030
check that your transistor
is not blocked or saturated.

550
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,408
If you remember these two words, you say:

551
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:53,000
"If my transistor is neither blocked
nor saturated, my transistor

552
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,830
is in normal operation ",
and it corresponds to its

553
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,840
use as an amplifier,
with the amplifier diagrams

554
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,630
we will study later.

555
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,840
However if your transistor is blocked or

556
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,890
saturated, your transistor is used,

557
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,940
simply as a digital circuit,
and it acts as an inverter.

558
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,528
If you inject a voltage V1,
a binary signal, which

559
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:22,710
oscillates between 1 and 0,
you will see a voltage V2

560
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,050
which is also binary.

561
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,240
It is as if you had done
a logic inverter set-up,

562
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,540
which is like this.

563
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,360
And what you put in binary state, you find

564
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,000
the opposite state,  so a 0 gives
us a 1 and 1 gives us a 0.

565
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,570
And that's it, it's
the behavior of your transistor,

566
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,000
when you are in the blocked
or saturated state.

567
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,050
If you want to use your transistor, if your

568
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:50,160
transistor is in normal mode, there you

569
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,010
go to put very low
voltage variations on V1,

570
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:59,380
it is less than the thermodynamic voltage

571
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,650
26 millivolts, and since
there is a slope, you will

572
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,080
find the linear output voltage,
which is the

573
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,464
voltage V2, which transforms
the variation V1

574
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:16,190
into a variation V2, which is
10 times higher, because

575
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,700
we have a multiplication factor
equal to 10.

576
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,030
But then that's where we see
the need to polarize the transistor.

577
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,390
One of the things that will be
discussed in great lengths,

578
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:30,580
is that if we want to have
a signal whose dynamic

579
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,600
or whose variation
is within a certain range, it

580
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,840
is necessary to impose to this
transistor a direct current and voltage.

581
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,216
So there will be a current
through the IC0 for

582
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,480
an IB0 current, and then there
will be a voltage V10,

583
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,860
which will allow it to be in a range that

584
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,520
all small variations imposed here turns

585
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,770
into a variation found in the output.

586
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,280
And we now talk of a voltage amplifier.

587
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,000
And this is an amp that has a gain.

588
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,110
To conclude and summarize
what we just saw, and

589
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,090
really set the idea on what is

590
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,910
an operating system of a transistor,
I want to take again the diagram.

591
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,500
In this diagram, I don't have,
but the resistor RC,

592
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,824
I took the transistor and I put
it between the supply voltage and ground.

593
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:17,220
It's of no use.

594
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:22,140
Do you understand that if I pull the current

595
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,720
from VCC and send it back
into the current in the ground,

596
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,940
generally, reading
current is very difficult?

597
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,360
It is read through a voltage, by Ohm's law.

598
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,096
So I have to put it in the resistance
to be able to see it .

599
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:36,750
But if you take this diagram and you say:

600
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,096
"I applied a voltage V1".

601
00:35:38,256 --> 00:35:39,072
Let me give you an example:

602
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:44,180
I put V1 is equal to perhaps
650 millivolts,

603
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,912
something of this magnitude,
and I see that there is an

604
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,392
IB current that will pass, therefore,
this junction is of the order of 0.6 to 0.7 volts.

605
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:53,150
Then I will have a current flowing.

606
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,870
Does V2 = 0?

607
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,448
No way. V2, in this case,
is always equal to VCC.

608
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,580
So this is a transistor that is
at all times in normal state.

609
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,470
It can, in no case, be saturated.

610
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:06,928
Why ? Because the voltage
V2 is constant and

611
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,832
strictly positive, and equal to VCC.

612
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,420
So this is just to show that if you have a

613
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,370
transistor, and you plug it like this,
so you have

614
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,840
a transistor that is useless,
because we can not

615
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,930
read the variation of the current.

616
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,410
I can increase V1 so I increases IC, but I have

617
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:29,088
not converted IC  into Ohm's law
to read it in the form of voltage.

618
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,050
So I have a current

619
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,640
that increases, but I can not observe it.

620
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:35,024
Now I'll take the same diagram.

621
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,560
But before moving on something, so I am

622
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,424
all the time here, I took V2 = VCC,
and if we say VCC

623
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:45,870
equal to 6 volts, so I'm here somewhere.

624
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,590
So this is a current increases.

625
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,410
Now if you increase V1,
you increase VBE,

626
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,890
then you're going
to have this decreasing curve.

627
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,040
And you are all the time
with a single point, so

628
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,760
you will change the current IC.

629
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,608
So if I increase V1, I'll raise the current IC.

630
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:06,920
And if I drop V1, I'll lower the current IC.

631
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,240
So I only observe current variation,

632
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,448
provided that I check it with an ammeter.

633
00:37:12,928 --> 00:37:16,224
I repeat the same thing, and I'll just

634
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:17,760
add a resistance here.

635
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:23,540
So I take this transistor, and I will, if

636
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,880
I calculate it like this
without adding to it a resistance,

637
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,740
by taking the numerical values
​​that are here,

638
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:35,200
I will end up with a current IB
which will give me a current IC = IE.

639
00:37:35,488 --> 00:37:37,830
Regarding the digital application I have

640
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:41,000
put with the values ​​given here,
I think the

641
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,768
base current for a transistor
which has a β = 200 is

642
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:47,350
of the order of 2.3 microamps,
to give me a current

643
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,808
200 times greater,
thus equal to 0.46 milliampere.

644
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,360
But it's of no use to me,
because I could not read the current.

645
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,000
I will add a resistor here.

646
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,140
When I add a resistor here,
it changes the data.

647
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,020
Now, current IC has not changed.

648
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,608
I go back, I have a current IC = 0.46

649
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,392
and now I converted this current
in a resistor which I inserted here.

650
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,590
And this resistor, will convert this current

651
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,296
into voltage at its terminals
which is equal IC x RC.

652
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,336
This I can read.

653
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:29,008
This I can well take and even inject into

654
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:30,520
another transistor stage here.

655
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,110
But it changes the data.

656
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:37,420
Is this tension very big to

657
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,620
be of the order of magnitude of VCC,
which cancels V2?

658
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,420
And it saturates my transistor.

659
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,520
Or it is small and it puts
the transistor in the linear region?

660
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,430
And that is something extremely important, so

661
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,032
it's me  who decided
the resistor RC value, which

662
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:57,088
I inserted, and it is my decision
that RC x IC will have some value.

663
00:38:57,408 --> 00:38:59,840
And there, in that case, we can

664
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,050
take that same set-up and make
the same calculation as earlier.

665
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,768
I took a resistor RC and I put 10 kilo ohms.

666
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,110
There, this side,
I have not changed anything.

667
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,240
You remember, we said, we reason always

668
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,660
on this side and that side.

669
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:23,320
I take that side and I write
the famous law of the

670
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,800
mesh that is here: IBRB + UJ = V1,
which is written here.

671
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,688
And I extract the value IB.

672
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,952
And I chose a value of RB: 10 kilo ohms.

673
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,344
What will give me, in this case,
230 microamps.

674
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:41,670
So I have 230 microamps
that will circulate here.

675
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,784
If this set-up was in normal mode, IC

676
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:54,416
should have been equal to
β x 230 microamps here.

677
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:56,752
So times IB.

678
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,232
So that will give me a current IC, that

679
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,530
I just have to calculate with the β
which is equal to 200 in the example,

680
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,568
it will give me 23 milliamps.

681
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,456
I imposed myself 23 milliamps here.

682
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:15,000
23 milliamps which will circulate
in a resistor,

683
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,656
I gave a value of 10 kilo .

684
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:20,720
If I take 23 milliamps, I put in a

685
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,968
a resistance of 10 kilohms, the Ohm's law
says 23 x 10 kilohms

686
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:30,250
they will lead you to
a voltage drop, or rather

687
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,880
you write this mesh from here to here,
you say

688
00:40:32,928 --> 00:40:36,400
VCC = RCIC+ V2.

689
00:40:37,664 --> 00:40:43,280
Or you put V2 = VCC - RCIC,

690
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:48,030
and you write that 23 milliamps,
which multiplies the

691
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,880
resistance of 10 kilohms here,
and you're going

692
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,008
to get a voltage drop on V2 = - 225 volts.

693
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:56,144
So it's impossible.

694
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,790
When you feed a transistor
with 5 volts,

695
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,600
there is a supposition we just made,
which is not

696
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,570
correct, that is to say β IB is valid.

697
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:08,144
Why ? Because I have found
that by feeding 5 volts

698
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:13,152
V2 = - 225 volts, so it's not possible.

699
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:14,890
So there is an assumption that I just

700
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,320
did which is not correct:
this is IC = β x IB.

701
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,130
Why ? Because when
I added that RC and this RC,

702
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,370
by a current going through,
imposed V2 = 0, you

703
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:30,690
remember that this voltage drop
is very large, and

704
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,950
it saturated the transistor.

705
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,688
So in reality, V2 = VCE = 0.

706
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,390
So that law is not at all correct,
in this example here.

707
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,110
So you will end up
with something else instead,

708
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,128
you'll say ICSAT is limited.

709
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,530
The current here can never reach the value

710
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,310
I calculated here, it is certainly lower.

711
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:54,180
Why ? Because the maximum
value of this current is

712
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,420
when the transistor saturates.

713
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,390
So here, I have a short-circuit,
and I can write

714
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:07,936
at this point, V2 = 0 and ICSAT x RC
can not be equal to VCC.

715
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,776
And that's the maximum I can get.

716
00:42:10,016 --> 00:42:14,040
So it will give me a ICSAT current
that will be a

717
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,432
constant equal to VCC/RC.

718
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:20,490
And this is the maximum current
that I can have.

719
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,650
And when I get to this current here,
it stabilizes here.

720
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,480
The transistor is no longer
a current source, and the

721
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,870
transistor will act in saturated mode,
and I can continue

722
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:34,310
to increase IB, but it has no
impact on the output.

723
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,740
So I find a current of 0.5 milliamps,

724
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,090
so I am far from
these 23 milliamps I assumed

725
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,460
to be, if the transistor
had not been saturated.

726
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,420
Then that is right.

727
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,360
And now, if I want
to calculate IB, I have no

728
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,336
right divide ICSAT by β.

729
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:54,000
I have to take the mesh
that is here, and say

730
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:56,590
what is the value of IB.

731
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,032
Beside, it was calculated, it is there.

732
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:05,408
And it is sure that IE is equal to the sum
of this and this, that will give IE.

733
00:43:05,456 --> 00:43:07,840
It is not at all equal to ICSAT.

734
00:43:09,104 --> 00:43:12,780
I hope that with that example,
you managed to

735
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,740
understand that it is
the values ​​you give

736
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:20,110
yourself that can saturate
a transistor or bring

737
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,420
your transistor to operate
in normal mode, or block it.

738
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,330
It's you who decide it,
based on these different

739
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,270
values ​of resistance ​you have chosen.

740
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:33,240
This week, we saw all modes of

741
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,130
transistor operation, we studied in details

742
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,020
the different electrical
characteristics of the transistor,

743
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,000
and we drew useful
conclusions as

744
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,010
introduction, to show that a transistor,
of course,

745
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,540
has modes of operation
which are mainly dependent

746
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,352
on the circuits in which we will put them.

747
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,780
And this is especially the
calculations of elements and

748
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,248
components that we will put
around that will allow us

749
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,488
to make electrical diagrams that hold.

750
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,176
Either you want to use it in
analog mode and we made

751
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:07,360
an amp, and must polarize, and it will have
a gain, and it is a linear gain.

752
00:44:07,504 --> 00:44:08,848
Either we use it in the

753
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,890
blocked or saturated mode
and there, it would be useful to make

754
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,570
an open or closed switch ,
so useful for logic circuits.
