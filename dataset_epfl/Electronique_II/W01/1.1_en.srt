1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,573
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,680
We're going to address
the study of the transistors.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,480
Of course there are different
types of transistors and

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,890
mainly the bipolar transistor
and the MOS transistor.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,490
The bipolar transistor is
absolutety known for its

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,820
very educational features. We can easily

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,140
understand how we can put

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,420
a bipolar transistor in a typically analog circuit.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,650
The MOS transistor has very
simple qualifications

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,770
but when it comes to digital circuit it's a bit

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,860
more complicated than
the bipolar transistor when it is

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,310
in analog circuit. So in this course we will

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,470
mainly focus on bipolar transistor

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,850
compared to the MOS transistor,
but at the same time we will

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,470
look at the MOS transistor and analyze it's use

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,310
in analog circuits also.

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,090
To begin with bipolar transistor we will first

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,700
tackle it by analyzing
the structure of the transistor,

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,640
the symbols we use to present it,

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,800
and then we will move on to
its electrical characteristics.

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,300
It is very important, it is absolutely a very

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,690
important part in the analysis
of all the transistors because

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,780
this is what will help us to understand later on

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,173
the true effect called "transistor effect".

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,660
And then you need to model the transistor.

26
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,010
The transistor is made
to be used in a circuit

27
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,810
where there will be continuous supply,

28
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,820
this is what we call the DC model of transistors that will be

29
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,720
used in this kind of transistor polarization and

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,280
continuous supplies,
direct currents, direct voltages.

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,020
And we also have the AC model, it is

32
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,810
also known as the increase model
or small signals model.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,270
This is the case of a signal which varies with

34
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,950
time that we'd like to superimpose
on a continuous component

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,730
and both models together will lead us

36
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,500
into analyzing a complete transistors circuit.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,240
And once we are done and we understand what

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,550
happens with these two models
and we handled them

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,540
in exercises, we will move to

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,890
the second order effects
with bipolar transistor.

41
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,120
And we will see for example
the base width modulation effect

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,950
or end with the

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,800
thermal behavior of this transistor.

44
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,506
So when you look at this,
you'll see that there is NPN.

45
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:42,380
In this course we will
not analyze all of the

46
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,370
physics of semiconductors
and analyze what happens

47
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,420
with the PN junction.
In other courses of the same nature,

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,400
you have plenty of courses
that are either in physics

49
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,590
or in electronics where we

50
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,040
will explain what is a PN junction and what

51
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,653
happens within a PN junction and
what is the transistor effect

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
and how it is made.

53
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,230
So the aim of this course
is to focus especially

54
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,850
on the electronic use and circuiting

55
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,266
of transistors, and make
especially an analog circuit.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,040
So when I take this symbol
you see here, this is

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,180
silicon in which we have created two PN junctions

58
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,000
and we talk of an NPN transistor, it looks like

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,426
a type N silicone sandwich

60
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:28,830
Here, it is type N.

61
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,810
So in the middle we put
the type P and we end up with

62
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,580
a transmitter, a base and a collector
and the symbol is this.

63
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,800
We will understand what it means, why we called

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
this transmitter, why we called this collector,

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,520
and why there is a base.
First you have to know one thing,

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,230
if you take the symbol that you see here,

67
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,890
it is an arrow, the arrow indicates

68
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,000
the direction of current flow.

69
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,170
Thus in Switzerland we use
an arrow that shows

70
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,470
where the current passes and
in which direction, and of course

71
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,510
in Switzerland we have a convention
which shows that

72
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,540
the current is latent, the current and
the electrons are in opposite directions.

73
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,450
In other countries they keep
the same direction of the arrows.

74
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,300
Here electrons flow from the emitter to the

75
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,020
collectors, hence the name transmitter:
it transmits electrons

76
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
which will be collected in the collector.

77
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,290
However the arrow here indicates
the direction of current flow.

78
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,700
The transistor has two accesses that will

79
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,100
be used by charges, so it's outlet, it's the

80
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,270
collector and the transmitter
and the base is the access that

81
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,780
allows me to control
what will happen in the

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,380
transistor between
the base-transmitter junction or

83
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,560
possibly the base-collector junction .

84
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,630
So it must be remembered,
the collector and the transmitter

85
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,790
will be used later as output ports.

86
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,070
The base-transmiter junction
or the voltage between base

87
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,450
transmitter will allow
us to control the transistor.

88
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,030
This same transistor may be
constructed with a PNP structure,

89
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:15,920
that is to say, if you take

90
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,840
the same structure

91
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,780
instead of putting a P layer
between the two

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,390
N layers, you put two P layers and in the

93
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,950
middle you put an N layer, and then you

94
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,010
end up with the same
transmitter base collector access.

95
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,250
The symbol looks exactly
like the one we saw

96
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,750
with the NPN and this is the PNP.

97
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,060
There is a fundamental difference
and it is in the current direction.

98
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,510
Look here, the current is going out
of the transmitter, here the

99
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,690
current enters the transmitter and
goes out through the collector,

100
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,360
so the arrow always indicates
the direction of current flow,

101
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,893
so similarly here we will see
current entering, and the collector.

102
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:07,480
Otherwise the use of
the transistor remains the same.

103
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,466
Later you will see, when
we'll talk of the collector

104
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:18,080
transmitter that is because
the two terminals of the transistor will

105
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:19,240
be used at the output.

106
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,790
But you must know one thing
that the impedance seen

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,880
on the transmitter side will be
very low, the resistivity seen

108
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,640
on the transmitter will be very low,
contrary to what

109
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,600
we see as resistivity of the collector,
on both sides

110
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,550
it will be very high. So we have
two accesses for output

111
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,370
and both accesses behave
with output impedances

112
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,190
that will be completely different.

113
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,226
This is what will allow us later to make

114
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,400
set-ups of completely different nature.

115
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,060
And later you will see we need to use both

116
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,210
transistors because
if you see this style of set-ups,

117
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,070
they are set-ups in which we may connect

118
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,090
both transmitters together.

119
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,630
And these two transmitters allow us to take the

120
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,870
NPN transistor that will be connected
to the PNP transistor.

121
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,350
And we will take a current
that goes down in this direction,

122
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,330
it goes through the transmitter
and enters one transmitter,

123
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,650
it exits through the collector
of the other, so we

124
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,900
speak of supplementary set-ups. This is what will

125
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,550
enable us make electronic circuits whether

126
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,470
in the analog domain or in the digital domain.

127
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,310
That's the reality.

128
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,730
What you have seen before was just a

129
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,020
way to explain that there
is an NPN transistor and a

130
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,060
PNP transistor and the symbols you have seen,

131
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,730
so the two symbols, or rather
the physical implementation of the

132
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,160
transistor do not present the reality.

133
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,773
However, this is a diagram of an NPN transistor

134
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,670
which is fully integrated and
we only see the transistor,

135
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,610
we will look at the layers, you have here

136
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,170
an N layer, here a P layer
and here you have an N layer.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,100
But when you look at the access to the transistor,

138
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,610
you see it on the surface, that is the transistor

139
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,410
is realised according to this vector
or this blue arrow, we see

140
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,490
the NPN transistor, but when you just connect

141
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,140
this transistor to the outside world we see that we

142
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,210
take the transmitter from
the surface of its various

143
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,130
layers formed from
a silicon substrate, there you

144
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,400
also see the base and the collector despite

145
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,910
the transistors production being where I am

146
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,400
framing, so we see the NPN.

147
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,610
And yet if you look closely, you will

148
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,440
realize that the base width , when I pass

149
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,600
from the transmitter layer
to the collector layer,

150
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,650
the base width is in this small part here.

151
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,480
And this small part defines the thickness of the

152
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,620
base, an extremely important
parameter on what we'll later

153
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,520
call the current gain,
the β of the transistor.

154
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,050
So the more the base is thin the better the

155
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,000
current gain of a transistor is.

156
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,270
Of course there are
other things that degrade with

157
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,420
this, but it is not the moment
to talk about them.

158
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,030
The transmitter and collector are different in

159
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,680
geometry and doping that is
really in terms of geometry.

160
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,150
Just observe, see how small the transmitter is

161
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,400
and see how huge the collector is,

162
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,050
where the base is set,
where we have put the transmitter.

163
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,750
This means that
this transistor despite it's

164
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,260
showing us a PN junction here

165
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:44,946
and another junction seen here, PN,

166
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,620
which is on that side, well the two junctions are

167
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,280
not symmetrical.
And that will be reflected

168
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,210
strongly on the symbol you see here.

169
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,373
So when I take the base and
the transmitter I have a PN junction.

170
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,600
When I look at the base
and collector I have also a

171
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,950
PN junction but the
two junctions are geometrically

172
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,220
not the same, and
the same is for the doping.

173
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,590
The doping of the transmitter is

174
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,280
much stronger than
the doping of the collector, so

175
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,220
physically what I wanted to say is that

176
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,740
this transistor is absolutely not symmetrical.

177
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,840
If you want to use the collector
instead of the transmitter

178
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,240
you will have a transistor
that will be completely

179
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,240
degraded and it is a serious mistake.

180
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,500
And you need to be careful
and manufacturers

181
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:37,800
when they encapsulate it
they clearly show us where

182
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,710
the transmitter and the collector are.
So we cannot turn it

183
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,350
in one direction or another, it is essential

184
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,740
to respect the different pins or different accesses

185
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,730
to the transistor and they are made
on the transistor housing.

186
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,470
I'll take the transistor as it is and

187
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,130
take some time to explain this.

188
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,460
I will use this symbol to explain what

189
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,000
we wanted to do with a transistor in general.

190
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,590
So a transistor when we see it we see a

191
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,866
base-transmitter junction and we have
the collector on one side we see

192
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:17,580
I drew a current between the base
and the transmitter and

193
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:19,500
I have shown that there
is a current in the collector.

194
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,470
I just want to show you something you

195
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,670
know very well, I will draw a resistor.

196
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,600
With a resistor, you learned Ohm's law,

197
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,560
Ohm's law says that the current you see

198
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,420
between this and that is voltage U,
and this is

199
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,200
current I, and this is a resistor R.

200
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:50,146
You were told, Ohm's law says U equals RI.

201
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:54,650
So if I put my two fingers here, these

202
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,440
two fingers show a vector
which is the voltage

203
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,500
that is proportional to
a vector which is the current,

204
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,610
and between the two there
is a given resistivity and we'll

205
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,890
have a link between U and I.

206
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,000
So current and voltage are correlated
according to the value of resistance.

207
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,680
I'll come to the transistor,
we'll keep this figure in mind.

208
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:21,140
I want to create a component in which

209
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,490
I will be able to control
a current as I'm doing  here,

210
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,690
there I change U,I changes too
with it so I have the two

211
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,420
linked here, I'll do something else.

212
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,640
I'd like to put my two fingers here and my

213
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,400
other two fingers here and make sure that

214
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,340
I control  the voltage here between
the base and transmitter and there,

215
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,310
regardless of what happens
between the collector and

216
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,190
the transmitter, I would want my current
not to be affected by this.

217
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,020
So I can move the collector-transmitter
voltage but

218
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,200
the current Ic is only controlled
by Vbe, it is not

219
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,820
controlled by the voltage at the terminals,
so not like this.

220
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,780
So, you know this, this kind of symbols, if I

221
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
look at the transistor and then
I would like to know which

222
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,850
component, that when I look at a voltage at its

223
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,330
terminals, the voltage can move
without affecting the current,

224
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,280
you know it is about what
we call the current source.

225
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,280
So it is a symbol we drew like that, and we

226
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,000
said "there will be current in there"
when we apply

227
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,720
current, you can change this voltage and

228
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,840
this voltage will not affect the current
and we said it is

229
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,010
an infinite resistor,
and that's what we wanted

230
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,490
do with the transistor,
we wanted to create a kind of

231
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,330
current tap.

232
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,560
I change the Vbe amount and
I'll be able to control

233
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,040
the Ic current with it,
so for each voltage Vbe,

234
00:13:55,133 --> 00:14:00,306
I will find a current Ic and
they are not linked to the same terminals.

235
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:03,320
The voltage controls the current here,
but this voltage

236
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,580
there can move without affecting
the current Ic, and that's

237
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,740
the aim of those who created
the whole transistor phenomenon,

238
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,213
so any electronic which is based,

239
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:16,130
either on bipolar or MOS,
it is the same principle.

240
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,000
Current is controlled by voltage
and it is called

241
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:21,533
transconductance.

242
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,813
So we will create a component
in which there are two accesses

243
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,290
and with these two accesses,
there is a current source

244
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,560
and we draw the symbol of this current source

245
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,870
called controlled current source,
and this current source,

246
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,790
will provide us with a current
that passes and

247
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,730
this current, will depend on
a voltage where the two

248
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,390
are not related,

249
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,670
here I have the voltage and here
I have the current, and the symbol here.

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,110
So this is what the man wanted to do,

251
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,110
to find the three accesses
and on one side, I control

252
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,560
the current by a voltage and
we'll talk later of transconductance.

253
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,600
What did we manage to do?

254
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,100
So he was able to take this idea I just

255
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,250
presented, he found a law through

256
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,880
silicon and creating these different layers

257
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,530
I showed you earlier,
where the relationship between

258
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,830
Ic and Vbe,
this is the law that you see here.

259
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,470
Thus the analytical model
corresponds to a current which is

260
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,626
exponentially proportional
to the voltage Vbe.

261
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,390
So he will apply a voltage to Vbe

262
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:48,110
and will see that there is a law
which if you draw, you

263
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,770
will see suddenly, that from a certain

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,470
Vbe value, you will have a drastic increase,

265
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,420
it is an exponential and
it is modeled in this way.

266
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,380
There is a parameter inside, Is,
Is it is the

267
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,000
reverse current in the transistor.

268
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,850
Ut is a parameter called
thermodynamic voltage

269
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,840
that is bonded to silicon and Ut value

270
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,360
depends on the temperature, but

271
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,090
at room temperature, you have a voltage Ut

272
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,000
which is 26 mV at room temperature.

273
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,800
However this current Is depends
on the geometry.

274
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,300
And it changes from
one transistor to another,

275
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,630
is it a law that we will use oftenly?

276
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,730
No, not for the bipolar transistor,
you will see

277
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,830
why and we will make
a very important focus, why

278
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,040
this kind of analytic model
is hardly used when

279
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:45,000
we want to make a circuit.

280
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,020
So if you take this
exponential law and you

281
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,460
now plot the axis here, instead of

282
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,250
it being linear, here you replace
it with a logarithmic scale

283
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,200
and then you will see the following.

284
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,250
Here we see the same characteristic
Ic equals

285
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,430
Is(e^Vbe / Ut-1), when we plot

286
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,750
with the scale Ic becomes
a logarithmic scale,

287
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:17,510
and we find it is about a law,

288
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,360
a line, and this line allows us to easily

289
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,000
find the reverse current.

290
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,610
So you find this law here,
look when Vbe

291
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,840
equals 0, so I'm here. Where Vbe is 0,

292
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,730
So you replace it with 0
and you will find that the

293
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,320
current Ic you are measuring
in the transistor will be

294
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,280
negative again, which will be equal to -Is.

295
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,510
So when you look at a Vbe equals 0, and if you

296
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,930
have a very precise micro-ammeter,
you are able to

297
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,420
measure what is happening
with the parameter Is

298
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,500
and you can extract the value of Is.

299
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,470
Otherwise, if you plot the curve
and you plot

300
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,250
different points on it and
you extrapolate it

301
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,700
by the right that we see here
on that scale, the intersection

302
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,680
of this line here gives
you the order of magnitude of

303
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,250
current Is, and it is like
that in a laboratory that

304
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,730
we plot or we extract the value of Is,

305
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,880
the slope is 1/Ut so you

306
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,150
note that the 26 mV at

307
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,710
room temperature, you will also

308
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,670
extract this value.

309
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,410
That's just to show how we

310
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,000
measure a transistor,
and we show that this law

311
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,450
is a law that fits best with the transistor we

312
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,960
saw here.

313
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,573
I would like to take the same thing
and take this law,

314
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:50,730
and show that we often approximate it

315
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,430
by saying the -1
next to the exponential, I can

316
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,590
neglect it, so I can approximate it by this.

317
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,540
And now I'll go to an explanation that will

318
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,200
help us model the transistor.

319
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,530
Look at this graph and look at this one.

320
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,570
I think those who have studied
the diode before, they

321
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,860
understood that every time
we have an exponential component,

322
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,360
an exponential characteristic, we can

323
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,460
replace it with something
pretty crude that says

324
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,380
the exponential, here
I practically have an Ic current

325
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,220
equal to 0, and here I have
a drastic current increase

326
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,350
according to very few Vbe variations.

327
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,890
It turns out that in silicon, the voltage

328
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,010
junction, the voltage at which we begin to have

329
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,330
the sudden current increase, is called the

330
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,450
Uj tension and we talk of a junction voltage.

331
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,640
So to make things easier, when we're going to

332
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,520
make a test model of our transistor,
we'll go

333
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,750
from this model and we will use this model,
it is for this

334
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,350
I said earlier, we oftenly do not use

335
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,380
the exponential law beacuse we replace it

336
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,160
with a  linear segments law,
so we will say

337
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,100
that our transistor will be blocked for a Vbe voltage

338
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,010
lower than a threshold voltage called

339
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,850
the junction voltage, which is in the order,

340
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,030
of 0.7 V, and the current

341
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,250
increases sharply, so it can go to infinity

342
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,360
when the Vbe voltage is equal to Uj,
or is equal to this order of magnitude.

343
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,560
Be careful, this is valid only when

344
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,533
we talk of test model
and we will strongly insist on it.

345
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,840
So I have found a word that I will stick to

346
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,250
transistor, and you will retain it, we'll talk

347
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,840
of transistor blocking.

348
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,860
The transistor blocks when
the current Ic is equal to 0,

349
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,930
so when I'm here and in a very

350
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,730
sudden way, I show that regardless
of what happens

351
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,790
around this point
when I'm in the exponential law

352
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I show that the blocking of this transistor

353
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,520
corresponds to a value Ic equals 0 and I say

354
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,430
suddenly there too, instead of applying
very precise analytical law

355
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,400
I'm talking here about Vbe

356
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,530
less than Uj, so I have
a current Ic equals 0, and I will

357
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,720
use a second term I call the conducted

358
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,000
transistor, and I will say that when
Vbe equals to Uj,

359
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,930
I have something that is not defined.

360
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,790
If you look at this, Ic can be any

361
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,720
value here, it can be 5 mA, 10 mA,

362
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:46,160
infinite mA , so in other words, this will

363
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:48,580
depend on the circuit in which
I want to put the transistor.

364
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,000
But if I do not put or
I do not pay attention to the

365
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,080
Ic limit, know that your transistors, the

366
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,620
current in it can stretch
to infinity, the transistor infinity

367
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,580
means destruction.

368
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,310
So it is essential
to ensure that the current

369
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,370
in the collector be limited,
and we know very well that

370
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,790
the element that will limit
this will be a resistor

371
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,890
that will surely be inserted
in the collector or in

372
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,260
the transmitter we will see this later,
this is what will limit

373
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,340
it to a certain value
because of the supply voltage

374
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,530
which will also be limited.

375
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,220
So in what we have seen
on this slide,

376
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,860
is simply to show that when
it is a DC transistor analysis,

377
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,370
then we talk only of

378
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,470
the transistor operation
when there is a DC current

379
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,490
which passes through it or
a voltage which will be of the order of

380
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,160
of magnitude of Uj,
we will use this kind of model, but

381
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,506
is it like this all the time ?

382
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,260
No. And this I will insist on it
a lot, because

383
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,370
I know it's a problem when we do not know

384
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,470
how to differentiate in our mind
the DC model

385
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,390
from the AC model, which is
most important in the use

386
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,826
of transistors, this is a
rough approximation of this curve.

387
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,800
The bipolar transistor has
a defect, we do not like this.

388
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:07,666
Remember earlier we were

389
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,320
talking about Ube or Vbe voltage,

390
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,050
we said the Vbe voltage is
the voltage that will

391
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,200
allow us to drive or have a proportional

392
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,826
current flow between Vbe and Ic,
it was found that it is exponential.

393
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,186
Will this terminal draw power?

394
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,060
Is there a current that will
pass into the base?

395
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,000
Unfortunately yes, that is
what will happen with the

396
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:36,213
bipolar, it would not be
the case for an MOS transistor

397
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,350
later, in a bipolar transistor, you have a

398
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,100
linear relationship
between Ib and Ic, so in the first

399
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,250
approximation, and it is the line you see here.

400
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,700
And the parameter β is
a parameter that is given by

401
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,250
the manufacturer of your transistors,
or if it is you who

402
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,300
make the integrated circuits
around it, it is the

403
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,550
geometry of your transistors
that will define the β.

404
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:07,050
Nonetheless, this β is a parameter
that will linearly bind

405
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,320
Ic and Ib, I'm saying
in the first order, and

406
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,420
we will find that there
is a linearity between the two.

407
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,930
The β in transistors, the low power that you

408
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,460
will probably use in low power circuits

409
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,460
or use in laboratories

410
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,640
to learn the use of transistors,
you will see that

411
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,630
this β is quite high,
it is something that varies

412
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,000
between 100 and 300, as a ratio,
of course it does not have a unit

413
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,390
because that is a ratio of amps to amps.

414
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,030
So we just found that whenever Ic

415
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,360
increases, it is increasing
with Ib, and both are

416
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,000
bound together in the transistor
in the absolute, and we

417
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,630
will see that there are conditions of use for

418
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,930
this law to be valid when
the transistor (inaudible).

419
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,270
I would like to stop and

420
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,470
summarize a bit what we just saw.

421
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,630
We introduced the symbol
of the bipolar transistor, we

422
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,730
demonstrated that the bipolar transistor
is an asymmetric transistor,

423
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,210
we can not turn and replace

424
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,430
the collector terminals
by the transmitter as we want.

425
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,560
And we have just seen that
there is an exponential law between

426
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,950
the output current and input voltage,
I just said it.

427
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,880
So the input voltage,
it is the base-transmitter junction

428
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,320
that will allow me to control,
and on the output I have a current.

429
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,100
Therefore the output variable
will be a current and will be

430
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,520
the current Ic and
I just showed you it has

431
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,820
a current flowing through
the base and that this current

432
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,610
binds it to the collector current
so I have a current Ib

433
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,240
which is equal to Ic/β,
where Ic = β.Ib and

434
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,070
β is one of the transistor parameters.
