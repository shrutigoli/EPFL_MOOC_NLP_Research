1
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:05,617
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:10,238
We'll cover in this video
the principle of class B

3
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:14,266
followed by a modification of
this class B which will become AB

4
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:16,798
that is to say, we will add
a little bit of polarization

5
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:19,687
to the transistor to paste
a little bit of current passing

6
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:23,418
in our components. We will call it AB.

7
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:29,062
And we will do performance analysis
of a type B or AB setup

8
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,451
So I will continue to say either B or AB

9
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:34,827
because there is very little current that
will pass and that makes the difference

10
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:38,027
and I end with a practical example
of an implementation

11
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:42,453
of a single class B amplifier.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,653
<I> To start the analysis of amplifiers, </ i>

13
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:48,853
<I> we'll just see what that means class B. </ I>

14
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:51,578
<I> Then we will then talk
about class AB. </ I>

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,989
<I> So a class B amplifier, </ i>

16
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,970
<I> as we had already said
in the previous video, </ i>

17
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,629
<I> This is an amp that will take
voltage here </ i>

18
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:02,179
<I> convert it into the same voltage </ i>

19
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:05,779
<I> it is a voltage follower so
it will be a common collector </ i>

20
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,565
<I> achieved by a push-pull setup
to have a symmetrical supply </ i>

21
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:13,344
<I> and so that the voltage V out can display </ i>

22
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:14,231
<I> a low impedance. </ I>

23
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:15,910
<I> So the impedance I see from here, </ i>

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,412
<I> This is the impedance I see </ i>

25
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:20,275
<I> from a transmitter of
a bipolar transistor </ i>

26
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:22,337
<I> It means that it is a low impedance </ i>

27
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:25,837
<I> as compared to the one I see from here
which is of high impedance </ i>

28
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:27,360
<I> compared to this one. </ I>

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,516
<I> We call this class B </ i>

30
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:31,252
<I> and this class AB. </ I>

31
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:33,798
<I> The only difference between the two, </ i>

32
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:37,708
<I> is these voltage sources that I added here. </ I>

33
00:01:37,908 --> 00:01:39,836
<I> So these pressure points that you see here, </ i>

34
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,259
<I> are voltage sources which are supposed </ i>

35
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:46,028
<I> to polarize the bipolar
transistor junction </ i>

36
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:49,228
<I> either one or the other,
by two voltage sources </ i>

37
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:51,978
<I> for the two tensions that we see
at the entrance and exit </ i>

38
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,178
<I> are quite similar in DC and AC. </ I>

39
00:01:56,465 --> 00:02:00,228
<I> This is an example
of the class B amplifier </ i>

40
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:02,015
<I> that we will immediately turn into AB </ i>

41
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:03,580
<I> and see why we need </ i>

42
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,318
<I> this change to get this A </ i>

43
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:07,418
<I> we'll put it here. </ I>

44
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:10,618
<I> So the type of amplifier B </ i>

45
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:12,489
<I> corresponds to this feature </ i>

46
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,770
<I> So if I hide this part, </ i>

47
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,395
<I> if I just look at the NPN transistor
which is above </ i>

48
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,158
<I> and I look at the charge
connected here </ i>

49
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,345
<I> by putting the right hand over, </ i>

50
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:24,694
<I> you'll see that this is indeed </ i>

51
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,706
<I> a common-collector type of transistor. </ I>

52
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:28,706
<I> The collector is connected to a Vcc, </ i>

53
00:02:28,906 --> 00:02:30,493
<I> the load is connected to ground </ i>

54
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:31,888
<I> and I have an input voltage. </ I>

55
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:33,826
<I> Now if I hide the other transistor, </ i>

56
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:35,632
<I> it is again a common collector </ i>

57
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:38,480
<I> with the load connected to 0 </ i>

58
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,492
<I> and the transistor collector
is connected to -Vcc </ i>

59
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:44,238
<I> and I have the input voltage. </ I>

60
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,890
<I> So I have two transistors that realize </ i>

61
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,537
<I> the famous Push-Pull setup. </ I>

62
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:51,802
<I> So the characteristic of
an NPN common header, </ i>

63
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:52,827
<I> This is what I see here. </ I>

64
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:56,715
<I> So I see that V out and V in
are linearly proportional </ i>

65
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:58,829
<I> as soon as the transistor
begins to conduct, </ i>

66
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:01,065
<I> that is to say beyond
a junction voltage. </ I>

67
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,983
<I> I look at the voltage at the output </ i>

68
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,943
<I> when the input is negative. </ I>

69
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:09,143
<I> I see that I have
a negative voltage. </ I>

70
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:12,343
<I> Of course, it's the same
story for the PNP transistor: </ i>

71
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:14,259
<I> When the transistor starts conducting, </ i>

72
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,397
<I> I'm going to have a linear law. </ I>

73
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:18,760
<I> So we see that the linearity
is from here to there, </ i>

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,794
<I> from here to there. </ I>

75
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:23,096
<I> But the two transistors are blocked
between more or less </ i>

76
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:24,771
<I> a junction voltage for both. </ I>

77
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:28,143
<I> So when we talk about
this junction voltage </ i>

78
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:30,224
<I> which is about 0.7 volts ... </ i>

79
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:32,908
<I> So we have 0.7 volts,
both transistors are blocked</ i>

80
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:35,603
and this will create a crossover distortion

81
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:37,027
<I> called cross-over. </ I>

82
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:39,297
<I> So when looking
at the input voltage </ i>

83
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:41,147
<I> and looking at the output, </ i>

84
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:43,897
there is still a distortion
clearly identified here.

85
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:48,289
<I> When the input voltage exceeds
the voltage of junction </ i>

86
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:50,467
<I> that's where
our transistor will conduct. </ I>

87
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,392
<I> So we will have a transistor
that is conductive </ i>

88
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,767
right here, just this part here.

89
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:57,542
<I> And here, </ i>

90
00:03:57,742 --> 00:04:00,742
<I> between this part here, so that what we see </ i>

91
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:03,630
<I> in both voltages is roughly 0.7, </ i>

92
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,902
<I> we'll have the output voltage
that will be blocked </ i>

93
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:09,409
<I> where both transistors are blocked. </ I>

94
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,407
<I> So we will find to output a voltage equal to 0. </ I>

95
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,886
So this distortion here
is necessarily audible

96
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,992
<I> if it is an audio amplifier </ i>

97
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,867
<I> Or if there is another amplifier, </ i>

98
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,030
we will talk about a distortion.

99
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:26,317
This is a distortion due
to the non-polarization

100
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,650
<I> of our components. </ I>

101
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,164
<I> So this is what drives
us to do class A. </ I>

102
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:35,363
<I> I remind you that the class A,
it means that your transistor </ i>

103
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:38,563
<I> was polarized throughout
the passing period </ i>

104
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:41,030
<I> of your input voltage. </ I>

105
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:44,299
<I> So we impose only one component </ i>

106
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:47,174
<I> to conduct all along the signal. </ I>

107
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,771
<I> Which leads us to move
this voltage, </ i>

108
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:52,807
<I> to make it either completely positive
or completely negative </ i>

109
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:54,729
<I> and to conduct the transistor </ i>

110
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:57,929
<I> after having polarized the transistor
in the in and out area</ i>

111
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:59,178
<I> which we will not do here. </ I>

112
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:03,131
<I> There is no test consumption here </ i>

113
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:06,862
<I> when there is nothing going on here. </ I>

114
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:10,062
<I> We have no input voltage,
it would be 0 volts at the exit,</ i>

115
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,284
<I> so no current is flowing here </ i>

116
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:14,271
<I> and no current is flowing
through the two transistors. </ I>

117
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:18,871
<I> What we are going to change,
is to do a little polarization. </ I>

118
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:22,906
<I> And we'll call this class AB. </ I>

119
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:26,061
<I> So I'm going to impose
a bit of polarization </ i>

120
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:29,585
<I> that is to say there will be
a ground that will go to rest </ i>

121
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:31,335
<I> without a signal </ i>

122
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:33,543
<I> which will pass through
the two transistors. </ I>

123
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:35,968
<I> What is sent from
the NPN transistor will be </ i>

124
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,425
<I> will be absorbed by
the PNP transistor. </ I>

125
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,779
<I> So if you look at this diagram here, </ i>

126
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:44,028
<I> you will see that I had to add </ i>

127
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:47,066
<I> a polarization. I drew it as a voltage </ i>

128
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:49,978
<I> So if you take the 0.7 volt
that I added here </ i>

129
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:51,608
<I> and you consider that
this transistor here, </ i>

130
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:54,866
<I> it will conduct because
we imposed to it 0.7 </ i>

131
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:56,975
<I> and on this side, I have 0.7 volts, </ i>

132
00:05:57,213 --> 00:05:59,704
<I> you will understand that
the potential difference </ i>

133
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:03,796
<I> from here to here is 0 DC. </ I>

134
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,364
<I> So if you put 0 volts here </ i>

135
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:08,547
<I> you will find 0 volts here. </ I>

136
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:11,747
<I> This will result in an alignment </ i>

137
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:12,909
<I>of two characteristics. </ I>

138
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:16,109
<I> This way, even if
the voltage source here </ i>

139
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,309
<I> V = 0, I am around the origin, </ i>

140
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,845
<I> I'll find that Vout = 0 </ i>

141
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:25,045
<I> but as soon as the voltage Vn
increases, Vout will follow. </ I>

142
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:29,766
<I> So I have at rest a voltage
difference equal to 0 </ i>

143
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,966
<I> and when I start applying
a voltage that increases </ i>

144
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,182
<I> or decreases, </ i>

145
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:37,382
<I> I was able to eliminate this discrepancy
between the two voltages </ i>

146
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:40,582
So I deleted this crossover distortion

147
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,753
<I> and the input and output
is the true copy. </ I>

148
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:44,436
<I> So what you put here </ i>

149
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:47,175
<I> you find it exactly here
in terms of voltage. </ I>

150
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,697
<I> So it is typical to a voltage follower. </ I>

151
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:53,177
<I> The input voltage equals
the output voltage, </ i>

152
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:57,252
<I> and the current is the current
that will pass through the supply </ i>

153
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:59,259
<I> controlled by the voltage variation </ i>

154
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:02,412
<I> either on this junction
when we have a positive voltage, </ i>

155
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:06,159
<I> or this junction
when we have a negative voltage. </ I>

156
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,783
<I> So we will have one of
the transistors conducting</ i>

157
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:11,759
<I> and at rest, we will have very
less current </ i>

158
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,377
<I> And that's how much
we put in class A, </ i>

159
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:16,671
<I> that is to say how much
we polarized the junction </ i>

160
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,842
<I> for there to be current flowing here. </ I>

161
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:22,042
<I> So theoretically,
if the two transistors are the same </ i>

162
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,242
<I> and we impose a voltage
that conducts both </ i>

163
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:28,854
<I> exactly so that
the voltage generated by one</ i>

164
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,132
<I> is absorbed by the other, </ i>

165
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:33,332
<I> we will have 0 current
in the charge</ i>

166
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:35,007
<I> which is in practice extremely
difficult to do </ i>

167
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:37,817
<I> because we have
two complementary transistors </ i>

168
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:41,042
<I> that are not of the same nature,
the other an NPN PNP. </ I>

169
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:42,567
<I> So in practice, </ i>

170
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,562
<I> we will have a lot of trouble
to avoid that there </ i>

171
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:46,868
<I> be a little current going
through the charge. </ I>

172
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:50,706
<I> But the more we add polarization
current in both transistors </ i>

173
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:54,525
<I> the better the compensation
around this passage </ i>

174
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,548
<I> by 0 of our feature. </ I>

175
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,373
<I> To do this, </ i>

176
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:02,844
<I> One technique is to use this kind of setup. </ I>

177
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:07,432
<I> In this kind of setup,
we see that we used the diode </ i>

178
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:10,321
<I> to generate the voltage of Ube. </ I>

179
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:12,871
<I> So I take a junction voltage </ i>

180
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:15,092
<I> I impose myself through a diode. </ I>

181
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:17,859
<I> I need to create a path for the current </ i>

182
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,723
<I> It is necessary that the current
flows in that direction. </ I>

183
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:22,923
<I> So I will have to connect
a positive potential. </ I>

184
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:25,387
<I> Here, I showed that I made it
by current sources. </ I>

185
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:29,140
<I> This is a theoretical way to show that </ i>

186
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,767
<I> I have an almost zero voltage
from here to here </ i>

187
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,797
<I> I have an almost zero voltage
from here to here </ i>

188
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,302
<I> because there is a supply source
it is current even if the difference </ i>

189
00:08:37,502 --> 00:08:39,799
<I> in voltage is equal to 0 </ i>

190
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,541
<I> and you will be able
to impose a current </ i>

191
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:43,755
<I> which passes through the two diodes </ i>

192
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,955
<I> and this current then depends
on the current you have put </ i>

193
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:48,423
<I> which will generate junction voltage </ i>

194
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:50,528
<I> across a diode </ i>

195
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:52,671
<I> and the same across a diode </ i>

196
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:56,019
<I> that are expected to generate
two junction voltages. </ I>

197
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:57,783
<I> It's that we fall back at this moment</ i>

198
00:08:57,983 --> 00:08:58,682
<I> in this situation</ i>

199
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:02,319
<I> and we get
a practical implementation </ i>

200
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,443
<I> for the creation of polarization of the output level. </ I>

201
00:09:06,643 --> 00:09:08,905
<I> And there, we can find
what we saw earlier </ i>

202
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:12,943
<I> that is to say an input voltage
equals the output voltage </ i>

203
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:16,427
<I> and a gain is 1 in this kind of setup </ i>

204
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:19,230
<I> with a current gain which
is extremely high </ i>

205
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,830
<I> which is proportional to β gain
of the bipolar transistors </ i>

206
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,886
<I> we used. </ I>

207
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,903
<I> That is to say,
the current entering here </ i>

208
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:31,164
<I> corresponds to β times the current
that goes out of the other side. </ I>

209
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,509
<I> I'll analyze this setup in more
details </ i>

210
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,071
<I> to understand what will
happen in terms of power. </ I>

211
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:40,897
<I> So each transistor supports </ i>

212
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,636
<I> a half-alternation signal. </ I>

213
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,324
<I> One, the positive alternation,
the other, a negative alternation. </ I>

214
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:49,040
<I> So if you take the input Vin </ i>

215
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,287
<I> and you this voltage here. </ I>

216
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,801
<I> We imagine it is
a voltage of this style. </ I>

217
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,426
<I> What will happen? </ I>

218
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:58,092
<I> You'll have your transistor in red </ i>

219
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,966
<I> that will begin to conduct current </ i>

220
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,255
<I> that I've drawn in red. </ I>

221
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:03,583
<I> So there will be a collector current </ i>

222
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,896
<I> of the NPN transistor that will </ i>

223
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,866
<I> always be in red in the charge. </ I>

224
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,752
<I> So the voltage VI,
if this voltage increases, </ i>

225
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:14,721
<I> this current will pass
into the charge. </ I>

226
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:16,736
<I> This voltage will follow it
in the same amount. </ I>

227
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:18,808
<I> I drew this in this  way. </ I>

228
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:22,786
<I> I have shown that for
the positive alternation</ i>

229
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:25,002
<I> so when you we're here, </ i>

230
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:28,580
<I> I'm going to draw,
shade this in red, </ i>

231
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,858
<I> I see that there is a current
that will pass through the transistor N </ i>

232
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:36,712
<I> and will go to the charge and then, </ i>

233
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:39,912
<I> I'll get to block this transistor </ i>

234
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:41,500
<I> when I lower this voltage. </ I>

235
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,541
<I> Because when I lower the voltage, </ i>

236
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,193
<I> this transistor here blocks. </ I>

237
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:48,393
<I> I have a junction here
that will have a voltage</ i>

238
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:51,046
<I> and this voltage then begins
to follow rather this one </ i>

239
00:10:51,246 --> 00:10:52,172
<I> that begins to be negative. </ I>

240
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:55,372
<I> So when I lower this voltage,
the transistor here </ i>

241
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,021
<I> will start to conduct
and it is the black arrow </ i>

242
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:00,401
<I> So I'm having a black current</ i>

243
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,564
<I> that will pass through
the charge like this</ i>

244
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:04,387
<I> and will continue its path </ i>

245
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:05,841
<I> and it will generate a voltage </ i>

246
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,749
<I> will be positive in this
direction in the charge. </ I>

247
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,590
<I> So current flows through
the PNP transistor, </ i>

248
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,013
<I> This is the current that is here. </ I>

249
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:14,851
<I> The sum of the two currents, </ i>

250
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:17,224
<I> is the two currents that
will appear in the charge. </ I>

251
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:20,424
<I> So if I take ... sorry,
I'm talking of the sum </ i>

252
00:11:20,624 --> 00:11:23,836
<I> If I speak of the sum
while considering the arrow </ i>

253
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:26,249
<I> I now speak in terms of voltage </ i>

254
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:32,204
<I> The voltage will reflect
the current II x R </ i>

255
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,740
<I> When the current is positive
in this direction. </ I>

256
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,628
<I> So I will see that VI will
be positive in that sense. </ I>

257
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:41,828
<I> Otherwise, as I power to -Vcc,
I will have a current flowing </ i>

258
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:45,010
<I> in that direction and VI that will
be negative in this direction. </ I>

259
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,924
<I> So I will have Vl that will be
positive and negative </ i>

260
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,457
<I> which is exactly
the image of what I see </ i>

261
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:52,878
<I> about this feature here. </ I>

262
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:56,078
<I> So I have a positive voltage. </ I>

263
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:57,720
<I> I have a voltage that will be  </ i>

264
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,849
<I> proportional to what
I called the black part </ i>

265
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:04,049
<I> that is to say, the PNP transistor which is
in the process of conducting current </ i>

266
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:06,920
<I> that goes in this direction,
towards - Vcc. </ i>

267
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:10,664
<I> Coming from
the perfomamnce performance. </ I>

268
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,864
<I> So the performance of such a setup</ i>

269
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:18,799
<I> and we will take again what
we mentioned at the beginning </ i>

270
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:20,630
<I> we will look at the average power </ i>

271
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,707
<I> expressing the instantaneous power </ i>

272
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:26,755
<I> and we will look at both the expression
of the instantaneous power </ i>

273
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,571
<I> then, calculate
the average power. </ I>

274
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:31,026
<I> So I start with a medium voltage </ i>

275
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:33,938
<I> with a voltage ... </ i>

276
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:35,752
<I> pardon, the value of
the average power </ i>

277
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:37,488
<I> with a sinusoidal voltage. </ I>

278
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:40,513
<I> I applied to the input
a voltage V (t) </ i>

279
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:43,006
<I> that will be the same Vl (t) </ i>

280
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:44,747
<I> since it is the true copy of both. </ I>

281
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:49,085
<I> And we will find that Vl ^ V sinωt </ i>

282
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:52,496
<I> will of course generate
a current that will be Î sinωt </ i>

283
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:55,309
<I> and Ohm's law is what will connect </ i>

284
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,636
<I> these two expressions together. </ I>

285
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:02,194
<I> to simplify the calculation
that will follow. </ I>

286
00:13:02,394 --> 00:13:04,953
<I> When I look at
a transistor like this, </ i>

287
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:07,283
<I> then I want to see which
is the maximum voltage </ i>

288
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:08,154
<I> that appears there. </ I>

289
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,354
Remember that this voltage,
I look on the transmitter.

290
00:13:11,554 --> 00:13:13,392
<I> When I look at a voltage
on the transmitter and </ i>

291
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:15,518
<I> I consider myself that
I have a voltage here </ i>

292
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,025
<I> which is a junction voltage </ i>

293
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:20,225
<I> and that this voltage source </ i>

294
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,317
<I> or the voltage difference
here can be 0, </ i>

295
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:26,778
<I> if it is a current source </ i>

296
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:29,820
<I>therefore I can fully impose
a voltage equal to 0. </ I>

297
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:34,160
<I> In practice, there would be here
a transistor instead of this </ i>

298
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,339
<I> but whose collector
is connected here. </ I>

299
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,153
<I> That means that
I can push this voltage </ i>

300
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:41,704
<I> up to about 200 millivolts </ i>

301
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,459
<I> before Uce = 200 millivolts </ i>

302
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:49,854
<I> even if it is said that Uce = 0
the transistor is saturated, </ i>

303
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:53,054
<I> in practice one needs
low power transistors </ i>

304
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:55,416
<I> in the order of magnitude
of 200 millivolts </ i>

305
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:59,038
<I> so that the transistor does
not go into direct saturation. </ I>

306
00:13:59,551 --> 00:14:01,934
<I> So if I push this voltage here, </ i>

307
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,757
<I> the junction voltage
remains the same. </ I>

308
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,873
<I> So this one will follow </ i>

309
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:10,117
<I> until I get to saturate
this transistor here. </ I>

310
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,915
<I> So if this voltage equals 0, </ i>

311
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:16,115
<I> that means, to allow
for the maximum voltage </ i>

312
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,260
<I> I see here, I have to go through</ i>

313
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,494
<I> the feature like this. </ I>

314
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:24,222
<I> That's the way I would have
looked to say </ i>

315
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:26,410
<I> what is the voltage Vout max. </ I>

316
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,154
<I> Why am I talking about this? </ I>

317
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:31,354
<I> Because I'm going to simplify
in the calculation that follows. </ I>

318
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:34,554
<I> This voltage, will rise up to what value? </ I>

319
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:37,681
<I> It could rise to Vcc + </ i>

320
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:39,429
<I> and go down to - Vcc </ i>.

321
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,704
<I> In practice, no. </ I>

322
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:43,813
<I> Does it depends on the saturation
of this transistor? </ I>

323
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:45,994
<I> Absolutely not. It depends
on the junction here. </ I>

324
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:48,013
<I> Look at the way I have to go </ i>

325
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:49,602
<I> when I look from the transmitter. </ I>

326
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:52,802
<I> From the transmitter of a transistor,
I have my two fingers which will rise </ i>

327
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:55,460
<I> in the same amount until I saturate </ i>

328
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,222
<I> this current source. </ I>

329
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:59,422
<I> And I stop at a difference when
this voltage here is equal to this. </ I>

330
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:01,210
<I> So I have a short circuit
from here to there, </ i>

331
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,350
<I> I have 0 volts. </ I>

332
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,189
<I> In theory, i will still have
this voltage and this</ i>

333
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:07,317
<I> the equivalent of a voltage Ug. </ I>

334
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:12,119
<I> This voltage max, it will be
at Vcc - Ug </ i>

335
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,048
<I> In practice, </ i>

336
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:20,528
<I> we must add the equivalent
of something like 0.2 volts </ i>

337
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:23,760
<I> when bringing a transistor where
the transmitter is connected here </ i>

338
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,183
<I> and the collector is connected here. </ I>

339
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,608
<I> Or we must consider
the voltage difference </ i>

340
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:29,969
<I> we have seen on this power source </ i>

341
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,940
<I> once achieved with transistors. </ I>

342
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,891
<I> So in practice,
the maximum voltage </ i>

343
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:38,458
<I> is proportional to Vcc </ i>

344
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:39,947
<I> minus the necessary voltage</ i>

345
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,483
<I> for this current source to remain
the current source </ i>

346
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:46,293
<I> to which must also subtract
the voltage Ug. </ I>

347
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:49,493
<I> But in the calculation
that follows, </ i>

348
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:52,317
I will take this into account:

349
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:55,863
<I> I will consider the voltage, </ i>

350
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:57,992
<I>it can rise to Vcc. </ I>

351
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,481
<I> In other words, I am saying </ i>

352
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:02,681
<I> I neglect this voltage
drop Ug I'm talking </ i>

353
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:04,765
<I> and I neglect
this small voltage drop </ i>

354
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,046
<I> that I need to reserve for my source. </ I>

355
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:09,063
<I> So I will consider
in my calculation </ i>

356
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:13,054
<I> this hypothesis that is written here
so not to say all the time </ i>

357
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:16,254
<I> and this Vcc minus
the saturation voltage here </ i>

358
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,979
<I> minus the voltage Ug
of this transistor, </ i>

359
00:16:19,217 --> 00:16:21,597
<I> I will approximate this
all the time to Vcc. </ I>

360
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:26,181
<I> So by writing the law in the power </ i>

361
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:27,631
<I> or power in charge, </ i>

362
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:29,709
<I> it is a power which is equal to </ i>

363
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:33,595
<I>the efficient value divided
by the value of the charge. </ I>

364
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:37,583
<I> I always replaces the efficient value
by the peak value </ i>

365
00:16:37,783 --> 00:16:39,912
<I> because this is what interests
me before saturating. </ I>

366
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:42,596
<I> So I want to talk about
this saturation voltage. </ I>

367
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:44,973
<I> And then in this case,
I' say I can go up </ i>

368
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:45,877
<I> untill Vcc up. </ I>

369
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:48,649
<I> So the maximum power in the charge </ i>

370
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:52,174
<I> is slightly above this. </ I>

371
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,712
<I> And theoretically, according
to this hypothesis here </ i>

372
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:58,403
<I> it is equal to Vcc divided
by 2 ^ 2 x Rl. </ I>

373
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:01,238
<I> So for a quick calculation,
I can accept this</ i>

374
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,020
<I> if not, I have to calculate
where I say </ i>

375
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,544
<I> Vl peak= U </ i>

376
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:11,999
<I> we'll call this voltage source </ i>

377
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,015
<I> and I'll talk about saturation. </ I>

378
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:17,611
So what is the saturation
voltage to allow for this setup

379
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:18,648
<I> less ... </ i>

380
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:22,923
<I> Excuse all this plus Ug </ i>

381
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:26,696
<I> and I have to put a - sign </ i>

382
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:29,896
<I> and subtract this from Vcc. </ I>

383
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,187
<I> So here I wrote it wrongly. </ I>

384
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:34,985
<I> I will note more clearer
the voltage Ug. </ I>

385
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:38,606
<I> So Vcc minus Vc minus
the saturation voltage here </ i>

386
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:40,772
<I> plus the Ug  I will subtract </ i>

387
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:44,601
<I> to talk in practice about
this true peak voltage. </ I>

388
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:46,699
<I> And we will approximate it by Vcc. </ I>

389
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:50,645
<I> I will now take the same set up, </ i>

390
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:53,100
<I>  realize it as it was </ i>

391
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
<I> and go into the expression
of the power </ i>

392
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,226
<I> that will take me to express
the efficiency of such a setup. </ I>

393
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,058
<I> The power ... </ i>

394
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:04,039
<I> I will start by analyzing
the power that is dissipated </ i>

395
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:04,901
<I> in the load. </ I>

396
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:08,381
<I> I just saw the one that
was in my charge,sorry</ i>

397
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:11,270
<I> This is the expression
that I have seen just now </ i>

398
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,997
<I> and now I will express
the one I see in my transistor. </ I>

399
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:18,411
<I> Take the example
of NPN transistors </ i>

400
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:21,515
<I> I can do the same for the PNP </ i>

401
00:18:21,715 --> 00:18:24,679
<I> This transistor here </ i>

402
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:29,395
<I> has a voltage difference
multiplied by a current here. </ I>

403
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,798
<I> So that, it will give me
the instant expression of power </ i>

404
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:37,740
<I> I'll dissect as Vcc - Vn </ i>

405
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:39,047
<I> this is the Vce voltage. </ I>

406
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:41,239
<I> So this voltage, is all the time ... </ i>

407
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:43,958
<I> The Vce is less tension
this voltage I see </ i>

408
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:44,732
<I> across the load, </ i>

409
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:47,932
<I> So it will give me this term
multiplied by the current </ i>

410
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:51,761
<I> flowing through the transistor,
which is exactly the current charge. </ I>

411
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:54,170
<I> So this current Ic1 = Il. </ I>

412
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,091
<I>I know the expression. </ I>

413
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,702
<I> It is Ohm's law
that will give it to me: </ i>

414
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:00,074
<I> it is the voltage across my terminals </ i>

415
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:02,621
<I> divided by the resistance
of the charge. </ I>

416
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:05,014
<I> So I replace it with its value </ i>

417
00:19:05,214 --> 00:19:06,521
<I> I performs the multiplication </ i>

418
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:09,721
<I> and I found
the instantaneous power </ i>

419
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:12,735
<I> dissipated in my transistor </ i>

420
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:19,757
<I>is equal to Vcc when Vi divided
by Rl least square value </ i>

421
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:21,630
<I> Vl divided by R. </ I>

422
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,281
<I> So I have a square law function
of the output voltage </ i>

423
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:31,155
<I> which is the Vl which is X ^ 2 over R with a -sign</ i>

424
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,533
<I> an X / R multiplied by a constant </ i>

425
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,821
<I> which is the voltage Vcc. </ I>

426
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:38,873
<I> If you consider what happens </ i>

427
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:40,037
<I> in an a setup containing </ i>

428
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:42,940
<I> a signal that varies
very little over time </ i>

429
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,911
<I> so something that is very very
very small in variation, </ i>

430
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:48,942
<I> the instant power,
it could be important </ i>

431
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:51,600
<I> when there is a certain inertia </ i>

432
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,661
<I>of low frequency </ i>

433
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:55,861
<I> because we have the junction
of the transistor that will </ i>

434
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,933
<I> eventually heat</ i>

435
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:01,133
<I> and that thermal heating
could be of interest us </ i>

436
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,806
<I> when we speak of a very low
frequency signal. </ I>

437
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:05,272
<I> That's why I'll search </ i>

438
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:06,979
for when does the instantaneous power

439
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:09,809
<I> reaches a maximum. </ I>

440
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,935
<I> So looking at this, I see </ i>

441
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:15,587
<I> that the expression I have here </ i>

442
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:21,790
<I> by deriving it in the function
of voltage I see </ i>

443
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,496
<I> V (t) which is over
the charge or on entry </ i>

444
00:20:23,696 --> 00:20:26,293
<I> and that I equate to 0
to see the maximum </ i>

445
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:30,450
<I> I see it is when the voltage on my charge </ i>

446
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,896
<I> is equal to half the supply voltage </ i>

447
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,233
<I> at that time, </ i>

448
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:38,354
<I> I have maximum power </ i>

449
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:41,459
<I> dissipated in one
or the other transistor </ i>

450
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:49,070
<I> So this power, is worth
Vcc ^ 2/4 x RI. </ I>

451
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:55,174
<I> That is the maximum instantaneous
power in a transistor </ i>

452
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:58,803
<I> when the signal is at low frequency. </ I>

453
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:01,230
<I> I will now move to the average power. </ I>

454
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,307
<I> So I'll take this phrase
that I have here. </ I>

455
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:06,311
<I> I will apply a sinusoidal voltage </ i>

456
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:07,490
<I> to this kind of setup </ i>

457
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,126
<I> and I'll look at the average power. </ I>

458
00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:13,050
<I> This is the one we look at
quite often </ i>

459
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,495
<I> to watch what
the average loss value </ i>

460
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:16,197
in the transistor.

461
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,608
<I> We have already discussed
this kind of expression </ i>

462
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:22,254
<I> when introducing in
the previous video. </ I>

463
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:24,144
<I> So how will I address thist? </ I>

464
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:25,301
<I> I have two transistors. </ I>

465
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,782
<I> I know that each of the transistor </ i>

466
00:21:26,982 --> 00:21:29,434
<I> will conduct during half the period. </ I>

467
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:31,180
<I> So I just have to take </ i>

468
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,107
<I>the average power in a transistor </ i>

469
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:35,531
<I> and multiply by a factor of 2 </ i>

470
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:37,110
<I> what I'm doing here. </ I>

471
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,475
<I> So the average power
in a transistor </ i>

472
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:42,532
<I> is the voltage times the current route. </ I>

473
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:45,487
<I> I include over half of the period </ i>

474
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:46,981
<I> because this transistor is blocked </ i>

475
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,306
<I> So it just goes ... </ i>

476
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:52,220
<I> What concerns me is when
it sees the current pass </ i>

477
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,023
<I> multiplied by 1 / T and
I multiply by 2 </ i>

478
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:58,335
<I> I speak of power in both transistors </ i>

479
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:01,535
<I> knowing that each working
for half the period. </ I>

480
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,862
<I> I take the calculated
expression just now </ i>

481
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:04,688
<I> it's here. </ I>

482
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:08,398
<I> I replace the voltage with
a sinusoidal voltage </ i>

483
00:22:08,598 --> 00:22:10,760
<I> So sin ω t by replacing ωt </ i>

484
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,013
<I> I call a substitution α </ i>

485
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:16,938
<I> to write less ... it's not all the time ωt </ i>

486
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:21,115
<I> and I replace the power
that I know on the charge </ i>

487
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:23,498
<I> of a sinusoidal voltage
that I report here. </ I>

488
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:27,236
<I> This is the value of ^v sin ωt
divided by the value of R </ i>

489
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:29,853
<I> that corresponds to the current
going through through my office. </ I>

490
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:32,164
<I> And I effect the intergral . </ I>

491
00:22:33,189 --> 00:22:34,289
<I> I replaced with the terminals </ i>

492
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:36,316
<I> and I find this phrase. </ I>

493
00:22:36,516 --> 00:22:40,789
<I> So the average power
dissipated in a transistor </ i>

494
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:42,757
<I> multiplied by 2 </ i>

495
00:22:42,957 --> 00:22:48,792
equal to 2 x Vcc x ^ v / π x RI

496
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:53,665
<I> minus^ V / Rl 2 </ i>

497
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:58,502
<I> and I look when will that
mean power be maximum </ i>

498
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,425
<I> So I drift from the
variable that is ^ Vl. </ I>

499
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:06,531
<I> For any value of V ^
of the sinusoidal voltage </ i>

500
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:07,902
<I> that I apply to such a setup  </ i>

501
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:10,660
<I> I'm having a maximum
average power? </ I>

502
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,800
<I> Well I'll find that when
Vi = 2 Vcc / π. </ I>

503
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,713
<I> It's a calculation to do. </ I>

504
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:20,863
<I> It is taken from the derivative
of that expression </ i>

505
00:23:21,063 --> 00:23:26,587
<I> and now I look at the
power in the transistor </ i>

506
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:27,978
<I> its exact value, </ i>

507
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:31,178
<I> replacing ^Vr value </ i>

508
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:33,324
<I> not its value which
is equal to 2 Vcc / π. </ I>

509
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:36,524
<I> And this is the average maximum term  </ i>

510
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:39,724
<I> in a transistor in the case of
a sinusoidal excitation. </ I>

511
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:42,924
<I> This is 0.2 Vcc ^ 2 / RI </ i>

512
00:23:43,124 --> 00:23:47,837
<I> assuming of course that ^VI = 2 Vcc / π </ i>

513
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,137
<I> and taking into account this term </ i>

514
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:52,639
<I> that has been derived from
the average value. </ I>

515
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,046
<I>Remember this. </ I>

516
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:55,966
<I> We now see what is
the average power </ i>

517
00:23:56,166 --> 00:24:00,756
<I> to a sinusoidal voltage
in a type B or AB setup. </ I>

518
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,785
<I> A short summary to now
see the performance. </ I>

519
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,105
<I> The supply voltage: </ i>

520
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:09,954
<I> I remind you that we have
a more or less Vcc voltage </ i>

521
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:11,716
<I> so I have a voltage of 2 Vcc </ i>

522
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:15,900
<I> multiplied by the current that
will be carried by the power </ i>

523
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,282
<I> ... which is the current share
of this power supply </ i>

524
00:24:18,482 --> 00:24:20,883
<I> which will be the current
that is supplied to the charge. </ I>

525
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,226
<I> So what is the expression
that we know, </ i>

526
00:24:23,426 --> 00:24:25,992
<I> we just saw. It is ^ Vl / π RI. </ I>

527
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:31,395
Knowing that in the charge
we have the ^ V^ 2/2 RI

528
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,995
<I> and the supply voltage, </ i>

529
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:40,672
<I> So replacing ^ Vl by the value
we put the hypothesis </ i>

530
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:43,334
<I> that is to say Vlmax = Vcc, </ i>

531
00:24:43,534 --> 00:24:47,103
<I> the supply should provide
a setup class B or AB </ i>

532
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:53,264
<I> of the order of magnitude
of 2 Vcc ^ 2 / π Rl </ i>

533
00:24:53,464 --> 00:24:57,382
<I> so that the load times
maximum power </ i>

534
00:24:57,582 --> 00:25:00,176
<I> Vcc ^ r / 2 Rl. </ I>

535
00:25:00,376 --> 00:25:02,377
<I> So I can calculate my performance. </ I>

536
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:07,061
<I> I consider practically,
that polarization takes nothing </ i>

537
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:09,984
<I> and the little A that I put into it </ i>

538
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:11,121
<I> does not count. </ I>

539
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:13,504
<I> I divide this </ i>

540
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:15,017
<I> by this </ i>

541
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:19,977
<I> and I fall back on a value
of a maximum perfomamnce </ i>

542
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:22,264
<I> in the order of 80%. </ I>

543
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:23,508
<I> This is equal to π / 4. </ I>

544
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:26,484
<I> So this is about the 80%. </ I>

545
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:30,440
<I> So we can say that
the setup of type B or AB </ i>

546
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:33,296
<I> has a yield of this
order of magnitude, </ i>

547
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:39,775
<I>of 78% of what
we give it as energy. </ I>

548
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:44,238
<I> Compared to a class A,
it was found was 25% </ i>

549
00:25:44,438 --> 00:25:48,562
<I> and there you come across something
where you have a loss of 20% </ i>

550
00:25:48,762 --> 00:25:50,882
<I> and where it falls
on a much better yield </ i>

551
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:51,798
<I> In a class. </ I>

552
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:56,677
<I> This curve summarizes
what we just saw. </ I>

553
00:25:56,877 --> 00:26:01,477
<I> By standardizing
the peak value Vcc </ i>

554
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:04,588
<I> that is to say, when I look ^ VI = Vcc, </ i>

555
00:26:04,788 --> 00:26:05,825
<I> there on the scale, I have  1 </ i>

556
00:26:06,025 --> 00:26:07,943
<I> and normalizing the power </ i>

557
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:10,188
<I> I have both in my transistor </ i>

558
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:12,140
<I> and in both my office </ i>

559
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,382
<I> in relation to the supply power, </ i>

560
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:17,582
<I> So I could say
that the maximum power, </ i>

561
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:19,162
<I> that's when I have = 1 </ i>

562
00:26:19,362 --> 00:26:21,283
<I> since it is the power supplied
by the power </ i>

563
00:26:21,483 --> 00:26:23,120
<I> which is the normalization value. </ I>

564
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,862
<I> I saw that the transistor, </ i>

565
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:28,710
<I> it has a square law </ i>

566
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:34,329
<I> with a Vl ^ 2 with a - sign  </ i>

567
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:39,060
And in the charge, the Vl ^ 2 is divided by RI.

568
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,281
<I> And the performance,
I have a loss from here to here </ i>

569
00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:46,481
<I> that the supply gives </ i>

570
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:50,968
<I> and I have all that which
is made to the charge </ I>

571
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,247
<I> So a visual analysis of this </ i>

572
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:57,447
<I> lets us understand everything
that is going on inside. </ I>

573
00:26:57,647 --> 00:27:00,647
<I> How the power transistor takes </ i>

574
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:04,394
<I> to a certain value which is
of the order of 1/2 Vcc </ i>

575
00:27:04,594 --> 00:27:09,766
<I> Then we have the charge
that begins to take power </ i>

576
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:12,966
<I> and tends towards
the maximum power </ i>

577
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,717
<I> we see here. </ I>

578
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:16,810
<I> And it is at that point,
we have the maximum yield </ i>

579
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,464
<I> that's about 20% loss </ i>

580
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:22,160
<I> with respect to what the supply gives </ i>

581
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,360
<I> and compared to what
the charge takes as effective value </ i>

582
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,847
<I> co power in the charge. </ I>

583
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:33,002
<I> Let the practical realization. </ I>

584
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:36,202
<I> If you remember our Push-Pull setup </ i>

585
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:40,514
<I> which was with one NPN-type transistor, </ i>

586
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:44,010
<I> 1 PNP  transistor type. </ I>

587
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,680
<I> Both are connected by their transmitter. </ I>

588
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,839
<I> A little polarization here. </ I>

589
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,339
<I> I'll take the class B </ i>

590
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,952
<I> and a power supply,
an outlet, an inlet </ i>

591
00:27:55,152 --> 00:27:57,402
<I> and a dual power supply. </ I>

592
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:03,127
<I> The current flowing to the outlet </ i>

593
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:06,246
<I> is the current that we take
from the supply voltage. </ I>

594
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:08,783
<I> It is this current that will
go in one direction </ i>

595
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:09,658
<I> or another. </ I>

596
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:12,858
<I> Now, the current that we will take </ i>

597
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,786
<I> from the level which is just before </ i>

598
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:18,624
<I> the one that provides the voltage
to our power amplifier </ i>

599
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:19,899
<I> class B, </ i>

600
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,235
<I> it's here. </ I>

601
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:22,979
<I> So that's the current Ib </ i>

602
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:25,067
<I> and that's the current Ic. </ I>

603
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:29,900
<I> What is between the two Ic = β Ib, </ i>

604
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,661
<I> such that β is
the β of the transistor. </ I>

605
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:37,139
<I> Usually, when we do an amplifier
level that comes here </ i>

606
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:41,014
<I> often, we need to achieve
a voltage amplifier there. </ I>

607
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:44,214
<I> So here we have a voltage gain </ i>

608
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:48,778
<I> and we do a counter reaction
between the output and the input </ i>

609
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:52,803
<I> with a counter reaction rate
that would happen like this. </ I>

610
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:57,310
<I> That is the classical setup
of a class AB amplifier. </ I>

611
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,840
<I> The power level is of class AB, </ i>

612
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,799
<I> plus an amplifier that performs voltage </ i>

613
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:04,999
<I> and counter reaction
to cause the output voltage </ i>

614
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:07,564
<I> subtracted from the input voltage
and make all these</ i>

615
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:10,764
<I> with a voltage gain proportional
to what has been set here. </ I>

616
00:29:10,964 --> 00:29:13,260
<I> So the most important thing, </ i>

617
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,282
is what is the relationship
between Ib and Ic.

618
00:29:15,482 --> 00:29:20,335
<I> It goes through the β
because it is β × Ib. </ I>

619
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:24,341
<I> When a question arises what is
the β value in the transistor </ i>

620
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,021
<I> especially as this is
a power transistor, </ i>

621
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:27,651
<I> we'll realize </ i>

622
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:31,540
<I> that the β of a power transistor
is relatively small </ i>

623
00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:35,471
<I> because the base width
of such a transistor </ i>

624
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:38,488
<I> can not be very large to have bounds </ i>

625
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,029
<I> in quite high voltage. </ I>

626
00:29:40,229 --> 00:29:42,424
<I> When you want to subject
this transistor </ i>

627
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:43,923
<I> to relatively high voltages, </ i>

628
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:47,797
<I> the β can not be very great. </ I>

629
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:49,277
We have to have transistors

630
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:51,816
<I> whose β is quite moderate
or even low </ i>

631
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:54,822
<I> and we require voltage differences </ i>

632
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:56,416
<I> at the terminals of this transistor. </ I>

633
00:29:56,616 --> 00:29:59,221
<I> Which brings us to remedy </ i>

634
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:02,282
<I>this  β by electronics. </ I>

635
00:30:02,482 --> 00:30:04,930
<I> That is to say, we take our component, </ i>

636
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,678
<I> and replace it by a Darlington. </ I>

637
00:30:06,878 --> 00:30:09,591
<I> Very often in these amplifiers, </ i>

638
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:12,606
<I> if it's realized with
bipolar transistors </ i>

639
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:15,602
<I> the transistor which performs the setup</ i>

640
00:30:15,802 --> 00:30:18,802
<I> is often performed
by Darlington based fixtures </ i>

641
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:19,703
<I> or pseudo-Darlington </ i>

642
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:23,246
<I> So we see here
the two possible layouts. </ I>

643
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,852
<I> When you want
to make a Push-Pull, </ i>

644
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,512
<I> we put this transistor here </ i>

645
00:30:26,712 --> 00:30:30,849
<I> and replace it by
the equivalent NPN of this. </ I>

646
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,360
<I> We can take in the place
of the PNP </ i>

647
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,273
<I> the equivalent of this
and put it below </ i>

648
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:37,856
<I> but we have a β that will
be the β1 x β 2 </ i>

649
00:30:38,056 --> 00:30:39,820
<I> of two Darlington setups </ i>

650
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,020
or using a pseudo-Darlington.

651
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,270
<I> So we put a pseudo-Darlington
NPN transistor </ i>

652
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:50,428
<I> and the other will be of PNP type</ i>

653
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:51,901
<I> that appears here. </ I>

654
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,794
<I> So we can make mixtures in between. </ I>

655
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:57,379
<I> If we wish to have
two output stages </ i>

656
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:58,533
<I> of NPN nature </ i>

657
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:00,665
<I> ie this transistor
and this transistor </ i>

658
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:04,459
<I> the driver level towards
the charge is the same, </ i>

659
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,912
<I> we can use
instead of this transistor </ i>

660
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:10,112
<I> a Darlington setup of NPN Nature </ i>

661
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:13,051
<I> and a pseudo-Darlington
instead of this transistor here, </ i>

662
00:31:13,251 --> 00:31:17,985
<I> which makes the two transistors
that see the charge the same. </ I>

663
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:19,518
<I> You can choose the same transistor </ i>

664
00:31:19,718 --> 00:31:22,718
<I> that can guarantee a better match </ i>

665
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:25,292
<I> between the two levels. </ I>

666
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,110
<I> And finally, </ i>

667
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,960
<I> I'd like to give a very
simple example</ i>

668
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,907
<I> on a simple class AB amplifier </ i>

669
00:31:34,107 --> 00:31:36,194
<I> that anyone can go to a laboratory </ i>

670
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:36,961
<I> and plug. </ I>

671
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,623
<I> To do this, I have
to make the diagram </ i>

672
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,162
<I> I have just presented, </ i>

673
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:44,362
<I> that is I have to take my output level </ i>

674
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:47,562
<I> and create a driver level </ i>

675
00:31:47,762 --> 00:31:50,762
<I> that will control this level</ i>

676
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:53,412
<I> and that will allow me
to make a counter reaction. </ I>

677
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,260
<I> So very often,
or always the same, </ i>

678
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,021
<I> I will need an extra level</ i>

679
00:31:58,221 --> 00:31:59,995
<I>that I will add to my amplifier </ i>

680
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:02,344
<I> which is a Class B or AB. </ I>

681
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:06,701
<I> So here in this case,
I have a class AB power amplifier </ i>

682
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:09,901
<I> I added a market
operational amplifier </ i>

683
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:12,131
<I> which on the inside contains
a driver level</ i>

684
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:14,305
<I> that will get me the voltage, </ i>

685
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:17,505
<I> and contains a differential
pair of input </ i>

686
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:20,121
<I> to be able to make
a counter reaction </ i>

687
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:21,816
<I> from the outlet toward the inlet. </ I>

688
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,416
<I> So this is typical to the diagram
that we make practically </ i>

689
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:28,248
<I> to make a low power amplifier. </ I>

690
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:31,053
<I> It is equivalent
to something like this: </ i>

691
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:33,864
<I> if I take my scheme
and I draw on the side </ i>

692
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:36,639
<I> that would give me this: </ i>

693
00:32:37,347 --> 00:32:39,839
<I> I have a resistor. </ I>

694
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:43,472
<I> We'll take a loudspeaker because
we will make an audio amp. </ I>

695
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:47,825
<I> I have a counter reaction
with two resistors </ i>

696
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:50,157
<I> This one, it is called R2. </ I>

697
00:32:50,357 --> 00:32:54,846
With a transfer function
we will achieve a filter (inaudible)

698
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:58,646
<I> to avoid if ever there
is an offset in my amp, </ i>

699
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:02,123
<I> this offset is not multiplied
by the gain and returned. </ I>

700
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:04,234
<I> It is filtered by
the capacitance here. </ I>

701
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:06,881
<I> When we have a trial voltage, </ i>

702
00:33:07,081 --> 00:33:08,429
<I> this branch here will disappear, </ i>

703
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:09,777
<I> the capacitance is a short circuit. </ I>

704
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:11,727
<I> You hide it, you actually
have a voltage follower </ i>

705
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:14,363
<I> a voltage follower which
sees at the input </ i>

706
00:33:14,563 --> 00:33:17,563
<I> the voltage you are
going to put in on Vi. </ I>

707
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:20,763
<I> Very often in practice,
it also makes a feed pass. </ I>

708
00:33:20,963 --> 00:33:22,713
(INAUDIBLE) up here

709
00:33:22,913 --> 00:33:24,757
<I>  on passive components </ i>

710
00:33:24,957 --> 00:33:27,957
<I> to avoid also that there be
a test component </ i>

711
00:33:28,157 --> 00:33:30,114
<I> which is superimposed </ i>

712
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:31,936
<I> and appears in the speaker </ i>

713
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,076
<I> what we sought to avoid
with this kind of amplifier. </ I>

714
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:40,446
<I> So I would take a loudspeaker
8 ohm for example. </ I>

715
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:41,589
<I> Unfortunately here
there is a mistake. </ I>

716
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,745
<I> So I erase this. </ I>

717
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:45,804
<I> We will write the correct unit. </ I>

718
00:33:46,654 --> 00:33:48,502
<I> I have a speaker of 8 ohm. </ I>

719
00:33:48,702 --> 00:33:50,908
<I> The first thing we do </ i>

720
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:53,451
<I> when you take a setup
of this style, </ i>

721
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:57,269
<I> this is to evaluate the given
power as we had said. </ I>

722
00:33:57,469 --> 00:34:01,234
<I> Here in this example,
I'll do a reverse engineering </ i>

723
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:04,004
<I> on the most I can get in power </ i>

724
00:34:04,204 --> 00:34:06,387
<I> when I have a given supply voltage </ i>

725
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,131
<I> and I will establish it
to roughly 15 volts. </ I>

726
00:34:08,368 --> 00:34:11,631
<I> I purchased a component that
is powered with about 15 volts </ i>

727
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:15,660
<I> and I will consider
it as the Vcc = 15 V </ i>

728
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,312
<I> and -15 volts </ i>

729
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:18,815
<I> And I have a speaker of 8 ohm. </ I>

730
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,711
<I> What is the maximum
theoretical power? </ I>

731
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:22,826
<I> The maximum theoretical power </ i>

732
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:26,869
it will tell you it is the Vcc / 2 x RI.

733
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:29,771
<I> So it will give me 14 watts. </ I>

734
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,301
<I> And you remember, we just said </ i>

735
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:36,326
<I> the output voltage may
never reach Vcc. </ I>

736
00:34:36,526 --> 00:34:39,590
<I> So here in this example,
the theoretical power, </ i>

737
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,790
<I> I have considered that ^ Vi,
the maximum value at the output </ i>

738
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,022
<I> is equal to Vcc. </ I>

739
00:34:44,222 --> 00:34:46,066
<I> But actually, I have to subtract </ i>

740
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:48,114
<I> a small amount of a resistance </ i>

741
00:34:48,314 --> 00:34:50,446
<I>that we add frequently in amplifiers </ i>

742
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:52,810
<I> when there is a level with bipolar </ i>

743
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,010
<I> because this resistance
of a very, very low value </ i>

744
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,456
<I> about 0.2 ohm </ i>

745
00:34:57,656 --> 00:35:01,929
<I> prevents or limits the thermal runaway. </ I>

746
00:35:02,129 --> 00:35:06,713
<I> Now I have a voltage Uj. </ I>

747
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:11,405
<I> And then I have some component
that I have to ensure </ i>

748
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:14,440
<I> before my current
source saturates. </ I>

749
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,924
<I> So I have a voltage drop here, </ i>

750
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:18,032
<I> a voltage drop here, </ i>

751
00:35:18,232 --> 00:35:20,822
<I> a voltage drop here that
I must subtract from Vcc. </ I>

752
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:24,822
<I> So I can never reach
this Vcc = 15V. </ I>

753
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,134
<I> So here, I took a example. </ I>

754
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,186
<I> Say assuming I have
an increase of 4 volts </ i>

755
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:32,936
<I> and I reserve 3 volts
for this path here, </ i>

756
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:35,377
<I> I'll end up with something correct</ i>

757
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:38,265
<I> in the order of ± 12 volts </ i>

758
00:35:38,465 --> 00:35:40,934
<I> even with a 15 volt power supply. </ I>

759
00:35:41,134 --> 00:35:45,401
<I> This brings me to a real max power </ i>

760
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,919
<I> about 9 watts. </ I>

761
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,504
<I> So that's one example. </ I>

762
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:51,318
<I> For someone who wants
to make it in a laboratory </ i>

763
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:53,301
<I> by taking a market speaker </ i>

764
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:55,444
<I> and making an amplifier </ i>

765
00:35:55,644 --> 00:35:58,270
<I> and taking a attack level </ i>

766
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,634
<I> and a counter reaction level</ i>

767
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:04,472
<I> in a simple amplifier embodying
the counter reaction, </ i>

768
00:36:04,672 --> 00:36:07,672
<I> could relatively easily plug this </ i>

769
00:36:07,872 --> 00:36:10,705
<I> by keeping the power components
on the outside. </ I>

770
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:12,656
<I> As this is a voltage follower </ i>

771
00:36:12,856 --> 00:36:15,658
<I> you can always imagine
that it is part of your amp. </ I>

772
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:17,440
<I> This tension and stress
are the same, </ i>

773
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,172
<I> they follow. </ I>

774
00:36:19,672 --> 00:36:23,795
<I> So this is a story that makes
an Av voltage gain</ i>

775
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:26,339
<I> which is equal to 1. </ I>

776
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:29,112
<I> So we have a voltage gain of 1 </ i>

777
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,787
<I> So if we can consider
That this and this, it 's comparable </ i>

778
00:36:32,987 --> 00:36:34,536
<I> in terms of gain calculation </ i>

779
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:36,533
<I> and it brings us to
the real values ​​</ i>

780
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:39,208
<I> of an embodiment of power
if not higher than that. </ I>

781
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:42,907
<I> If someone will wish to make
a complete amplifier </ i>

782
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:47,303
<I> by replacing this setup
by a level of full transistors, </ i>

783
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:50,503
<I> he needs to make a gain level</ i>

784
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:52,261
<I> plus a differential pair. </ I>

785
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:55,932
<I> And that will be part of
a detailed exercise </ i>

786
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:58,200
<I> that would be given
after this video </ i>

787
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,040
<I> that summarizes,
for those who realized it, </ i>

788
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,183
<I> an excellent summary
of all of these courses </ i>

789
00:37:05,383 --> 00:37:08,383
<I> you just followed
throughout these videos </ i>

790
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:12,199
<I> because whoever happens to achieve
the equivalent of a full setup</ i>

791
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,941
<I> for delivering power to the output, </ i>

792
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:17,540
<I> then he understood all
the possible </ i>

793
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,420
<I> and imaginable uses of a transistor
and the roles of the various setups</ i>

794
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,087
<I> that are in it. </ I>

795
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:26,043
<I> So I strongly urge you to do
the exercise that will be given. </ I>

796
00:37:26,981 --> 00:37:30,352
To end this chapter on power amplifiers,

797
00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:33,402
I would just summarize what we just saw.

798
00:37:33,602 --> 00:37:36,869
So we analyzed the class A amplifier.

799
00:37:37,069 --> 00:37:43,067
We analyzed the  class A, AB and B amplifiers.

800
00:37:43,267 --> 00:37:46,267
So with these three types of amplifiers,

801
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:48,407
we can make audio amplifiers.

802
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:51,607
I gave a little more focus
on audio amplifiers.

803
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,807
I'll give a complete exercise

804
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:56,720
on the achievement of a class A amp

805
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,349
and a class AB amplifier

806
00:37:59,549 --> 00:38:01,182
and it would be great for a student.

807
00:38:01,382 --> 00:38:02,701
What I would like to end with,

808
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:05,901
for the two setups, it is often necessary

809
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:07,961
to consider the supply voltages.

810
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,007
So we understand that
the power on the charge

811
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,214
is done by the level of the supply voltage.

812
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:14,150
Once we calculated the power

813
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,676
we would like to have
at the output based on the supply,

814
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:21,323
we have a clear idea
of ​​the power value to set.

815
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:23,243
Then in both cases,

816
00:38:23,443 --> 00:38:25,575
it is the voltage follower setups

817
00:38:25,775 --> 00:38:27,096
either A or AB.

818
00:38:27,296 --> 00:38:30,296
So we have an attack level

819
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:32,457
and a counter a reaction level

820
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:35,656
which should be achieved
either by integrated elements

821
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:38,059
either with components bought in the market

822
00:38:38,259 --> 00:38:40,891
which we realize with a large voltage gain

823
00:38:41,091 --> 00:38:42,914
and a differential level at the inlet

824
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:45,394
to perform the counter reaction.
