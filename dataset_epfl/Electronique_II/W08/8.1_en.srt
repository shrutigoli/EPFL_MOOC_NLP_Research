00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,898
Hello, today we'll discuss

2
00:00:07,098 --> 00:00:08,723
amplifiers

3
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:11,670
and especially talk about the notion
of power in the amplifiers.

4
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:14,644
I'll start first with an introduction

5
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:17,616
followed by a classification

6
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:19,599
of amplifiers types

7
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:22,689
Class A, Class AB, Class C, Class D.

8
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:24,227
We'll see what that means

9
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:25,731
and then I'll end

10
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:26,783
this video

11
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:30,528
by telling what is a class A amplifier

12
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:34,589
and analyzing the topology
of a class A type of amplifier.

13
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:40,514
We will start by analyzing the power
dissipated by a periodic signal.

14
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:42,428
You take a charge

15
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:44,770
this charge could be a speaker

16
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:46,760
if we speak of an audio amplifier

17
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:48,198
or it could be something else.

18
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,056
It is a resistive, inductive,
or capacitive charge

19
00:00:52,977 --> 00:00:56,489
and if you look at the voltage
and current that goes through

20
00:00:57,298 --> 00:00:59,707
and you analyze the expression
of current and voltage

21
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,624
given that in the amplifiers

22
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,565
we'll polarize certain types of amp

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,789
therefore there will be a DC component

24
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:09,858
whose average value is zero.

25
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:11,850
There will be also

26
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:14,108
an AC component

27
00:01:14,737 --> 00:01:16,012
whose average value is zero.

28
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:19,576
So I used the color red to identify what is

29
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:22,327
in DC

30
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:24,091
and I used the color blue

31
00:01:25,077 --> 00:01:27,536
to talk about AC components.

32
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,884
The expression for the instantaneous power

33
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:32,908
is the product of U(t) x U(t).

34
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:35,071
I'll multiply this by this

35
00:01:35,404 --> 00:01:37,846
and here is the multiplication result.

36
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,676
We can talk about the average power

37
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:43,431
of a signal

38
00:01:44,283 --> 00:01:48,145
which is composed of
a voltage and a current

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,656
containing a DC portion, AC portion

40
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,046
and here the expression of
the average power,

41
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:55,142
is the integral

42
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,621
between 0 and T over a period

43
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:01,006
of the instant term multiplied by 1 / T.

44
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,644
So you develop this multiplication

45
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:06,425
and you will end up with these terms.

46
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:10,311
I put in yellow what I want,

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,730
it is the useful power in my charge.

48
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,859
So it is that which corresponds
to the AC portion.

49
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,152
you will find

50
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:20,755
a component U0 I0 which is the product

51
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:23,110
of two DC parts.

52
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:25,290
The current continues in the charge,

53
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:28,250
DC voltage at the edge of the charge

54
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:32,742
which will be called the DC power

55
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,660
in the DC nature charge

56
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:37,764
and we will find the useful component,

57
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,448
that I mentioned just now,

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,138
so it is this U (t) × I (t).

59
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,867
Of course this is zero, that is zero

60
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:46,093
because the component,

61
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,189
the integral over one period of a component

62
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,335
whose average value is zero is zero.

63
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,862
So we will end up with an average power

64
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:55,661
and this average power is the one that we'll use

65
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,972
and it is composed of a DC portion
and an AC portion.

66
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:02,787
Just to remind

67
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:04,037
the expression

68
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:06,557
of an average power dissipated in a charge

69
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:10,022
when it is an excitation voltage
of a sinusoidal nature

70
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:13,124
So you remember very well what is called

71
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,761
the phasers.

72
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:16,903
So we'll present

73
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:18,846
this component U (t) I (t)

74
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:22,143
in a charge which might be such

75
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:24,877
inductive, capacitive nature,
or which contains the two components

76
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:25,886
or resistive.

77
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,867
So it has an imaginary part, a real part

78
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,470
and the AC power into a charge like this

79
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:33,431
we saw

80
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:37,421
it is the average value
of a sinusoidal component

81
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:40,937
so it's peak u, peak i multiplied by 1 / T

82
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:46,355
and ∫ 0 to T of sin(ωt), sin (ωt-Φ).

83
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,762
I asked

84
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,385
for a sinusoidal voltage

85
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,168
having a phi phase

86
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:59,340
the power A to C which is the peak u, peak i of 2

87
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:00,762
and I marked it in yellow.

88
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:04,800
Of course we can write the same
thing as Ueff, Ieff, cosΦ

89
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:08,260
but we will see all the time the peak u, peak i  appearring

90
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:09,418
for a simple reason

91
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,836
that it is an amplifier,

92
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,407
just now when we will achieve it,

93
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,274
with components based on transistors.

94
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,651
We are interested in the peak value,

95
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:21,206
we will especially talk

96
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:22,737
of the peak value

97
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,022
because that is the value that will

98
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:27,286
show when the signal saturates or blocks.

99
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,213
When it is a sinusoidal voltage

100
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:30,916
we will see that the sinusoidal voltage

101
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:32,358
will be capped.

102
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:34,551
So we talk quite often in these ...

103
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:36,732
cases of amplifiers

104
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:39,429
of the peak value than the efficient values

105
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:42,748
for understanding reasons of
signal dynamics at the exit.

106
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,459
But we will understand it better

107
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,396
later when I talk of a transistor patterns.

108
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:51,845
When analyzing an amplifier

109
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:54,892
always talk about this concept of optimization.

110
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,535
will optimize what?

111
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,367
Well we will optimize

112
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:01,103
the power that we will draw

113
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:03,704
compared to the power
that we will lose

114
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:05,595
You know very well

115
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:06,963
if you take a quadrupole

116
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:08,742
and you say "I have an amplifier inside"

117
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:10,544
you will it power it

118
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:13,236
by a DC voltage coming from a supply.

119
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:15,689
You will bring a signal

120
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,275
and send back this

121
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:18,802
and if you speak of a charge

122
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:20,045
on this side.

123
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:22,901
the power that will go
to the charge is a component

124
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:24,481
which must be very accurate

125
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:27,486
with respect to the input signal

126
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,780
but amplified in power

127
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:31,778
whose power comes from the DC.

128
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,368
We will talk all the time about

129
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:34,955
yield.

130
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,096
What is it that we had to give in there

131
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:39,897
and what had we to remove out
and what was lost?

132
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:42,498
So the yield is expressed as

133
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:44,386
the output power

134
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:47,078
divided by the input power

135
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:49,289
plus the DC power

136
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:50,609
that the power supply gave.

137
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:53,430
Quite often DC power, it

138
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,391
pardons the input power

139
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:57,156
with respect to the DC power

140
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,576
this is supposed to be 3 times nothing

141
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,769
because usually the power is amplified

142
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:01,695
hence the title

143
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,168
power amplifier.

144
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:03,735
So,

145
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:04,971
the component here

146
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:06,536
is the greatest of the two

147
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,598
which is the smallest

148
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:09,766
relative to the two

149
00:06:10,723 --> 00:06:13,146
and generally, if you take a signal here

150
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:14,664
whose power is very low

151
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:15,724
we can neglect it

152
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:16,999
with respect to this power

153
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:18,359
which is supposed

154
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:20,677
to provide us the component that must

155
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:22,654
exceed these two things

156
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:24,318
and there is power that we will lose

157
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,893
that will come from the DC power.

158
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:28,155
So in return

159
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:29,929
this is what came out as power

160
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:31,410
compared to what was given

161
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:32,484
in the supply.

162
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,560
So this, we will come back to it everytime

163
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:35,836
and comment on it

164
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:37,627
for these different types of amp that we'll see.

165
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,131
We will define what is called

166
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:41,993
the amplifier class.

167
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,242
And I will talk

168
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,766
of classes

169
00:06:46,203 --> 00:06:47,930
A to start.

170
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:49,541
In the title there is an error.

171
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:51,457
So we will not speak of class B,

172
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:54,432
we will rather speak of class
so I erase this.

173
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:56,820
We are talking of classes A

174
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:59,203
and immediately afterwards we will talk

175
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,668
of class B and AB classes.

176
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,083
The definition of a class A amplifier

177
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:06,502
this is an amplifier

178
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:10,128
when you take the non-linear component

179
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:11,206
a transistor

180
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:13,014
it can be any type of transistor

181
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:14,937
Bipolar, MOS, or otherwise.

182
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:16,459
We have an output current

183
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:18,145
and a control voltage.

184
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:24,205
If your transistor conducts
throughout the period of a signal

185
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,111
you can speak of a class A amplifier

186
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:30,052
That is, your transistor,
you need to polarize it.

187
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:32,866
You must apply a DC component.

188
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:36,334
And then when you make
a change in the control voltage

189
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:37,493
of this transistor

190
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,558
you will see that your transistor will never

191
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:40,324
or saturate

192
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,396
or block, so it will stay all the time

193
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:43,169
in this

194
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:45,156
conversion characteristic

195
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:47,108
voltage - current.

196
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:50,033
And it will never come into blockage.

197
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:51,984
So it is called the conduct transistor

198
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,304
throughout the signal period.

199
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:55,991
And if you look at it at the exit

200
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:57,590
you look at the current

201
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:58,664
that you can put in your charge,

202
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,162
that's the charge line,

203
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:01,481
which has a slope 1 / RL

204
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,042
with a negative sign in front

205
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,612
and you see these different characteristics

206
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,073
which are controlled by the UBE.

207
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:09,041
So you have the UBE which varies here

208
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:11,392
and you will see that this UBE which varies

209
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:13,617
and here we will see a current

210
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,499
which is sent to the charge

211
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,520
and that

212
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,021
linearity is expressed.

213
00:08:20,278 --> 00:08:21,711
This is when the transistor blocks.

214
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:24,152
And here is when the transistor saturates.

215
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,395
So if we neglect saturation

216
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,116
one can very well speak

217
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,609
of a dynamic which is equal
to the supply voltage

218
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:31,797
so we will be able to say

219
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,073
that a signal

220
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,702
if we polarized the transistor well

221
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:36,879
that is to say, we placed

222
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:39,066
our DC component

223
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:41,401
on the DC output voltage

224
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,294
In the middle of the charge graph as follows

225
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:46,787
we will have a positive alternation

226
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,847
exactly equal to this alternation
of the other side.

227
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:51,639
And all this without ever

228
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,647
blocking the transistor or saturating it.

229
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,622
This is the blocking here

230
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:58,697
of your transistor

231
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:00,414
and saturation

232
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:02,839
if this is the blockage

233
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,576
this, will be almost here,

234
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:07,605
we will consider it here

235
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:10,410
so we will talk about saturation here

236
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,666
and we will talk about a dynamic
that is equal to

237
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,792
VCC of 0 to VCC.

238
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,923
And we'll talk about half of the dynamic

239
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:20,744
if we really polarized in the middle

240
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:21,821
of the charge graph

241
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,406
When we speak of a class B amplifier

242
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:28,849
here, the data is another

243
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,914
transistor

244
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:33,848
or just going to be especially transistors

245
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,201
that will conduct

246
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:38,421
or conduct during a half period
of a sinus signal.

247
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,464
What we will do is that

248
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,649
we will place the transistor
when the transistor is off

249
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:46,917
and each time there is a positive half

250
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:48,354
one we'll conduct

251
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,588
and we need another transistor

252
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:51,944
to make it conduct

253
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,377
for the negative alternation.

254
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:55,412
So we stand around zero

255
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:58,345
here we will say that the transistor
will conduct only

256
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,912
in a period

257
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:00,829
and again

258
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:02,241
we will have a problem

259
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:04,194
of the transistor blocking

260
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:07,566
between here and there
before starting to conduct

261
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,162
then we will have a distortion

262
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:09,886
of the signal

263
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:11,763
and that's why we talk

264
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:14,042
of a Class B amplifier

265
00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:17,421
whose expression is really
one that is written there:

266
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,234
the transistors conduct

267
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:21,295
during a half period of a signal

268
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,819
and they are blocked for

269
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:26,771
for a better part of their characteristic

270
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:28,348
and they will conduct after

271
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,681
and then we will need

272
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:33,514
another transistor which conducts for the other alternately

273
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:35,409
and here we will talk about

274
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:37,644
two complementary types of transistors

275
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,709
and we'll see right away that it is a push-pull setup.

276
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:43,305
So here is the characteristic

277
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:45,841
of a class B amplifier

278
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,674
We will see that when we talk about AB

279
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,956
is that we added inside
a little bit of component A

280
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:53,220
that is to say we polarized

281
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,164
the transistor slightly

282
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,744
for this transistor to block

283
00:10:59,028 --> 00:10:59,823
correctly.

284
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,072
But it is close to blocking

285
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,744
and very little polarized,

286
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,026
absolutely not like the class A amplifier

287
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:08,741
where we made the transistor conduct throughout.

288
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:10,969
So here we see the two characteristics

289
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:12,128
of a transistor

290
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,670
and another transistor

291
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,255
where one will conduct in alternation

292
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:19,197
in this direction and the other
for the other alternation

293
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,372
and we see that there are two transistors

294
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,036
and it will be our famous push-pull setup.

295
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,497
Look at what is a class C amplifier

296
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:30,662
So typically the amp A and Class A

297
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,921
and class B could have been used

298
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:34,198
to make the audio.

299
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:37,624
Here we are talking about
a rather special amplifier.

300
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:40,098
I will read the expression:

301
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:44,195
the transistor conducts for less
than a half period of a signal.

302
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:47,564
So if the class A amp was polarized here,

303
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:51,211
if the Class B amp was polarized here,

304
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:54,212
the class A amp, it was polarized here

305
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:56,375
the Class C amplifier is polarized

306
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,111
when the transistor is really blocked

307
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:00,414
is seriously blocked

308
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,778
and it will simply conduct, look when

309
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,684
it will conduct just for the small spikes
if I talk of a sinusoidal voltage.

310
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,821
Your transistor is blocked all along

311
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:13,539
and whenever there is a small
alternation going from here to there

312
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,303
your transistor will send
a current to the output.

313
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:19,753
So we will find current peaks

314
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:22,359
that will happen just during

315
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:25,836
what we call an opening angle
of our transistor

316
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,631
that is to say it is a tiny bit

317
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:30,861
but it is adjusted with your generated signal .

318
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:32,633
If it is a periodic signal

319
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,200
we will filter the signal.

320
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:37,153
So if you put a selective filter,

321
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,646
if your charge is an
LC type resonant circuit

322
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:45,702
you'll have your filter

323
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:49,207
thanks to this impedance

324
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:52,086
which is a narrow band pass filter

325
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:53,709
or resonant circuit.

326
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:56,175
You'll just have a voltage corresponding

327
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,275
to a voltage which is synchronous with

328
00:12:58,506 --> 00:13:01,402
the fundamental frequency of your signal.

329
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:02,362
So that brings us

330
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:03,790
to certain types of amplifiers

331
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:04,993
typically used

332
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,346
in RF amplifiers

333
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:08,495
or high frequency

334
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:11,055
with a quite specific charge

335
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:12,803
of LC filter type.

336
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:14,974
So these amplifiers will not be considered

337
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,152
as part of what we'll do

338
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,618
in this video and in the following video.

339
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:24,239
But this is typical of the amplifiers
used in high frequency circuits.

340
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,401
The class D amplifier

341
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:30,046
we will read this sentence below:

342
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:32,551
the voltage out is rectangular

343
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:35,114
at high frequency

344
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,132
whose average obtained by low-pass filtering

345
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:39,378
in the useful signal.

346
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:42,488
That means, it's not a linear amplifier,

347
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:44,998
so we will not take Y = AX

348
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:48,149
because we will first pick

349
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:51,928
the transistor or two transistors

350
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:54,919
and we will each be in the part
where the transistor

351
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:57,274
does not behave as a current source.

352
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:01,073
So we will each time push
the transistor to saturation.

353
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:04,055
It will no longer function as a switch.

354
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:05,984
So we block it

355
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:07,989
and saturate it, we block and saturate it.

356
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,089
And when we do this with a transistor

357
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:12,871
it will give us a square signal
according to what we control with.

358
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:16,190
So the output voltage is a signal

359
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,006
like the one you see here it is rectangular.

360
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,266
and we will use this kind of installation

361
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:23,623
to do the signal modulation.

362
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,225
I will give an example right away.

363
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,187
Here is an example.

364
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:28,949
I took a signal

365
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:33,078
modulated by the PWM

366
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,632
that is to say it is

367
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,179
a pulse width modulation .

368
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:39,642
If you take a square sign,

369
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,398
you modulate in PWM,

370
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:44,200
you pass it through a filter,

371
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:46,706
which is in blue which is a signal

372
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:49,059
of rectangular type,

373
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:51,929
if you filter by low-pass
you will see what is in red.

374
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:54,904
And that will give you your desired signal.

375
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,524
If this is an audio signal

376
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:59,661
and the signal that appears with the blue

377
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:01,397
is a modulated signal PWM

378
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,238
and you filter you get your audio signal.

379
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:06,213
The efficiency of such a setup

380
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:09,491
is extremely high compared
to the returns that we know.

381
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:13,191
Unfortunately our blue signal

382
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:16,457
is a signal which is rectangular in nature

383
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:17,716
and that risks

384
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,614
keeping still some harmonies

385
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:21,382
and which requires a fairly specific filter

386
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:22,966
and the higher the power

387
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:24,564
the more it is a passive filter

388
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,128
of a dimensional nature

389
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:29,161
to have a useful signal

390
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,373
in red

391
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:35,986
unique to what was in the carrier
that we put in the PWM.

392
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,280
You can of course use a ΣΔ

393
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,393
where the width of the pulses
are fixed duration.

394
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:43,039
This is the temporal density

395
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,287
therefore we see here by the zero crossing

396
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:48,984
more pulse is seen that when
the signal passes through the maximum.

397
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:51,691
It is a type of modulation you will study

398
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:53,849
in other types of courses.

399
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:55,321
Nevertheless this amp either

400
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:57,164
we will not study it under

401
00:15:57,396 --> 00:16:01,148
this course, we will focus on
class A amplifiers,

402
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,668
Class AB amplifiers, and B.

403
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:07,163
I'll start with the class A amplifiers

404
00:16:07,962 --> 00:16:10,381
A class A amplifier is what we studied for

405
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:12,366
the whole series of this courses

406
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:15,192
that is to say we took
a transistor and we polarized it.

407
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:17,333
If I take the common transmitter

408
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:21,269
We used the common transmitter
with a resistive charge in the collector

409
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:24,808
but the common collector,
resistive charge in the transmitter

410
00:16:25,338 --> 00:16:27,322
or a charge of no other
nature than resistive.

411
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,021
We used the same assembl

412
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:31,445
for decoupling the DC component.

413
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,210
We put a coupling capacitor

414
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,728
and we put the charge

415
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:38,608
on the other side so that there is
no direct current flowing through it.

416
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:41,498
Similar: common transmitter, common collector.

417
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:44,855
We did not study the inductive charge

418
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:46,303
where a transformer is placed

419
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:50,807
where in terms of DC, the connector of
this transistor is connected directly here

420
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:54,822
in terms of AC it is the current change in

421
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:57,002
that will inductively couple

422
00:16:57,432 --> 00:17:01,921
in the other self or the other
part of the transformer

423
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,307
a variable signal that
will be on the resistance.

424
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,681
So I will not talk about this

425
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,916
because we will try to focus
primarily on audio amplifiers.

426
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,338
It's very bad in terms of audio amplifiers

427
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:16,341
because if you put a speaker here, instead

428
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,128
of this

429
00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:20,859
it's true that you have decoupled the component

430
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:21,965
continue

431
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,890
but remember that your charge

432
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,425
from the AC perspective

433
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,165
is in parallel with this resistor.

434
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,333
So you're going to have

435
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:32,394
an AC component also in this resistance

436
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,935
but doesn't correspond to
a sound coming out of a speaker

437
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:37,593
but again you will have
a sound in the speaker

438
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:40,359
but which part of it has been
lost in this resistor

439
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:42,818
which serves to polarize the transistor.

440
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:44,261
So generally

441
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:47,367
th, we will see that the performance will be better.

442
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:51,953
Here it is used because
it has a poor performance.

443
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,591
And here it is excellent
in terms of performances

444
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:56,784
but as we have not talked of inductive charges

445
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:58,633
and inductive couplings

446
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:00,642
I will not tackle it.

447
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:02,929
However I'll talk about both types of setups

448
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,885
because we studied the active loads

449
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:09,250
and we will see that to win
the fact that we decouple

450
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,207
a loudspeaker when we plug it to a DC node

451
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:16,125
we could do it in this way.

452
00:18:16,322 --> 00:18:19,168
That is, we'll take a transistor and
then we will put a current source

453
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:20,785
and you can put the current here

454
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:23,927
so like that our speaker
has no DC current.

455
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:25,641
So we will study this

456
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:27,068
and this.

457
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,963
Of course in common transmitter

458
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,293
or common connector.

459
00:18:30,513 --> 00:18:32,344
This and this is the realization

460
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:36,720
of this same setup drawn
with a real transistor.

461
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:40,193
I begin with the class A amplifier

462
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:43,187
So you know very well

463
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:43,996
these two setups.

464
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:46,503
We studied the common transmitter

465
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:48,178
and we brought each time

466
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:50,681
to analysis of the gain and polarization.

467
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:50,615
analysis of the gain and polarization.

468
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:53,003
This time, I will bring our thinking

469
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:54,594
to performance analysis

470
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:58,087
and power that we will send to our charge

471
00:18:58,282 --> 00:19:00,556
in relation to what will
be injected as signal at the input.

472
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,398
So we will think in terms of performance.

473
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:05,862
When you take the common transmitter setup or common connector

474
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:10,255
and you have a signal
if this is your charge

475
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:12,843
you always have a DC component

476
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,667
that will go through your charge.

477
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,966
So the current you see here

478
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:21,241
IC = IC or IE in the common connector

479
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,180
will be an average value

480
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:25,354
of any signal you impose

481
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:28,227
So here if you look
in terms of polarization

482
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:31,767
you have your load carrying an IC0 current.

483
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:33,974
The voltage that appears

484
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:37,821
UCE0, so this voltage
that I see from here to there.

485
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,244
Or from here to there.

486
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,192
This is the voltage drop

487
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:47,552
IC x RL - VCC is what will remain for VCE.

488
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,837
Sorry I had to use the minus sign

489
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,913
not in the right place.

490
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:54,604
This is the VCC - ICRL
if I have a phase problem.

491
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:57,511
So UCE0 voltage or VCE0

492
00:19:57,895 --> 00:19:59,577
it is the difference of this tension here

493
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:02,071
minus the voltage drop
I have on this resistor

494
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:03,127
which is written here.

495
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:07,959
So if you inject a useful
alternating signal

496
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,165
it is this one, if it was music,

497
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:12,345
it is that you would have
heard in your speaker

498
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:16,148
and it is one that will vibrate
your speaker membrane.

499
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:17,797
Here you can talk

500
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,487
of an increase in current variation

501
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:24,930
a small IC2T current which is
equal to peak i, sinωT.

502
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:29,723
The VCE0 voltage is the peak V, sinωT.

503
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,047
In other words

504
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:35,963
it is the phase with a minus sign:
- RL sinωT

505
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:40,116
when I talk about this setup shown here.

506
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,984
So there's a phase inversion
with a minus sign.

507
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,642
Let's talk about power.

508
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:48,250
It introduced the concept of power

509
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:50,452
and said there is a DC component

510
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:54,642
and there is another component
that will likely be of AC nature.

511
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:56,564
The DC component

512
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:57,981
in the charge

513
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,911
is the one we just saw here.

514
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:01,895
And the AC component

515
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:11,638
is the peak i sinωT times
voltage times current.

516
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:13,797
We said we will do especially

517
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,079
watch the peak values,

518
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:21,093
given that cosΦ in this case, is 1.

519
00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:23,033
So that's why I do not see it here.

520
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:25,689
So I have peak V times peak i divided by 2.

521
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:27,390
I could talk about the efficient values

522
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:29,840
but we'll talk all the time of peak values

523
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,450
because it is this value here
that is important to us

524
00:21:32,772 --> 00:21:36,701
if we want to see if this voltage is equal to VCC.

525
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:39,496
That is to say, the sine goes
through a maximum

526
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:43,337
when the transistor is blocked

527
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:46,340
and so it goes through the voltage VCC

528
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,805
and when your transistor
is saturated that is when VCC = 0

529
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,778
I'll talk about the peak component here.

530
00:21:52,924 --> 00:21:54,870
This is why we talk all the time of peak value,

531
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,445
because we see the true dynamics.

532
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:59,095
And here it is polarized, that is we put

533
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,672
the DC component in the center
of the charge graph,

534
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:05,047
we will have a dynamic
exactly equal to VCC.

535
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,372
In the transistor,
as voltage and current are reversed

536
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:16,650
So the minus sign indicates
that current and voltage

537
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,438
are in a reverse phase,

538
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:19,526
and I see it here.

539
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:22,762
It's the same, I'll find the DC component

540
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:24,266
UCE0

541
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:25,163
at rest

542
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,230
multiplied by the current IC0

543
00:22:28,478 --> 00:22:30,383
flowing through the transistor which
is the same as in the charge

544
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,866
minus the peak i divided by two.

545
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:37,612
The power supply is a voltage IC

546
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,874
so the one that is polarization

547
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:42,201
multiplied by the supply rails.

548
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:44,437
In this instance, we have VDC.

549
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,969
So we have a total power

550
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:47,561
that the power should provide

551
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:49,083
which is equal to VCC IC0

552
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:50,761
which is nothing but
the sum of these two.

553
00:22:51,158 --> 00:22:52,476
If you add these two things,

554
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:57,071
you have that, and a plus sign
and a minus sign will disappear

555
00:22:57,462 --> 00:23:00,567
so you'll have the -VCE0 IC0

556
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:05,463
and + VCE0 IC0 it will you keep
the VCC IC0 which is here.

557
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:08,849
So the power will provide the supply voltage

558
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:11,218
multiplied by the polarized current.

559
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,037
Now write,

560
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:19,723
the useful power which is in the charge
divided by the total power.

561
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,496
So I'll erase everything that I added

562
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:23,115
and here it is.

563
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:26,700
The whole component
useful is only this one.

564
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:30,935
That's is the useful power sent to my load.

565
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,823
So if you connect a speaker here

566
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:38,279
Your speaker will definitely
move the membrane

567
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:40,062
and send the acoustic wave

568
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,762
with a power which is equal to

569
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:45,202
the peak multiplied by
the peak value divided by two.

570
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:48,497
And it will be the useful
component that I will use

571
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,593
and I have to divide by
the power component.

572
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:55,263
That which comes from the supply

573
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:59,897
So I find the peak V,  peak I divided by two

574
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,892
divided by the DC component
coming from the power supply.

575
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:09,743
I repeat the same thing just now.

576
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:13,573
Both setups common transmitter
and common connector.

577
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:16,639
I put my charge line at the output

578
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,281
and I am in the condition where
I really have the maximum yield.

579
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:23,039
My performance is greatest when

580
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:25,019
I put my charge line

581
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:28,161
and I impose a polarization in my charge line

582
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:31,673
that is in the middle of my charge line.

583
00:24:31,974 --> 00:24:36,482
So I have the positive part,

584
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,247
the part where the sinuses goes
through an average value

585
00:24:39,552 --> 00:24:42,552
which is equal to the voltage VCE0.

586
00:24:42,912 --> 00:24:49,012
The positive part of this, the part
that goes from VCC until VCE0

587
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:51,267
is VC0 to 0

588
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:52,910
will give me a sine

589
00:24:53,254 --> 00:24:58,666
which has a peak value Vmax
is equal to VCC / 2.

590
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:00,590
So when I apply

591
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,836
a polarization equal to VCC / 2

592
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:09,072
therefore when this node here is at VCC / 2

593
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:10,013
at rest

594
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,423
as here, of course,

595
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:14,884
So here if I am at VCC / 2

596
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:18,721
I'm sure the dynamic I see at the exit

597
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:20,842
I have to put it in blue, it would be better,

598
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:22,370
So the dynamic rising

599
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:25,439
happens, it hits against
the supply voltage here

600
00:25:25,711 --> 00:25:26,457
it will go down

601
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,384
It will hit against the mass.

602
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:32,605
Here the transistor blocks,
here the transistor saturates.

603
00:25:32,957 --> 00:25:34,652
And I end up with a dynamic at the exit

604
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:35,655
which is maximum.

605
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,851
So I just have to say that at this moment

606
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,064
the peak value will be

607
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:43,508
the maximum value of the peak
equal to VCC / 2.

608
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:46,564
When I polarize

609
00:25:46,728 --> 00:25:48,755
the transistor in the middle
of the supply rails,

610
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:51,895
it is very important to remember, this is what was said

611
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:54,975
when we learned the concept of dynamics

612
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:55,999
and saw that

613
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:59,609
when the dynamic is maximum
when it has the power rails

614
00:25:59,863 --> 00:26:00,750
and we move to the middle.

615
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:04,450
And at that moment
the expression of our performance

616
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:10,255
I need to replace the Vmax by VCC / 2

617
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:17,391
and Imax by IC0

618
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:23,941
and here I simplified this and that,
I simplify this and that.

619
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:27,749
And I'll be left with VCC / 2,
which would be added here.

620
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:31,036
So I replace VCC / 2,
the VCC that is in here

621
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,537
I will be left with 1/2 times
the 2 that is left here.

622
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,612
It gives me 1/4, so 25%.

623
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:38,928
We come to realize that taking a transistor

624
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,733
and using it as a common connector

625
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,099
which is the ideal class A amplifier

626
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:48,503
and polarizing it correctly
in the middle of the charge line

627
00:26:48,663 --> 00:26:50,870
gives us a maximum theoretical yield

628
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:52,435
equal to 25%

629
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,542
and we can not do better.

630
00:26:55,873 --> 00:26:57,193
Let's analyze it.

631
00:26:58,314 --> 00:26:59,816
So I look at the rest.

632
00:27:00,698 --> 00:27:02,362
This is what we concluded earlier.

633
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:07,764
At rest, when I polarize at VCC / 2

634
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:13,473
so I keep half the of supply voltage

635
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:17,545
shared with my transistor and on my charge.

636
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,818
I lost 50% of the components,

637
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:25,338
I have not yet imposed a variable signal

638
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:27,006
so I do not listen to music.

639
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:30,227
As soon as you turn on
an amplifier of this nature,

640
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:33,829
you will have in your care
a dissipated DC power

641
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:36,271
IC0 of VCC / 2.

642
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:38,064
So your speaker it will move

643
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,674
by the current flowing through it

644
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:42,131
and after it remains static in one place

645
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:44,192
but it begins to dissipate this power here.

646
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:49,172
Transistors and charges dissipate
the same power at rest.

647
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:51,651
Then you take your signal

648
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:54,017
and we will see what will appears here.

649
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:57,260
We saw the rest,

650
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:59,954
we will look at the maximum
power that can be drawn.

651
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:04,318
There is a quarter that was in the transistor

652
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:07,859
that will pass to the charge.

653
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,325
So there, in this 50%

654
00:28:10,545 --> 00:28:12,944
which was heated in this transistor at rest

655
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:15,536
which becomes the useful component

656
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:19,509
which will add to this DC component
that was in the charge.

657
00:28:20,172 --> 00:28:21,656
So if you look at what is happening here

658
00:28:21,943 --> 00:28:25,022
you can see the useful signal

659
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,815
So the AAC component
that was in your charge

660
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:30,138
came from the transistor

661
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,989
and you'll keep 50% of
the DC component in the charge

662
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:35,393
which continues to be dissipated.

663
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:37,437
And at that time your transistor

664
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:41,332
it loses some of its DC power

665
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,814
because it converted it into AC
towards the charge.

666
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:47,012
So we can not do better than 25%.

667
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:49,379
And in practice it is less than this

668
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:51,660
because we need electronics around

669
00:28:51,804 --> 00:28:52,515
and remember that

670
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:56,011
a class A amplifier is simply
a common collector

671
00:28:56,216 --> 00:28:59,183
that is used and would allow a signal

672
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,384
to be amplified.

673
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:03,696
And that's the best qualities of amplifiers

674
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:06,704
because the transistor is always conducting

675
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:10,873
and we do not lose the transition from
one state to the other of this transistor.

676
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:14,653
But we have all the time
a DC component in our speakers

677
00:29:14,847 --> 00:29:17,097
and this we do not like it,
the speaker do not like it either.

678
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,587
So if I have to comment what we just saw

679
00:29:21,786 --> 00:29:23,086
and draw some conclusions

680
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:26,034
we need a constant supply

681
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,560
and it is a supply

682
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:29,696
which should provide plenty of power

683
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:32,491
compared with the power
that we take on the charge.

684
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:36,673
Because there is 75%
of the power that is supplied

685
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:40,019
which will be lost to draw only
25% of the loudspeaker.

686
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:42,062
and all this, the supply that is here

687
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,482
unfortunately is providing it all the same.

688
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:48,998
So the power dissipated in
the transistor and maximum rest,

689
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,287
is equal to the power supply divided by 2

690
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:54,481
and once you start putting a signal

691
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:59,699
the transistor begins to evacuate
the part that was lost as heat

692
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,190
because it turns it into a useful charge.

693
00:30:02,624 --> 00:30:03,791
And unfortunately

694
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:05,325
there is a DC current

695
00:30:05,592 --> 00:30:07,672
which will spend all the time in your load

696
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,716
in this kind of installation.

697
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,841
And the burden is covered permanently

698
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,850
by a continuous current component.

699
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,642
Which is unacceptable for a speaker.

700
00:30:15,865 --> 00:30:18,446
As we saw, you send a direct current,

701
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:19,873
your speaker moves,

702
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,703
and it will remain in this situation

703
00:30:21,912 --> 00:30:24,388
with a DC dissipation.

704
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,068
We can remedy this DC history

705
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,648
by making a setup where
the active filler is used.

706
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:37,656
And here we talk of a polarization current
and voltage symmetrical.

707
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:40,908
That is to say, instead of having
a supply voltage VCC

708
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:41,733
as earlier

709
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:43,658
we have more or less a VCC.

710
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,349
And like that our load,
it can be placed at a midpoint.

711
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:51,223
So again at rest we are in the middle
of the dynamics.

712
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:52,562
As earlier,

713
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,212
but the middle of the dynamics
can be polarized

714
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:58,585
to something of the order
of magnitude of zero volts.

715
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,983
So the charge at rest

716
00:31:03,314 --> 00:31:05,619
will be between the mass

717
00:31:05,817 --> 00:31:07,932
and something that could be found

718
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,832
around zero volts with a little offset.

719
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,667
So there can be a current
that passes in our charge.

720
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,464
So it is always the same idea:

721
00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:18,746
half of the dynamics.

722
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,760
Because you put VCE0 = VCC.

723
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:25,680
And you keep part of the VC voltage

724
00:31:25,882 --> 00:31:27,101
on the speaker.

725
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:30,834
Then you arrange that all
the current you polarize with

726
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:33,003
be taken by your transistor

727
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,788
so if IS = IC

728
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:37,849
you may well say that there
is no polarization current

729
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:40,861
So at rest, the current here in red

730
00:31:41,184 --> 00:31:42,824
is approximately equal to zero

731
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:44,675
because all the current will pass like this.

732
00:31:45,263 --> 00:31:48,072
After you start changing the voltage

733
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:51,852
So you push this current into the charge

734
00:31:52,185 --> 00:31:56,351
when you lower the current IC.

735
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,836
So that means that the voltage has dropped.

736
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:00,723
but when you increase the voltage

737
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:03,069
you will draw more current here

738
00:32:03,218 --> 00:32:04,542
which exceeds the current IS

739
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:05,893
and which will be taken from the ground

740
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,950
and descend via your transistor.

741
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:10,310
So the ideal situation

742
00:32:10,626 --> 00:32:12,547
is that if you can make a setup

743
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:14,469
exactly where all the current that is there

744
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:15,828
is equal to the current which is here

745
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,617
you arrange to end up with an ICRL = AVCC.

746
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,792
That is, at rest, you find yourself
with an alternation

747
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,861
when all the current passes
through the charge

748
00:32:27,193 --> 00:32:29,649
the tension rises to VCC.

749
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:32,666
After all when the current

750
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:35,717
is practically passing through the transistor

751
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:39,142
you will lower this alternation here

752
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:40,637
arriving towards -VCC.

753
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:45,295
And like that you have a dynamic
that is equal to 2 x VCC.

754
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:49,550
And in practice it takes
a little more than 2 x VCC

755
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:52,751
because we need some additional current

756
00:32:52,926 --> 00:32:54,491
So there will be a small current

757
00:32:54,835 --> 00:32:57,411
to balance the difference of the two currents

758
00:32:57,712 --> 00:33:00,006
which is drawn from the charge

759
00:33:00,132 --> 00:33:01,219
to be pushed into the charge

760
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:04,266
but we're no longer in the condition
of a class A amp

761
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:07,442
where all the polarization current
was already in the charge.

762
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,534
So we managed by a setup like this

763
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:12,763
to avoid having an excessive DC current

764
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:14,621
especially if this is a loudspeaker.

765
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:17,675
And I want to analyze.

766
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:19,816
I'll analyze as earlier.

767
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:22,440
So in the charge

768
00:33:22,642 --> 00:33:25,044
we always have peak v peak i divided by two.

769
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:28,809
So it is V squared divided by times RL.

770
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:32,159
If I replace peak v by peak i in RL.

771
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,114
And the power that the supply
should have given

772
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,148
it should be

773
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:43,653
the total power is the sum of
what I will have in the source

774
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:47,146
so it's VCC x IS

775
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:49,823
and the transistor will take

776
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:54,829
the VCC x IS minus what I had in charge

777
00:33:55,004 --> 00:33:57,118
the peak v peak i divided by 2.

778
00:33:57,403 --> 00:34:00,535
So if you add up what appears here

779
00:34:00,823 --> 00:34:02,810
well you will see that the total power

780
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:05,384
is 2VDC times IS.

781
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,270
Now you analyze,

782
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:09,174
you do the power in the charge,

783
00:34:09,353 --> 00:34:10,580
the peak v on 2RL

784
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:11,938
you replace it here.

785
00:34:12,146 --> 00:34:14,209
The total power, this one

786
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:16,578
you fall back to an expression

787
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:22,946
peak v/ 4RL by the DC component
which is VCC IC.

788
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:25,805
We will see at once that
we did not gain in returns

789
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:29,772
actually we avoided that there be
a DC current passing through the speaker

790
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,637
and we avoided that this DC current

791
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:36,176
be all the time in a charge that does
not like this kind of current.

792
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:39,092
And unfortunately we kept the same performance,

793
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:39,939
normally.

794
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:42,731
Because we multiplied
the supply voltage by two.

795
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,784
Let's analyze this.

796
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:48,555
We are in the same condition as earlier:

797
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:51,057
we want to have maximum dynamic

798
00:34:51,432 --> 00:34:53,888
and the maximum dynamic is obtained

799
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:58,183
when we start in the middle
of the supply rails.

800
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:02,454
That is, we are between 0 and VCC on one side

801
00:35:02,654 --> 00:35:03,965
and 0 and -VCC on the other side

802
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,727
and seen here between 0 and -VCC

803
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:07,879
and 0 and VCC.

804
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:13,217
And when you have a signal
that shows the variation around VCE

805
00:35:13,428 --> 00:35:17,562
we will see that this voltage
rises to 2 VCCC

806
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,104
and down to -VCC

807
00:35:19,338 --> 00:35:21,095
therefore the peak value

808
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:23,808
from here to here

809
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:25,446
is equal to VCC.

810
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,920
And that is what is written here.

811
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,210
So your peak value is equal to VCC

812
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:33,423
and the maximum current that
you can send in your charge

813
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:34,982
is exactly what we said!

814
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:37,272
this current Is that can
pass through the charge

815
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,647
be pushed in this direction

816
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:40,120
be pulled in that direction

817
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:42,413
so it's VCC / R.

818
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,714
You now replace the value of peak V

819
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:49,356
with VCC

820
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:54,933
Here, you will end up with
a yield equal to 25%

821
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:56,691
and we will have gained nothing.

822
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:59,123
So you replace the Is by its value

823
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:00,786
and V peak by its value

824
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:03,655
and you end up with a quarter

825
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,871
So you end up with a yield of 25%.

826
00:36:07,068 --> 00:36:08,762
This is the same returns we got before.

827
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:11,210
Typically, Class A amplifiers

828
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,899
are around this kind of setup.

829
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:15,069
That is to say, we take a common manifold

830
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:16,667
a current source is carried out

831
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:19,294
and it is this power source that will provide

832
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:22,188
the current Is that will pass
into our transistor;

833
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,192
To analyze what we have just seen

834
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:29,011
so we will make a comparison at rest.

835
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,024
This is the same report as earlier.

836
00:36:32,415 --> 00:36:33,739
Remember we added a power source

837
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:38,135
which was not in the pure class A amplifier
without an active charge.

838
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:40,259
Here we find that the charge

839
00:36:40,476 --> 00:36:42,976
as there is no direct current, so at rest,

840
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,596
this we gained over it,
there is no more current content.

841
00:36:45,883 --> 00:36:47,649
But it added an additional component

842
00:36:47,846 --> 00:36:49,846
who took the balance of the DC current

843
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,402
which was in the charge.

844
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:53,635
If we now look at what happens

845
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,075
when we have an Ac component

846
00:36:57,164 --> 00:37:00,240
we will end up with what we had seen earlier:

847
00:37:00,763 --> 00:37:03,249
your transistor gives 25%

848
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:07,084
this time it will come from here to there.

849
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:13,234
While having a current source that will
continue to lose this DC component

850
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:15,978
which will remain at 50%.

851
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:19,609
And the 25% that the active transistor lost

852
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:21,237
will move into the charge

853
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,122
and we find ourselves with a total power

854
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,027
of Vcc Is which is the 100%
so the sum of everything we see here.

855
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:31,565
Lets do a small analysis

856
00:37:32,141 --> 00:37:34,686
of what has been found with these polarizations

857
00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:39,264
with a current source and more VCC - VCC.

858
00:37:39,782 --> 00:37:43,340
So we have once again
constant supply voltages.

859
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,992
This is typically the setup that is used

860
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,903
to achieve power amps

861
00:37:49,237 --> 00:37:52,220
although this is a class A amp

862
00:37:52,926 --> 00:37:54,747
with a common emitter

863
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,605
but generally the power levels have

864
00:37:57,827 --> 00:37:59,971
voltage followers.

865
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:02,347
Their goal is to boost the current

866
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:03,842
they take from the supply

867
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,479
and passes towards the outlet.

868
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:08,343
And above all they have a very
low output impedance.

869
00:38:08,675 --> 00:38:10,364
because it comes on a transistor emitter.

870
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:13,514
So the yield remains low

871
00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:18,436
The power dissipated by
the transistor is maximum at rest

872
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:21,383
is equal to the power supply divided by two.

873
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:23,381
And then we can say

874
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:24,398
we gained

875
00:38:24,608 --> 00:38:26,311
by this setup compared to the first

876
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:29,165
that is we do not have a DC component in the charge

877
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:32,419
and this is a good solution for
a class A audio amplifier

878
00:38:32,762 --> 00:38:33,969
especially in common collector,

879
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:35,110
what we just discussed.

880
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,642
And you are in the market full of amplifiers

881
00:38:37,804 --> 00:38:39,798
which are based on an active transistor

882
00:38:40,002 --> 00:38:43,357
which may be a bipolar amplifier,

883
00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:46,200
MOS or a tube amplifier

884
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,054
that maybe, you do not know

885
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:50,057
because we did not speak of it in this course.

886
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,984
But it is still, to this day used in tube amplifiers

887
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:58,433
which are used as active elements.

888
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:02,038
And I would like to finish this video

889
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:04,533
with the following conclusions.

890
00:39:05,198 --> 00:39:08,623
All that has been said and repeated

891
00:39:08,995 --> 00:39:11,344
is that class A amplifiers

892
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:16,276
are amplifiers, quite often,
not with very strong powers

893
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:19,779
because if we look for extremely high powers,

894
00:39:20,374 --> 00:39:22,838
there are so many losses in the Class A amps

895
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:25,012
that we prefer the Class AB amplifier.

896
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:28,841
Nevertheless, it remains
the great high quality amplifiers

897
00:39:29,193 --> 00:39:31,683
because your transistor
is all the time in its linear region.

898
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:34,029
It is all the time controlling
a current in a charge

899
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:35,141
without blocking

900
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,373
or saturating.

901
00:39:36,703 --> 00:39:38,605
And quite often

902
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:41,044
and this in an exercise you will see

903
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:43,090
when we make a class A amplifier

904
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:45,876
we add a gain level

905
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,292
we have a conducting level

906
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:48,938
for counter reaction.

907
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:51,892
I'll give an exercise later, to do

908
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:56,749
with the use of a voltage gain level

909
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:59,781
before attacking the current gain

910
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,169
or what is done with class A
or we mainly amplify the power.

911
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:05,994
And I would like to just remind

912
00:40:06,357 --> 00:40:08,191
that the Darlington is part of the landscape

913
00:40:08,345 --> 00:40:10,520
when it is a bipolar transistor

914
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:12,523
and that otherwise the MOS transistor

915
00:40:12,735 --> 00:40:14,759
as there is no current in the grid

916
00:40:15,043 --> 00:40:16,398
is an excellent candidate

917
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:19,141
because it does not charge
the driver level that is before.

918
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:22,187
And often we need an input level

919
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:24,711
to perform the counter reaction

920
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:27,001
and this is done with differential amplifiers.

921
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:30,888
The exercise will be the best way
to understand what's going on

922
00:40:31,074 --> 00:40:33,296
with a market amplifier

923
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,078
of class A type.
