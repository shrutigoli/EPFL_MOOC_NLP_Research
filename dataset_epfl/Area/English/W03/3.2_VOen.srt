00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,320
Hello and welcome to this lesson
which will today be dedicated to a quick presentation

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,870
on governance of protected areas.

3
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,900
Governance is of course a decisive factor
in explaining the successes but also the failures

4
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,099
of protected areas.

5
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:35,980
To find out more, it might be helpful to refer
to the guidelines published by the World Commission

6
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,880
on Protected Areas.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:48,620
In particular for this lesson,
look at the first chapter of the document

8
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,100
which explains the relationship between the
definition

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,180
of categories of protected areas, that we
have already seen,

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,230
and governance,
and which rapidly also identifies some important

11
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,600
concepts
to be familiar with this subject.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,640
Other interesting documents to consult
the 84th edition of the NAPA letters,

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,640
which summarizes a study by PAPACO conducted
in French-speaking Africa

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,390
on the conditions of governance of protected
areas.

15
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,140
This study and this letter are available in
full

16
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,380
as usual at papaco.org.

17
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,840
As announced, Paul NDiaye will be helping
me

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,580
throughout this module.

19
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,720
So, the notion of governance is a difficult
concept to define

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,700
and focuses more on who manages the protected
area

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,410
than what managers actually do.

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:51,310
We often talk about the quality of governance:
what we call good governance.

23
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,600
As we have already mentioned,
the types of governance were established

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:03,580
historically, based on dirigiste settings,
but over time, we have moved from a philosophy

25
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,110
of preservation,
based on the exclusion of residents,

26
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:14,030
to a philosophy more oriented towards the
sustainable use of resources

27
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:20,000
linking the population to conservation,
or sometimes, the private sector.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,639
We have therefore expanded the list of actors
involved in the management of protected areas.

29
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:33,000
Of course that is not always possible everywhere,
it is important to remember,

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,639
but it is nevertheless the current trend.

31
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:43,160
Let's listen to an account on this subject
from Senegal.

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,130
Governance is already a vague concept,
when applied on a local scale,

33
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,850
such as a protected area.

34
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,880
It defines the way
the exercise of power is structured.

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,630
Furthermore, there are mechanisms and frameworks
which define the arrangements for the participation

36
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,570
of different actors.

37
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:11,870
In Senegal, we can say that this governance
has been dynamic.

38
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,310
And all over Africa, we can see cases
of delegation, simply through

39
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:25,500
the creation and implementation
of tools for management.

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,220
So we talk of participatory governance
with more and more actor participation or

41
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,400
with the
involvement of other actors, who can be private

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,290
actors or others.

43
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,320
In any case,aspects of decentralization
are strong elements in the dynamic

44
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:54,530
of protected areas governance in Senegal and
in other places in Africa.

45
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,280
Governance intends to be effective and efficient
and when we talk of governance, we think of

46
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,310
an ideal,
which means that there are many elements

47
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:09,640
which must figure in this model.

48
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,699
A good state presence, the absence of corruption...
sustainable management of resources,

49
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:20,911
but also sound planning documents,
which express the effectiveness of the governance

50
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:25,410
of protected areas.

51
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,100
That said, what does this governance relate
to

52
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,200
in the context stricto sensu of protected
areas

53
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,470
and what applications can be drawn from it?

54
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,160
The governance of protected areas
leads us to questions of power, relations

55
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,870
and responsibilities.

56
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,000
From a practical point of view, we are able
to understand this

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,320
by asking this question:
Who has the authority and the responsibility

58
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:58,230
for managing,
and must report what has been achieved?

59
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:03,410
It has little to do with managing,
which is “what to do to achieve the goals

60
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,870
of the protected area”.

61
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,610
But it tells us about the decision-makers
and those ultimately responsible

62
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,470
and what has been done or not been done for
the protected area.

63
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,840
Governance also can also answers the following
important questions:

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,340
How are decisions for the protected area made?

65
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,630
What norms are applied?

66
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:35,400
Which approaches, values and principles serve
as a guide for the decision makers?

67
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,460
The answers to these questions and others
inform us

68
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,490
about the quality of governance.

69
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,890
It helps us understand if we are dealing with
good governance or not.

70
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,660
IUCN defines four broad types of governance
of protected areas,

71
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,760
which will allow us to define the framework.

72
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,480
Let's look at these types with Paul.

73
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:06,130
We do indeed have four types of governance,
all of them are legitimate and important for

74
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,510
conservation.

75
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,460
Protected areas, under the authority of the
government

76
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,150
whether at regional, national level, or at
supranational level,

77
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,770
are an example of governance by the government.

78
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,670
Protected areas under the authority of several
interested parties,

79
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,900
is what we call shared governance.

80
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,889
Protected areas under the authority of the
private sector,

81
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:45,150
that is, in general, landowners
or owners of the natural resources concerned,

82
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,300
we call that private governance.

83
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,560
And finally, protected areas under the authority
of indigenous people

84
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,170
or local communities, whether settled and/or
mobile,

85
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:06,040
with common law and/or legal rights,
this is called governance by indigenous peoples

86
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,780
and local communities.

87
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,600
We will look at each of these types of governance
one by one

88
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,860
in the following sequences.

89
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,140
A general description, an overview is also
given in chapter 4

90
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,760
of the guidelines.

91
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,220
You can see how these different types of governance
are organized

92
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,990
into a sort of continuum.

93
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,310
It ranges from a governance, essentially in
the hands of the state,

94
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,540
here on the left,
which as we have said,

95
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,510
concerns the majority of national parks in
Africa, for example

96
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,300
to a governance of protected areas
in which the state is no longer involved,

97
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,350
at least in theory.

98
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,900
We can find this here, on the right.

99
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,780
These are in general private protected areas
or community protected areas, where the rights

100
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,760
have been transferred to the local actors.

101
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,270
At this stage, we can examine what we gain
from this classification.

102
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,930
We observed in unit one
that the protected areas are arranged into

103
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,460
six categories,
one, two, three, four, five, six,

104
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,340
that we already know and which are now here
on the left.

105
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:17,060
We can see that they are also broken down
into four types of governance.

106
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,490
All that can therefore be easily summarized
in a comprehensive table,

107
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,060
that you can see here, containing 24 boxes,
a sort of matrix,

108
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,490
which describes all the types of protected
areas, that you can find.

109
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,820
So for example a park of category II, a type
of national park,

110
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,440
managed by the state will be found in this
box,

111
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,349
whilst a sacred site, whose access is forbidden
by the community

112
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:44,050
to preserve the environment in its natural
state,

113
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,900
of category I, will be here.

114
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,600
Another site, managed by indigenous people
for example,

115
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,980
where there is sustainable fishing,
so a category VI, will be here.

116
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,690
This matrix helps us to categorize protected
areas

117
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,080
that we come across
and eventually to form useful groups,

118
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,080
for example, to organize meetings and training
for managers, who share the same preoccupations

119
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,230
in terms of management and governance.

120
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,940
Unfortunately, protected area governance is
rarely listed

121
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,210
in the world protected areas databases.

122
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:31,860
Present estimations relate therefore
to less than 30% of protected areas in Africa.

123
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,900
The results give us at least 80% are state
protected areas,

124
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,630
in blue on this map, we can see them all over.

125
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,740
The rest, a small percentage of PAs, of shared
governance

126
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,330
or community governance, or private governance.

127
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,620
And we can see here, this varies depending
on the region.

128
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,580
In general, state protected areas are the
largest, as we have said,

129
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,140
and the private ones are mostly found in English-speaking
Africa.

130
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,600
This map here summarizes all that,
but keep in mind that the vast majority of

131
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,200
protected areas in Africa
has no type of governance assigned to it here.

132
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,540
If we do not yet know
all the types of governance at a continental

133
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,630
scale,
we know, on the other hand, that governance

134
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,120
evolves.

135
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,320
It is in fact obvious that no type of governance
is unchanging.

136
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,350
Changes in status happen over time,
which force changes to occur

137
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:39,430
that result from a concern to improve governance
to create efficient conservation conditions

138
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,120
Governance can be learned,
can be experimented with and can be tested

139
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,600
and certainly other models still need to be
invented

140
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,990
to address the challenges of today and the
future of our protected areas.

141
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,500
Going into detail on the different types of
governance,

142
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,630
in our next sequences,
we will be able to better reflect on that.

143
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,000
You must understand that governance and above
all its quality,

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,180
is a determining element of the ability, or
lack thereof,

145
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,899
of a protected area to play its role.

146
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,420
If governance is lacking
even if the best management strategies are

147
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,480
put in place,
results will be mediocre, or even nonexistent.

148
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,050
Management is the easiest to master
as we now have most of the technical solutions

149
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,330
for the parks.

150
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:33,779
There are 1000 examples of protected areas
that could do infinitely better

151
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,839
than they are doing, if only they changed
their governance

152
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,810
and of course those who manage it,
This brings us back to the notion of responsibility

153
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,850
that we have raised whilst studying categories.

154
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,080
Think carefully about this and ask yourselves
for the sites that you are familiar with,

155
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:58,770
in what way could a simple change of manager
change their results radically.

156
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,440
We are at the end of this lesson.

157
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,740
The next episode will be about protected areas
governed by government

158
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,430
Have a good day.
