00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,300
Welcome to today's lesson
where we will be introducing private protected 

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,950
areas,
which are pretty rare in Africa, especially

3
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,130
in French-speaking Africa,
as we have already said.

4
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,720
As usual in this module, I suggest that you
refer

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,540
to the World Commission on Protected Areas
guidelines,

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,500
to find out more.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,510
You could also look
at the 85th and 86th editions of the NAPA

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,110
letters,
which summarize a study undertaken by PAPACO

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,010
on the topic,
and that you can download once again from

10
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,800
the website papaco.org.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,490
Let's now turn to Paul who will explain it
all to us.

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:02,120
The appearance of private protected areas
demonstrates an important change

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,300
in strategies for organizing conservation.

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,340
Through them, the number of protected areas
have generally diversified and cautiously

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,330
increased.

16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,930
This type of protected area
is much more widespread in English-speaking

17
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,160
countries,
than it is in French-speaking countries.

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,480
For IUCN, private governance includes all
governance

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,220
that is not undertaken by governments,
not by indigenous people, and not by community

20
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,270
groups,
Private governance is also governance

21
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,930
that isn't shared between these different
actors.

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,570
Governance of private protected areas can
therefore include

23
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:52,180
property and management by individuals
or groups of individuals,

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,630
by NGOs,
by companies, by existing commercial companies,

25
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,570
or by companies created by groups of private
owners

26
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,560
in order to manage the private protected areas
together.

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,340
It could also be done by owners of protected
areas who manage them to make profit,

28
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,060
for example ecotourism companies.

29
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,530
It could be done by research entities, such
as universities,

30
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,920
or a fieldwork department etc.

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,630
And finally, it could be done by religious
entities;

32
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,480
it is rare, but it happens.

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,700
We have said it before, the history of conservation
in Africa

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,670
has been one of progressive expansion
towards new actors, and so to more than just

35
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,670
the state.

36
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,330
Even though they were never really absent
from protected areas,

37
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,170
for example, they managed hotel establishments
in the parks,

38
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,370
these private actors were not really in a
governance position

39
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,510
up until recently.

40
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,100
The decay of these infrastructures in the
private areas of the state,

41
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,540
the drop in the number of visitors,
the unavailability of public financial resources

42
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,360
for the renewal of equipment, the pressure
from sponsors, etc.

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,620
have caused public officials
to call on the private sector more and more.

44
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,590
This has had mitigated results for some of
the African countries,

45
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,540
and there is a high dependence on the quality
of the governance set up.

46
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,620
These private sector companies are often considered
to be more able

47
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,190
to respond to urgent situations quickly due
to their ability to mobilize funds.

48
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:43,790
In reality, when possible, the acquisition
of a territory

49
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,950
dedicated to conservation, by a private actor,
normally leads to private governance being

50
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,170
implemented.

51
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,760
However, the situation is not as simple on
the ground.

52
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,709
The responsibility that results from having
a private status

53
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:07,069
is rarely maintained solely by the owners
of the state-controlled protected areas.

54
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,060
Property and fauna have differing statuses
in many French-speaking countries,

55
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,160
which is why it is hard to identify the type
of governance.

56
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,050
This means a strictly private governance is
hard to recognize.

57
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:31,289
Reality strangely imposes a shared governance
formula

58
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:34,200
with the state or with local communities

59
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,360
and it could just be to secure
the investments made.

60
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,389
We particularly find examples of private governance
in the strict sense

61
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,630
in English-speaking Africa, like in Kenya
for example.

62
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:56,080
Indeed, in Kenya, many conservancies.
have private owners

63
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,480
which can bring many problems

64
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,600
especially in terms of handing over,
over time

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
Let's have a look at the example of Lewa,
which is a conservancy,

66
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
nestled at the bottom of Mount Kenya.

67
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,760
An essential quality that
private actors possess

68
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,900
involves their expertise

69
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,120
and their ability

70
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,420
to mobilize significant financial means quickly.

71
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,400
In fact, these means probably prompted them

72
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,080
to be interested in protected areas being set up.

73
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,740
because profitability is sometimes important.

74
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,060
Investing in protected areas

75
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,760
equates
with an additional motivation.

76
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,800
The political and financial context

77
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,560
in the end of the 20th century

78
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,860
goes hand in hand with a trend
for the private sector

79
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,680
to be increasingly interested in African protected areas.

80
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,000
The private sector's interest
in conservation

81
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,440
provokes legitimate questions about the conditions,
the amount of and the type of participation.

82
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,160
Is it a strategy
to involve the private sector

83
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,520
or should we start talking
about the privatization
of protected areas?

84
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,480
The state could consider
surrendering public land
to private entities,

85
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,320
especially in the form of long leases.

86
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,000
The emblematic cases
most often involve classified land.

87
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,280
Examples of these can be noticed
nearly everywhere in Africa,

88
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,760
like in Senegal for example,

89
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,720
in the classified forests Bandia or Fathala.

90
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,000
Be careful though as these territories
are managed more like zoos

91
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,520
where animals with diverse origins
are brought together

92
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,880
and it is therefore ex situ conservation.

93
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,560
And so, they are not really
protected areas.

94
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,440
Some conceded hunting zones
in classified forests

95
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,440
that are managed sustainably
by private entities

96
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,480
and that match the description
of a protected area,

97
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,280
would be classified in that category.

98
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,920
This type of plot,
when it is managed optimally,

99
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,480
can however have a serious negative impact on the local population, for example.

100
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,920
Ouaba lives in Naboandaga,
a waterfront village

101
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,760
in the east of Burkina Faso,

102
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,440
in the Singou Wildlife Reserve

103
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,280
that covers an area
of nearly 500,000 acres.

104
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,840
Since it was created in 1955,

105
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,440
access to the park
is subject to restrictive rules

106
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,920
for the local population.

107
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,480
With time, new boundaries
have been put in place

108
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,320
which further reduce the residents' access
to the resources.

109
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,960
Here, we are at the boundary of the park.

110
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,600
Our fields were on the other side before.

111
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,220
The néré and shea trees, amongst others,
are also in there.

112
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,560
Our fields were in there, so it was like we
had lost our fields.

113
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,950
My husband, who has livestock, can no longer
bring his animals here either.

114
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,519
If animals enter the park, they are seized.

115
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,899
He doesn't have anywhere for them to graze
anymore

116
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,210
and we have far fewer livestock too.

117
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,370
These are also cases
where the state's strategy of involving private

118
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,480
entities
involves asking them to take over a private

119
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,490
area from the state.

120
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,350
For example, that is the case with Fazao park
in Togo,

121
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,800
which is entrusted to a private Swiss foundation.

122
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,200
It also happened in Central Africa, where
certain parks in DRC,

123
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,630
like Garamba or Virunga,
which are also entrusted to be managed by

124
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,700
certain NGOs.

125
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,620
The results are proportionate
with the level of investments from these partners

126
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,410
and these investments usually vary from one
site to another.

127
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,769
At the other extreme, it can be regarded as
an abandonment or a total transfer

128
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:53,240
of land rights by the state and the communities,
which results in the complete privatization

129
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,230
of the land.

130
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,480
And yet, land issues turn out to be a particularly
sensitive topic,

131
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,300
especially in the event they are occupied
in the very long term,

132
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,390
which is inkeeping with the spirit of conservation.

133
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:18,100
Furthermore, in the spirit of legislation,
in Senegal or Kenya for example, fauna still

134
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,850
belongs to the state.

135
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,519
Like we have already said,
examples of this type of governance are quite

136
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,269
rare in French-speaking Africa,
due to the current law.

137
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,060
In any case, when they are governed by private
entities,

138
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,089
the territorial extension of protected areas
is generally quite limited

139
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,459
and they are not always governed very well.

140
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:46,260
You should know that private governance is
developing unequally in Africa.

141
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,870
It is possible to find good examples of NGOs,
companies and individuals,

142
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,910
who are genuinely investing in conservation,
just as it is possible to find bad examples

143
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,070
of it
with individuals with no principles, who loot

144
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,630
public resources
under the guise of conservation.

145
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,570
Of course, it all depends on the quality of
the governance system

146
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,590
and on the other actors' abilities -- especially
the state's--

147
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:16,010
to ensure that the private actors are not
free to make all the decisions.

148
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,839
Some of the decisions could be at the expense
of conservation.

149
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,620
We need to remember not to criticize the model,
because some individuals misrepresent it,

150
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,040
but let's try to promote good practice.

151
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,889
Consider the protected areas governed privately
that you know of

152
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:35,010
and think about the promotor's motivation
and how that finally influences the results

153
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:47,080
for conservation.

154
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,480
There we go, that's the end of this lesson.

155
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,589
The next episode will be on protected areas
governed by communities.

156
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:54,360
Have an excellent day.
