00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,850
Welcome to today's lesson
on analyzing the governance by government

2
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,779
of protected areas.

3
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:28,950
Its role in the conservation of nature in
Africa turns out

4
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,080
to be crucial.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,860
Of course, you can refer
to the WCPA guidelines on governance

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,260
to find out more, and especially chapter three.

7
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,680
I also recommend the 87th edition of the NAPA
letters,

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,739
here,
which summarizes a study we have recently

9
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:56,489
done
on the governance model in Africa.

10
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,989
You can download both of them on our website
papaco.org.

11
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:05,930
We will have a look at the history, the special
features and some weaknesses

12
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:12,220
of governance by government, with our friend
Paul Ndiaye.

13
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,390
Nearly everywhere in French-speaking Africa,
as well as in other places,

14
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,460
the first protected areas created in the beginning
of the twentieth century

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:27,210
are a result of public initiatives
in places such as Senegal, Ivory Coast, French

16
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,250
Sudan,
Guinea-Conakry, Upper Volta, Dahomey, Niger,

17
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,250
etc.

18
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,360
They enabled the first state protected areas
to be created.

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,290
Up until now, these state protected areas
have

20
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,979
the most widespread form of governance in
Africa,

21
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,259
as we have already said.

22
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,580
Although this is progressively evolving.

23
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,740
Colonial administration took some initial
decisions,

24
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,869
which were not reconsidered
by the independent African States,

25
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,560
which replaced them mainly from the 1960s.

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,190
History does in fact allow for the state initiative
to have a large role in terms of creating

27
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,720
protected areas.

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,700
On top of this, it seems important to formulate
two statements.

29
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:30,220
First of all, the new state protected areas
that were created after countries became independent

30
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,609
are limited in number,
except for a few countries, like Guinea-Bissau

31
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:36,609
especially.

32
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:41,970
But, even in this case,
the size of the areas is much more modest

33
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,790
everywhere
than those of the previous generation.

34
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:53,489
Then, there's the conditions the state protected
areas were set up in

35
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:58,380
that are constantly affecting them through
an authoritarian approach.

36
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,770
This generates a lot of frustration,
which is at the origin of the continuous conflicts,

37
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,810
something which we will talk about later.

38
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,100
State governance exercises a prominent influence
in the national protected area networks, which

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,880
are organized everywhere in Africa,
particularly, but not only, in French-speaking

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Africa.

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,630
Therefore, for example, the large parks in
West Africa,

42
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,449
like Niokolo-Koba in Senegal, or Comoé in
Ivory Coast, etc.

43
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:29,120
Mole National Park in Ghana, W-Arli-Pendjari
that we have already seen,

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,410
well, all of these parks are governed by the
state.

45
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,620
Historically, governance of state protected
areas,

46
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,170
whenever the different entities may have been
established,

47
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,820
does not suffer from any ambiguity in any
of the countries.

48
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,060
It is exclusively protected by the public
authority,

49
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,731
directly or by delegated services,
such as the Water and Forestry Service, or

50
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:01,010
the National Park service.

51
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,669
Sometimes relatively autonomous entities have
been created

52
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:08,380
as an attempt to give them more flexibility.

53
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:14,220
That is the case with bureaus, agencies autonomous
public institutions, etc.

54
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,450
But this type of governance always seem authoritarian
and rigid.

55
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,070
These were the essential ingredients to produce
the success

56
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,729
that it received initially, at least.

57
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:32,590
All of the French-speaking states have applied
this model,

58
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,000
sometimes without changing it, up until recently.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,540
Most of the English-speaking countries have
done the same.

60
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,200
This approach, which involves imposing decisions,
presupposes

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,840
that two conditions be met:
have the means and the technical ability as

62
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,260
well.

63
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:57,840
Means include first of all legality and legitimacy,
essential for recognition by all relevant

64
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,790
actors,
in one way or another, by the protected area.

65
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:09,070
The state has the legal rights to decide to
create a protected area

66
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,540
and to manage it alone.

67
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,160
However, having the legal right to do it
is not necessarily acknowledged by the local

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,660
population,
especially if they were evicted

69
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,980
when the protected areas were created.

70
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,540
The technical ability refers to managing human
and financial resources,

71
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,650
which are also necessary for establishing
their authority.

72
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,540
Strangely, this ability has frequently caused
problems for the states.

73
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,530
They have found themselves in other emergency
situations,

74
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,310
where they have been unable to mobilize personnel
and provide sufficient budgetary allocations

75
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,710
to cope with the needs for managing them.

76
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,150
Governance by the state is weakened
and state protected areas are threatened in

77
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,650
every way:
by trespassing, by poaching,

78
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,400
by livestock straying.

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,250
This last point partly explains the reality
of the situation

80
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,980
that has brought the African states to loosen
up on exclusive governance,

81
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,780
which they had been strict about up until
then.

82
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,360
The conditions surrounding the creation of
the first protected area networks

83
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,450
greatly justify the primacy of state protected
areas,

84
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,580
which still exists.

85
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,810
However, their inefficiency in some situations
has ended up negatively affecting this type

86
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,020
of governance in many places.

87
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,300
That's why they have been extended to other
actors,

88
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,210
private or community actors,
as we will see in the next videos.

89
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,400
There are large differences between countries
or regions.

90
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,120
There we go, that's the end of the lesson.

91
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,280
The next episode will examine
another type of governance of protected areas:

92
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,960
private protected areas.

93
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Have an excellent day.
