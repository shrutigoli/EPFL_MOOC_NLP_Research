1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,560
Welcome to this class. 

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,430
Today we will talk about shared governance
of protected areas,

3
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,130
which concerns a type of governance in which
many actors share

4
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,380
the responsability of the land.

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,570
For further information, once again, please
refer

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,260
to the World Commission on Protected Areas
guidelines.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,160
In particular, chapter 3 shows different possible
patterns

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:43,110
of shared governance, and provides interesting
case studies.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,660
Also please refer to the 88th edition of the
NAPA letters,

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,250
which summarizes a study
that we have conducted in Africa on the matter

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:58,000
very recently,
and that you can download, as usual on papaco.org.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,710
It is important to stress that shared governance
cannot be decreed:

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,540
no convention or rule enforces it,
however some situations can obviously favour

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,610
it.

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,860
Shared governance relies on a few principles,
for example, a necessary equity

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,100
between the parties involved in decision-making.

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,670
Paul will explain that to us.

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,330
The equity principle is essential for shared
governance to develop,

19
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:33,840
but it remains difficult to respect,
because governance in itself is based on relationships

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,970
between actors that do not perform the same
functions

21
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,909
although their functions may be complementary.

22
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:47,600
The existence of relationships suggests mutual
trust,

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,880
which needs to be built and maintained over
the long term

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,420
between the actors who end up being forced
partners.

25
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,100
A big part of the problem in the setting up
of shared governance actually lies at that

26
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,840
level.

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,520
We will discuss equity in detail, especially
its different types,

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,140
in module seven.

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,980
We have observed in the previous sequences,
which were about different types of governance,

30
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,720
that the different parties involved played
different roles.

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,760
Three roles are crucial here.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,340
First, there's authority, which is generally
enforced by the State.

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,800
The State ensures that commitments are kept.

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,310
Decentralization policies in Africa have strongly
reduced this role

35
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,640
to the benefit of other kinds of stakeholders,
as we have observed with community governance,

36
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,299
in the previous sequence.

37
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:50,380
Their second role involves mediation,
which is no individual stakeholder's prerogative.

38
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,990
Yet, communities that claim
they have unextinguished rights on some lands

39
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,550
devoted to conservation
play a crucial part in the process that leads

40
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,130
to establishing
a lasting agreement.

41
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,320
The last role is that of participation;
private stakeholders participating in the

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,060
governance of protected areas.

43
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,019
The financial resources, the private sector's
technical skills

44
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,920
give them the ability to intervene.

45
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,550
This must however be regulated by a legitimate
authority,

46
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,109
and benefit from intercommunity mediation.

47
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:35,889
To put it simply, very simply, there are two
major types

48
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:40,280
within this shared governance,
that represent a bigger or lesser involvement

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,799
in the collaboration between the different
parties,

50
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,420
once again, a continuum.

51
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,400
Generally, there are two scenarios.

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,040
In the first situation, where collaborative
management is used,

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:04,810
the State and the communities are bound
through a brief

54
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,520
or a management contract.

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,840
The communities, in this case, are responsible
for planning activities and for implementing

56
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
them.

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,690
However, annually,
they are to produce a report

58
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,680
that they must share with all the other actors.

59
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:34,289
Besides, still in the same scenario,
it is the communities that decide how to manage

60
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:40,980
the resources
extracted from the protected area,

61
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,520
which means that they are also expected to
inform the other partners

62
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,889
of how the resources, originating from the
protected area,

63
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,479
are being managed.

64
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,229
In the second situation, we talk about joint
management.

65
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:03,050
Here, the state and communities are not bound
by a contract or a brief.

66
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:11,060
But there is a statutory authority that is
accepted and acknowledged by all,

67
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,610
through which the stakeholders will be able
to plan

68
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,150
and implement activities.

69
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:27,340
And they will also specify, through this meeting,
each actor's role in implementing activities.

70
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,270
It is also during this statutory meeting
that the stakeholders will decide

71
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,090
how to share the profits from the protected
area.

72
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,020
Shared governance thus comes out as an exercise
based on equilibrium,

73
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,169
and in most protected areas where they have
attempted

74
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:48,650
to implement shared governance
difficulties have come up,

75
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,590
which took time to solve.

76
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,449
The transfer of responsibility thus remains
a thorny subject.

77
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:00,699
Let's listen to Arsène, who will share
a good example from Burkina Faso.

78
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:04,449
To illustrate the aforementioned concept of
shared governance,

79
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:10,550
we can use the example
of the Mare aux Hippopotames Biosphere Reserve,

80
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,310
located at about 60km
from Bobo, in Burkina Faso.

81
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,689
It is a special Ramsar site
because of the diversity of its flora and

82
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:24,539
its fauna
but also because because of the fact that

83
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,999
many of its species are endangered.

84
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:31,840
Fishing seems to be the only activity currently
authorized

85
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,410
within that reserve, and it is an important
activity,

86
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:41,530
in terms of food security and income that
benefits the communities.

87
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,199
Regarding the actors that are involved in
this initiative,

88
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,810
two are identifiable.

89
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:54,009
First, the State, through OFINAP,
which is the National Office of Protected

90
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:57,689
Areas;
it's the national body in charge of the implementation

91
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:03,210
of territorial policies
regarding protected areas.

92
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,889
But on the other hand, we also have the AGEREF,
which is the Intervillage Association

93
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,699
for the Management of Natural Resources and
Fauna.

94
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,779
It is comprised of communities from ten villages
bordering the reserve.

95
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:23,460
The relationship between these two stakeholders
is much more like a joined management system.

96
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:30,999
Indeed, the State, through OFINAP, sends representatives
to the association's general assemblies,

97
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:37,690
during which the future directions,
in terms of protected areas management are

98
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,690
defined.

99
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,460
Now, to take on the matter of the benefits
for the communities

100
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,700
from their involvement with managing and governing
this protected area,

101
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,069
there are two things that stand out.

102
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:54,669
The benefits can appear at an institutional
level.

103
00:07:54,669 --> 00:08:00,750
Thus, currently, AGEREF is involved with the
protected area's

104
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,400
management and governance dynamics.

105
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,499
It is therefore a good example of shared governance.

106
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:15,270
Even more than that, we hope, given the current
dynamics,

107
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,969
if there was a concession, that AGEREF could
be the first stakeholder

108
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:26,639
to step up to insure the good management
of this natural resource.

109
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,289
Benefits are also identified by and listed
under

110
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:33,180
their socio-economical aspect.

111
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,440
Indeed, we can already notice that many jobs
have been created

112
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,789
which is linked to the presence of this biosphere
reserve.

113
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,930
They include, among others, eco-guards who
protected the villages,

114
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,430
tourist guides and camp managers.

115
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,260
All of these are jobs are created
in the communities that live on the fringes

116
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,680
of that reserve.

117
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,730
Another point relative to socio-economical
development

118
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,269
is the generation of additional income in
favor of the communities.

119
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:13,880
Indeed, these earnings originate from the
ecotourism activity,

120
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:23,810
through, notably, an entrance fee to the reserve,
an increase in the value of non-timber forest

121
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,149
products,
an increase in the value of fishing products.

122
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:34,370
So all these activities revolving around ecotourism
enable income to be generated, which is redistributed

123
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,329
according to an allocation formula
between the various stakeholders involved

124
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,329
in the initiative.

125
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:45,580
We will now discuss the problems met by the
association.

126
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,329
They appear here on many levels too.

127
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:54,240
First, we can bring up the association's limited
power,

128
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,060
or ecoguards' struggle when faced with poachers.

129
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,329
Indeed, arresting poachers is the State's
forestry services' prerogative,

130
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:09,220
which, by nature, may reduce, sometimes,
the association's ability to be effective

131
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,339
in its efforts to fight against poaching.

132
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:19,190
Another challenge that exists
and that deserves a deeper thought process

133
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:27,889
in order to solve it,
is, oftentimes, the tense relationship between

134
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:33,709
the association's tech teams
and some members of the communities, who sometimes

135
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:41,160
express very important needs
in terms of exploiting natural resources,

136
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,250
which often do not allow for those resources
to last.

137
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,120
It is therefore necessary to keep thinking
about those matters of conservation

138
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,280
so that these initiatives take into account,
just as much,

139
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,139
the preservation of these resources,
while allowing the neighboring communities

140
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:04,709
to live from these resources next to their
territory.

141
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,839
Finally, we can bring up a point regarding
the fact

142
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:15,800
that, currently, the AGEREF has no official
document

143
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,050
that underpins its involvement
in the management and governance of this protected

144
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,050
area.

145
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,450
We hope that, with the concession, which,
when it is implemented,

146
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,660
will allow the creation of a document which
could be signed

147
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:34,720
by the many stakeholders,
a document in which each party's obligations

148
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,960
would be specified.

149
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,970
Such a document would enable, indeed, a better
management

150
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:46,870
of the association's intervention in the biosphere's
reserve.

151
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:54,470
Shared governance remains a constant objective,
because its conquest is also permanent,

152
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,600
any asset remains fragile
because of interests prone to evolving.

153
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,009
This is why the stakeholders must keep their
dialogue systems efficient,

154
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:09,350
they must function according to each party's
interest,

155
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,500
and with, always, in mind
the preservation of what we have gained from

156
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,940
conservation.

157
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,540
It is a real challenge, because it demands
habit-breaking,

158
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,860
for reticence, incomprehension and fears to
be overcome.

159
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:32,889
However, sharing governance is a vital way
to help protected areas to evolve

160
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:39,610
towards fairer, more sustainable mechanics,
that guarantee more solid results in the long

161
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,250
term.

162
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,680
Yet we know that it will be hard, especially
for certain State structures

163
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:56,100
to go beyond their own interest,
in order to be open to encouraging prospects,

164
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:02,430
but that are often off-putting for people
unprepared for this kind of work.

165
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,949
Another aspect to consider is the cost of
implementing

166
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,380
such a governance system.

167
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:18,910
It can sometimes be very expensive,
in terms of effort to gather a panel of stakeholders

168
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,899
to make decisions,
and, in the end, this will turn out to be

169
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:24,899
crippling.

170
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,300
Because even if shared governance can seem
desirable,

171
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,670
it is not always possible everywhere, or at
any given time.

172
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,279
There, I couldn't have said it better.

173
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,899
Thank you Paul for all these elements.

174
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,300
This is the end of the class, in the next
episode,

175
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,380
we will talk about the Nagoya Protocol and
we will find another Paul.

176
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,380
Have an excellent day.

177
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,380
