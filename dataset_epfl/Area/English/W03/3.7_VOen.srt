00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,590
Hello and welcome everyone!

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,710
Today's lesson is dedicated to the Nagoya
Protocol

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,380
on access to genetic resources
and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,230
arising from their utilization
in relation to the Convention on Biological

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,230
Diversity.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:32,550
We will go over: an introduction to the protocol,
the importance of genetic resources,

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,930
access to and sharing of benefits,
which are called ABS in English,

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,520
the benefits and the scope of the protocol,
the mechanics and the link between ABS and

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,520
protected areas.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,839
You can consult the website of the Convention
on Biological Diversity

11
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:51,500
for more detail on the subject.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,339
What is the Nagoya Protocol?

13
00:00:56,339 --> 00:01:00,299
It is an international treaty, which follows
on from and affirms

14
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,390
the Convention on Biological Diversity,
notably, one of its three objectives:

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,750
the fair and equitable sharing of benefits
arising out of the utilization of genetic

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,010
resources.

17
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,970
It is an historic agreement
on the international governance of biodiversity,

18
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,120
relevant to different commercial and non-commercial
sectors,

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,440
dealing with genetic resources.

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,030
It is based on the fundamental principles
of prior informed consent

21
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:35,110
and mutually agreed terms
conferred by the Convention on Biological

22
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,350
Diversity.

23
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,850
This came into force on 12 October 2014,
after the ratification of the protocol by

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,280
12 countries.

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,100
Why the Nagoya Protocol is important:
it provides a greater legal certainty

26
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,420
and more transparency for providers
and users of genetic resources.

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:07,250
It helps to ensure benefit-sharing,
particularly when genetic resources leave

28
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,369
the supplying country.

29
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:13,849
It establishes conditions for access to genetic
resources

30
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:16,879
that are more predictable.

31
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,870
What are genetic resources?

32
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,799
All living organisms: plants, animals, and
microbes

33
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:32,329
are carriers of genetic material which could
be useful to humans.

34
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:37,249
These resources can originate from wildlife
and domesticated animals,

35
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:39,280
and wild and cultivated plants.

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:47,920
You can find them in environments where they
flourish naturally,

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,359
that's an in-situ case,
in collections of human origin,

38
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:58,010
it's an ex-situ case,
for example: botanical gardens, gene banks,

39
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,819
or seed pools
or collections of microbial culture.

40
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,849
The importance of genetic resources.

41
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:09,290
Genetic resources are important
because they represent a crucial source of

42
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,010
information
to better understand the natural world.

43
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,220
They can be used
to develop products and services for human

44
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,790
use.

45
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,349
The access mode to genetic resources
and sharing of benefits, arising from their

46
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:31,090
usage
can create incentives for conservation

47
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:39,090
and sustainable utilization of biodiversity,
the creation of a fairer and more equitable

48
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,890
economy.

49
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:50,120
Access and benefit sharing:
it is done in a way that is possible

50
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,059
to give access to genetic resources.

51
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:59,020
It is also done in a way
that the benefits arising from the utilization

52
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,819
of genetic resources
can be shared between people and countries

53
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:09,449
using the resources,
called "users",

54
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,540
and between the people and countries, which
make them available,

55
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,340
called "providers".

56
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,760
The benefit of the Nagoya Protocol:
it encourages the furthering of research on

57
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:30,140
genetic research
which could lead to new discoveries.

58
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:37,700
It offers incentives to preserve and use
genetic resources in a sustainable way.

59
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,240
It increases the contribution of biodiversity
to human well-being and development.

60
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,910
The scope and central aspects of the Nagoya
Protocol:

61
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,190
it applies to genetic resources,
to traditional knowledge associated with genetic

62
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,320
resources,
and benefits arising from their utilization.

63
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:06,390
Its central aspects are:
access, benefit-sharing,

64
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,400
compliance, and traditional knowledge.

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:20,560
The mechanics:
the ABS is based on prior informed consent

66
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,490
given by a provider to a user.

67
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,830
Negotiations between the parties regarding
development,

68
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,840
and mutually agreed terms,
with the aim of ensuring fair and equitable

69
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,420
sharing
of genetic resources

70
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,140
and its associated benefits.

71
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,510
This makes reference to the way access to
genetic resources is obtained

72
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,120
and the way the users and providers come to
an agreement

73
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,640
on sharing benefits arising from their utilization.

74
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,480
Users wish to have access to genetic resources
for the purposes of:

75
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,620
firstly, scientific research, for example
taxonomy,

76
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,590
secondly, development of commercial products,
for example medication.

77
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,750
The providers of genetic resources allow access
in exchange for an equitable share

78
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,190
of the benefits arising from their utilization.

79
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:24,620
The link between protected areas and ABS:
protected areas and ABS have the common aim

80
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,590
of biodiversity conservation.

81
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,150
The Nagoya Protocol is legally binding,
therefore, it is a strong opportunity for

82
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,420
protected areas.

83
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:43,220
Protected areas can benefit from research
and bioprospection.

84
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,750
Protected areas are the hub,
which connects community, conservation,

85
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,090
and traditional use of biodiversity.

86
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:57,670
ABS can contribute to conservation and sustainable
use.

87
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:04,820
Protected areas and ABS are two frameworks
that address the common challenges of governance.

88
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,310
The benefits arising from the utilization
of genetic resources

89
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,570
can be monetary,
when research and development lead

90
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:19,610
to the commercialization of a product,
an example being the royalties or state payments,

91
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:27,650
non monetary, for example, technology transfer,
skill improvement in terms of research.

92
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:36,430
ABS can contribute to sustainable development
and the struggle against poverty.

93
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,680
An information kit in relation to access to
and sharing of benefits

94
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,990
has been developed to raise public awareness.

95
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:49,630
This kit is available on the website
of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

96
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,870
This is the end of this lesson.

97
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:58,200
The next episode will be an overview of the
governance of protected areas.

98
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,990
Meanwhile, have a good day!
