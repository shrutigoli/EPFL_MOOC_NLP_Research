Hello and welcome to this third module of
the MOOC

2
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:14,580
on protected areas management in Africa.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,500
This week, we will talk about protected areas
governance.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,050
It is an extremely important subject, as we
will see with Paul NDiaye,

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,490
who is a lecturer at the University of Cheikh
Anta Diop University in Dakar.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,880
So this week, the module will be structured
as follows:

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,679
the first class will be introducing the notion
of governance

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,030
and different types of governance
that we come across in protected areas.

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,000
As for the second lesson,
it will introduce governance by government,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,820
which applies to the majority of protected
areas in Africa these days.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,680
Less frequent, but just as important, is private
governance,

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,140
and this will be the topic of the third lesson.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,230
The fourth lesson will be about governance
by communities,

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,869
the one that enables local populations
to take control of managing a certain number

15
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:02,600
of protected areas
more and more frequently.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,130
The fifth lesson will deal with shared governance,
a type of governance

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,119
that brings together several types of actors
in the decision-making schemes.

18
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,929
They are sometimes complex,
but they are always rich and innovative.

19
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:17,350
It is also being developed a lot at the moment.

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,740
The last lesson will be on our weekly convention.

21
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,869
Once again, we will be staying in the field
of the Convention on Biological Diversity

22
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,729
with a specific focus, here as well, on local
communities.

23
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:32,690
We will be looking at how people access and
share the advantages,

24
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,189
and we will deal with the famous Nagoya Protocol.

25
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:43,600
Finally, we will have our brief weekly summary
in the form of an animation,

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,639
and then the assignment for this module will
be explained to you.

27
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:50,639
There we go, it is now time for this module
on governance.

28
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:54,029
Have an excellent third week with us!
