1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,550
Governance is the process of decision-making
relating to managing protected areas,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,500
and not the actions of management themselves.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,579
It concerns therefore who makes the decisions
and how they are taken.

4
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:18,970
This is a fundamental notion to understand
the strengths and weaknesses of protected

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,970
areas.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,350
we can roughly identify four types of governance.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,420
Governance by the government is the most frequent
in Africa,

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,420
and this is the case,
where decisions are made by the government,

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,870
whether at ministry level,
or by an independent public body or a decentralized

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,850
department.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,269
In general, the state owns the area
and it can choose to consult the other stakeholders

12
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:49,239
when managing these protected areas, but ultimately,
it is always the state

13
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,390
who makes the decisions and takes responsibility
for them.

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,109
Shared governance is when decision-making
involves several parties,

15
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,030
who all have responsibility for the final
decision.

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,720
This sharing of responsibilities can go as
far as complete delegation

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,310
of protected area management by the state
to a third party,

18
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,830
such as a private entity, an NGO or a community.

19
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,390
But, most often, the state is reticent to
delegate authority,

20
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,469
even when it does not succeed in exercising
that authority,

21
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,439
and it continues to be the dominant party
involved.

22
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,409
Private governance concerns the areas either
controlled by,

23
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,500
or whose property is maintained, by an individual,
an NGO or a company

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,899
whether it is for the purposes of profit or
not.

25
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:41,390
In this case, the authority to manage protected
areas and for their resources

26
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,000
goes back to the owner who determines management
goals,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,119
develops plans and retains control over decisions
as long as they respect relevant legislation.

28
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,049
This is still a fairly rare form of governance
in Africa,

29
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:59,570
but it is now becoming more common.

30
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,340
Finally, governance by communities concerns
protected areas

31
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,520
where local residents are responsible for
management,

32
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,420
by means of various institutions,
or by formal or informal customary rules.

33
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,680
In such a case, the area is under the control
of the local community,

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,849
who is responsible for reaching goals,
even if the protected area is not recognized

35
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,409
in a legal document.

36
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:33,680
By allowing the locals to be users
and custodians of their own resources,

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,290
we hope to generate more effective support
for conservation of protected areas.

38
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,510
No matter who is in charge of governing the
protected area,

39
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,580
whether he is alone or he shares his mission
with others,

40
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,620
governance is based on the notion of responsibility.

41
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,620
Too few of the decision-makers in protected
areas in Africa

42
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,269
are accountable for the decisions that they
make

43
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:01,340
and on the way that they make them,
and this greatly weakens

44
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,319
management results on the field.

45
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,340
Evolving towards better governance of the
conservation sector requires

46
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,910
more responsibility and transparency by the
relevant actors.

47
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,340
So let's now start the test
on this module.
