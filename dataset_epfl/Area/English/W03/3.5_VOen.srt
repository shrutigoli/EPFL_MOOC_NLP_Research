00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,700
Welcome to today's lesson
about governance by local communities. 

2
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,730
It's a type of governance that has enjoyed
a definite interest

3
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,200
throughout the whole of Africa for at least
the last 30 years.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,610
Of course, a good way to find out more would
be to have a look at

5
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,500
our now familiar guidelines on the governance
of protected areas,

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,370
edited by the World Commission.

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,340
In particular, take a look at the end of chapter
three,

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,710
which focuses specifically on different forms
of governance,

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,940
including community governance.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,019
To complement this reading, it could also
be useful

11
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:51,129
to consult the report of a study carried out
by PAPACO

12
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:58,900
on community protected areas in West Africa,
and the 25th edition of the NAPA letters,

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,080
which has a short introduction about them.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,360
Let's now see with Paul, the context for the
increase in the number

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,470
of community protected areas in Africa.

16
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:14,250
The difficulties met by states to extend protected
areas governed by the government

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,920
has offered many opportunities
for community protected areas to develop.

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,500
It's in fact a process that is supported
by a context of taking responsibility for

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,620
local issues;
a process that is strengthened itself by decentralization

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,110
policies
that involved some of environmental fields,

21
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,090
including the management of natural resources.

22
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,530
Community protected areas
represent a recent and interesting form of

23
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,640
governance
due to the hopes for positive responses

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,480
to the various shortages discovered
by the state protected areas that were already

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,820
in place.

26
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,240
The recent willingness of the African states
to concede their powers to local collectivities

27
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,979
has been the first stage
in the decentralization in terms of conservation.

28
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,940
These collectivities have sometimes benefited
from it

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,230
in order to create local protected areas,
just as the law gave them the possibility

30
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,230
to do.

31
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,310
The community protected areas,
which are the result of a process of decentralization,

32
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,720
are roughly the following:
the governance system is controlled by the

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,460
local communities;
the legal status is recognized,

34
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,720
and of course, it's within a well defined
space.

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,650
Also, the management objectives prioritize
conservation,

36
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:48,590
and the recognized usage rights are to the
advantage of the people.

37
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:54,620
Of course, the community protected areas can
be terrestrial.

38
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,880
That's the case, for example, of community
natural reserves

39
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,300
which were established in Senegal.

40
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,080
But these protected areas can also be aquatic.

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,040
That's the case with marine community protected
areas.

42
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,540
Or land and water can be combined:
That's the case of the famous marine protected

43
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,380
area of Bamboung,
in the Saloum Delta.

44
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,950
So, let's have a look at the special case
of this Bamboung reserve,

45
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,040
which causes quite a stir in Senegal.

46
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,620
Its manager will tell us a bit more about
it.

47
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,849
Yes, the community marine protected area of
Bamboung

48
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:37,430
is the first marine area created in Senegal
by the people.

49
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,340
These populations managed these lands for
a long time,

50
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,300
before there was a presidential decree.

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,700
And now, the arrival of the decree has enabled
populations

52
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,770
to have a collective conscience.

53
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,599
They also knew about the commitments that
the state of Senegal have made,

54
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,880
and that have empowered them in their way
of managing the area.

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,690
Now a collective conscience was born from
this,

56
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,400
and the behaviours
that really did not coincide at all

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,810
with managing the environment well
were forbidden by the people themselves.

58
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:23,350
And that is thanks to management rules
being applied and implemented,

59
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,400
rules which were pre-established by the people
themselves,

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,470
and which were adopted by state authority.

61
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,860
So that enabled the populations
to integrate the whole of the 14 outlying

62
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,840
villages
of the community marine protected area of

63
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,129
Bamboung.

64
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:46,189
This was through village meetings, where their
representatives were designated.

65
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:51,689
These representatives are currently in what
we call a management committee.

66
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,580
And this management committee is comprised
of all of the delegates

67
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,189
from the 14 outlying villages, and there is
an executive committee

68
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:01,939
with its functional commissions.

69
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:08,080
This has enabled them to take a big step forward
and progress towards conservation.

70
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,339
Regarding protected areas, local populations,
who were previously considered

71
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:18,870
to be predators or destroyers of what conservation
has already achieved,

72
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,160
have progressively changed their attitude
after being faced with a shortage

73
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,180
of easily accessible natural resources.

74
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:33,300
Due to the impulsiveness of motivated groups,
the initiative of creating community protected

75
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,800
areas came about.

76
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,559
This brought the advantage of producing a
significant increase

77
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:42,389
in land dedicated to conservation.

78
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,749
We are not lacking in examples to demonstrate
this change,

79
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:49,880
and as Paul has just told us,
it is a wonderful source for extra protected

80
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,409
areas, in spaces
that the state could not have or would not

81
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:56,770
have wanted to manage anyway.

82
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,479
Let's look at an example in the south of Benin.

83
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:06,279
We have noticed that, at the regional level,
and in the Mono Delta, there are no protected

84
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:21,999
areas.

85
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:25,069
Loss of habitat and poaching are the biggest
threats.

86
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:29,729
For their subsistence, local communities depend
on the nature that surrounds them.

87
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:46,870
Consequently, they are the key to successfully
preserving nature.

88
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,169
My name is Dhossou Alain,
I am the coordinator for the NGO Africa Mobile

89
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,169
Nature.

90
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:58,339
Here, we are in Gogohondji village,
located in the commune of Houéyogbé, in

91
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:59,649
the Doutou county.

92
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:04,189
It's a waterside village by the Toho lake,
where a community reserve is in the process

93
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,330
of being formed.

94
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,349
We are pleased to welcome you to our village.

95
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,499
We will show you around the reserve that is
being created.

96
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:13,990
It is a reserve rich in biodiversity.

97
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:21,539
There are many species, including the sitatunga,
crocodiles, boas, turtles, and other aquatic

98
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:28,439
animals...

99
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,080
We started, for example, raising awareness
after we noticed that poaching was placing

100
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,940
a burden on the animals.

101
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,569
We are starting to grow closer to the hunters
and we have started to identify them by where

102
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,330
they live.

103
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,009
And we have started to have discussions with
them,

104
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,069
and we have grown closer to the authorities,
to certain authorities

105
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,159
that are closer to the reserve
and that will be able to intervene in the

106
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:57,069
zone anyway.

107
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:05,520
Since we intervened here, we have really noticed
that, these days, the poaching rate has decreased.

108
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,740
There are still numerous constraints though:
the small size of each community protected

109
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,529
area
considered individually, insufficient coordination,

110
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:21,240
networks that need to be created,
technical abilities that need strengthening,

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:36,050
changes in objectives that need to be monitored,
a valuation that needs to be set up, etc.

112
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,120
This governance model is in the process of
being developed,

113
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,640
and it will probably continue to evolve.

114
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,690
The positive aspect is it enables certain
cultural practices,

115
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,690
which are positive for conservation, to be
valued,

116
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,610
as we will see in a later sequence of this
lesson,

117
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,340
which will mainly be about culture.

118
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:05,000
A good place to demonstrate this is the Bissagos
Islands in Guinea-Bissau.

119
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,850
Augusta Henriques from the NGO Tiniguena will
explain it to us.

120
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,100
The Urok community area possesses essential
characteristics

121
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,500
regarding community.

122
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,790
Cultural inclusion:
Management rules are inspired of traditional

123
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,460
management rules.

124
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,560
And within traditional management, women have
a role

125
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,480
in all the stages of exploiting strategic
resources,

126
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,880
for example, shells for food security.

127
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,590
We cannot be efficient when managing resources
if women are not included.

128
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:48,870
So it isn't so much a question of equal rights,
but more a question of efficiency.

129
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,840
It has to be said, thanks to the impulse from
collectivities or local communities

130
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:03,070
more and more community protected areas
are being set up

131
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,720
with different aspects depending on the country,
depending on the laws in place and depending

132
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,340
on the habits.

133
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:17,330
But we also need to specify that decentralization
does not explain everything.

134
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,660
With regards to this, the marine space very
rarely has concessions made for it

135
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,910
by the state.

136
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,620
That is particularly the case in Senegal.

137
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,770
It has however not stopped community initiatives
to spring up

138
00:10:30,770 --> 00:11:52,310
for conservation in the marine field
with the support of state technical services.

139
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,040
There's a nice story told to us from Senegal.

140
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,400
That's the end of the lesson.

141
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,590
The next episode will be
about shared governance of protected areas.

142
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,510
Have an excellent day.
