00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:14,519
Hello and welcome to everyone,
today's class is about Ramsar Convention

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,820
on wetlands.

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,910
We're going to review the presentation of
the Convention,

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,140
organs, missions, pillars
and international organizations that are partners

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,740
with the convention.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,410
For more informations, you can check the website
of the convention for more details.

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,460
Wetlands are a public good that we ought to
protect,

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,550
they contains 80 per cent of biodiversity.

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,339
They have a major role in the regeneration
of water resources

10
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:47,670
and the preservation of biodiversity.

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,399
The convention on wetlands
is the framework of international cooperation

12
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,350
and national action
for conservation and rational use of wetlands.

13
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,790
It's also called Ramsar Convention
from the name of the Iranian city where it

14
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,220
was adopted in 1971.

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,460
About 80 percent of UN member states
are contracting parties of the Ramsar Convention.

16
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,759
The convention adopted a large definition
of wetlands

17
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,310
including all lakes and rivers, underground
aquifers,

18
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:30,030
swamps and marshes, wet grasslands,
peatlands, oases, estuaries, deltas and tidal

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,329
flats,
mangroves and other coastal areas, costal

20
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:40,719
reefs,
and all human-made sites such as fish ponds,

21
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,110
rice paddies fields, reservoirs, salt pans.

22
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,189
Organs of the convention : the application
of Ramsar Convention

23
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:53,249
is the result of a permanent partnership between
contracting parties,

24
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:57,770
169 on the date of 10 June 2015.

25
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,609
The permanent committee is the secretariat
of the convention

26
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:04,399
that benefits from advice of a subsidiary
organ of experts,

27
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,479
a scientific and technical review panel
and the support of the program on communication,

28
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,660
capacity building, education,
participation and awarness.

29
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,800
Every three years, representatives of the
contracting parties

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,830
gather in a conference, as the supreme political
organ

31
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:27,210
of the convention, adopting resolutions in
order to administrate

32
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,740
the work of the Convention and to improve
the means

33
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,230
required by the parties in order to achieves
its goals.

34
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,770
The mission of the Convention is the conservation
and the rational use of wetlands by actions,

35
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,760
on a local,
regional and national scale, plus international

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,640
cooperation
in order to contribute to the realisation

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,680
of sustainable development in the entire world.

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,460
In accordance with the three pillars of the
Convention,

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:03,830
contracting parties commit to :
- Work for the rational use of every wetlands

40
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,260
in the framework of national plans, politics
and laws,

41
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,920
management measures, and education of the
public.

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,020
- To register appropriate wetlands on the
list

43
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,050
of wetlands of international importance,
called, again, Ramsar List and to take care

44
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,730
of their governance.

45
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,410
- To cooperate on the international level
for cross-border wetlands,

46
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:37,900
shared wetlands systems, shared spaces
and development projects that could effect

47
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,900
wetlands.

48
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,360
What do wetlands do, and what could happen
to them.

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,370
They stock water, and guarantee its quality,
contributing

50
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,100
to resilience against drought.

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,180
They protect against flooding and storm effects.

52
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:05,820
They provide food and other services
such as transport and leisure.

53
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,360
They offer different types of housing for
biodiversity

54
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,500
and play a key role in biological cycles
for numerous species, and in annual migration

55
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,930
structures.

56
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:26,530
Under the pressure of a growing demand from
a human population in expansion,

57
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,340
wetlands are deteriorated and disappear.

58
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,720
Excessive exploitation of the latest wetlands
threatens more and more

59
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,380
their ability to provide essential services.

60
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,940
To counter this, we must ensure rational use
of wetlands

61
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:52,000
and the water they contain, restore degraded
wetlands,

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,240
and if necessary, create new ones to regain
the services

63
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,660
that we need.

64
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:07,400
Listen to Ania Grobicki, general secretary
of Ramsar for the functioning of the convention.

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,900
The most important body of the Ramsar Convention
of wetlands

66
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,810
is the conference of the parties, the COP
which meets every three years

67
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,260
to decide on the key strategic directions
of the convention.

68
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,160
In between the COP, the standing committee
meets annually

69
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:31,260
to guide the convention, it is composed of
the regional representatives

70
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,010
of each region of the six regions of the convention.

71
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,210
There is a scientific and technical review
channel, the STARP

72
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,710
which is a group of scientific and technical
experts

73
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:48,300
who publish important guidelines on the conservation
and wise use of wetlands.

74
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,090
Finally, at a global level, the Ramsar Convention
secretariat

75
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,639
is based in Gland, Switzerland, and manages
the everyday activities

76
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,620
of the Convention,
which includes publishing the Convention documents

77
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,870
and administrating the Ramsar sites of international
importance.

78
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,490
On a national level, the administrative authority
in each country

79
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,150
implements the strategic directions of the
Convention in that country

80
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:24,410
and the national wetlands commitee
which are multi-stakeholder platforms include

81
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:31,200
the private sector,
NGO and civil society to support the government

82
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,139
in implementing the Convention.

83
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,600
Finally, under the sustainable development
goals

84
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,669
the Convention is in charge of with monitoring
the extent of wetlands

85
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,030
worlwide.

86
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,430
Thank you very much.

87
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,230
Ramsar Convention recognises six International
Organizations Partners

88
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:59,210
that provide specialized technical assistance
and advice, in accordance with the principles

89
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,640
of the Convention.

90
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,921
They are :
Birdlife International, the International

91
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:12,430
water Management Institute,
the International union for conservation of

92
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,230
nature,
Wetland international, WWF international and

93
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:22,810
WWT.

94
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:30,270
The Convention is in collaboration with a
network of partners.

95
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:37,290
Listen to Anada Tiega, former general secretary
of Ramsar Convention, about relations between

96
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,200
protected areas and wetlands.

97
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,500
Links between wetlands and protected areas
are close.

98
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:51,240
Actually, it's because wetlands bring water
to biodiversity

99
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,150
and every protected areas which goal is the
conservation

100
00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:00,880
of biodiversity include wetlands as an essential
part.

101
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:08,389
Because they are used as habitat, and also
as a place for reproduction, for breeding

102
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,020
little ones and bringing survival.

103
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,940
In fact, if we take a look, for instance,
at the world heritage

104
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,370
in those natural sites, every one of them
have wetlands

105
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,240
as a crucial part.

106
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,410
The MAB system for biosphere reserves
also include wetlands, in their central part.

107
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,830
Finally, Ramsar sites are exclusively wetlands.

108
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:38,019
Those Ramsar sites exist in order to protect
species,

109
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:44,579
every endemic migrant vulnerable species
in danger of extinction.

110
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:49,449
To conclude, wetlands are crucial for sustainable
development

111
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:54,430
because they provide the water we need.

112
00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:00,949
Wetlands are the cradle of biological diversity
and provide water and primary productivity,

113
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:05,279
that an incalculable
number of plant and animal species rely on

114
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,829
for their survival.

115
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:13,329
Ramsar Convention is one of the only one to
take in account

116
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:17,240
a special type of natural environment.

117
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,759
That's it, we're at the end of the lesson,
next episode will be

118
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:29,149
a conclusion of the course called topicality
and conservation.

119
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:31,610
Looking forward to it, I wish you a good day.
