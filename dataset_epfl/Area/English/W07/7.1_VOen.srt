Hello and welcome to this seventh and last
module of the MOOC

2
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:16,160
on managing protected areas in Africa.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,430
This module is about what we have called
the topical issues of protected areas,

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,480
namely the hot topics of today.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,380
These have been covered in previous modules,
in more or less detail.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,780
So this week, the module focuses on the following
subjects.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,500
The first lesson will be on climate change.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
What is it?

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,390
How does it impact protected areas?

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,660
How can they mitigate climate change?

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,480
In the second lesson we will look at the connectivity
of protected areas

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,739
and associated concepts, of buffer zones,
resilience, etc.

13
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,840
The restoration of protected areas,
which has unfortunately become essential in

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,610
numerous sites,
is the subject of the third lesson.

15
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,070
In the fourth lesson we will learn about equity,
particularly, gender equity

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,960
because, in protected areas, as well as in
other places,

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,970
equity must be a key notion in decisions
and the way they are made.

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,320
The fifth lesson will address
the difficult issue of corruption

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,890
and the trafficking it generates within protected
areas.

20
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,789
The sixth lesson is this week's convention,
the very last one

21
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:25,819
and we will talk this time about the Ramsar
Convention,

22
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,950
which deals with wetlands.

23
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:33,259
And finally, the traditional summary
of the important points, covered this week,

24
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:38,819
will be offered in the form of an animation,
followed by a conclusion of this MOOC

25
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,989
when we will attempt to review everything
we have looked at together.

26
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,580
So here we go,
have a great seventh week with us.
