1
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,660
We are now at the end of this MOOC
on the management and governance of protected

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,109
areas in Africa.

3
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:18,700
I hope you enjoyed following it
as much as we enjoyed developing it.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,251
And of course, I hope it helped you better
understand these territories,

5
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:26,980
their interests, their specificities,
their issues,

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,300
and that it will help you to protect them
better in the future.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,700
They deserve it, and they need our help.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,059
I would like to thank one more time
the three key people who coordinated this

9
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,090
MOOC with me :
Sylvie Goyet,

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,670
Paul NDiaye,
and Paul Ouedraogo,

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,269
you know them well by now.

12
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:49,710
And thank as well wholeheartedly the many
speakers

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,949
that participated over the weeks.

14
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:57,370
Particularly my colleagues from Papaco
of whom so many joined us.

15
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,940
Arsène Sanon,
Bora Masumbuko,

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,210
Youssouph Diedhiou,
et Lacina Koné.

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,860
I have a special thought for Beatrice Chataigner
and her partner Nestor of course,

18
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,399
for having greatly contributed to the preparation
of this MOOC.

19
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:18,610
Also, Marion Langrand
who managed the forum, and the discussions

20
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,420
with an expert hand.

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,270
And Marc Chataigner who created the illustrations
of our conclusions.

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,759
Without forgetting all the personnel of the
EPFL,

23
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,170
who enthusiastically helped us to prepare
these videos.

24
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:39,939
Especially Cibèle Avelino,
who, as you have seen, edited the videos perfectly.

25
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:44,060
All of the very dedicated team
at the Centre for Digital Education of the

26
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,060
EPFL.

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,359
And of course, all of our friends of the MOOC
programme for Africa,

28
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,159
without whom this training would not have
seen the light of day.

29
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,340
Of course, we count on you for your comments,
your opinions, your criticisms or encouragements

30
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,710
to know what you enjoyed,
what was useful, what can be improved.

31
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,119
We would also like to know which topic
you would like to see be developed in greater

32
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,119
detail.

33
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,790
And we will see if this can soon be a part
of a new MOOC to be created,

34
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,819
why not?

35
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,220
Feel free to contact us.

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,510
We hope to continue working together
through the website papaco.org,

37
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,690
on our social media platforms, on the field,
in your activities.

38
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,900
Don't forget to register for the NAPA letter,
if you wish to stay in touch month after month.

39
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,230
And if possible, to join the world commission
of protected areas,

40
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,620
with which you are now very familiar.

41
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:52,670
Finally, I just need to thank the organisations
and the people who have financed this MOOC,

42
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,430
Mr. André Hoffmann, thank you sir,
the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne

43
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,810
and the Franco-Swiss partnership,
especially the French agency for development.

44
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,700
A reminder that this MOOC is the fruit of
a technical collaboration

45
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,120
between the EPFL, IUCN, the university of
Cheikh Anta Diop

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,940
and the Ramsar convention represented by its
Secretariat

47
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,560
See you soon, I hope.

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,390
Have a great day.
