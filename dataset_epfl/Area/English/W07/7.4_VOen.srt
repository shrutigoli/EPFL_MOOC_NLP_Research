00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,740
Today's lesson is dedicated
to the ecological restoration of protected

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,740
areas.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,460
We will have a look at the definition of ecological
restoration,

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,680
the principles and guidelines
of ecological restoration of protected areas,

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,390
an example of ecological restoration,
and the process of ecological restoration

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,660
for protected areas
suggested by the World Commission on Protected

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,660
Areas.

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,370
To find out more, you could, in fact, refer
to the document

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:49,170
Ecological Restoration for Protected Areas:
Principles, Guidelines, and Best Practices.

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,170
A document prepared by the World Commission
on Protected Areas'

12
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,200
Ecological Restoration Taskforce on this topic.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,770
During its Conference of the Parties, the
twelfth session,

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,100
the Convention on Biological Diversity has
reaffirmed the necessity

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,190
of reinforcing the support and the cooperation
intended to promote ecosystem restoration

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,360
efforts
in developing countries.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,770
All with the purpose of implementing
the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020

18
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,250
and meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

19
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:31,070
This is why the Convention on Biological Diversity
has decided to expand and reinforce

20
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,890
monitoring of the deterioration and restoration
of ecosystems.

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,000
This is with the aim of supporting adaptive
management

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,060
and drawing up a report on the progress made
on the Aichi Biodiversity Targets,

23
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,700
and particularly on Targets 5, 14, and 15.

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,380
Definitions.

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,610
Ecological restoration is
the process of assisting the recovery of an

26
00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:01,740
ecosystem
that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed.

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,200
It is therefore an intentional activity
that initiates or accelerates the recovery

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,280
of a previous ecosystem,
that is old or recent regarding its specific

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,829
composition,
its community structure, its ecological functioning,

30
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:23,260
the ability of the physical environment to
support all of its living organisms,

31
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,209
and its connectivity with the landscape.

32
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:33,480
This assumes and requires good knowledge
of functional and adaptive ecology of targeted

33
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,609
ecosystems,
knowledge of the history of anthropogenic

34
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:42,870
deterioration,
and finally of choosing a reference ecosystem

35
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,029
to guide planning, implementation, follow-up,
and assessment

36
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:49,879
of the restoration project.

37
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,359
The reasons and the targets for ecological
restoration:

38
00:02:54,359 --> 00:03:00,090
restoration in, and around, a protected area
contributes to a number of societal aims and

39
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,829
objectives,
which are linked to biodiversity conservation

40
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,909
and human well-being.

41
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:15,529
The reasons for implementing restoration projects
varies and can include, for example,

42
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:21,700
the recovery of certain species,
the reinforcement of an ecosystem function,

43
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,529
or connectivity at the level of a terrestrial
or marine landscape,

44
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:30,390
the improvement of possibilities for tourist
experiences,

45
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,819
or even, the recovery or the improvement of
diverse ecosystem services.

46
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:41,209
Restoration can contribute to the ability
to adapt to climate changes

47
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,069
by reinforcing resilience when faced with
changes,

48
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,400
and by supplying ecosystem services.

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,010
It can contribute to the easing of climate
change

50
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,010
by capturing carbon dioxide in ecosystems.

51
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:04,959
Climate change and other rapid global changes
form new challenges for restoration

52
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:12,559
and they highlight the need for adaptive management,
as was highlighted in module four.

53
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:16,810
The World Commission on Protected Areas
identifies three fundamental principles

54
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,549
for the ecological restoration of protected
areas.

55
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:24,920
Ecological restoration of a protected area
must be:

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,040
effective.

57
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,560
This means, effective ecological restoration
is one that recovers and preserves the values

58
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,110
of a protected area.

59
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,110
Efficient.

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,920
Efficient ecological restoration
is one that maximizes positive results

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,080
by minimizing time, resource and effort costs.

62
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,510
Commitment.

63
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,960
Ecological restoration of protected areas
that induces commitment is one

64
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,540
where partners and interested parties collaborate
together,

65
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:58,550
that favors participation,
and that improves the visitors' experience.

66
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:05,150
Specific good practices which must be applied
to a given project

67
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,570
must be chosen during the planning and conception
stages of the project.

68
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:18,090
Let's take the examples of ecological restoration
introduced by Abdou Salam Kane

69
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,210
from the Direction of the National Parks of
Senegal.

70
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,200
In 2006, thanks to a partnership with the
Danone Livelihood Fund,

71
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,910
the project developed by Oceanium
with the purpose of restoring an extremely

72
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,250
degraded mangrove forest
came about at the same time as the launch

73
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,140
of the mangrove reforestation program
along the Senegal coastline.

74
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,610
Mangroves, which used to be abundant along
this coastline,

75
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:55,620
have gradually disappeared after human intervention,
from the rise in sea levels and from the drought.

76
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,150
The local population has seen its subsistence
sources,

77
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,210
especially food sources, disappear.

78
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:10,350
Over time with people stocking up shrimp farms,
and in a general way, oyster farms, which

79
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,730
used to be prosperous
in mangroves,

80
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,520
and with saltwater penetrating the soil,
paddyfields have stopped producing.

81
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,050
To this day, nearly 150 million mangrove trees
have been planted in nearly 500 villages at

82
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,700
the Saloum Delta and in Casamance.

83
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,980
It is the largest world-wide program for mangrove
reforestation

84
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,930
with nearly 30,000 acres of mangroves having
been planted.

85
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:47,380
Moreover in the Delta of the Senegal River,
the Tocc Tocc community nature reserve, which

86
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,060
is involved in the Lac de Guiers,
is a continental area

87
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,750
of permanent fresh water.

88
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,350
It is in the process of being restored by
local communities

89
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,030
with technical support from the Direction
of the National Parks

90
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,550
and a number of partners.

91
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,050
The result of the restoration efforts
have enabled it to be recognized as a Ramsar

92
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,980
site.

93
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:17,620
With global warming, the rising sea level,
the Tocc Tocc community nature reserve's initiative

94
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:24,920
and the one by Oceanium are all crucial projects,
which guarantee the improvement of livelihoods,

95
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,389
and which demonstrate the need to collaborate
with nature

96
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:33,900
in order to guarantee that the environment
and populations, who depend on protected areas

97
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:41,310
and wetlands for their livelihood,
receive support for codevelopment activities.

98
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,889
The World Commission describes a seven stage
process,

99
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,910
recommended as a way of undertaking
the ecological restoration of protected areas.

100
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,650
The stages are not strictly sequential,
and some elements, like adopting adaptive

101
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,520
management
must occur throughout the whole project.

102
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,260
This process is placed in context
through a series of diagrams and more conceptualized

103
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,560
graphic boxes,
which provide extra information.

104
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,680
To conclude, ecological restoration of protected
areas contributes

105
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,810
to reaching the global targets for biodiversity
conservation.

106
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,870
It involves acting with caution and humility,
and recognizing that ecological restoration

107
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,659
is a complex and difficult process,
and that us intervening can have unexpected

108
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,050
consequences.

109
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:40,050
The World Commission on Protected Areas' approach
for restoring protected areas is a policy

110
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,500
framework
based on a group of clear principles,

111
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:55,300
which, rather than defining rigid processes,
supports an approach favoring a holistic approach,

112
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,240
large collaboration, careful planning, and
thought-through implementation

113
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,089
so as to obtain the desired results.

114
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,749
You can find out more
by also reading the 69th edition of the NAPA

115
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,620
letters,
which summarizes the guidelines which helped

116
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,420
me to prepare this lesson.

117
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,740
There, we have reached the end of this lesson.

118
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,029
The next episode will talk about the issues
of gender and equity

119
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,170
in managing protected areas.

120
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,760
Meanwhile, have an excellent day.
