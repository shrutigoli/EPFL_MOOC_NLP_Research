- Hello Geoffroy.
- Hello Paul.
Hello everyone.
Today's lesson is dedicated to two important concepts concerning the management of protected areas: connectivity and buffer zones.
While they are different, they partly coincide and that is why we are dealing with them in the same lesson.
You will find more information on this topic in the eBook of the World Commission of Protected
Areas, in chapter 27.
Let's therefore start with connectivity.
It isn't that easy to define even though everyone understands the general meaning of it: it's not very complicated.
Connectivity refers to the opportunity that species have to move between different points in an ecosystem; or even the amount of connections that will exist between the components within that ecosystem.
It can also refer to the nature of these connections, or even an environment's ability to preserve the ecological processes that occur there, for example, migration.
So to keep it simple, we will talk about the connectivity of habitats when beneficial habitats are linked to each other, and therefore not isolated.
And we will talk about the connectivity of ecological processes that may exist, even if at a distance, when we look into the migration of birds.
Connectivity is an important notion in the evolution process as well, because it enables genetic mixing to still be possible.
It therefore also involves longer-term effects, but that are obviously essential for the survival of species.
And yes, this connectivity concept is becoming more and more important with the fragmentation of environments, the boom of invasive species, the development of infrastructures or the human population, and of course, climate change, which forces certain species to move, if they can, mainly between protected areas.
Connectivity works based on the principle of networking, which, in theory, seems simple for protected areas that are more or less close to each other.
In reality, the discontinuities produced by strongly anthropic territories that separate two protected areas sometimes lead to the need to implement functional migration corridors, especially those in favor of terrestrial fauna.
It is true that, in fact, a landscape that maintains more connections between its different parts will be more able to preserve biodiversity because they will be able to move between these different zones.
While certain species, which are naturally mobile, become independent quite easily from physical links with their usual habitats, others, on the contrary, will only move when those links exist.
Sometimes a simple disruption in the environment, like a road, for example, can have disastrous consequences for the survival of a species by blocking migration, its migration, while other species may not be disrupted by this road at all.
It is important to keep this in mind.
Wildlife is not sensitive in the same way when habitats are not connected.
Fauna corridors, for example, are territories that link together habitats used by wildlife.
In fact, frequently they link together protected areas.
They are created based on the assertion that species in the protected area will in fact move around, and also use that passageway.
So, absolutely, it's true that certain species, will not venture out in man-made spaces surrounding the park, and so, if there are corridors, obviously, they will rather go through the corridor.
But that is not correct for all species, as some have quite an erratic way of moving around, like the elephant frequently does, for example, not always, but frequently.
Let's have a look at quite a functional case study of corridors in Senegal with Moussa Diouf.
In Senegal, we have many interconnections between protected areas.
There is Djoudj and Diawling between Senegal and Mauritania, that's more of an air corridor than a land one.
There is the corridor between Mali and Senegal, through the Niokolo-Koba and the Bafing, therefore through the Senegal River, but the model that is used the most anyway, the most complete corridor there is, is the corridor between biosphere reserves of Niokolo-Koba and of Ferlo.
Niokolo-Koba has been a biosphere reserve for a long time: since 1981.
The status of biosphere reserve has only just been awarded three years ago to the Ferlo biosphere reserve.
So, it is something completely new.
We are in the process of putting in place managing bodies.
The objective of this biosphere reserve, which is the destination zone of fauna migrating from Niokolo-Koba, is to reintroduce ecosystems into the zones in Ferlo, which are not liable to flooding.
When Niokolo-Koba is flooded during the rainy season, so at the end of the rainy season,
Niokolo-Koba's fauna, namely the large antelopes, who are more trypanotolerant than resistant, leave the park and find themselves in these northern zones.
Now, the corridor that is used still functions today, because we have had proof, witness accounts from the villagers, who, during each wintering period, recount to us the fact that, mainly the roan antelope, the Hippotragus equinus, pass through, leave Niokolo-Koba to go towards Ferlo and then return there around the end of the rainy season.
Yet, this corridor is greatly threatened by human occupation now, but development and management programs for these spaces, which are being implemented at the moment, may be able to allow us to reinvigorate them and make them more functional.
So, to keep it simple, there are three different types of corridors.
A landscape corridor is a group of territories with multiple uses: agricultural, hunting, harvesting, pastoralism...
They will however allow animals to pass.
A linear corridor is a territory that we keep in quite a natural state to link together two protected areas, so, globally, that is its only function: being a thoroughfare.
Finally, â€�stepping stonesâ€� are territories that are close enough to allow species to pass from one protected area to another.
More specifically, we can try to maintain large territories, which directly integrate protected areas and their connectivity, or we could target little ecosystems, like rivers and their galleries, which will link together different protected areas.
We can work on developing infrastructures to avoid environments being disrupted.
We can also, when necessary, recreate beneficial environments between the protected areas, or even expand from the conservation nucleus.
Paul Ndiaye has an interesting example for us.
Connectivity also comes from a system of territories more or less adjacent, which have statuses that are progressively changing from being completely focused on conservation to being fully anthropized.
It is therefore about putting in place zoning measures, which allow a smooth transition for wildlife travelling from spaces protected in a strict way to ordinary spaces.
This option was frequently applied within the framework of biosphere reserves organized as a whole, nested together.
The model known today throughout the world for zoning protected areas, is the model advocated by UNESCO for the concept of biosphere reserves.
It's a model that needs to be encouraged and that is very functional.
In fact, personally, I don't know of any others.
This model implements a core area, a buffer zone and a transition area.
The core area is generally composed of a classified ancient forest, defined as a national park or a fauna reserve, which is surrounded by a "to be defined" buffer zone.
And it's at that point maybe, that we need to be very inventive to explain this buffer zone.
In Senegal, we have recently put in place what we call the concept of a natural community reserve.
They are indigenous areas surrounding the park and each local community puts in place this land, which is a natural community reserve, but which belongs to the village land.
So this space is deliberated and managed in a rational way, with relations forged in symbiosis between the managers of protected areas and the people so that the people can find in the buffer zones, what they want there and avoid the risk of meeting the managers, and rangers, inside the protected areas.
Well, Moussa mentioned the importance of the buffer zones in the organization of the community or the conservation of protected areas.
Note that it is a notion that differs from one country to another, and sometimes even from one park to another in the same system.
Generally, the point of establishing a buffer zone lies in natural resources being secured in the best way, obviously, that's understandable.
It also lies in the relationship between the protected area's local populations improving, and of course, in the ability to respond better to the needs of certain species in the park, who are susceptible to occasionally leaving the strict boundaries of the core area.
Buffer zones surround the protected area and are used to reinforce conservation by creating an interface between this protected area and the other territories where access isn't monitored.
So, it enables, for example, farming activities and elephants, who will plunder the harvests, to avoid coexisting directly together, or even so a cattle farm and a territory used by lions and hyenas don't coexist.
The buffer zone is therefore useful for managers of protected areas and for those living in their outskirts.
Defining a buffer zone is complicated, because, essentially, it relates to the issue of governance.
Its size must make sense in ecological terms.
Therefore it will be large enough from the perspective of the custodian to protect the protected area, but it must also take into account the outskirts and the people, and so it will not encroach too much on farming land.
In Senegal, an approach consisted in creating a certain number of community reserves all around the Niokolo-Koba park to protect it better.
By extending this zone of natural community reserves all the way along Niokolo-Koba, we have therefore tried to create a strip of more than 691,000 acres of community protected areas, that almost completely surround the central nucleus of Niokolo-Koba.
And I think that we have, through this natural community reserve, explained this notion of the buffer zone.
It is a space, we need to make sure is clear, it is a space that is on village land, and so that originally belongs to the villagers.
It is now managed in a rational way by villagers alongside the managers of the protected areas in such a way as to produce in this space everything that the villagers went to get in the park in the form of poaching, and for which they risked their lives.
So it is really a negotiation, an arbitration zone for the various concerns of the managers, the protected areas and the people.
The construction of connectivity or of buffer zones requires, in practice, a sustained participatory approach.
That is where the main difficulty in their development lies, but it is also a unique opportunity, because it forces productive dialogue with the outskirts.
There, the essential has been said.
I will see you again in the next episode, which will be about ecological restoration of protected areas.
In the meantime, have an excellent day!
See you very soon.
