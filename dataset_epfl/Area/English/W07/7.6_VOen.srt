00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,160
Hello and welcome to this lesson,
dedicated today to a problem,

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,160
we regularly encounter in managing protected
areas:

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,160
corruption and trafficking, which goes hand
in hand with it.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,500
Of course, this is not the only sector where
this phenomenon exists,

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,670
but its influence on numerous failures in
parks and reserves is such

6
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,580
that we wanted to make it a specific topical
issue.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,120
In addition to this lesson,
you can find more information on this phenomenon

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,850
on the websites shown on this picture,
which discuss the subject and give you

9
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,220
at least some solutions.

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,019
So for this lesson, a specialist from EAGLE
Network will help us.

11
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:54,159
EAGLE are eco-activists for governance and
law enforcement.

12
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,140
We have Luc Mathot, who is based in Libreville,
in Gabon.

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,879
So the first question to ask ourselves
is whether this phenomenon of corruption

14
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,460
is a significant problem in our protected
areas.

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,090
I work mostly in Central Africa.

16
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,710
In each protected area, if you have 20 or
30 eco-guards,

17
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,659
there will be at least one who is corrupt,
but actually sometimes, it tends to be the

18
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,390
other way round:
one of twenty who is not corrupt.

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,890
I don't have the evidence,
but in every protected area there are always

20
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,070
corrupt eco-guards.

21
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,600
It's inevitable.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,899
I am not only talking about eco-guards,
it is the gendarmes around them, etc.

23
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:40,780
Salaries are not always very high, the temptation
is very strong.

24
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,770
They give you one or two million.

25
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,970
The question is, "What does corrupt mean?"

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,149
Is it someone who let's through a little meat,
or who closes his eyes to game coming through

27
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,020
or is it someone who organizes the trafficking?

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,140
So there really are several levels of corruption
and complicity.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:05,549
I don't know if it starts at the top
or the bottom, but it is at all levels.

30
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,399
We have had water and forestry agents implicated.

31
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:14,200
In Gabon, there was a captain in the Gendarmerie
that we had arrested with ivory.

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,870
He was selling ivory himself, it was in his
official car.

33
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,500
A prefect has been arrested, he did seven
months in jail,

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,480
a sub-prefect, so it can be at all levels.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,200
We have had cases... we have had eco-guards,
for example,

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,030
or the managers of protected areas are corrupt.

37
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,330
You should know that traffickers, poachers
have money.

38
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,800
It is of course for profit
that they take part in trafficking

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,750
and so they have a tendency to get close to
eco-guards,

40
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,550
to get close to managers to corrupt them,
to offer them money.

41
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,300
So either it is a bit organized like that
or maybe a little opportunistic.

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,710
Eco-guards who catch a poacher, a trafficker
of ivory or something else,

43
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:02,370
automatically, the poacher will try to corrupt
the eco-guard

44
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,660
or the manager of the protected area who caught
him,

45
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,590
so we have had a lot of cases in North Congo,
Cameroon,

46
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,680
they are eco-guards who have been arrested
who have gone to prison

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,590
and who have been convicted.

48
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:21,100
So it is important to look at this problem
and that the eco-guards

49
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,000
and managers of protected areas are ready
to react.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,980
You can also find recent information on the
species

51
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,710
that are the most exposed to trafficking
and the consequences that it has on their

52
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,950
conservation
in the leaflets published by EAGLE Network.

53
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,370
Let's now look with Luc
at the main challenges of wildlife trafficking

54
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,910
in Africa.

55
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,870
We are always talking about the problems of
means, of capacity,

56
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,610
we don't have enough cars, we don't have enough
money...

57
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:58,290
The real problem, is actually
the lack of real political will and corruption,

58
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,040
even collusion.

59
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,790
It is not that traffickers of ivory or other
things,

60
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,870
are really strong, organized.

61
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,460
We are not at the level of drug trafficking
with armed men

62
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,230
who shoot at you at any time...

63
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,290
We could stop the trafficking.

64
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,370
We really could stop it.

65
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:27,039
If on our side,
we had really honest, effective teams...

66
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,189
and they were competent,
because often we work with eco-guards, water

67
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:34,030
and forestry agents
who are not used to fighting against trafficking.

68
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,979
So, we must work with specialists, agencies
who fight against drug trafficking, cocaine

69
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:40,990
trafficking.

70
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,060
The same agencies can fight against ivory
trafficking.

71
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,150
That's what we did,
that's the opportunity we had in Togo,

72
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,169
where now it is the anti-drug agency which
works on ivory.

73
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:56,180
And for them ivory is like cocaine,
and now we have much more effective results,

74
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,560
real legal procedures, real investigations.

75
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,710
An eco-guard, a water and forestry agent is
not even used to arresting someone,

76
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,990
to taking him to prison, to taking him in
front of a prosecutor,

77
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,020
the code of criminal procedure, he can't master
it.

78
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,990
So there is this problem of competence and
then that of corruption,

79
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,520
I have already talked a lot about it,
but we think it really is the biggest problem.

80
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,449
A subject, we talk a lot about at the moment,
is ivory trafficking.

81
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,130
How is the struggle against this phenomenon
going?

82
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,070
In the case of ivory, if we talk about corruption,
it is a special case but similar,

83
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:35,610
it is a special case
in that the amounts involved are large.

84
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,710
You sometimes seize three or four tons of
ivory,

85
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,749
that represents three or four million of Euros
in Asia.

86
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:45,490
And when there is more money, it is easier
to corrupt.

87
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:52,889
There is a lot of complicity,
a lot of corruption, obviously.

88
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:57,449
Certain countries like Botswana,
which is the least corrupt in Africa along

89
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,080
with the Seychelles,
there is very little trafficking.

90
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,310
There are 200,000 elephants, something like
that, in Namibia as well.

91
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,300
You realize that a lot of States say, "It's
not our fault,

92
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,830
we are an African State.

93
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,260
It is because there is demand for ivory from
the Chinese."

94
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,669
Yes, that is true, but why in Botswana,
why in Namibia, is there much less trafficking

95
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:23,389
than in Central Africa, than in West Africa?

96
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,169
It's because they are the countries which
are more watchful,

97
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,740
where there is less corruption,
in which the law is more vigorously applied.

98
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,819
There is also a lack of political will.

99
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,430
You hear all the time
that a certain country has signed agreements,

100
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,659
there are laws, they want to fight,
there are action plans, strategies, workshops...

101
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:46,949
I almost want to say each month, in any case
each year,

102
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,740
but overall on the ground, nothing changes.

103
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,840
There is not really a political will.

104
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,340
The elephant is also an animal that is a little
anachronistic,

105
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,469
which causes damage,
which is not always welcomed by populations.

106
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:02,150
This has perhaps some consequences for political
will,

107
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,280
but I think that it is above all
because there are financial issues behind

108
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,539
this pro-ivory lobbying.

109
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:11,870
And of course, there is always corruption.

110
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,509
So concretely, are there solutions to this
problem?

111
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:22,520
Again, solutions to improve slightly the fight
against wildlife trafficking,

112
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,650
it would be, as I said just before,
to work with specialists in the fight against

113
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,979
trafficking.

114
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:33,699
Not biologists, not water and forestry agents
nor eco-guards,

115
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:39,710
but people who have worked on drug trafficking,
on mass trafficking, human trafficking.

116
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,400
So they are much more effective.

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,259
They can work day and night, they are used
to that.

118
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:50,069
They are used to dealing with legal procedures,
arresting people, interrogating people.

119
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,249
Most of the water and forestry agents in all
countries,

120
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:58,990
they finish work at 4pm-5pm,
Often also they don't feel strong, they are

121
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,879
not armed,
they are not trained for that.

122
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,039
So again, working with the most competent
structures

123
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,879
and then anticipating corruption,
knowing if we arrest a trafficker,

124
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,919
we know very well that there will be someone,
maybe even a lot of people, who he will call

125
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,650
to get this person released,
maybe because they received money, or he's

126
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,080
a friend,
maybe because they do business together etc.

127
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,089
So you must anticipate the corruption.

128
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,610
To illustrate all this,
let's look in more detail at EAGLE's action

129
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,699
on the ground.

130
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,940
We try above all to work with the national
authorities in Africa

131
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,500
so that they can increase the degree of law
enforcement.

132
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,110
EAGLE's work can be resumed in four points.

133
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,880
We have the investigation:
we identify or localize the traffickers

134
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,149
and we gather a maximum amount of evidence
against them,

135
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,360
traffickers of ivory in particular, wildlife
in general.

136
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,740
Then we put pressure on the authorities to...
facilitate the arrest of these traffickers.

137
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,009
Always caught in the act or almost always
in the act

138
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:10,660
with the ivory in their hands,
so whilst they are selling the ivory or panther

139
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,440
skins or live animals.

140
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,200
And then, there is the legal side.

141
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,920
We have the legal experts who follow the case
with the authorities,

142
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,970
who check that records haven't gone missing.

143
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,960
Sometimes, a file goes missing, a clerk takes
the file,

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,220
it can then no longer be found...

145
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,399
We check all that, we follow the case to court
with our teams of legal experts but also our

146
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,380
lawyers
who are there to defend the water and forests,

147
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,880
to defend governments.

148
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,010
And then there is the media side, we broadcast
all the results.

149
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,800
We inform the public, the authorities at the
same time,

150
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,620
to also dissuade potential traffickers.

151
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,070
So it is on these four points,
that we really put a strong emphasis in the

152
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,350
fight against corruption.

153
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,790
This is the end of this lesson.

154
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,600
The next episode will be an introduction to
the Ramsar Convention,

155
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,149
which deals with wetlands.

156
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:05,959
Have a great day!
