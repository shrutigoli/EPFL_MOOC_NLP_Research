1
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,299
- Hello Geoffroy.

2
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:10,499
- Hello Paul.

3
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:12,589
Hello everyone.

4
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:16,829
Today's lesson is dedicated to two important
concepts

5
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:22,849
concerning the management of protected areas:
connectivity and buffer zones.

6
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:28,029
While they are different, they partly coincide
and that is why we are dealing with them in

7
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,140
the same lesson.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,420
You will find more information on this topic
in the eBook of the World Commission of Protected

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,079
Areas,
in chapter 27.

10
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,480
Let's therefore start with connectivity.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,390
It isn't that easy to define
even though everyone understands the general

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,969
meaning of it:
it's not very complicated.

13
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:54,199
Connectivity refers to the opportunity that
species have to move

14
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,170
between different points in an ecosystem;
or even the amount of connections that will

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,700
exist
between the components within that ecosystem.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,610
It can also refer to the nature of these connections,
or even an environment's ability

17
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,500
to preserve the ecological processes that
occur there,

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,040
for example, migration.

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,080
So to keep it simple, we will talk about the
connectivity of habitats

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,470
when beneficial habitats are linked to each
other,

21
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,060
and therefore not isolated.

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,290
And we will talk about the connectivity of
ecological processes that may exist,

23
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:45,280
even if at a distance, when we look into the
migration of birds.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,640
Connectivity
is an important notion in the evolution process

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,860
as well,
because it enables genetic mixing to still

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,250
be possible.

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,340
It therefore also involves longer-term effects,
but that are obviously essential for the survival

28
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,020
of species.

29
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:11,760
And yes, this connectivity concept is becoming
more and more important

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,180
with the fragmentation of environments,
the boom of invasive species,

31
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,560
the development of infrastructures or the
human population,

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:29,150
and of course, climate change,
which forces certain species to move,

33
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,630
if they can,
mainly between protected areas.

34
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,390
Connectivity works based on the principle
of networking,

35
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,070
which, in theory, seems simple for protected
areas

36
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,770
that are more or less close to each other.

37
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:54,000
In reality, the discontinuities produced
by strongly anthropic territories

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,440
that separate two protected areas
sometimes lead to the need to implement

39
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,410
functional migration corridors,
especially those in favor of terrestrial fauna.

40
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,620
It is true that, in fact, a landscape that
maintains more connections

41
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,040
between its different parts will be more able
to preserve biodiversity

42
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,500
because they will be able to move between
these different zones.

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,210
While certain species, which are naturally
mobile,

44
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,200
become independent quite easily
from physical links with their usual habitats,

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,220
others, on the contrary, will only move when
those links exist.

46
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,340
Sometimes a simple disruption in the environment,
like a road, for example,

47
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,890
can have disastrous consequences for the survival
of a species

48
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,340
by blocking migration, its migration,
while other species may not be disrupted by

49
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,660
this road at all.

50
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,310
It is important to keep this in mind.

51
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:05,510
Wildlife is not sensitive in the same way
when habitats are not connected.

52
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:15,140
Fauna corridors, for example, are territories
that link together habitats used by wildlife.

53
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,060
In fact, frequently they link together protected
areas.

54
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:26,699
They are created based on the assertion that
species in the protected area

55
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,500
will in fact move around, and also use that
passageway.

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,749
So, absolutely, it's true that certain species,
will not venture out

57
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:43,729
in man-made spaces surrounding the park,
and so, if there are corridors, obviously,

58
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,830
they will rather go through the corridor.

59
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,490
But that is not correct for all species,
as some have quite an erratic way of moving

60
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,009
around,
like the elephant frequently does, for example,

61
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,830
not always, but frequently.

62
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,909
Let's have a look at quite a functional case
study of corridors

63
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,099
in Senegal with Moussa Diouf.

64
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:08,330
In Senegal, we have many interconnections
between protected areas.

65
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:13,099
There is Djoudj and Diawling between Senegal
and Mauritania,

66
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,590
that's more of an air corridor than a land
one.

67
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:22,760
There is the corridor between Mali and Senegal,
through the Niokolo-Koba and the Bafing, therefore

68
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,059
through the Senegal River,
but the model that is

69
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:32,000
used the most anyway, the most complete corridor
there is,

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,590
is the corridor between biosphere reserves
of Niokolo-Koba and of Ferlo.

71
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:45,430
Niokolo-Koba has been a biosphere reserve
for a long time: since 1981.

72
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,749
The status of biosphere reserve has only just
been awarded three years ago

73
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,669
to the Ferlo biosphere reserve.

74
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,939
So, it is something completely new.

75
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:58,800
We are in the process of putting in place
managing bodies.

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,259
The objective of this biosphere reserve,
which is the destination zone of fauna migrating

77
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,580
from Niokolo-Koba,
is to reintroduce ecosystems into the zones

78
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,009
in Ferlo,
which are not liable to flooding.

79
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:19,330
When Niokolo-Koba is flooded during the rainy
season,

80
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,629
so at the end of the rainy season,
Niokolo-Koba's fauna, namely the large antelopes,

81
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:29,210
who are more trypanotolerant than resistant,
leave the park

82
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,889
and find themselves in these northern zones.

83
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:36,659
Now, the corridor that is used still functions
today,

84
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:41,160
because we have had proof, witness accounts
from the villagers,

85
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,650
who, during each wintering period, recount
to us the fact

86
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:50,479
that, mainly the roan antelope, the Hippotragus
equinus, pass through,

87
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,259
leave Niokolo-Koba to go towards Ferlo
and then return there around the end of the

88
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:56,949
rainy season.

89
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:02,699
Yet, this corridor is greatly threatened by
human occupation now,

90
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,419
but development and management programs for
these spaces,

91
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:14,399
which are being implemented at the moment,
may be able to allow us to reinvigorate them

92
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,949
and make them more functional.

93
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,339
So, to keep it simple, there are three different
types of corridors.

94
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,939
A landscape corridor is a group of territories
with multiple uses:

95
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:31,080
agricultural, hunting, harvesting, pastoralism...

96
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,729
They will however allow animals to pass.

97
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:40,889
A linear corridor
is a territory that we keep in quite a natural

98
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,669
state
to link together two protected areas,

99
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:48,129
so, globally, that is its only function: being
a thoroughfare.

100
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:53,369
Finally, ”stepping stones”
are territories that are close enough

101
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:59,280
to allow species to pass
from one protected area to another.

102
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,899
More specifically, we can try to maintain
large territories,

103
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:09,059
which directly integrate protected areas and
their connectivity,

104
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:14,849
or we could target little ecosystems, like
rivers and their galleries,

105
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:17,509
which will link together different protected
areas.

106
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:23,960
We can work on developing infrastructures
to avoid environments being disrupted.

107
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,789
We can also, when necessary,
recreate beneficial environments between the

108
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:33,750
protected areas,
or even expand from the conservation nucleus.

109
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:40,740
Paul Ndiaye has an interesting example for
us.

110
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:48,470
Connectivity also comes from a system of territories
more or less adjacent, which have statuses

111
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:54,550
that are progressively changing
from being completely focused on conservation

112
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,360
to being fully anthropized.

113
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,570
It is therefore about putting in place zoning
measures,

114
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,139
which allow a smooth transition for wildlife
travelling

115
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:15,170
from spaces protected in a strict way to ordinary
spaces.

116
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,930
This option was frequently applied
within the framework of biosphere reserves

117
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,800
organized as a whole, nested together.

118
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,560
The model known today throughout the world
for zoning protected areas,

119
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,830
is the model advocated by UNESCO for the concept
of biosphere reserves.

120
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,160
It's a model that needs to be encouraged and
that is very functional.

121
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,370
In fact, personally, I don't know of any others.

122
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,870
This model implements a core area, a buffer
zone and a transition area.

123
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:56,899
The core area is generally composed of a classified
ancient forest,

124
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:02,630
defined as a national park or a fauna reserve,
which is surrounded by a "to be defined" buffer

125
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,850
zone.

126
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,579
And it's at that point maybe, that we need
to be very inventive

127
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:11,060
to explain this buffer zone.

128
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:20,279
In Senegal, we have recently put in place
what we call the concept of a natural community

129
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,670
reserve.

130
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:27,709
They are indigenous areas surrounding the
park

131
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:34,270
and each
local community puts in place this land,

132
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:40,339
which is a natural community reserve,
but which belongs

133
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,910
to the village land.

134
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,329
So this space is deliberated and managed in
a rational way,

135
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:51,470
with relations forged in symbiosis
between the managers of protected areas and

136
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,019
the people
so that the people can find in the buffer

137
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:02,110
zones, what they want there
and avoid the risk of meeting the managers,

138
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,459
and rangers, inside the protected areas.

139
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,540
Well, Moussa mentioned the importance of the
buffer zones

140
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,440
in the organization of the community or the
conservation of protected areas.

141
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,949
Note that it is a notion that differs from
one country to another,

142
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:20,069
and sometimes even from one park to another
in the same system.

143
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:24,820
Generally, the point of establishing a buffer
zone lies in natural resources

144
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,480
being secured in the best way,
obviously, that's understandable.

145
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,459
It also lies in the relationship
between the protected area's local populations

146
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:38,180
improving,
and of course, in the ability to respond better

147
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:44,420
to the needs of certain species in the park,
who are susceptible to occasionally

148
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,180
leaving the strict boundaries of the core
area.

149
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:56,040
Buffer zones surround the protected area and
are used to reinforce conservation

150
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,490
by creating an interface between this protected
area

151
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,820
and the other territories where access isn't
monitored.

152
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,649
So, it enables, for example, farming activities
and elephants,

153
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:13,290
who will plunder the harvests, to avoid coexisting
directly together,

154
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:19,639
or even so a cattle farm and a territory used
by lions and hyenas don't coexist.

155
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,029
The buffer zone is therefore useful for managers
of protected areas

156
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:28,560
and for those living in their outskirts.

157
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,620
Defining a buffer zone is complicated,
because, essentially, it relates to the issue

158
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
of governance.

159
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,110
Its size must make sense in ecological terms.

160
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,819
Therefore it will be large enough from the
perspective of the custodian

161
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:46,029
to protect the protected area,
but it must also take into account the outskirts

162
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,180
and the people,
and so it will not encroach too much on farming

163
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,180
land.

164
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,860
In Senegal, an approach consisted
in creating a certain number of community

165
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:03,459
reserves
all around the Niokolo-Koba park to protect

166
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:04,740
it better.

167
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,540
By extending this zone of natural community
reserves

168
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,629
all the way along Niokolo-Koba,
we have therefore tried to create a strip

169
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:20,710
of more than 691,000 acres
of community protected areas,

170
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,920
that almost completely surround the central
nucleus of Niokolo-Koba.

171
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,430
And I think that we have, through this natural
community reserve,

172
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,470
explained this notion of the buffer zone.

173
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:41,180
It is a space, we need to make sure is clear,
it is a space that is on village land,

174
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,940
and so that originally belongs to the villagers.

175
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:50,680
It is now managed in a rational way
by villagers alongside the managers of the

176
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,279
protected areas
in such a way as to produce in this space

177
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,389
everything
that the villagers went to get in the park

178
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,350
in the form of poaching,
and for which they risked their lives.

179
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,980
So it is really a negotiation, an arbitration
zone

180
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,820
for the various concerns of the managers,
the protected areas and the people.

181
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:18,990
The construction of connectivity or of buffer
zones requires, in practice,

182
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,139
a sustained participatory approach.

183
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,319
That is where the main difficulty in their
development lies,

184
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:31,470
but it is also a unique opportunity,
because it forces productive dialogue with

185
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,410
the outskirts.

186
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,269
There, the essential has been said.

187
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:42,439
I will see you again in the next episode,
which will be about ecological restoration

188
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:43,680
of protected areas.

189
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,420
In the meantime, have an excellent day!

190
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,160
See you very soon.
