00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,019
Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:17,300
Today's lesson is dedicated to protected areas
and climate change.

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,270
We are going to have a quick look at the definition
of climate change,

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,289
the challenges for protected areas, the effects
of climate change,

5
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,140
the role of adaptation and mitigation of protected
areas.

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:36,300
I suggest you take a look at this website
to learn more.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,830
Climate change is a sustained change
related to the expected and usual climate

8
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,890
conditions
for a given region.

9
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,400
It occurs over decades, or maybe even longer
periods.

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:59,680
It concerns significant statistical variations
of the general state of the climate

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,320
or of their variability, which persists for
a prolonged period.

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:14,790
Today, climate change is of major interest
to scientists as well as the public,

13
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,020
due to the implications regarding
food security,

14
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:27,400
health,
the economy on a global and national scale,

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,560
as well as our lifestyles,
population growth,

16
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,440
the evolution and degradation of habitats,
as for example deforestation and degradation

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,159
of wetlands etc.

18
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,200
The main cause of climate change, according
to experts on the subject,

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,619
is the increase in greenhouse gas, especially
carbon dioxide,

20
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:02,810
due to widespread use of fossil fuels
since the industrial era, and especially the

21
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,030
last 100 years.

22
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:13,730
The unprecedented increase of global temperatures
that happened in the 20th century

23
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,970
is the greatest of the last millennium, according
to IPCC.

24
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,000
This increase is mostly due to the impact
of human activity

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,160
on the climatic balance of the planet, and
has induced changes

26
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,630
in rainfall patterns, in times of drought,
storms,

27
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,670
the acidification and temperature of oceans,
the sea level rise etc.

28
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,890
The challenges for protected areas facing
climate change.

29
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,160
For several decades, protected areas have
been considered

30
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,010
to be an essential tool for biodiversity conservation.

31
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:05,250
The impacts of climate change now give them
a renewed role as an adaptation tool to climate

32
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,060
change.

33
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,910
They have a threefold function in this respect:
to help species to adapt to the pattern of

34
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,819
climate change
and to sudden climate events

35
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:26,860
by providing refuges and migration corridors.

36
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,420
Protecting populations against sudden climatic
events

37
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,090
and reducing vulnerability to flooding, to
drought,

38
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,220
and other catastrophes linked to climate.

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,160
Directly helping economies to adapt to climate
change

40
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,650
by reducing costs deriving from the harmful
effects

41
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,890
of climatic events.

42
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,670
From the point of view of ecological challenges,
the world has now more than 200,000 protected

43
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,670
areas.

44
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,909
Those consisting of land masses
cover more than 15% of the surface area of

45
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:09,849
the globe,
and protected areas appear amongst the most

46
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:15,120
effective tools
in protecting species against extinction

47
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,390
and the impact of man-made threats.

48
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,270
Concerning social issues,
protected areas might be able to supply services

49
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:32,460
specifically for the ecosystem
and increase the ability of the local population

50
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,360
to adapt to climate change.

51
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,690
On the impact of climate change.

52
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:45,070
Climate change modifies two factors
that control the distribution of biomes,

53
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,690
namely temperature and precipitation.

54
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,540
That means that the ecosystems that we find
within the biomes,

55
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,430
are directly affected by climate change.

56
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,650
A number of other factors of anthropogenic
sources

57
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,850
complicate the response of the vast majority
of ecosystems

58
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,850
when faced with climate change.

59
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:20,660
Conversely,
changes in the function of ecosystems

60
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,790
due to the anthropogenic component and climate
change,

61
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,360
could greatly influence the world's climate.

62
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,590
We note the impact on nutrient and carbon
cycles.

63
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:41,509
As an example, one of the most well known
impacts

64
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:48,180
of the accumulation of greenhouse gas is global
warming.

65
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,240
The impact on vegetation, for example global
warming,

66
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:02,190
could cause temperatures that the local vegetation
is not adapted to

67
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,020
and it would not be synchronized with the
photoperiods.

68
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:15,680
Impact on fauna, for example,
birds, that migrate over great distances,

69
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,210
could see their reproduction area and wintering
ground modified.

70
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,620
The effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

71
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,789
As an example, the appearance and proliferation
of invasive species

72
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:40,820
could be accentuated by climate change
in forests and in Sudanian Savanna.

73
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,570
Listen to Ibrahim Thiaw,
Deputy Executive Director

74
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:51,009
of the United Nations Environment Programme,
on the role played by protected areas faced

75
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,259
with climate change.

76
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,320
Today, in the world, there are around 200,000
protected areas .

77
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,380
They cover a little more than 14% of the world's
land

78
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,410
and almost 3% of oceans.

79
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,380
Beyond their initial function of conservation
for fauna and flora,

80
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,850
they are progressively transformed
into providers of natural and cost effective

81
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,860
solutions
thus contributing to taking up certain great

82
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,980
contemporary challenges,
which are the most difficult to explain.

83
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,340
Humanity is still confronted with these issues.

84
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,669
Therefore, protected areas contribute to mitigation
and adaptation

85
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,370
to climate change.

86
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,610
Well conserved, protected areas form important
carbon sinks.

87
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,100
In fact, UNEP estimates that 15% of terrestrial
carbon stocks

88
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,160
are stored in protected areas.

89
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:50,669
However, mismanaged, degraded forests contribute
up to 17% of global carbon emissions,

90
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,099
which makes it the third emission source above
the transport sector.

91
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,660
Protected areas also form buffer zones against
catastrophes,

92
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,410
whether they are natural or anthropogenic
in origin,

93
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,699
for example flooding, forest fires, hurricanes
etc.

94
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,350
Furthermore, they supply essential ecosystem
services:

95
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,849
food, pure air and freshwater.

96
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:21,580
As you see, protected areas deliver many benefits
to humanity.

97
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,419
We must therefore invest in conservation or
restoration of natural capital,

98
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,759
the only thing capable of guaranteeing services,
not only in the short term

99
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,810
but also the long term,
working thus as a safety valve for generations

100
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,810
to come.

101
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:42,659
In conclusion, in module 2 on planning,
you have seen the planning methods for protected

102
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,829
areas.

103
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:50,470
So that the protected areas network is effective,
the selection of sights must be the best it

104
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,230
can be
and strategies must be adapted for the establishment

105
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,050
of protected areas
in the context of global change, and climate

106
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,970
change is one of them.

107
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,529
To achieve this, it is essential to define
the networks of resilient protected areas

108
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,589
manage them for resilience, climate adaptation
and mitigation

109
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:14,170
and integrate them into the climate planning
process.

110
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,519
This is the end of this lesson.

111
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,699
In the next class we will examine another
aspect related to today's subject:

112
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,360
connectivity between protected areas.

113
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,779
Until then, have a great day!
