1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,500
Hello, in this sequence, we will look into
the notions

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,719
of gender and equity in protected areas.

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,720
The reference book for this sequence is is
French:

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,110
Gender and equity in the Protected Areas of
West Africa

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,430
by Julienne N. Anoko for FIBA and IUCN.

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,040
This is the reference book that I recommend
you read.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,280
What is equity?

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,070
According to a commonly accepted definition,
taking into consideration the equity principle

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,540
"aims at an equitable access of men and women
to develop their capacities,

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,829
regardless of their sex, gender, social class,
religion or age".

11
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:50,719
The issue of equity, please take note of this,
tends to be associated or confused

12
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,329
with women's demands,
because it is mainly them who suffered and

13
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,129
who continue to experience inequality.

14
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:00,289
But you will have realized that there is much
more to this notion.

15
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:05,790
In the process of managing protected areas,
in most cases, dialogue only takes into account

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,610
the men's perspective.

17
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,890
It therefore excludes the other groups, women
whose roles as users,

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:18,010
managers, environmental experts,
but also as destroyers of natural resources

19
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,820
are clearly evident.

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,950
It also excludes young and old people,
and other sectors of the population.

21
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,760
And yet, the approach for sustainable development
recommends recognizing and taking into account

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,300
all of a nation's strengths in order to attain
their objectives.

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,720
It subsequently becomes essential
that all development projects include the

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,210
principle of equity
in each of their phases.

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,650
Let's have a look together at some extracts
from the video on equity,

26
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:56,150
a video developed and prepared by the IUCN
PAPACO Programme.

27
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,340
Equity...

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,970
I see equity much more as a justice principle,
insofar as... the two genders

29
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:12,840
have just as much the same ability
to intervene in the development process,

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,489
and that the female gender is frequently made
invisible

31
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:18,470
despite all the efforts they make.

32
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,810
It would simply be establishing justice.

33
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,470
We need to start from the woman's place in
society,

34
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,230
which is good,
and try to move forward so that there is this

35
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,970
equity,
because we know so well

36
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,170
that they participate in the management of
areas.

37
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,750
She is the one who lives it daily,
and it's through the day-to-day that we can

38
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,400
change, I believe.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,960
Throughout the centuries, it is the women,
who have suffered the most from discrimination.

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,230
Today, we feel obliged to try and first of
all balance things out,

41
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,170
to at least level things out
for there to be a certain, and a faint balancing

42
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,120
out,
at least before incorporating all of the other

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:09,220
social classes.

44
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,800
These girls come from local villages
in the hunting zone in Ghana,

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,740
and as their zone's benefits are reduced,
their zone's natural resources,

46
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,730
we can only pay them back
by supporting them with their children's studies.

47
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,910
It is true that other activities are carried
out in this field,

48
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,590
there is maybe gardening that may have been
mentioned to you,

49
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,910
there is also some drilling that has been
done in some villages.

50
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,790
So that's what we do with the idea
that we can still give back to these local

51
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,170
zones.

52
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,240
Educating these young girls, it's also educating
a family.

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,551
We therefore think that if, in these villages,
there are girls who manage to succeed, they

54
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:57,110
will be more sensitive,
they will come back to support their parents

55
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,580
and these are immediate impacts
and its the whole village, who will benefit

56
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,580
from it.

57
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,959
One day, these women will come back to work
on their village's development

58
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,470
for decision-making,
for the other activities.

59
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,120
We have been thinking
that, for now, it is better to support these

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,519
young girls,
who have not only been abandoned,

61
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,590
because the parents prefer to give them away
in marriage,

62
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:30,560
but we think that, now, as soon as they succeed,
they will come back to support their village.

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,160
With equity, we also think
that we must aim to eliminate all of the barriers

64
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,710
that are an obstacle to people possessing
their economic,

65
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,340
social and political rights.

66
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,600
Equity is also justice.

67
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,520
This means eliminating all sorts of barriers
that mean that people cannot benefit from

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:57,000
what is rightly theirs.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,060
Pendjari Park covers nearly 300,000 hectares.

70
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,770
It was created in 1961.

71
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,300
It belongs to the savanna that extends over
several million acres

72
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,800
between Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger.

73
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,180
They are mainly composed of W Park and Arli
Park.

74
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,460
In the south, it is bordered by the Atakora
Mountains.

75
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,110
The Pendjari river is the only significant
waterway

76
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,460
and it runs for around 125 miles within the
park.

77
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,990
Pendjari park was declared Biosphere Reserve
in 1986.

78
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,900
It has been split into several zones with
one for hunting,

79
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,990
where there are dozens of wildlife species,
including elephants, lions, buffaloes and

80
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,320
antilopes.

81
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,490
In the 1980s, Pendjari Park's natural resources
gradually deteriorated.

82
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,120
Local people were therefore kept away from
the park

83
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,150
and poaching was rife throughout the area.

84
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,080
Having observed this, management decided to
involve the local populations

85
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,680
in the management of the reserve.

86
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,630
Equity has added to the management of natural
resources,

87
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,010
particularly in West Africa, firstly by showing
us

88
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,650
that women and vulnerable groups
are knowledgeable,

89
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,560
and equity has enabled the knowledge that
these people have to be valued.

90
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,990
Equity has also enabled these advantages to
be spread out

91
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,490
and equity has enabled many of these people
to come forward,

92
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,710
to have a voice so that they can express themselves,
as we've been able to listen to groups that

93
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:32,259
we were not listening to,
thanks to equity in conservation in West Africa.

94
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,070
The Urok community area has the essential
characteristic

95
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,820
of cultural inclusion.

96
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,960
Management rules are decided
by updating traditional management rules.

97
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,380
In traditional management, women play a role
in every stage

98
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,990
of exploiting strategic resources,
like, for example, shells for food security.

99
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,210
And we cannot be effective when managing these
resources

100
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,740
if we do not involve women.

101
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,800
And so, more than just a question of finding
equity,

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:16,010
it is also about finding effectiveness.

103
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,930
Along with other women, young and old,
Iana is off to collect shells on the shores

104
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,040
at low tide.

105
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,580
These shells are one of the staple foods in
the Bijagos,

106
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,930
especially just before the harvest, when the
lofts are empty.

107
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,620
It is also a traditional ritual
that is transmitted from one generation to

108
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,070
another
and tradition is always closely linked to

109
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,570
the environment.

110
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:47,960
We cook the shells with rice, if we have rice,
otherwise we can cook them with mangoes.

111
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,750
We can also use mangrove fruit,
it is very very nourishing.

112
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,449
It is a traditional dish.

113
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,830
Our grandmothers and mothers taught us how
to prepare shells.

114
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,940
It is also very important during rituals and
ceremonies.

115
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:17,410
Bijago people are organized by age groups
and to transition from one age group into

116
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,360
another,
a ritual and ceremonies are needed.

117
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:31,630
For these events, we prepare the traditional
dishes.

118
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,789
I am a member of Urok's management commitee.

119
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:47,550
I have every right to speak in this meeting,
to express myself.

120
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:54,860
In West Africa, we have started to act,
we put it in place, the people accepted it,

121
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,000
but we still have many obstacles,
which mean that people aren't taking the plunge.

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,120
People don't have the courage to say "yes,
we will accept change."

123
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,220
And I think we should not be afraid,
because it's a desire

124
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,850
and until we decide to change things ourselves,
to work on it, I don't think we will manage

125
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,990
it.

126
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,350
But there are still many constraints.

127
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,029
We must also understand that things were built
over many centuries

128
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,980
and what we would like is for people to be
made aware,

129
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,620
to accept that we can change,
and that the changes are not just negative.

130
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,710
There, this sequence is now finished.

131
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,370
You now understand the whole point of integrating
and taking into account

132
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,440
the principle of equity in managing protected
areas.

133
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,280
For the manager, it is about prioritizing
dialogue

134
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,140
between all social classes.

135
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,350
It is about integrating equity
in developing and preparing the management

136
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,610
plan.

137
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,230
It is about having all the groups participate
in the activities,

138
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,500
in the protected area's actions.

139
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,830
Finally, it is about ensuring an equitable
distribution

140
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:11,350
of access to development, to activities,
and to the benefits that protected areas can

141
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,480
bring.

142
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,480
There, this sequence is finished.

143
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,980
I invite you to refer to the guide and the
video.

144
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,649
Have a good day.
