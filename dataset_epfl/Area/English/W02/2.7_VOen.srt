1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,420
Hello and welcome to all.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,980
Today's lesson is about the Aichi targets
as defined by the Convention on Biological

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,050
Diversity.

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:32,530
We will go through the history of these targets,
then look at the guidelines of one of the

5
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,530
targets,
and then consider the usefulness of Aichi

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,530
Targets.

7
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,949
I invite you to read these thoroughly on the
CBD website,

8
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:49,789
and to look more broadly at their corresponding
strategic plan.

9
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,520
Please listen Martin Yelkouni on the history
of Aichi targets.

10
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,670
It was during the 10th
Conference of the parties of the Convention

11
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,960
on Biological Diversity
in Japan,

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,829
that the Aichi targets, as part of the strategic
plan

13
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:09,210
for Biodiversity 2011-2020 were adopted.

14
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,270
Aichi refers to the name of the Aichi Prefecture,
Japan.

15
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:19,119
This is a general strategic framework on biodiversity,
not only for biodiversity- related conventions

16
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,740
but also for the United Nations as a whole.

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,640
The Parties agreed to translate this general
international framework

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,219
into national strategies and action plans
for biodiversity.

19
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:38,960
It seeks to live in harmony with nature looking
towards 2050,

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,240
that by then, biodiversity would be valued,
conserved, restored and used wisely,

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,840
thus maintaining the services provided by
the ecosystems

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,479
which keep the planet healthy,
and providing essential benefits to all peoples.

23
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,189
So we are talking about
extremely important aspects of conservation

24
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,460
overall
but also, more specifically in Africa.

25
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,869
And these directly affect our work in protected
areas.

26
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,470
You will definitely hear Aichi mentioned in
different models.

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:21,120
The 2011-2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity
is based on 5 main goals,

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,890
including the 20 Aichi targets for Biological
Diversity.

29
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,120
These are the following:
First goal: Address the underlying causes

30
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,819
of biodiversity loss
by mainstreaming biodiversity

31
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:40,620
across government and society.

32
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:48,450
That means increasing awareness
of the value of biodiversity

33
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,680
and its integration into developmental planning,
resource mobilization for the conservation

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,220
of biodiversity,
and the application of sustainable production

35
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,860
and consumption measures.

36
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:15,700
Targets 1 to 4 are part of this goal.

37
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,099
Second goal:
Reduce the direct pressures exerted on biodiversity

38
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:26,459
and promote sustainable use.

39
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,739
This means reducing the degradation and fragmentation
of natural habitats,

40
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,379
managing agricultural resources, forestry
and aquaculture

41
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:43,439
in a sustainable manner,
to reduce pollution and eradicate invasive

42
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:50,680
alien species,
and to maintain wetlands inland, coastal and

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,299
marine.

44
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,319
Targets 5 to 10 are part of that second goal.

45
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:07,280
3rd goal: Improve the status of biodiversity
by safeguarding ecosystems, species, and genetic

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,300
diversity.

47
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,980
This means that well-connected and managed
ecologically representative networks

48
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,850
and protected areas should cover 1/10th of
marine areas

49
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:29,130
and 1/5th of terrestrial areas,
avoiding the extinction of species

50
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,220
and maintaining genetic diversity of useful
domestic species.

51
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,340
This goal covers the targets 11, 12 and 13.

52
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:51,390
4th goal: Enhance the benefits of biodiversity
and ecosystem services.

53
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:58,919
This means that eventually,
ecosystems will provide services essential

54
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:05,150
to man's welfare,
improving carbon storage

55
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,370
and implementing the Nagoya Protocol.

56
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,520
targets 14, 15 and 16 are included in this
fourth goal.

57
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,860
5th goal: Enhance implementation through participatory
planning,

58
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,419
knowledge management and capacity building.

59
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:31,870
This means that by 2020,
we will have the implementation of national

60
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,580
action plans for biodiversity,
the integration of traditional knowledge and

61
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,680
practices
of indigenous and local communities in the

62
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,560
conservation of biological diversity,
and the improvement of scientific and technological

63
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,980
matters.

64
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,070
Targets 17-20 are part of this fifth goal.

65
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,000
The strategic goals are relevant
for the creation, governance, and restoration

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,180
of both protected terrestrial and marine areas.

67
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,759
Of the 20 Aichi objectives, there is one you
should be aware of

68
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:21,270
as it directly affects protected areas, and
that is the objective 11.

69
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,940
It states that by 2020,
at least 17% of terrestrial and inland water,

70
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,820
as well as 10% of coastal and marine areas,
especially areas of particular

71
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,849
importance for biodiversity and ecosystem
services,

72
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:46,470
are conserved through effectively and equitably
managed

73
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,889
ecologically representative and well-connected
systems

74
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,310
of protected areas and other effective area-based
conservation

75
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,860
measures, and integrated into the wider landscape
and seascapes.

76
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:06,660
A set of guides on the Aichi targets have
been developed

77
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,060
to provide parties and other stakeholders
with an introduction to each of the Aichi

78
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:19,629
Biodiversity Targets
by briefly explaining key terms,

79
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:26,860
highlighting the implications for the establishment
of national targets,

80
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,849
by providing ideas for preliminary national
actions,

81
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:42,330
by identifying progress indicators
and identifying additional resources.

82
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,879
These guides are important to consider,
if you need to work on Aichi Targets, do not

83
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,259
miss them.

84
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:55,389
Take for example a directive for target 5
of the Aichi Targets

85
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:01,830
pertaining to biodiversity.

86
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,910
Example directive on Goal 5 of the Aichi targets.

87
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:17,490
Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss
of all natural habitats, including forests,

88
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,020
is at least halved and where feasible, brought
close to zero,

89
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:30,580
and the degradation and fragmentation
is significantly reduced.

90
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:38,710
The guide will help us understand this article
by putting it in context:

91
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,180
Habitat loss, including the degradation and
fragmentation

92
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,700
is the most important factor
in terms of the loss of biodiversity globally.

93
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:58,760
Similarly, slowing and possibly halting
the impoverishment of habitats

94
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,400
is essential for the protection of biodiversity
and maintaining ecosystems essential to human

95
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,290
wellbeing.

96
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,940
Then the guide explains the target:
It applies to every natural habitat including

97
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,160
forests.

98
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,850
Finally, the guide suggests ways to achieve
this target.

99
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:29,750
For example, the rate of loss of natural habitats
must be reduced by at least half and brought

100
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,410
to near zero if possible.

101
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,320
Another example:
The degradation and fragmentation of natural

102
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,710
habitats
should be significantly reduced.

103
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:47,640
Please follow the usefulness of Aichi Targets
with Abdou Salam Kane.

104
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,280
The Aichi targets were developed, based on
an analysis of the benefits

105
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,510
that nature provides in terms of human welfare,
so they go beyond

106
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,420
the mere conservation of biological diversity.

107
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:09,370
The Aichi targets highlight the connectivity
between biodiversity and sustainable development.

108
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,260
The strategic plan of the Aichi objectives
are the essential instruments

109
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,600
which have been negotiated and adopted by
193 Contracting Parties

110
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,150
which gives them a strong legitimacy.

111
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,710
They are an excellent basis for the objectives
of sustainable development.

112
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,070
Other arrangements and agencies part of the
the United Nations system

113
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:36,510
endorsed the Strategic Plan and its objectives,
so as to ensure consistency among these instruments.

114
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,680
So the inclusion of the Aichi targets in the
sustainable development goals

115
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,940
ensure essential international policy coherence
so as to facilitate the implementation and

116
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:53,290
attainment
of different multilateral environmental agreements.

117
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,910
The strategic plans of the Aichi targets
are being implemented through strategies

118
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,040
and national action plans for the conservation
of biodiversity.

119
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,620
Some countries have therefore already included,
or are in the process of including these obligations

120
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,630
in their national planning system
across government departments and sectors

121
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,780
which are the developmental bases in their
country.

122
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,980
These provide institutional infrastructure
and resources

123
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,240
to implement these elements
and then make the expected results for achieving

124
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,170
the objectives
of sustainable development.

125
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,770
The strategic plan and Aichi targets are currently
being implemented

126
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:37,950
through strategies and national plans for
biodiversity.

127
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,740
Some countries have therefore already included,
or are including these obligations

128
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,740
in their national systems,
in various ministries and sectors

129
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,680
thus providing the institutional infrastructure
and resources

130
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,620
to implement these elements
and to report on them.

131
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:10,530
In conclusion, significant progress has been
made

132
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:18,430
in the achievement of most of the Aichi Biodiversity
Targets.

133
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,750
Some elements of the targets,
such as protecting at least 17% of terrestrial

134
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:31,110
and inland water
are well underway.

135
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,930
However, in most cases, these advances are
not enough

136
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:44,310
to achieve the targets set for 2020.

137
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,130
Additional measures are necessary to keep
the 2011-2020

138
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:56,730
strategic plan for biodiversity on track.

139
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,130
The main measures recommended to achieve each
goal

140
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:10,580
are presented in the 4th edition
of the Aichi Targets Passport on biodiversity.

141
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:17,720
Here, the class comes to an end.

142
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,450
The next episode will be the module's conclusion
in the form of a short animation,

143
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,500
and will present this module homework.

144
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:34,060
In the meantime, have an excellent day.
