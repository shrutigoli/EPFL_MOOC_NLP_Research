Hello and welcome to the second module of this MOOC on protected areas management in Africa.
This module covers the specific topic of management planning for protected areas.
So, the module this week is structured as follows: the first lesson will cover actual planning for protected areas, its purpose, how you prepare it, how you implement it, how you assess its effectiveness, who needs to be involved.
The second lesson will look into planning for networks or for protected area systems.
It raises the same questions, but on a different scale: at the national level, regional level or even at an office level.
In the third lesson, we will examine the impact of these different planning methods: the results we obtain and the progress we make.
The fourth lesson will fit the topic of protected areas into a wider context, that of land use planning: what they add and what they endure, how they interact, what to do so that everything works.
The fifth lesson will specifically deal with the topic of transboundary protected areas.
They come with a whole other level of planning and of stakes at play.
The last lesson will cover our weekly agreement and we will talk again about the biological diversity convention.
We will particularly focus on the priorities it currently highlights that are the Aichi targets.
Finally, we will briefly summarise the important aspects mentioned this week through a short animation and we will give you the information for this module's assignment.
That's it.
We hope you have an excellent second week with us.
