00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,950
Hello. 

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,700
Today, we will consider
system and network planning for protected

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,020
areas.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,840
The documents you should look at to complement
this lesson,

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,380
are the IUCN guidelines on system planning.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,670
This document is currently only available
in English.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,430
So, why are we interested in planning protected
areas at this scale?

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,170
Béatrice Chataigner from IUCN PAPACO, based
in Nairobi, will explain it to us.

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,830
It is important to understand today
that natural resources are increasingly in

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,360
demand
and increasingly exploited by the human population

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,430
which is also increasing exponentially.

12
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,100
We therefore need to ration the use of these
natural resources

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,460
so that they can be used sustainably in the
long term;

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,660
this rationed use is needed for all territories,
and, in particular, protected areas, and all

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,670
the more
since the populations most affected by the

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,720
exponential use of these resources
are those that live in the outskirts of these

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
protected areas.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,079
And it is these populations that are the most
vulnerable

19
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,640
and that need these resources to survive from
day to day.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,310
That's something we often hear,
but which natural resources are we actually

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,310
talking about?

22
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,859
Which natural resources are we willing to
protect?

23
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:36,039
Of course, there are exploitable natural resources,
whether they are renewable or not, whether

24
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,780
it is wood, ores, water, fauna...

25
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,950
These exploitable resources are advantageous
mainly

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,770
to those who sell and to those who buy them,
and that's usually a very limited number of

27
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,820
people.

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,389
There are also, all the natural resources
that aren't exploitable

29
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:55,029
and yet that we use every day and that are
beneficial to everyone.

30
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,029
And what are they?

31
00:01:56,029 --> 00:02:01,299
It's the quality of the air we breathe, the
purity of the water we drink,

32
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,810
the fertility of the soil we cultivate,
it's the natural barriers against flooding

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,093
or other climatic events,
and they are extremely important to preserve.

34
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:17,200
This is made possible by these ecosystem services,
and these ecosystem services exist only

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,990
because the ecosystems that produce them are
in good health.

36
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,610
And so, the fundamental tools to keep these
ecosystems healthy,

37
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,400
are actually protected areas and the link
that exists between them,

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,140
to form an effective and relevant network
for protecting these ecosystems on a large

39
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,140
scale.

40
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,060
If we look at the practical aspects rather
than the theoretical ones,

41
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,210
how do we efficiently plan this network of
protected areas

42
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,830
by considering land development issue?

43
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,980
When we mention planning a system of protected
areas,

44
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,450
the procedure we will use is exactly the same
as the one that we will use for single protected

45
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,450
areas.

46
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,680
This means that we will first identify the
values

47
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,730
of the protected area systems.

48
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,200
This happens with all of the interested parties
involved in the system and from that,

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,231
we will be able to determine the pressures
they endure today

50
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:09,320
and those they will endure tomorrow, called
threats.

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,950
From this analysis, we will be able to determine
what we have to do

52
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,981
to thwart these pressures, and therefore,
to preserve these values.

53
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:20,880
This allows us to determine conservation objectives
for protected areas systems,

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,710
and therefore the actions required to reach
these objectives.

55
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,730
Specific tools exist to take into account
these aspects,

56
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,160
for example, the gap analysis approach that
you can read about.

57
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,110
It allows to identify the key ecosystems
and the possible connections between these

58
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,110
ecosystems.

59
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,300
It therefore means we can determine what we
need to prioritise

60
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,830
in terms of conservation through the protected
areas network.

61
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,820
It's fascinating, but to be honest, it's a
bit complicated.

62
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,370
I asked Lacina to briefly explain all of this
to us.

63
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:59,480
The way that we produce, what we call a gap
analysis

64
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,520
allows us to compare the appropriateness of
the distribution of protected areas

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,440
and of the distribution of the key biodiversity
areas

66
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,340
to be preserved in the territory.

67
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:21,500
By compiling the available data on biodiversity,
we can then identify the biodiversity areas

68
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,460
based on vulnerability and irreplaceability
criteria.

69
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,590
What makes a site irreplaceable is its unique
character,

70
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,020
this means no other site can play the same
conservation role

71
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,240
as that site in that territory.

72
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,930
A site or a species' vulnerability
is linked to the threats that that site or

73
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,740
that species endure
and that are in danger of making them disappear

74
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,120
definitively
if the sites or species are not protected.

75
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,900
Then, we superimpose this key biodiversity
areas network

76
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,440
and the current protected areas network to
map the gaps,

77
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,780
i.e. the key biodiversity areas that are not
yet included

78
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,830
in the protected areas network.

79
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:22,780
Finally, we just need to prioritise the required
actions to fill the gaps

80
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,340
and to formalise them into a national conservation
strategy.

81
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,960
This will allow us to adjust the national
protected areas networks

82
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,600
based on the gap analysis results.

83
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,669
You've understood correctly; this approach
means

84
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,940
we reflect on the protected areas network
to then eventually be able to modify it

85
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,000
depending on conservation priorities.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,020
All of this will be reflected on maps, like
Lacina told us.

87
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,340
Let's take the example of Cameroon.

88
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,889
Let's overlap various maps taken from the
Forest Atlas of Cameroon

89
00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:00,010
where first of all, we see here the country's
vegetative coverage,

90
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,260
and then the different types of forests established
in Cameroon.

91
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,790
For example, the forest reserves, here in
light green,

92
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,220
the community forests that I am circling in
red,

93
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,740
the communal forests here in brown, that have
just been added.

94
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,930
Let's then add the protected areas network
which is quite familiar to us,

95
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,840
here is the Dja River, the Faro River, Bénoué,
Bouba Ndjida, etc.

96
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,210
Let's add the active logging zones over the
top,

97
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,560
and there are a lot of them.

98
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,389
You can see them here in brown,
and then, for example, the hunting zones

99
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,430
that we see here in orange.

100
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,620
These territories, hunting zones or logging
zones,

101
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,330
bear witness to the use of the territory in
relation to nature.

102
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,180
Finally, we can also, for example,
consider all the mining permits that exist

103
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,550
currently in the country.

104
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,290
So, if we overlayed all of that on the key
biodiversity areas,

105
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,419
we could finally draw a coherent protected
areas network

106
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:07,920
that takes into account, not only the ecological
stakes,

107
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,340
but also the main pressures like those we
have just seen.

108
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:18,139
We will therefore be more prepared
to address this country's conservation challenge.

109
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:23,790
This process must obviously be participatory
and must take into account all of the participants

110
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,360
connected to the management of protected areas
near and far.

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,889
The main difficulty is actually to have, at
the same time,

112
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,960
all of the data needed to decide where the
priorities are

113
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,740
and to gather together all the people in on
place

114
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,010
to take these decisions.

115
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:45,889
Gap analysis is therefore a powerful tool
to determine a network, to draw it and build

116
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:48,699
it,
or at least it is in theory.

117
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,110
But once this network exists,
how can we evaluate how it functions and eventually

118
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,080
its efficiency?

119
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,509
Once the protected areas network is under
way

120
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:03,410
and that the system has been launched, we
have another question to answer:

121
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,590
are we really achieving the goals we wanted
to

122
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,190
by implementing this network
in terms of the conservation of the country's

123
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,960
ecosystems?

124
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,780
To know whether or not we manage it, we'll
put in place

125
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,170
a monitoring and evaluation system of the
network management actions.

126
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,280
Some tools exist to do this, like RAPAM, for
example,

127
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,980
which allow us to understand this efficiency.

128
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,610
RAPAM has been implemented
by protected area management agencies themselves,

129
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,130
and it allows them to regularly monitor their
protected areas system

130
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,909
and therefore to gradually correct it.

131
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,210
There are also other monitoring and evaluation
tools

132
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:42,910
that exist for protected areas,
but they are more tools for just one site.

133
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,830
It's therefore another approach, where other
participants are called upon

134
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,150
to evaluate the efficiency of this management.

135
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:56,250
To summarize, a protected area obviously only
protects

136
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,100
part of the ecosystems that are necessary
to insure

137
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,310
that all of the values of a territory are
preserved.

138
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,180
We therefore need to develop representative
and comprehensive systems

139
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,790
just as the Convention on Biological Diversity
asks us to do

140
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,820
through the conservation targets they have
set,

141
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,520
the famous Aichi Targets,
that we will look into at the end of this

142
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,450
course.

143
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,950
We see an interesting example in the marine
protected area network

144
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,180
that was developed on the Atlantic side of
Africa.

145
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,440
We already know Charlotte Karibuhoye who is
one of the key players

146
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,430
of this network and will quickly tell us
about how the network developed and how it

147
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,920
works today.

148
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,670
RAMPAO is the Regional Marine Protected Area
Network for West Africa.

149
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,560
The network has given itself the mission
to maintain a coherent entity,

150
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,960
for the critical ecosystems that are important
for the ecological processes to function.

151
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,080
This is to preserve biodiversity,
but also to insure that the legacy

152
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,630
and the associated ecosystem services are
maintained.

153
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,870
So, just like I said, it's a network that
hopes to cover

154
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,320
the West African marine ecoregion that covers
seven countries

155
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,770
in the West African sub-region.

156
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:19,880
So there's Mauritania, Senegal,
Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea,

157
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,350
Sierra Leone and Cape Verde islands.

158
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,790
This network therefore tries to finally combine
all of the sites

159
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,850
that have already been developed into marine
protected areas.

160
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,160
There is therefore a bio-geographical or - physical
aspect, if you prefer -

161
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,380
but there is also a human aspect, because
it gathers people,

162
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:50,020
representatives, managers from all these sites
that are therefore members of

163
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:56,120
that network.

164
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,620
The Regional Marine Protected Area Network
RAMPAO

165
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,770
has been set up within the PRCM framework.

166
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:08,360
PRCM is the Regional Program for Coastal and
Marine Conservation in Western Africa,

167
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,490
now known as the Regional Partnership for
Coastal and Marine Conservation.

168
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,850
RAMPAO was therefore created after a long
consultation process

169
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,950
between different participants
because the participants noticed they shared

170
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,810
many of the same problems,
and the same challenges

171
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,780
in terms of preserving marine and coastal
resources.

172
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,770
They shared a lot of cross-border habitats.

173
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,870
It is also noticeable that there are migratory
species

174
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,500
that cross the borders.

175
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,950
So we see that finally even, for example,
the users, the fishers

176
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,370
don't necessarily respect the political boundaries.

177
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,300
The participants from these countries thought
that there needs to be a joint approach to

178
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:57,720
be able to battle these problems.

179
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,140
From 2002, there were therefore several meetings,
several...consultations...

180
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,459
Namely, in 2004, 2005, and 2006, there were
specific meetings

181
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,529
for the managers of the marine protected areas
to think of goals and think about how the

182
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,500
network would work.

183
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,670
And all of this culminated in 2007 when the
network was officially created

184
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,959
during the consultative assembly
in Cape Verde in April 2007.

185
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,680
And so, we see that, today also,
this network was able to also gain political

186
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,140
recognition,
since there was a regional strategy for marine

187
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,149
protected areas.

188
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:39,720
This was established in 2002 and was officially
approved

189
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,589
by the ministers in charge of the protected
areas,

190
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:47,680
of fishing and of the environment in those
countries.

191
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:59,920
They signed a general policy declaration
that emphasized the importance of this network.

192
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,870
The advantages of the Regional Marine Protected
Area Network

193
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,930
for preserving MPAs are numerous.

194
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,450
We can organise them into two different groups.

195
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,380
I see it that we can have a group called "the
social benefits"

196
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,910
and a group simply called "the ecological
benefits".

197
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,430
I'm using the term social because we are referring
to human beings.

198
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,750
I'm particularly meaning strengthening abilities
of the managers

199
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,670
of marine protected areas since the network
was able to implement

200
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,740
a series of activities for strengthening abilities
in key areas

201
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,820
that are very important for preserving marine
protected areas.

202
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,350
This is mainly in terms of management plans,
the development of management plans,

203
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,000
the development of business plans, marine
supervision,

204
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,440
which is important for marine protected areas
of course,

205
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,890
and the issue of shared governance.

206
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,670
All of these are questions that really were
addressed

207
00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:01,880
in a systematic manner to train the managers
of these marine protected areas in these domains.

208
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,760
But there are also the exchanges, the mutual
reinforcement,

209
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
there is particularly the economies of scale.

210
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,050
This means that, finally, instead of each
country or each site

211
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,310
organising training,
there are training sessions that will benefit

212
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,839
many people.

213
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,529
But there is also the fact that the network
was able to represent,

214
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:26,649
at a national and an international level,
the needs of the marine protected areas

215
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:30,060
of the sub-region, and really make known the
progress

216
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,010
but also the challenges that the marine protected
areas face.

217
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,180
At an ecological level, I think it is completely
obvious,

218
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,350
this network today covers almost 5 million
acres

219
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,160
of marine and, of course, coastal areas.

220
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,430
Over half of it is in fact maritime.

221
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:55,730
Then, there are 27 sites that are protected
and that are members of the network.

222
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,070
There were projects before the creation of
the network

223
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,190
that showed the link, the connectivity that
exists

224
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,470
between these different sites.

225
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,019
So the network finally contributes to protecting
species

226
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,490
that need all of these sites to develop.

227
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,550
There are species that are born in one site,
that develop in another, and that will reproduce

228
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,970
elswhere.

229
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:26,600
All of these species benefit from
this network.

230
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,040
There are also some important ecological processes:
species migration, larval dispersion...

231
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,360
All of these are benefits that this network
is offering.

232
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,700
But there is also an issue that is topical
at the moment,

233
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,329
we're talking a lot these days about climate
change

234
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:52,120
and like me, you know that healthy ecosystems
are more resilient to climate change.

235
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,339
So the network allows, on one hand, to preserve
a sample of healthy ecosystems

236
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:02,300
but also, as a network,
it can preserve several samples from the same

237
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,870
ecosystem,
from the same habitat.

238
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,680
This means that if anything were to ever disturb
a site,

239
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,800
it still has the ability to be resilient.

240
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,200
That resilience is maintained
thanks to several samples existing from that

241
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,269
same habitat.

242
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:25,300
All that is to basically say
that this network has very clear and very

243
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,510
obvious ecological benefits,
that we will have to, of course, I think,

244
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:37,270
measure and quantify
in a much more systematic manner.

245
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,889
Consider the protected areas networks
that you know of on a country or region scale

246
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:46,460
like RAMPAO
that Charlotte has just spoken to us about.

247
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,060
Are they complete, are they logical?

248
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,180
What were the important aspects in forming
the network?

249
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
Are they simply opportunistic?

250
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,600
It happens.

251
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,750
Do they meet the objectives we have just mentioned?

252
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,630
There we go, that's the end of this lesson.

253
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,459
The next video will look into following up
on results

254
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,620
and the impacts of planning.

255
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,549
Have a brilliant day!
