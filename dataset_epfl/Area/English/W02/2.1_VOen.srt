Hello and welcome to the second module
of this MOOC on protected areas management

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,280
in Africa.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,950
This module covers the specific topic of management
planning for protected areas.

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,270
So, the module this week is structured as
follows:

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,860
the first lesson will cover
actual planning for protected areas,

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,970
its purpose, how you prepare it, how you implement
it,

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,550
how you assess its effectiveness, who needs
to be involved.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,140
The second lesson will look into planning
for networks

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,600
or for protected area systems.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,210
It raises the same questions, but on a different
scale:

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,280
at the national level, regional level or even
at an office level.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,760
In the third lesson, we will examine the impact
of these different planning methods:

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,030
the results we obtain and the progress we
make.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,360
The fourth lesson will fit the topic of protected
areas

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,690
into a wider context,
that of land use planning:

16
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,720
what they add and what they endure,
how they interact, what to do so that everything

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,450
works.

18
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,250
The fifth lesson will specifically deal with
the topic

19
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,990
of transboundary protected areas.

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,610
They come with a whole other level of planning
and of stakes at play.

21
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,390
The last lesson will cover our weekly agreement
and we will talk again

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,610
about the biological diversity convention.

23
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,560
We will particularly focus on the priorities
it currently highlights

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,980
that are the Aichi targets.

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,030
Finally, we will briefly summarise
the important aspects mentioned this week

26
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,250
through a short animation
and we will give you the information for this

27
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,950
module's assignment.

28
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,560
That's it.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,760
We hope you have an excellent second week
with us.
