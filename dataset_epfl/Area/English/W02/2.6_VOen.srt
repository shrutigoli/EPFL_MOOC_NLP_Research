00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,040
Hello. 

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,000
Today, we will talk about transboundary protected
areas.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,699
This will help show some of the aspects
on how to plan protected areas and their outskirts

4
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,810
that we have studied in this module.

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,119
The reference book for this class is the guidelines
of

6
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:39,940
the World Commission on Protected Areas,
on transboundary conservation.

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,780
First of all, a transboundary protected area
is a protected area.

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,960
It is therefore a territory dedicated to nature's
conservation.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,019
We can see here a map of the regional area
W, spread across three countries

10
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:56,479
- Burkina, Niger and Benin - and formed by
three parks

11
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:03,600
that have the same name, and are all of category
2.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,820
A transboundary protected area is specific
in that it spreads beyond

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,400
a national border, so there is no more separation
between the countries involved.

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,609
Therefore, the flow of people and animals
are usually freely possible.

15
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:25,640
We are going from managing each park separately
to creating an area with a relatively shared

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,340
management.

17
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,000
We might - roughly- see three types of transboundary
areas.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,549
The ones that gather two adjacent protected
areas

19
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:50,390
- I draw them here as an example -
These protected areas are then simply separated

20
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,920
by a border.

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,150
These are transboundary protected areas.

22
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,799
For example,
The W,that we just studied, evolves toward

23
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,049
this pattern.

24
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,520
Another type of transboundary protected area
gathers

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:21,700
two or several protected areas connected by
territories of another status;

26
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:28,930
this complex is called a transboundary conservation
landscape.

27
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,629
The W parks are a good example, because they
are transboundary parks

28
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:37,010
that are connected to other parks - such as
Pendjari, Arly's park etc -

29
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:45,560
by territories
of another status:

30
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,290
reserves, hunting areas, and pastoralism areas.

31
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,620
It all shapes a landscape called the "W Arly
Pendjari",

32
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,550
named after the main parks it's composed by.

33
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,879
Such as the the combination named KAZA, which
stands for Kavango Zambezi,

34
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,940
in Southern Africa that spreads out over several
countries - Namibia, Angola,

35
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,180
Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana - and is composed
of certain

36
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,670
famous parks such as Chobe in Botswana Kafue
in Zambia

37
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,550
or Hwange in Zimbabwe.

38
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,250
All these territories which are parks, are
connected through other areas

39
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,500
of different status, and shape this transboundary
landscape

40
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,890
which is delineated by the white line here
and that is obviously huge.

41
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:46,480
The
third type of transboundary protected area

42
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,250
gathers different territories,
some of which are protected - but not all

43
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,519
of them are -
and that are necessary to maintain migrations

44
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,019
of certain species,
for example here, zebras or wildebeest in

45
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,200
Eastern Africa.

46
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,609
In that case, it's more a transboundary conservation
area rather than

47
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:14,099
a transboundary protected area strictly speaking.

48
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,220
Having several countries working together
for conservation makes sense

49
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,560
when we know that a third of important biodiversity
areas

50
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,720
straddle at least one border.

51
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Over 300 transboundary parks are now formally
established in the world,

52
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:39,050
such as here the big Limpopo that connects
Southern Africa and Mozambique.

53
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,530
Trans-national collaboration is a logical
necessity, when, for example,

54
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,910
we look at a species like the lesser flamingos
that migrate between

55
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,950
Kenyan lakes in the Rift valley but reproduce
in Tanzania.

56
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,570
All of them.

57
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,100
Working on one side of the border without
looking at the other side

58
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,910
wouldn’t make sense in that case.

59
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,560
Collaboration of parks beyond borders
helps spreading the collectively protected

60
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,110
surface area,
developing shared activities, such as patrols

61
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,830
against poaching,
or improving the overall park resilience and

62
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:16,500
its capacity to adapt to change.

63
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,210
Brice is giving us the example
of TNS in Central Africa.

64
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,930
TNS gathers a few protected areas, three national
parks of category 2,

65
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,310
between Congo, Cameroun and CAR.

66
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,040
We already have seen the progress:
an anti-poaching squad was created by the

67
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,210
three states,
protocols about free movement of TNS employees

68
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,930
were written,
and there is an eco-toursim tour.

69
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,410
Not to omit the FTNS fund
that was created to finance activities at

70
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:56,940
the three transboundary desks,
like in RCA, Cameroun.

71
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,790
Also, cross-border collaboration helps make
a location more attractive

72
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,180
and grow its economic potential; for example,
for tourism or other

73
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,770
economic activities.

74
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,740
We can see here Mara's plains connected to
Serengeti.

75
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,780
Even though there isn't a transboundary collaboration
yet,

76
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,320
the ecosystem is overall important.

77
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,190
Off course, establishing transboundary collaborations
happens to be relatively

78
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,930
complicated, because it demands high level
agreements, between governments

79
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,420
of different countries.

80
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,440
Also, after a concrete collaboration
on the field, between protected areas

81
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,220
from each side of the borders.

82
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,740
The challenge is to build transboundary governance
systems

83
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,260
that are operational.

84
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,700
The model has been developed
in Southern Africa, as we see here, around

85
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:57,650
the TFCA that stands for
Transfontier Conservation Areas.

86
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:03,340
We can see here the KAZA,
that we studied five minutes ago.

87
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,500
Sometimes, the idea that
these territories might reinforce peace between

88
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,380
countries
triggered the creation of such areas.

89
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,950
These are the famous "Peace Parks",
that have developed between several countries

90
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,020
of this district.

91
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,850
They helped connecting wide conservation territories,
reopening the crossings for animals and bringing

92
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,910
human closer - in theory.

93
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,650
We can see here the opening of big Limpopo,
of which we talked -

94
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,790
between Southern Africa and Mozambique- by
Nelson Mandela in 2001.

95
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:41,880
In francophone Africa, the movement isn't
that advanced but begins to take shape.

96
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,960
The W example is interesting, and is briefly
introduced

97
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,890
by Pierre Kafando, who was the W conservator
in Burkina

98
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,410
during a few years.

99
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,560
The W regional park is well protected.

100
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,850
It overlaps three borders
of three states: Benin, Burkina and Niger.

101
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,040
This area was specifically created to protect
and maintain

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,620
biodiversity, and associated national and
cultural resources.

103
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,560
The park spreads out over a 10 300 km2 area
and

104
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:26,340
is part of one of the biggest protected system
of African savannah: the W-Arly-Pendjari complex.

105
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,860
The W regional park was created during the
colonial period, which is

106
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,269
when these three countries belonged to the
territory

107
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,130
of French West Africa.

108
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,370
The area of the W was poorly populated
because of the tsetse fly, that gives sleeping

109
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,470
sickness,
and other diseases such as osteoporosis We

110
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:54,310
can add to this
the richness of the area wild fauna.

111
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:03,589
It's only in 1927 that it was classified as
a sanctuary park.

112
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:08,660
Between 1952 and 1953
the High Commissioner of the Republic, general

113
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,730
governor of West Africa,
signed national by-laws, making this sanctuary

114
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,890
park
a state classified forest and a wildlife reserve.

115
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,819
One of the challenges of this collaboration
is the reinforcement of regional

116
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:27,089
integration through the theme: conservation,
management

117
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,269
and appreciation of biodiversity.

118
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,300
For the W regional park, this appreciation
goes though tourism

119
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,550
development, some products exploitation, acknowledged
as common right

120
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,310
by the resident communities, and handcraft,
agricultural and

121
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,730
socio-cultural activities on the outskirts.

122
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,420
The socio-economic advantages are: revenues
to the states,

123
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,199
especially public funds, private operators,
tourist camps

124
00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:00,290
guides and managers, hunt guides in the ouskirts
zones,

125
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:08,220
and outskirts communities, organized as associations.

126
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,670
There is also the reinforcement of the stakeholder's
capacity:

127
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,129
touristic guides, hotels camps managers, and
collaboration between populations

128
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:18,779
on each side of the borders.

129
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:25,560
There were travels, people who helped organize,
which also helped

130
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,069
diminish the conflict about the use of resources
and trades

131
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:31,749
in these communities.

132
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:39,620
Finally, there is the populations
participation to different land-use and monitoring

133
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,209
activities,
which allow the empowerment but also appropriation

134
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:51,670
of activities, and generates revenues.

135
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,970
That's the end of the class, next episode
will be about the

136
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:01,009
Aïchi targets, linked to the Convention on
Biological Diversity.
