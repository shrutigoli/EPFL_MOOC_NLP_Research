00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:05,170
This module allowed us to understand how much
the planning of protected areas 

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,330
is an important tool that allows
protected areas to achieve their conservation

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,150
purpose.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,780
To be effective, the planning must follow
a consistent approach,

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,830
simple and universal.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,420
The goal is to evaluate the values of the
protected areas

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,980
and the pressure they are up against,
and then define a vision and goals

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,570
that we wish to attain to preserve those values
in the long term.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,909
The organization of management activities
will then follow naturally.

10
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:39,219
Two rules, among others are necessary.

11
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,519
The planning must be done in a participatory
manner,

12
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:45,530
including all stakeholders, in and around
the protected area,

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,280
but it should also be implemented directly
by those

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:59,429
who will put it in practice and not just outsourced
to experts.

15
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:03,589
Whatever the scale,
around one protected areas or an entire network,

16
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:08,700
or even more in cases including regions combining
both development and preservation,

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,280
this approach will stay the same,
determining first the values and then their

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,869
conservation.

19
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,539
Of course, the stakeholders involved in the
process will be different people.

20
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:29,860
For a given site, it will be all the actors
directly influencing the area and its surroundings:

21
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,609
the managers, the communities, the private
sector.

22
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:40,409
For a good network of protected areas, there
should be a detailed consultation,

23
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,729
and the planning will be based
on an analysis of the shortcomings at the

24
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,280
national level
to determine the key zones

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,670
to protect and preserve the biodiversity in
its fullness

26
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:57,340
as well as the connectivity between these
areas.

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,520
The network will try to include all management
categories,

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,829
and all kinds of forms of governance to be
more efficient.

29
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:11,310
Lastly, for the integrated planning of a land
in its entirety,

30
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,319
a judicious development should be chosen
which will allow to protect resources in the

31
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,110
long run
while taking into account the inhabitant's

32
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,400
needs.

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,349
Thus, the planning will involve all of the
participants

34
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:34,400
in the development and land-use planning of
the concerned area.

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,190
The monitoring of the protected areas is a
decisive part of the planning.

36
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,120
A wise choice is needed from the start of
which indicators to measure

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,790
to be able to evaluate the impact on the management
actions.

38
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,730
Those indicators, measured during the implementation
of the management plan, will allow us

39
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,150
to understand what works and what doesn't,
and adjust the actions along the way.

40
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:11,180
It's a
repetitive process called adaptive management.

41
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,799
This monitoring will have three essential
functions:

42
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,329
guide the manager, as previously explained,
fully inform the decision-makers

43
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:23,890
and raise the awareness of the stakeholders
concerned about the management of the protected

44
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,040
area.

45
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,140
Finally, the Convention on Biologic Diversity
allows us

46
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,980
to plan for conservation on a global scale
by fixing quantifiable targets, like Aïchi

47
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,989
targets;
it helps us define conservation strategies

48
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,200
for each nation,
to building protected areas networks

49
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,000
which will include all the important ecosystems
present on Earth.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,540
That's it, you can now starts the test of
this module.
