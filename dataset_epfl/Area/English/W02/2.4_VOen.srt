1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,240
Hello.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,740
This sequence will be on monitoring results
and management planning.

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,920
First, we will go over different principles
of monitoring,

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,430
its definition, its role,
the different types and levels of monitoring,

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,970
who takes part and conducts them.

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:33,399
Then we will spend a few minutes on
two points in particular, a bit more innovative.

7
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,610
I have chosen an example of
participatory monitoring and one example of

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,750
a monitoring chart.

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,579
Let's look at this together.

10
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,840
What is monitoring?

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,309
It's a regular observation over time
of the same elements, on the same sites so

12
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,620
that one can follow and measure
the long-term evolution of these elements.

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:01,949
Usually, in relation to a reference condition
established in advance.

14
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,240
Allow me to emphasize important
words in this definition

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,680
First of all: regular.

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,080
Same elements, same sites, to measure the
evolution in the long run.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,600
These elements are important.

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,079
These mean that monitoring cannot be improvised.

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,060
It must be planned and organized.

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,670
It requires financing, competence
and long-term commitment.

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:33,079
Let's take a look at the reasoning behind
and the use of this monitoring.

22
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,630
The results are important for a number of
stakeholders.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,450
As you can see here, monitoring has 3 essential
functions:

24
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:48,670
To guide the managers, to adapt, adjust,
evaluate and prepare the next management plan.

25
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,729
It's in this case
a feedback process towards the different departments

26
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:55,830
and functionalities of the protected area.

27
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,880
Secondly, to inform more extensively the decision-makers
and the backers.

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,260
These means providing feedback to the board
of directors, to the donors,

29
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,030
who will ask questions like "What's the use
of the protected area?"

30
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,020
"What's its purpose?" or "How are things going
in your area?"

31
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,390
Here we are looking for elements of efficiency,
performance, elements

32
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,940
about the site's value and impacting measures.

33
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,940
Finally, monitoring has a role in raising
awareness.

34
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,170
The goal is to inform all of the actors contributing
to the management of the protected area.

35
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,910
It's an effort of communication and appropriation.

36
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,250
It is then necessary to build upon the information
by using

37
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,410
communication and organization tools: debriefing
meetings,

38
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,890
brochures like this one, to inform all the
stakeholders.

39
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,820
I would like to emphasize the 2 levels of
monitoring that I think are important:

40
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,770
the first one is the monitoring of management
efficiency

41
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,010
and of the management plan implementation.

42
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,240
Here we need to identify if the management
plan

43
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,230
is correctly executed, if its goals are met,
if its progress is appropriate,

44
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,850
at what level of financial efficiency and
effectiveness of means,

45
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,740
we need to learn from its implementation,
the processes underway,

46
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,590
from what worked and what didn't work.

47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,090
At what point the management cycle failed
or succeeded.

48
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,780
It is also about adapting the management's
decisions

49
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,040
when problems occur in the implementation.

50
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,220
Monitoring can be used to redistribute resources
and efforts

51
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,700
differently to improve the implementation.

52
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,450
Note that these issues will be studied more
in detail in the sequence 4.2.

53
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,230
The second level is about monitoring impacts
and the site's evolution.

54
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,910
This monitoring of course is also linked to
the previous one but it has

55
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,490
specific characteristics that I would like
to point out.

56
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,230
It goes further than the previous one.

57
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,400
We take into account, if possible
the impacts of the management, but also the

58
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,480
evolution of the context, threats
and changes in the environment.

59
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,239
This kind of monitoring goes further
in the evaluation of the results and in protecting

60
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,239
the site.

61
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,229
It also intends to study the changes taking
place.

62
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,120
Different types of
impacts monitoring can be implemented.

63
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,550
Firstly biological and ecological monitoring
which will measure the health

64
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,690
of the environment; for example the reef,
the species population,

65
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,879
and biodiversity.

66
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,849
Sequence 4.4 will bring you more on this subject,
such as how to conduct ecological monitoring,

67
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,090
etc.

68
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,100
Very important but rarely used:
socioeconomic monitoring,

69
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,590
which allows the measuring of the socioeconomic
status

70
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,389
of communities living inside or outside of
the protected areas.

71
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,800
This allows to identify usage of space and
resources,

72
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,520
actors' perception, pressure and improvements
brought

73
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,919
by the protected areas on the quality of life,
economic health and well-being of the populations.

74
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:17,080
Of course, most of the time we also study
some iconic species: turtles, some mammals,

75
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,229
birds,
representative of the protected area.

76
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:23,780
Lastly, I think that it is also important
to emphasize

77
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,860
the monitoring of some activities relevant
to the protected area.

78
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,340
For example, in the case of an AMP,
we will keep an eye on fishing activity.

79
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,270
In other protected areas, touristic activities
are important.

80
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,669
Who will conduct those studies?

81
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:41,350
Who will monitor them?

82
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,880
Generally, these studies are conducted by
scientists,

83
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,659
managers and by the park staff.

84
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:50,009
Sometimes with the help of the populations.

85
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:52,580
We will talk about this more later.

86
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:59,009
Note that some of these monitoring activities
require some very scientific methods.

87
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:04,620
Most of the time, the monitoring must be thorough,
and done in a consistent way.

88
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,789
This requires important financial resources
and sophisticated skills.

89
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:14,090
Other times, it needs to be suitable for a
less knowledgeable public.

90
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,630
The level and quality of information will
therefore

91
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,820
substantially change, and so will its purpose.

92
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,969
One needs to manage these different levels,
the different capabilities of the protected

93
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:28,389
area,
and the funding available.

94
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,729
I will now present two examples of monitoring
with different approaches:

95
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:38,740
first, an example of participatory monitoring,
which will involve communities, and then a

96
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,430
second
example that will focus on the restitution

97
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,740
and communication of the results.

98
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,820
For this first example, we will look at an
example of participatory monitoring.

99
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,099
Again, note that the scientific method must
be thorough,

100
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:59,650
but in this case, a large part of the work
is given to the communities.

101
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:05,550
Here, in this example in West Africa,
these women have been trained

102
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,610
and asked to conduct the monitoring of shellfish.

103
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,370
Note that the implementation of such a task
is interesting

104
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,630
to mobilize communities,
to strengthen their relation to their surroundings.

105
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:23,180
It can also be less expensive, but be wary,
it's not always the case.

106
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,349
Note also that this method usually requires
more time

107
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:30,560
because of the training and
the supervisory staff needed.

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,330
I would advise you to study this document
wich is entitled: "Guide de suivi participatif

109
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,879
des coquillages exploités en Afrique de l'ouest"
for a more detailed explanation.

110
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:54,690
$$(Jingling sound from the shells in the bucket)
Sorting by size is carried out for each bucket.

111
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,339
Sorting is done thanks to a column of sieves
and there are 13 buckets,

112
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:05,610
12 of which have holes which vary between
.5 and 6cm.

113
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,059
The last one traps remainders.

114
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:11,969
$$(The woman is counting out loud)
Numbers in each bucket are logged

115
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:16,699
and the data analyzed
so as to obtain figures on population density,

116
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:20,680
average size
and population structure.

117
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,110
For this second focus,
I would like to introduce you to an initiative

118
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,219
from
l'Agence Française des Aires Marines Protégées,

119
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,930
which has been producing monitoring charts
for some years now.

120
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,409
Let me remind you again that the principles
used for this monitoring

121
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,980
are the same as those given at the beginning
of this session:

122
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,370
thoroughness, method and consistency.

123
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:55,440
Here we have a rather interesting example
of

124
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,250
a restitution.

125
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,500
This tool has been developed thanks to a partnership
between the managers,

126
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,560
scientific associates, communities and in
partnership with

127
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,750
several marine protected areas.

128
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,570
Note that this tool is very useful
in a communication process.

129
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,700
It's very visual.

130
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,040
All of the data is gathered.

131
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,760
Therefore we have a dashboard with the evolution
of all the factors.

132
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,120
The graphical aspect makes it easy to follow.

133
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,060
This allows for an easier way to communicate
with all audiences.

134
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,730
What is also interesting in this example
is that the monitoring has been done on 2

135
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,970
levels:
on both the scale of a single protected area,

136
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,260
and of a network of protected areas,
to provide some degree of consistency.

137
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,140
In summary, I would like to insist on some
aspects of this monitoring.

138
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,440
First there is a strong concern in measuring
the management impacts.

139
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,930
For that reason, what we just saw, biological
monitorings,

140
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,100
and socioeconomic monitoring are very important,
even if they are not often used and if they

141
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,060
need a lot of resources.

142
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,440
Please also note that several levels of monitoring
are generally put in place

143
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,330
in protected areas: the monitoring of species,
the monitoring of management indicators,

144
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,970
the monitoring of the general context, the
monitoring of global impacts;

145
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,120
all of this implies
a strong and efficient coordination and sometimes

146
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,300
a prioritization,
due to means and resources not always being

147
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
available.

148
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,240
Finally, note in summary the need to build
up on the monitoring.

149
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,490
It's not enough to have all the data,
you need to also analyze and communicate these

150
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,050
results
to all the parties involved.

151
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:53,380
You should not hesitate to use graphic tools,
charts, visual tools to render this information.

152
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:59,780
That's it, this sequence is completed, have
a nice day!
