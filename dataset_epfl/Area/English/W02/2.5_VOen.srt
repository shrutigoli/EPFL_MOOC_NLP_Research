1
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,500
- Hello, Paul!

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,180
- Hello, Geoffroy!

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,460
Hello everyone.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,680
Today's class will address overall land use
planning.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,710
Earlier we saw how to do the planning for
one area,

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,770
or even a network of areas.

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,610
Now we'll scale it up, expand it,
and we'll focus on the entire land

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,150
where the protected area is located.

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,870
Paul NDiaye, who we'll meet in the next module
on governance,

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,860
will help clarify this for us.

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,210
When it comes to conservation,
each country must set a clear direction

12
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,160
for the management of their natural resources,
in light of the international rules to which

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,719
they are subject.

14
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,920
Specialized agencies, like the Ministry of
Water and Forests,

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,820
or that of National Parks,
are given the task to develop an overall plan

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:16,189
once all matters of governance are resolved.

17
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:22,689
We'll discuss this later, in a module on governance.

18
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:29,960
It's true that, today, national land use planning
is largely dependent on international conventions.

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,969
For example, the Convention on Biological
Diversity

20
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,799
which I spoke of in Module 1,
the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands,

21
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:45,630
or the Aichi Biodiversity Targets which we'll
soon discuss.

22
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:53,009
These conventions set priorities and commitments
via national biodiversity strategies,

23
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:59,479
which act as guidelines for land use planning,
while placing special importance on protected

24
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,450
areas.

25
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,409
Okay.

26
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:07,600
So,
overall planning organizes the sharing and

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,850
use
of resources and spaces,

28
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:18,700
and eventually, their conservation.

29
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:28,360
We'll consider two important elements:
the pillars of planning, and the benefits

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,920
of conservation.

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,550
The pillars on which all planning
should be based are these three principles:

32
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:46,310
legality, quality of the state;
legitimacy, as recognized by local communities;

33
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:52,020
and the partnership with
all parties who may be concerned or affected.

34
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:59,180
These principles are relatively hard to reconcile,
yet they are essential.

35
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:07,360
The benefits lie in conservation itself,
the final goal of planning,

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,500
as well as, of course, the benefit to local
communities,

37
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:18,120
who must be the natural beneficiaries
in the context of the sound use of resources.

38
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,230
Yes, exactly!

39
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,640
Integrated overall planning,
if well executed,

40
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,540
will begin by focusing on five points which
in part prevent

41
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,720
any conflict of interest or skills which might
arise.

42
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,800
We must also think about these spaces in a
holistic way,

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,820
taking into account the perspectives of all
those who use them.

44
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,990
Planning should not emphasize separations,
which are often artificial,

45
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,600
but on the contrary, create links.

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,510
For example, let's consider coastlines,
which may at first appear, wrongfully,

47
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,710
to be discontinuous territories.

48
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:08,180
The "maritimization" of territory:
this option consolidates defined land-use

49
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,950
strategies
with a concern for their extension into marine

50
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,480
waters.

51
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:22,150
This results in the creation of Marine Protected
Areas (MPAs),

52
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,289
consistent with conservation measures taken
onshore.

53
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:33,000
The territorialization of marine spaces: some,
such as fishermen,

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,789
do not recognize the control of marine areas
which inevitably leads to the depletion of

55
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:45,349
fish stocks.

56
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:51,970
Marine protected areas were developed in response,
as in Kayar, Senegal, that we can in this

57
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,970
photo.

58
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,270
Onshore territories have a tendency to extend
offshore,

59
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,360
particularly when adjacent to protected marine
areas,

60
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,729
and vice versa.

61
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:09,409
The influence of marine areas extends
well into the interior,

62
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:18,330
in that an overall holistic plan
must be based on the reciprocal link

63
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,830
between the two elements: land and sea.

64
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,900
Let's take a quick look at how this planning
works,

65
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,819
which normally involves several stages
which can be mapped out as follows.

66
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:38,499
Once the principles and overall approach are
agreed upon,

67
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:45,909
then planning operations may begin,
which normally involve several stages

68
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,910
which can be mapped out as follows.

69
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,610
Identifying the function of the spaces in
question.

70
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:06,889
First, the management zoning scheme:
integral or specific protection zone;

71
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:18,770
Next, the establishment of governance bodies,
and finally, establishment of managing bodies.

72
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,969
Depending on local context and urgency,
this process can go through more or less important

73
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,939
changes.

74
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:33,719
Seascapes are not yet humanized,
but the approach is the same

75
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:41,340
as that for landscapes, with one added concern
due to future challenges and particular technical

76
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:47,660
difficulties,
most notably when it comes to access constraints.

77
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,939
Clearly, incorporating protected areas -that
are

78
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:56,759
relatively fixed -
within larger spaces that

79
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:04,229
continuously evolve based on need,
desires, regulations or government changes,

80
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:09,339
etc.,
can be a very difficult task.

81
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:14,719
Yet there is no point in planning for protected
areas

82
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:17,969
when these are surrounded by total chaos.

83
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,740
Absolutely.

84
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,259
Let's take an example
to illustrate this: the cohabitation, if we

85
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:29,020
may speak of cohabitation,
of protected areas and the extractive industries,

86
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,960
which is rapidly expanding in Africa.

87
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,969
Take a look at our study on this subject if
it interests you.

88
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:43,280
Here is a map from this study
which you can access fully at www.papaco.org.

89
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,810
Here we have a photo of the Dja Reserve,
and of the Sangha Trinational in Cameroon.

90
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,089
Note that the protected areas shown on this
map

91
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,599
are surrounded by mining areas, the colored
areas here,

92
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:02,949
some of which encroach on the very reserves,
despite these being world heritage sites.

93
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,710
One arrives at a situation like this
simply via a lack of coordinated territorial

94
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,199
planning.

95
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,999
which leaves the field open to, in this case,
the Ministry of Mines,

96
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:16,199
to issue permits which do not take into account
other agreements,

97
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,789
--here, for conservation-- of this territory.

98
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,900
Unfortunately, this is a very common scenario.

99
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:41,919
Let's look at another example in Cameroon,
this time in the north

100
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,930
of the country.

101
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:56,589
All

102
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:30,670
of

103
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:40,029
the 
above also applies to other forms of development:

104
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:48,380
urbanization, the development of infrastructure,
the spread of agriculture, etc.

105
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,460
Overall territorial planning
must be seen as an absolute necessity for

106
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,020
protected areas
as an "empty-chair" policy has proven to be

107
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,649
clearly catastrophic.

108
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:07,610
Those who manage protected areas
must learn to leave their territories,

109
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:13,130
and engage in discussion with all the parties
around them

110
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,360
in order to prevent decisions being made against
them.

111
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,519
Thank you, Paul.

112
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,220
It's a subject which, clearly, we could talk
about for hours during this MOOC,

113
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,160
but we've arrived at the end of this part
of the course.

114
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,190
We need to wrap it up.

115
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,529
We'll meet again in the next section, to speak
about transboundary protected areas,

116
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:35,149
yet another level of planning.

117
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:36,650
See you soon, Paul!

118
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,650
- Good bye!

119
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,560
- Have an brilliant day.
