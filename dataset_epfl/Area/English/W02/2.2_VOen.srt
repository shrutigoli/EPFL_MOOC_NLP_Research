(birds chirping and car engine)
(camera clicks) 

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,160
Good Morning!

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,620
Today, our course will be on the planning
of protected areas.

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,410
the book to consult as reference,
will be the guidelines of IUCN for the management

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,599
planning of protected areas,
edited once again by the world commission

6
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:29,949
of protected areas.

7
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:33,330
You can also find a lot of information in
our study of management plans

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,510
in french-speaking Africa on our website papaco.org.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,010
Today, two colleagues from IUCN PAPACO will
help me.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,180
It's Bora Masumbuko, who is based in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso,

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,059
and Lacina Kone who is based in Niamey, Niger.

12
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:52,600
Both have good experience in the preparation
of management plans.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,100
So the first question that we are going to
ask ourselves,

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,359
is to know what this management plan is for.

15
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,109
The management plan, is a document that helps
to guide the Manager

16
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,339
on how he should manage his protected area.

17
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,270
It documents and identifies the values to
preserve in the protected area.

18
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,530
It clearly establishes the goals that must
be achieved

19
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,380
and identifies the actions that must be in
place to achieve those goals.

20
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:25,159
It is a document that allows to plan in time
and is interested in the present and future.

21
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,240
It allows to respond concretely to the following
questions:

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,610
What will be done?

23
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,930
How will it be done ?
and when will it be done?

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,049
It is therefore an essential tool to help
the Manager.

25
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:41,980
And for this, it must remain concise and clear.

26
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,450
The plan is a useful tool
to improve the management of the protected

27
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,869
area.

28
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,480
it allows a better use of financial and human
resources,

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,409
as it allows to plan activities in time,
therefore the cost and the need of human resources

30
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,680
are equally evaluated.

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,439
Finally - and this is very important-
the management plan increases the manager's

32
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,759
responsibility,
in obtaining results.

33
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,690
It also improves the communication between
all stakeholders,

34
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,940
involved in the management of protected areas.

35
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,950
OK, all that is easy to understand.

36
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,200
So, what are the principles that should guide
us

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,370
when we wish to create a management plan for
a protected area

38
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:34,440
and if possible, of course, a very good plan.

39
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,740
To develop a management plan with efficiency
and transparency,

40
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,150
it is essential to include a number of principles.

41
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,870
First of all, all the stakeholders have to
participate,

42
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,840
given that their level of involvement may
have an impact on the success

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,700
of the planning exercise.

44
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,170
At first, one must identify all of the participants
involved

45
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,150
then approach them with transparency to involve
them in planning.

46
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,220
Next, the documents which will be use as the
source of information.

47
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,659
should be elaborated in a clear accessible
manner

48
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,670
and should take into account cultural or linguistic
constraints.

49
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,860
Furthermore, communication is a key element
when approaching stakeholders,

50
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,830
because they must perceive that they are an
integral part

51
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,270
of the planning process.

52
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,159
They must be considered as partners, and not
obstacles

53
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,799
of nature conservation.

54
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,269
Thus, it is important to respond positively
to meeting requests,

55
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:36,980
to consider all points of view,
and to give each party time to formulate their

56
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,489
opinions.

57
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,879
If it becomes necessary,
undertake some research before taking a decision

58
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,980
that is not consensual
and then return the result to interested parties.

59
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,420
Regardless of the complexity of the management
plan,

60
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,129
it needs to apply those simples principles
to guide the planification process

61
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:03,060
and to guarantee that eventually the management
plan will be a useful document

62
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:11,720
accepted by all.

63
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,940
We know now what the plans are for
and we know the principles of their preparation.

64
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,109
Let's see the steps to follow.

65
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:24,460
When we are consulting different plans
we see that they do not all contain the same

66
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:32,039
informations
or, are not presented the same way.

67
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,470
This is not a serious issue.

68
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,479
To help elaborate those documents,
IUCN published guidelines

69
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,440
for management planning of protected areas.

70
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:54,860
This document presents, in 13 steps,
how to prepare such a plan.

71
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,860
Those 13 steps can roughly be summarized as
follows:

72
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:09,640
First of all, the pre-planning phase,
data collections and initial fieldwork;

73
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:17,339
then comes the evaluation of data
and information on the ressources

74
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,140
to form sufficient arguments
that will help in the identification of the

75
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:27,750
protected area values;
then we move on to identifying pressures and

76
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:35,050
threats
that the values previously defined are facing,

77
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:42,080
and we identify constraints
of the protected area territory.

78
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,200
From this analysis of values,
and the number of threats they are facing

79
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,649
we deduct a long term vision for the protected
area

80
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:58,400
as well as short-term management goals
and the activities helping to achieve those

81
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,080
goals,
i.e activities that will stop the threats

82
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:10,220
to resources
and to heritage values of the protected area.

83
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:17,740
It is then, that we write
a first draft of the plan we want to launch

84
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,029
and make it available to all the different
stakeholders

85
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:25,460
for a public consultation.

86
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:32,060
The plan can then be rightfully approved and
endorsed.

87
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,630
We must understand the development of a management
plan

88
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,020
is an evolving process.

89
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,270
In general, a plan is designed for a period
of 5 to 7 years

90
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,409
and is regularly revised
to adapt the management of the protected area

91
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,909
to the realities of the field.

92
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:58,460
All the steps in the management plan are important,
but we will spend time on some key steps of

93
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,860
the process.

94
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,130
The pre-planning is the step that allows the
preparation

95
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,060
and the logistics for the development of the
management plan.

96
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,610
It must lead to the establishment of the terms
of reference,

97
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,970
of the budget and method to follow.

98
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,431
It also allows helps to identify the team
for the preparation of the plan

99
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:23,820
- this is a crucial point,
because too often it comes down to entrusting

100
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,209
the work to an outside expert,
while it is essential that managers themselves,

101
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:34,200
the actors of the area themselves, feel involved
in this work.

102
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,900
Obviously, an outside expert can be an added
as support,

103
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,659
but should never be the main leader in the
planning.

104
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,589
Within this phase of pre-planning
we also identify a provisional timetable

105
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:50,370
for the process of preparation of the management
plan

106
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:57,959
up to its approval and then we make it public.

107
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,390
Step 3, is about the protected area’s values.

108
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:07,330
This assumes that we are engaged in the process
and have already collected data on the protected

109
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,020
area.

110
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,709
Then what is the heritage value of the protected
area?

111
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:20,280
It is simply what justifies
the creation and existence of this area

112
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:32,640
in other words, it is a heritage,
i.e a value that belongs to everybody,

113
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:45,450
and that is important to preserve for future
generations.

114
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,040
They are identified from known informations
and data

115
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:58,330
on the protected area in a participatory manner
with all parties of its outskirts involved.

116
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,310
It is obviously essential
to know the heritage values of a protected

117
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,150
area,
because the purpose of the protected area

118
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:13,150
is precisely to maintain those heritage values.

119
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:19,510
Then let us ask how
we can establish the heritage value of a protected

120
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,170
area?

121
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:28,080
It's simple, we have to ask ourselves for
example,

122
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:36,730
if the area is home to exceptional cases
of natural, scenic, cultural, scientific,

123
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:43,410
ecological, floristic values
or of essential resources for the local communities

124
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,820
or of rare and indigenous
animals and plants.

125
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:55,000
This 3rd step is crucial but difficult to
implement,

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,110
because those values can be subjective, misunderstood
or poorly advertised.

127
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,500
Yet it is those values that will form the
basis

128
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,740
in identifying the threats and constraints
that affect the protected area and will guide

129
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,820
the choices
of actions undertaken to preserve the area.

130
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,860
All the other steps
will ultimately be linked to the results

131
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:26,130
of identifying the values.

132
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,580
The last step of the planning process
is the review of the plan.

133
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,060
It consists in deciding when and how
we will update the management plan.

134
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,930
This implies that all other steps
were realized correctly including the monitoring

135
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,820
and review.

136
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,090
In numerous case, the plan is updated at least
every ten years.

137
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,150
The review usually starts around one to two
years

138
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,270
before the scheduled end of the management
plan,

139
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,680
to leave the necessary time
to collect the data on indicators,

140
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,630
to analyze them,
to consult all the stakeholders

141
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,320
and to validate a new plan.

142
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,110
In case of delay, we will continue to use
the previous version of the plan,

143
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,680
and this cannot differ from the pursuit of
essential activities.

144
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,500
So, we know now the most important part.

145
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,990
Take time to consult the management plans
of parks that you are familiar with,

146
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,530
and if you do not have access to those documents,
Look at what we have made available to you

147
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,000
on the platform.

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,310
Analyze their structure,
identify their strength and weakness if there

149
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,670
is any,
think about what you would change.

150
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,000
This is the end of this class.

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,090
the next episode will be
on the planning of protected areas network.

152
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:47,750
This implies a change of scale
to plan at the level of several areas.

153
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,360
Have an excellent day!
