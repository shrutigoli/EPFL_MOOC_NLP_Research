00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,950
Hello, today we are going to look at a tool,
recently developed by the World Commission 

2
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,520
on Protected Areas and IUCN,
which is called the Green List of Protected

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,520
Areas.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,260
Why a Green List, what is it and what is it
for?

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,660
You can find out more on the Green List website.

6
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,070
The address appears here.

7
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,760
Once again, to help me in this lesson,
I think you will recognize the team:

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,640
Nestor and his friend Béatrice.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,229
The first question that we will ask
is about the reasons

10
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:55,110
behind the development of the Green List.

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,550
The IUCN Red List,
that we will talk about later in this MOOC,

12
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,220
focuses on species that are at risk of extinction,
so species that are in danger.

13
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,660
It provides an evaluation of the major threats
which put a strain on the planet's species.

14
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,100
We understand that identifying the threats
that are urgent to counteract,

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,350
to ensure preservation of biodiversity is
essential.

16
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,220
But it is also extremely important
to share the success, to show what works,

17
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,000
wherever in the world we are.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,319
This is exactly the purpose of the Green List,
to show the protected areas that work,

19
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,290
that have succeeded in reaching their goal
of conservation,

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,300
whatever their system of governance,
however they are managed,

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,220
no matter where in the world they are, there
are successes

22
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,660
that we must be able to share with other areas
that find themselves in similar situations,

23
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,420
that need to make progress
and in order to do that, they need to be inspired

24
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,430
by other's conservation success stories.

25
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,649
In short, this Green List is above all, a
new label.

26
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,560
Do we need a new label when there are already
so many?

27
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,500
There are in fact already many labels associated
with protected areas.

28
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,280
But in general, they only concentrate on a
few specific aspects

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,630
of these protected areas.

30
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:15,180
For example, UNESCO's MAB, Man and the Biosphere
designates biosphere reserves,

31
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,640
or WWF's PAN Parks,
which aim at certifying the quality

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,720
of the tourism services of a site
in terms of conservation.

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,090
Or another label such as Ramsar,
which recognizes the importance of wetlands.

34
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,590
As for World Heritage,
it identifies an element of the protected

35
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:40,690
area
as having an extraordinary universal value.

36
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,440
Contrary to World Heritage,
which recognizes an extraordinary value within

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,990
a protected area,
,a value that existed before,

38
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,819
the Green List will be concerned with the
way in which the managers

39
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,060
will manage and govern this protected area
to preserve its values in general.

40
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,170
So the Green List has the advantage
of recognizing a job that is well done by

41
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,410
management
and then being able to share that to other

42
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,030
sites
or managers who wish to learn.

43
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,040
It's an important detail: contrary to World
Heritage

44
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,319
the Green List doesn't look at the intrinsic
value of the site,

45
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,040
it is about measuring, qualifying
the governance and the management of the site,

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,210
in order to recognize the quality of the manager's
work.

47
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:29,130
Youssouf, who is going to talk to us
in the next lesson on World Heritage,

48
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,930
will tell us a little about it now.

49
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,600
Although the World Heritage sites
are supposedly well run,

50
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,750
it's not the case for all of them,
to the extent that they lose partially

51
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:48,349
the value or values that warranted their inclusion,
either due to an ineffective management system

52
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,430
or governance.

53
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,440
These World Heritage Sites cannot
therefore be included to the Green List,

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,030
because their management system or governance
does not allow

55
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,730
the long term conservation of their outstanding
universal value.

56
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,600
Conversely, a lot of protected areas that
are eligible for the Green List,

57
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,819
will never be able to make it onto the World
Heritage List

58
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,209
as they do not have an outstanding universal
value.

59
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,490
Thus the Green List is a powerful process
for recognizing the efforts of managers

60
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,050
to govern and manage their protected area
well.

61
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,830
What these managers can expect in return,
as benefits

62
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,139
of the Green List,
is firstly a greater visibility for marketing,

63
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,000
for example,
because this is a label with worldwide recognition,

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,039
that can also reinforce a plea on a national
level,

65
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,169
for the recognition of protected areas
within the national system of protected areas,

66
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,509
for example.

67
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,610
It is also a way of lobbying to anticipate
the unsustainable use

68
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,020
of certain resources around the protected
areas,

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,009
and sometimes in the protected areas.

70
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:07,199
It is also helpful when it comes to fundraising,
for example,

71
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,750
it can be motivating for staff
as they are seen as having done a good job.

72
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,360
It's a way of improving the working standards
and staff competency.

73
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,259
Another of the major advantages that the Green
List brings,

74
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,379
is that the protected areas that take part
in this process

75
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:27,050
will directly benefit from the experience
and successes

76
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,440
of the protected areas that already appear
on the Green List.

77
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,229
So it is a way of constantly being required
to progress

78
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:40,770
and to improve practices on a daily basis.

79
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,610
So more specifically, how does the Green List
work,

80
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,400
how do you get on this list?

81
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,080
This is a totally voluntary procedure
for areas that decide to participate

82
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,919
this means that candidate PAs must put together
their own application themselves.

83
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,469
This application is made up of two things.

84
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:01,780
It's easy.

85
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,970
One part is a questionnaire, made up of a
list of indicators

86
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,559
which give information about the requirements
of the Green List.

87
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:13,059
So this is a whole list of questions to which
the manager will respond.

88
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:15,960
And then,
the second part of the application, is all

89
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,629
the evidence
proving that the responses on the questionnaire

90
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,009
are true.

91
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:25,940
This can be maps, documents, reports, photos,
a whole pile of evidence, proof

92
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,020
that backs the responses on the questionnaire.

93
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,740
The application is then examined by a reference
group,

94
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,449
a group of experts, on a national scale
which will analyse and assess

95
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:41,749
the appropriateness of the supplied information
in meeting the requirements of the Green List.

96
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:46,089
If this reference group is satisfied,
it transfers the application to an external

97
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:50,379
certifier or auditor,
who will again analyse the application

98
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,279
and check that the information is provided
and with enough detail,

99
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,639
and check that the group of experts' working
method was suitable.

100
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,469
If the auditor is satisfied,
he finally transfers the application

101
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:06,680
to the global committee of the Green List,
which is at IUCN's head office,

102
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,879
and who is the independent authority
that makes the final decision

103
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,110
whether or not to include the site on the
Green List.

104
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,689
So how is the development of the Green List
going

105
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:21,509
on a worldwide level or in Africa in particular?

106
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,719
The pilot phase lasted two years and ended
at the end of 2014.

107
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:29,819
It enabled eight countries to test the process
in their countries.

108
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,919
Those countries are:
Korea, France, Spain, Italy,

109
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,199
Kenya, China, Australia and Colombia.

110
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,449
At the end of this pilot phase,
24 protected areas were included on the world

111
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,750
level list.

112
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,930
Two of them are in Africa,
in Kenya as it was the pilot country for Africa.

113
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,060
In Kenya, there are two private conservancies
who have been added do the Green List,

114
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,629
Lewa and Ol Pejeta Conservancy,
recognized for the excellence of their management

115
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:58,099
and governance.

116
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,289
And now the process is up and running
and it allows the inclusion of new countries

117
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,180
and new protected areas on the Green List.

118
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,300
The objective is to achieve in two years a
mechanism

119
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,719
that is well-oiled and tested on the ground
so that it is long lasting in Africa.

120
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:16,919
The Green List of Protected Areas is therefore,
above all,

121
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:23,919
a tool to stimulate learning by example
by identifying and explaining best practice.

122
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,899
We can expect that it will progressively become
a new source of motivation

123
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,249
for all managers of protected areas around
the world.

124
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:35,010
On the Green list website, the address appears
here,

125
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,060
take the time to look at the requirements
and indicators

126
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,920
and how they are outlined.

127
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,430
It should serve as a guide to our future activities
in and around protected areas.

128
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,830
It is the end of this lesson.

129
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,290
The next episode will be about World Heritage
with Youssouf, as I said earlier.

130
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,059
Have an excellent day.
