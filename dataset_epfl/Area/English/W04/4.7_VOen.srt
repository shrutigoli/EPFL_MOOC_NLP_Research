00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,300
Hi, and welcome to the class. 

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,000
Today, we'll talk about
the World Heritage Convention.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,520
The reference reading as a complement of this
class

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,430
is of course, the convention itself and its
operations guidelines

5
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,330
if you would like get into more details.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,690
A quick look at this document will help you
know more

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,860
quite rapidly and, of course, you can also
check out UNESCO's website -

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,070
The link is right here.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,660
You will also find on papaco.org
many evaluation results of World Heritage

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,000
sites
conducted in Africa these last few years.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,239
For this class, as I said in the last class,
an IUCN papaco's colleague, Youssouph Diedhiou,

12
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,930
based in Dakar, Senegal, is going to help
me out.

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,270
He is specifically in charge of world heritage
conservation.

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,009
So, let's see with Youssouph where this convention
comes from,

15
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:08,540
and what its exact purpose is.

16
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,830
World Heritage is the legacy of the past
that we enjoy today and that we're passing

17
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,670
on
to the next generations.

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,330
World Heritage Convention looks at the sites
that have an outstanding universal value

19
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,590
that we'll define later on.

20
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,509
What triggered its creation
was building the Assouan dam, in Egypt,

21
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:44,640
that was going to flood Abou Simbel's and
Philae's temple.

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,760
Facing this threat, UNESCO started
an international cooperation in 1959 in order

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,430
to protect
these major architectural sites.

24
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,320
Then started long discussions
on how to set up a mecanism

25
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,819
to protect these exceptional sites.

26
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,899
These discussions ended upon elaboration of
a text called

27
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,380
the Convention concerning the protection of
Cultural and Natural Heritage,

28
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:31,230
that was adopted in 1972 in Paris,
during the UNESCO general assembly.

29
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,120
This convention's objectives are to identify
and protect these exceptional sites, but also

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:45,069
to introduce them
to the international community.

31
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:51,560
The convention helps States parties
by reinforcing their sites management capacity.

32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,409
It also helps the States parties
to safeguard their sites,

33
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:01,019
by reinforcing their technical capacity
but also by bringing them

34
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:07,049
professional assistance.

35
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:10,569
At site scale, it supports
the local communities' participation

36
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:15,260
to cultural and natural heritage protection.

37
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,689
Finally, the convention brings an international
support

38
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:27,799
to immediate danger
exposed sites.

39
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,340
Youssouph told us, this convention
looks at sites that have

40
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,719
an outstanding universal value.

41
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,700
What does it mean, specifically?

42
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,940
The outstanding universal value
means a cultural or natural importance that

43
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,920
is so exceptional,
that it transcend borders

44
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,599
and that its invaluable characters stay the
same

45
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,889
for present and future generations.

46
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,810
This outstanding universal value has three
components.

47
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:06,999
The first one affects criteria that
are numbered from one to ten.

48
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:11,579
The first six criteria involve cultural sites
and the last four criteria,

49
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:22,460
meaning seven, eight, nine and ten,
involve natural sites.

50
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,919
The second component is integrity.

51
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,020
Integrity describes the untouched values
that we want to see

52
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:36,870
appear on the World Heritage List.

53
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,490
The third and last component
is the management system that must be effective

54
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:52,830
in order to allow this universal value transmission
to next generations.

55
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:59,090
All of this is only theorical of course,
but it's the spirit of the convention.

56
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,970
Okay, all of this isn't necessarily
very easy to understand the first time,

57
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,830
so let's have a few examples
to better understand.

58
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,129
For the seventh criterion, let's have a look
at

59
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,419
the Mount Kenya National Park, with its spectacular
landscapes,

60
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,950
its peaks and its cliffs.

61
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,990
The seventh criterion is simply relating to
the beauty,

62
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,990
the exceptional aesthetic of a territory.

63
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,690
For the eighth criterion, let's look at
the National Park of Virunga, in Democratic

64
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,259
Republic of Congo.

65
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,560
It consists of seven volcanoes two of them
being

66
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,960
the most active in Africa right now.

67
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,800
The eighth criterion relates to Earth geological
evolution

68
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,280
and to what helps us understand it, or see
it today.

69
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,460
Regarding the ninth criterion, let's look
at National Park of Nakuru,

70
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,169
that is part of a lakes network;
in between which the lesser flamingos

71
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:52,900
of the Rift Valley travels.

72
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,020
The ninth criterion shows the natural evolution
of ecosystems on earth,

73
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,960
as shown by the functioning
of this migration.

74
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,229
Finally, the tenth criterion relates to biological
diversity.

75
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:12,849
The National Park of Niokolo Koba in Senegal
is a good example.

76
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:19,849
It's a very rich ecosystem, in flora and fauna,
at least, at the time of its enlisting.

77
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:22,710
What is the situation of World’s Heritage
sites

78
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,819
in Africa, nowadays?

79
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,580
The state of conservation of African World
Heritage sites

80
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,150
is very concerning,
With 35% of the sites registered on the in

81
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:40,120
danger list
some of which for over 20 years.

82
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,759
A site is registered on the in danger list
if it's threatened by a proved, precise and

83
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,360
upcoming danger.

84
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,180
For example, poaching of its biodiversity,
or when it's facing serious threats,

85
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,599
such as an upcoming conflict outburst
or heavy programmed infrastructures,

86
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:11,340
such as the mine on Mount Nimba in Guinea.

87
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,479
This deterioration of African goods
is linked to several factors,

88
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,099
and the most important are
anthropic pressure

89
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:31,620
such as poaching, agriculture,
the development of mining.

90
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,280
This is conveyed by an unsuitable budget,
insufficient staff,

91
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,080
and deteriorating infrastructures.

92
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,780
All of this does not allow to sustainably
preserve

93
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:49,039
the universal outstanding value of those sites.

94
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,300
Since 2008, the IUCN made several assessments
on management effectiveness of those sites

95
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,470
and the overall outcomes
of these assessments confirm this state of

96
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:04,689
deterioration
of these African world heritage sites.

97
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,050
A big thank you to Youssouph.

98
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,080
Now, we know the essential points.

99
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,250
Take the time to check out the UNESCO website
about World Heritage.

100
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,319
Look at what the criteria for registration
of these sites are,

101
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,349
the ones that you know,
and analyse which are the threats that they

102
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,970
face,
and why they are, or are not, at risk.

103
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,110
That's the end of this class.

104
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,390
Next episode will be the conclusion
and then the homework for this week.

105
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,219
Have a great day!
