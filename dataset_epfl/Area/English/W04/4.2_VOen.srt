00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,539
Welcome to today's lesson
about Management Effectiveness of Protected 

2
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:23,539
Areas.

3
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:30,910
The reference book that complements this lesson
is the IUCN guidelines on evaluating effectiveness,

4
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,780
edited by the World Commission on Protected
Areas.

5
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,430
The link can be found here.

6
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,090
In addition, on the papaco.org website,
you will find a lot of the evaluation results

7
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,409
from various African countries,
as well as the tools

8
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:49,100
that we will be talking about in this lesson.

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:57,700
So, let's first of all ask ourselves
why management effectiveness is important.

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,489
Let's use the example of lions in Western
Africa.

11
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:07,850
On the map that we see here,
the historic lion distribution is in grey,

12
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,950
and it is, let's say, a century old.

13
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:19,500
Except in the forest, on the coast there,
lions were present everywhere in Western Africa.

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,030
In dark grey
- all of these spots -

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,079
we can see the lion distribution
based on the estimation of a cat specialists

16
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:35,130
groups,
four IUCN specialists, in 2006.

17
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,659
The estimation shows that-- this is the good
news--

18
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:42,380
that most of the lions were within or in close
proximity

19
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:50,790
to protected areas that we can see here limited
by the black lines.

20
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,240
Let's now look at this map that was done in
2014

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,420
after a new study was carried out on the area
to control the presence of lions in all of

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,170
these sites.

23
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,149
The black is where the lion has been confirmed
present,

24
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:10,470
and so in all of the other places, the lion
seems to be absent.

25
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,990
They are therefore present in four sites in
Western Africa: Niokolo,

26
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:22,510
the WAP area - W, Arli, Pendjari -
that we talked about in the lesson on transboundary

27
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,110
areas,
and then, two little parks in Nigeria, Kendji,

28
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,550
and Yankari,
and then, that's it.

29
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,390
Everywhere else, including in protected areas,
the lion has disappeared or it is so rare

30
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,760
that clues of its presence weren't detected.

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,830
We can therefore see it in this example of
lions:

32
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,710
even though protected areas have existed for
decades,

33
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,520
they haven't prevented a species from pretty
much becoming extinct,

34
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,980
despite it being an emblematic species.

35
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,010
Unfortunately, many species have experienced
this trend

36
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,610
like the black rhinoceros
which became extinct at the beginning of the

37
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,230
2000s
in the north of Cameroon, in parks in Faro,

38
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,510
in Bouba Ndjida, in Bénoué.

39
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,790
There are many other ungulates that are now
very rare, or extinct,

40
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:16,700
like we saw in the first lessons, the Oryx
dammah in Western Africa.

41
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,680
Protected areas are therefore, not enough
to preserve ecosystems

42
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,440
if they are not well managed
with the aim of fulfilling their primary objective,

43
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,510
which, to remind you, is the conservation
of nature.

44
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,620
This graph, that we have already seen, shows
the decline of fauna in Africa

45
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,400
in the last 30 years.

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,480
I think it is explicit enough,
especially the curve for Western Africa.

47
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,310
Just to remind you, that's a loss of 85% in
35 years for the major park species.

48
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,570
This notion of management effectiveness covers,
very generally, two aspects.

49
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,960
First of all, it refers to our ability to
do our work well,

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,240
so, overall, to do it in accordance to what
is expected of us.

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,780
Generally, that is what is written in the
management plan.

52
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,630
Effectiveness is therefore our ability to
do our work well.

53
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:19,209
But that is not enough,
and the other concept that this term of effectiveness

54
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,750
covers
is the impact of our actions.

55
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:30,010
Is what we do useful for conservation?

56
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,780
The usefulness of our work.

57
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,790
Let's look at the following examples.

58
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,830
A park ranger patrols the park regularly in
accordance with the established plan.

59
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,760
He stops poachers, and so he does his job
well.

60
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,250
However, the poachers are quickly back in
the park

61
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,630
because the judge is corrupt.

62
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,710
The ranger did a good job, but it was pointless.

63
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,530
Another example is an officer who carries
out ecological monitoring

64
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,410
in the park throughout the year.

65
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,810
However, the data he sends off is not dealt
with

66
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,340
or integrated into the decision-making system.

67
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:15,490
He did his work well, but it was pointless,
and so, in the end, it was not effective.

68
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,590
It is therefore essential
for protected areas management to make progress.

69
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,770
A global analysis of the situation, at the
global level,

70
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,570
shows that, in fact, less than 25% of the
evaluated protected areas

71
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,210
are managed in a way
that can be described as correct:

72
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,460
24% in the world.

73
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,290
In 36% of the cases, it's basic,
et so, more than 40% are under the minimum

74
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,830
requirement.

75
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,380
So to respond to all of this,
the World Commission on Protected Areas has

76
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,870
created an evaluation framework
that allows for methods to be developed that

77
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,710
will be based on the same approach.

78
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,960
This means that we can cater to the diversity
of expectations,

79
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,930
of methods, of competencies, and of contexts
in quite a homogenous way

80
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,950
and by having quite a sound basis for joint
discussions.

81
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,020
Let's have a look at the stages in this framework
one after another.

82
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,600
The stages are very logical and simple.

83
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,660
First of all, there's the context.

84
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,890
Where are we?

85
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,889
Working on management effectiveness
is first of all about identifying the initial

86
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,840
situation,
i.e., the framework

87
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,650
within which we will carry out our activities.

88
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,160
For example, it is in this stage
that we will identify the values of the protected

89
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
area.

90
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,840
These are the values that will direct our
work

91
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,530
since we want to preserve them.

92
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,510
It's also at this point
that we will pay attention to the current

93
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,090
threats,
to what could happen,

94
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,290
to the land.

95
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,390
Next is the planning stage.

96
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,960
Where do we want to go?

97
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,919
This stage enables us to pay attention to
the management plans

98
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,010
but also to questions the protected area's
design,

99
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,480
its shape, its structure, its legitimacy,
its location,

100
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,230
its role in the global system of protected
areas in that country.

101
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:13,030
The next stage in evaluating effectiveness,
considers the methods that will be required.

102
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,360
What do we need?

103
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,330
Here, we estimate the budget,
the human and technical methods that are available,

104
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,750
and the way that we will allocate them.

105
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,960
Naturally, comparatively, stage four looks
into describing

106
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,500
the work done or the work that needs to be
done.

107
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,160
How will we proceed?

108
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,900
We analyze what we are doing,
and, if possible, we compare it with the recognized

109
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,420
standards,
for example, the number of officials per hectare,

110
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,030
the sampling rate required for good ecological
monitoring etc.

111
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,070
That's exactly what we will talk about at
the end of this course

112
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,370
along with the Green List.

113
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:58,570
Then there's the crucial stage of evaluating
the results we obtained.

114
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,030
What have we achieved?

115
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,350
Here, we identify if the work was carried
out well,

116
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,889
in accordance with the announced plan,
and if it answers our question: did we do

117
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,900
the job well?

118
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,210
It's also here that we make an inventory of
all the products obtained,

119
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,680
for example, the number of patrols done,
the number of educational sessions in schools,

120
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,050
the number of tourists who visited,
and finally, everything related to indicators

121
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,520
that show we did a good job.

122
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,800
Even more important is the sixth and final
stage

123
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,800
in the evaluation framework
which focuses on the impact of our actions.

124
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,580
It is the stage where we evaluate what has
changed in the area,

125
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,500
and that's where we ask if our work is useful.

126
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,940
In particular, it is in this stage that we
need to determine

127
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,480
if the values were well and truly preserved.

128
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,790
For example, it could be
an emblematic animal species like this cheetah.

129
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,560
Of course, it is the hardest stage to complete
and many evaluation tools don't cater for

130
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
it.

131
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,110
There we go, we have seen the framework
for the evaluation of management effectiveness.

132
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,100
It is a simple tool made to help us think
about our work

133
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,930
and that will allow us to organize our own
thoughts

134
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,560
in order to progress.

135
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,740
It is a cycle,
and so it's a thought process that needs to

136
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,390
become permanent
and that must influence our work throughout

137
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,610
the whole year.

138
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,550
As soon as the area is affected, that's the
sixth stage,

139
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,660
the context changes and so we need to start
analyzing again.

140
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,850
It isn't very complicated though.

141
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:39,040
It just needs to become a reflex for the organization
whether that be during the self-evaluations

142
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,630
that we carry out
or if our activities are audited.

143
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,620
Based on the framework, various tools have
been formalized

144
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,330
to allow for the principles to be quickly
applied to the area.

145
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,240
Some tools focus on the protected area networks
like RAPPAM, which is a quick evaluation tool

146
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,160
and it prioritises stages in protected area
management.

147
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,640
RAPPAM enables comparisons between sites
within a coherent whole,

148
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,190
for example, a national protected areas network,
or a system within ecosystems.

149
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,240
Let's take the example of the network of marine
protected areas in West Africa,

150
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,830
RAMPAO, that Charlotte has already talked
to us about,

151
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,770
and let's see with her how it is evaluated.

152
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,250
We evaluate the performance of the Regional
Network

153
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,090
of Marine Protected Areas in West Africa
on several levels.

154
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,430
It is a protected areas network, a network
of sites, of course,

155
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,390
and so the evaluation of the performances
of the sites

156
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,940
is already a very important aspect, and in
fact, most of the RAMPAO sites

157
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,589
do or have done regular evaluations of management
effectiveness,

158
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:53,220
especially by using known tools such as METT.

159
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,330
Global evaluations of the network's performance
or of its performances as a whole

160
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,050
are mainly carried out by using the RAPPAM
tool.

161
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:06,880
A first exercise was done in 2010, and, in
fact, it was backed by IUCN.

162
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,680
So, it is an exercise that gathers all of
the members of the network,

163
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,220
the managers, who carry out this evaluation
together,

164
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,420
who identify the progress, the challenges,
and who also recommend network management

165
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,040
improvements.

166
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:28,050
A second exercise was carried out in 2013
and a larger number of requests was involved

167
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,850
because the number of members had grown within
that period.

168
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:39,950
It also tried to analyze the current challenges
and recommendations to try and improve the

169
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,580
network.

170
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,892
Other tools focus on evaluating one site in
particular.

171
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:53,900
A frequently used tool is the METT,
the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool.

172
00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:01,160
It is a self-evaluation tool made to be used
on one single site.

173
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,760
It allows us to follow the progress of one
site over time,

174
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,210
but, once again, it should not be used to
compare one site with another,

175
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,000
that is what the RAPPAM is for.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,130
Some tools, like the EoH, Enhancing Our Heritage,
a tool created for world heritage, also focuses

177
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,220
on one single site,
but they are complex management analysis tools,

178
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,990
that are to be used when we want to go into
a lot of detail.

179
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,830
Take some time to look at the case studies
introduced in the guidelines on management

180
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,050
effectiveness.

181
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:38,460
Have a look also at our numerous site or network
evaluations in Africa,

182
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,930
on the papaco.org website.

183
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,890
Finally, have a look at a blank METT questionnaire
to understand the architecture and the principles.

184
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,850
Try and recognize the process from the World
Commission's framework

185
00:12:49,850 --> 00:13:01,700
through this simple exercise.

186
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,850
That's the end of the lesson.

187
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,830
The next episode will be
on putting into practice some of these principles,

188
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,540
particularly that are related to monitoring
protected areas.

189
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,250
Have a great day.
