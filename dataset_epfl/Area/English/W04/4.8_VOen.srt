1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,800
Working on management effectiveness is about
assessing

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,879
the ability of a protected area to preserve
its values.

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:12,690
This allows to identify the quality daily
work:

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,320
Am I working well?

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,040
But especially to measure its usefulness:
does what I do serve a purpose?

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,360
This is the notion of responsibility tied
to governance.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,840
When done regularly, an assessment of effectiveness
allows to

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,960
redirect management actions to respond to
identified problems.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,079
There are numerous tools that have been developed
based on the evaluation framework

10
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,440
prepared by the World Commission of Protected
Areas.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,550
This tool is made up of six simple and logical
steps.

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,550
Where am I?

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,460
Where am I going?

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,680
What do I need?

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,410
How do I do it?

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,920
What is the result?

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,640
What has changed?

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:05,440
Some tools assess networks, such as RAPPAM,
others focus on one site, like METT.

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,290
In all cases, the evaluation should be a voluntary
process

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,350
conducted by, or with, the managers,
and bringing together all parties

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:21,840
involved in the management of protected areas.

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,970
Monitoring a protected area is essential for
effectiveness

23
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:31,150
because it allows for threats,
faced by the values, to be controlled.

24
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,270
Good monitoring is the result of a meaningful
analysis

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,330
and of prioritizing threats.

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,360
The monitoring strategy should be flexible
and adjustable

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,360
according to the evolution of these threats
and the values concerned.

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,910
Ecological monitoring is another aspect of
effectiveness

29
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,100
and it consolidates methods of collecting
and analyzing data

30
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,280
which will measure the evolution of protected
area values.

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,300
There are many direct or indirect methods.

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,670
The choice of method will depend on its effectiveness.

33
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,340
Ecological monitoring must be carried out
by, or at least, with the managers

34
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,579
and not simply entrusted to an external contractor
who has no responsibility for the management

35
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,470
of the area.

36
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,409
Effective management is also about managing
together

37
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:24,900
and this is widely dependent on the support
and collaboration of all,

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,060
when it comes to conservation.

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,360
Therefore, we have to ensure
that everyone understands the priorities of

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,060
protected areas.

41
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,120
Education and awareness enable citizens' perceptions
to evolve

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,379
towards a more realistic understanding
of the importance of protected areas in their

43
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:45,510
everyday life.

44
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,970
It is an essential strategy to anchor conservation
as a common cause.

45
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,370
It is certainly difficult to measure the impact
of this awareness on behavior,

46
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,650
and yet this has to be an absolute priority.

47
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,579
Finally, in this module we have seen how the
Green List will enable us

48
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:09,430
to recognize, at a global level, the quality
of the managers' work,

49
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,319
not only in terms of their management effectiveness,
but also for the quality of their governance,

50
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:23,340
which finally allows us to fully measure
the responsibility of each person.

51
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,379
The Green List will be a powerful way
to encourage protected areas to follow the

52
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:33,040
best examples,
by transmitting useful tools to all sites

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,489
on their journey to be added to this unique
list.

54
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,639
Now, let's start this module's test.
