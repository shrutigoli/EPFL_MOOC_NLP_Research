1
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:22,820
Today we will look at raising awareness
for the conservation of protected areas. 

2
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,480
The document you should look at to complement
this lesson,

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,089
is the toolkit on Communication Education
and Public Awareness,

4
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:33,970
edited this time by the IUCN Commission on
Education and Communication.

5
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,720
Their website can be seen here.

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,990
So, to convince you that this aspect of protected
area management is important,

7
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,239
I am giving you here a reminder of the Aichi
Target that includes

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,860
the individual's awareness of conservation.

9
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,299
As you can see, it is the first target, and
that is not a coincidence.

10
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:55,489
So for this lesson, once again,
Béatrice Chataignier from IUCN PAPACO in

11
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,270
Nairobi
will help me along with her zebra, who looks

12
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,129
like he's in great shape,
and who we will call Nestor.

13
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:05,339
Like we have seen in the previous classes
on governance and planning,

14
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,610
active participation by all stakeholders
in decision-making

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,900
and just as much, in managing activities themselves
is essential,

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,799
so that they know and recognize and therefore
retain

17
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,509
the protected area's values
and also so that they feel responsible for

18
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:23,759
these resources.

19
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,429
These stakeholders could be close to the protected
area,

20
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:29,979
like for example, from the local community
or the local politicians,

21
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:33,939
or even from private neighbouring companies
etc.

22
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,490
But these stakeholders could also be far away,
like at the central services of protected

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,950
areas management,
users of bush meat, coal, or wood

24
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,030
that may be living in far away towns
or even farmers who pump river water

25
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,200
down stream from a protected area.

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,970
Either way,
as users,

27
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,649
they need to understand the importance of
protected areas

28
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,950
to safeguard their future and the products
that they depend on.

29
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,681
If the parties who intervene in and around
protected areas

30
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:12,390
do not become aware that the resources they
use daily

31
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,410
are limited and need to be used on a reasonable
basis,

32
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,340
and even, that some need to be preserved,
then these users will continue to increase

33
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,830
the threats
weighing on the protected area,

34
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,481
and thereby damage the ecosystems
and all of the services they provide them

35
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:34,519
with
and that these protected areas help to preserve.

36
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,220
And so if all these stakeholders that we have
just listed,

37
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,739
who intervene,
who actually impact these protected areas,

38
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,819
whether that be from far away or from close
by,

39
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:47,659
if these parties don't become aware that,
in fact, one way or another,

40
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:52,239
they are affecting these protected areas,
and subsequently, the ecosystems' services

41
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,049
and the natural resources they protect,
then they will continue to use them in an

42
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:57,159
irrational way.

43
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,010
There will therefore be no hope for the future,
for the sustainable use of these resources.

44
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,590
That is why it is vital to make them aware
of the role

45
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,519
that they have to play in the conservation
of natural resources.

46
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,739
In Kenya, for example, the lion plays a crucial
role

47
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:16,439
in balancing out ecosystems of course,
or even in photo tourism.

48
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,650
And yet, the local breeders see lions
mainly as a problem,

49
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,469
and of course, they act accordingly,
which is why they need to be informed and

50
00:03:25,469 --> 00:05:20,250
made aware.

51
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:59,680
In practice, what should we do to reach these
actors

52
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,840
and to make them interested
in the conservation of nature, in general,

53
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,970
and particularly in protected areas?

54
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,780
Paradoxically, while the research, which is
very extensive, shows

55
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,340
that the situation is critical for the survival
of certain species,

56
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,690
well, that isn't enough to convince all of
these actors.

57
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,740
Why?

58
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,080
Because very few of them have access to the
results from the research,

59
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,370
starting with political decision-makers.

60
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,150
And so, in the end, these people don't use
the data,

61
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,270
even though they are extremely relevant,
because they are either rarely communicated

62
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,490
or badly communicated;
either way, they are misunderstood and eventually

63
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,620
not used.

64
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,890
And that's the aim of raising awareness,
it's making the data, which is so vital, available

65
00:06:41,890 --> 00:07:02,000
and accessible
to this large panel

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,440
of stakeholders.

67
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:19,270
In

68
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,590
many Central African countries,
the drop in the elephant population due to

69
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,630
poaching for ivory
is alarming,

70
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,840
and yet if we look closely,
a small percentage of poachers or traffickers,

71
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,500
who are arrested, are eventually sanctioned
by the court.

72
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,770
It is therefore urgent to intervene at the
magistrate's level

73
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,750
to make them aware and to educate them to
treat these cases

74
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,810
with the same severity as the stakes at play.

75
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,870
And these stakes impact more than just biodiversity.

76
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,530
For example, trafficking impacts the country's
tourist economy.

77
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,530
Of course, we also need to intervene with
ivory consumers,

78
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,940
which are mainly Asian countries,
and China in particular.

79
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,670
I'm sure you can imagine how hard that is.

80
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,690
All of this isn't easy
and it is not just because something is communicated

81
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,170
that we will see some action follow on the
field.

82
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,620
There are many obstacles to overcome
so that the information is first heard by

83
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,080
the target audience,
and of course understood,

84
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,780
accepted,
incorporated,

85
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,260
and then implemented,
and even repeated,

86
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,419
if that is necessary.

87
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,550
Therefore, saying it or communicating it,
does not necessarily mean doing

88
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,150
or making them do something.

89
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,000
So, what do we do?

90
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,529
And for that, we need to first identify the
emotional reasons

91
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,520
or the customs that drive these stakeholders
to act like they do.

92
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,400
That means we need to be able to identify
their personal concerns,

93
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,140
what they are interested in,
what interests them in their daily life.

94
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,770
We need to make the link between natural resources
that we want to protect

95
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,180
and show them that what's best for them is
to change their behaviour

96
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,420
to preserve this resource that they are in
fact using.

97
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,920
So this message needs to be well and truly
clear,

98
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,920
directly linked to their concerns,
and so strike a chord emotionally with these

99
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
parties.

100
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,470
It also needs to be explicit enough for them
to understand exactly

101
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,260
what they need to change
and the alternative action they must perform.

102
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:59,510
That is extremely important,
it is about grasping the message.

103
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,810
For that reason, we need to not forget that
it is when we dialogue with them

104
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,180
that adults learn best,
because it is in that situation that they

105
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,170
will be acknowledged the most
and they will considered responsible learners

106
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,110
and the experiences and the knowledge they
have gained

107
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,440
will be shared and better recognized.

108
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,880
For them, it is the best way to be taken into
consideration

109
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,270
and so to change how they do things.

110
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:31,050
Thus, the methods we use to raise awareness
must be specifically adapted to each audience.

111
00:10:31,050 --> 00:11:15,950
There are many examples of campaigns,
mainly through social media nowadays.

112
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:44,270
What
is

113
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,810
therefore the actual impact of all these efforts
for these awareness initiatives in terms of

114
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,940
conservation?

115
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,350
At what point can we hope to see a change
in behaviour?

116
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,540
These are very difficult questions.

117
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:44,040
How much time would we need
to measure the impact of growing public awareness

118
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:53,050
once it has started?

119
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,960
Changes brought in amongst young people, the
new generation,

120
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,740
are usually faster and easier.

121
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:06,170
It is an absolute priority to educate and
to raise awareness among all these young people,

122
00:13:06,170 --> 00:14:20,290
all these children,
because it is them who will change our society.

123
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,230
Have a look on the internet at some public
awareness campaigns

124
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,600
led by the big conservation NGOs.

125
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,860
Some of the websites are suggested here.

126
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,470
See if the target audiences of these campaigns
have been well understood,

127
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,861
if the messages that have been distributed
give the target audience

128
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:38,930
an opportunity to act at their level.

129
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,970
There we go, that's the end of this lesson.

130
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,640
The next episode will be on the Green List
of protected areas.

131
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,860
Have a great day.
