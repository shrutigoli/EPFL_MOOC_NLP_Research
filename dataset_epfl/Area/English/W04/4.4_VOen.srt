00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:26,080
Welcome to today's course, focused on ecological
monitoring of protected areas,

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,510
what it is, what it is for, how to do it.

3
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,230
There are, unfortunately for us, as many materials
to look up,

4
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,790
as there are monitoring processes,
and you can find some models in this PAPACO

5
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,840
study.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,720
Of course, it's far from complete,
so once again I asked Béatrice Chataigner,

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,700
from IUCN PAPACO in Nairobi,
to help us go through it.

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,040
I don't know what the zebra just told her,
but it seems like she's having fun.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,850
Let's see with her what ecological monitoring
actually is.

10
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,110
Ecological monitoring is a set of data collecting
and analysis methods

11
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,080
that will enable to measure the status and
evolution of protected areas' values,

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,010
and that will monitor the threats that these
values might suffer.

13
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,480
If you can recall what was said during the
planning course,

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,400
the values, in fact, are the principal reason
why a protected area is created,

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,380
and these values can be, for instance, the
population of a given animal species,

16
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,840
for which the ecological monitoring will enable
us to know if this species

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,090
continues to survive, if it can survive,
and to understand whether its population can

18
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,079
increase,
and improve over time, and within a given

19
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,329
territory.

20
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:42,149
Keep in mind that each protected area has
its own values.

21
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:44,549
These values aren't the same from one area
to another

22
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,869
because stakeholders' interests when they
set up the values are very different

23
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,859
depending on the protected areas' context,
culture, history, its ecology.

24
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,649
For instance, a community can give a lot of
importance

25
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:01,760
to a particular species, like the hippopotamus,
here on the screen,

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,229
so they might consider that the protected
area's goal

27
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,249
is to ensure the species preservation.

28
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:10,319
In that case, the ecological monitoring will
be centred on the river

29
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,620
where the hippos live.

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,010
Whereas elsewhere,
the hippo might not be a species people want

31
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,840
to preserve,
especially if residents have problems with

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,040
them.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,270
Another example could be where a community,
considers that the value of a protected area

34
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,850
is the water spring
at the centre of it, because this spring turns

35
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,680
into rivers
that communities use everyday for they daily

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,040
activities.

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,150
If that spring is a value,
that spring exists thanks to a river basin

38
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,040
existing nearby,
which captures the water and then pours into

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,849
the spring,
so monitoring the state of health of this

40
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:46,180
spring,
,since it is the value of the protected area,

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,360
is in fact monitoring the state of health
of the river basin.

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,019
A neighboring protected area can have different
values,

43
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,680
so its ecological monitoring will be totally
different

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,599
because it will monitor different values.

45
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,010
There is no unique recipe for ecological monitoring,
it is specific to each protected area.

46
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,310
This is logical.

47
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,720
Planning is of course specific to each protected
area

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,620
and planning heads towards the conservation
of these values.

49
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,049
Ecological monitoring should be, likewise,
adapted to each site,

50
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,560
and intrinsically bound to the values it preserves.

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,920
Ecological monitoring is therefore a method
of assessing

52
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,269
a value's health, seeing how it evolves,
and also taking into account the evolution

53
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:34,280
of the threats it faces,
to see how they were reduced, or not.

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,430
So thanks to this ecological monitoring we
mesure the value's health

55
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,900
to see if the actions carried out
to protect these values succeeded or not.

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,560
And these managing actions stem from the managing
scheme.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,909
In other words, the ecological monitoring
enables us to mesure the impacts

58
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:56,590
of managing actions on the values,
which makes it an essential method to assess

59
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,110
the effectiveness
of the managing scheme in general.

60
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,519
In some ways, it's a barometer
of the effectiveness of the management of

61
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,409
the protected area.

62
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:09,040
To get there, it is necessary for ecological
monitoring to provide

63
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,840
accurate and relevant data on the state and
the evolution of the protected area.

64
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,910
In some cases, time and resources can be lost
collecting useless data.

65
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,160
We can sometimes realise that none of the
real values of the protected area

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,180
are truly measured by direct or indirect data
collected

67
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,110
during the ecological monitoring,
which will obviously restrict the opportunities

68
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:37,200
to make informed decisions for the preservation
of these values.

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Results of ecological monitorings are also
means of communication.

70
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Firstly, with stakeholders committed to the
protected area's management

71
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,660
as it enables us to show them how far we've
come,

72
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,640
what planned actions have taken place, what
impact they've had,

73
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,330
and it's also a simple and efficient tool
to inform other contributors and lessors

74
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,670
on the advancement state of the activities
for the values' conservation.

75
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,660
For that communication to be efficient, you
need the results

76
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,420
of the ecological monitoring to be presented
as a map,

77
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,380
simple, readable, intelligible, understandable
by everybody.

78
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,030
You need to avoid by all means complex unreadable
charts

79
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,470
that nobody can understand.

80
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,200
It is important to use a geographical information
system

81
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,720
that produces complete and readable maps
that everybody will easily read and understand.

82
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,040
But, careful.

83
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,120
Data can be sensitive.

84
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,660
For instance, the exact breakdown of a particularly
poached species

85
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,940
should not be communicated with a large audience.

86
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,560
It's logical.

87
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,890
The rhinoceros, white or black, is a good
example of that.

88
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:50,710
So, in practice,
how do we build and develop the ecological

89
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,750
monitoring of a protected area?

90
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,080
Once we decided to monitor the state of health
of our values,

91
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,090
firstly we need quite a few indicators to
properly mesure the state of health,

92
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,380
and then, there is an important choice to
make about the relevant metrics.

93
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,700
Let's take the example of a protected area
where there are many ecosystems

94
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,570
and the savanna ecosystem is considered to
be the value of the protected area.

95
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,340
So in that case, we'll consider which indicator
we need

96
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,490
to monitor the state of health of this savanna.

97
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,360
In general, what happens is that we monitor
the key ecological attributes,

98
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,080
and that will constitute indicators.

99
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,150
So, what are they?

100
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,530
It can be for example some features
of the vegetal and animal populations forming

101
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,770
this savanna,
and the indicators that we will monitor

102
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,280
could be the size of the population of a particular
vegetal species,

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,860
that could be a very fragile one, or a fragile
animal species,

104
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,050
and this will ascertain the threshold of the
savanna ecosystem's health.

105
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,290
It can also be the geographical breakdown
of the vegetal and animal species,

106
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,960
or its intra-population composition.

107
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,330
When selecting these indicators, we have to
choose the most relevant

108
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,100
amongst a large set of indicators we could
monitor.

109
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,150
Once we made that choice, it is important
to ensure

110
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,210
that the metrics will inform us on the state
of health,

111
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,780
whether it improves or not,
to make sure that we will have data, whatever

112
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,020
scenario happens.

113
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,970
Let's take a simple example to illustrate
this idea.

114
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,080
We know that the elephants have a visible
effect on the forest cover,

115
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,530
because as they move and feed themselves
they break trees, eat the barks, etc.

116
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,290
So we have a direct effect,
a direct link between elephant density

117
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,000
and the quantity of broken trees in the area
where they move and live.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:08:01,750
We could use as an indicator, for instance,
the health of the forest cover.

119
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,400
If we have many broken trees,
we can assume that the elephant density is

120
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,300
quite high in the area.

121
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,340
But then imagine, that, for example,
the elephant population has been suddenly

122
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,560
eradicated by poachers
so elephants would all have disappeared,

123
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,390
but not the broken trees, still standing there,
which means that this indicator we chose would

124
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,720
still be there,
accounting for a large elephant population,

125
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,810
while in fact they would all have been killed
overnight by poachers.

126
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,520
For each type of indicator to monitor,
there are in fact many data collection protocols

127
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,190
that we can use,
there is really quite a large number of them.

128
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,640
We can either take a census over the whole
territory, exhaustively,

129
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,220
or we can proceed to sampling.

130
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,530
This can be done by foot, by car, by plane,
depending on the environment and the conditions.

131
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:53,120
But each method has its own protocol
that has to be followed in a very strict manner.

132
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,680
Sometimes, we will count a species, sometimes,
we will count individuals.

133
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,180
Sometimes, we will only count tracks, indirect
evidence.

134
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,660
But anyway, we always choose the monitoring
method

135
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,250
that will end up being the most profitable
on a price-efficiency ratio.

136
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,250
What does this mean?

137
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,500
It means that we will choose a method that
will give the best possible quality

138
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,370
both in terms of quantity of data, and frequency
collection,

139
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,420
and to make sure that it will be done at a
lesser cost.

140
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,879
There are many methods, that we can't all
list here,

141
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:31,600
some are more frequently used than others,
though.

142
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,690
For instance, those that you will find in
the appendix of the study

143
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,560
carried out by PAPACO on ecological monitoring.

144
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,110
A commonly used method is photo trapping,
sometimes video trapping,

145
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,879
which enables us to observe what happens in
the ecosystem

146
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,550
without disturbing wildlife.

147
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,540
On the screen you can see some results of
the ecological monitoring

148
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,699
in the National Park of Lopé, Gabon,
that's the park where our university diploma

149
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:04,610
is run.

150
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,279
There.

151
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,829
Some interesting images, quite gratifying
to see.

152
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,680
Be careful next time that you go for a walk
in the forest.

153
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,170
Obviously, Big Brother is everywhere.

154
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,089
But do not mix up ecological monitoring and
research.

155
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:32,120
Research aims to answer a scientific question
to explain an event or a situation.

156
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,329
It is an important element in the protected
area management,

157
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,430
but rarely a daily tool in territory management.

158
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,759
Of course, those two are complementary and
can information can be shared.

159
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,620
In practice, it is true that data from ecological
monitoring

160
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,550
is useful to trigger research work,
because thanks to the collected data, coming

161
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,839
from ecological monitoring,
we can see evolutions appear, and then, we

162
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,550
can ask questions,
scientific questions that research will aim

163
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,110
to answer.

164
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,339
It helps to formulate research questions,
but keep in mind that it isn't the main goal

165
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:11,370
of ecological monitoring.

166
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,220
To sum up, ecological monitoring is a central
element

167
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,249
of the protected area management,
because it is a way to mesure the management

168
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:22,949
impacts on values
and consequently, to redirect management if

169
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:23,949
needed.

170
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:29,949
So, it is essential to have it set up
and run by the protected area managers themselves,

171
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:34,819
and not to leave that to external contractors,
who have no responsibility in the territory

172
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,759
management.

173
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,310
Take time to think about a protected area
you know

174
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,480
and try to define elements that the ecological
monitoring should mesure

175
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,550
according to the values of the territory and
the threats it faces.

176
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,269
Then try the opposite exercice,
read about already set up ecological monitorings

177
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:01,540
to see if they monitor the values of the protected
area or not.

178
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,749
You could be very surprised with the results.

179
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:06,350
Here we are, it is the end of this class.

180
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,589
In the next episode, we'll talk about raising
awareness for conservation.

181
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:11,589
Have an excellent day!

182
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:12,589
A partnership between André Hoffmann, Ecole
Polythechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,

183
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:13,589
and IUCN.

184
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:13,600
