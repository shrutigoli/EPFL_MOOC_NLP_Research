00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,180
Hello.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,730
In this lesson we will discuss surveillance,
which is a key feature in managing a protected

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,269
area.

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:19,720
Protected areas require surveillance,
firstly to ensure compliance with laws and

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,720
regulations.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,660
Of course, if all concerned parties have been
involved

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,960
in drafting the management plan,
it will be more likely that these laws will

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,289
be well-understood and followed.

9
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:33,300
However, this is not always the case.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,470
Things change, communities move,
the context will evolve,

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,730
and so, well-organised surveillance is vital.

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,531
In this lesson, we're going to look
at the different elements involved in a surveillance

13
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:47,820
system.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,500
(man) I've been around since 1999.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:01,010
Initially, it was more about larger vessels,
because industrial fishing, was what was dangerous.

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,700
Since then, we almost have industrial fishing
under control.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,210
No vessel today would consider entering the
PNBA.

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,050
We have to board fewer ships
as fines have increased.

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:20,230
Before, people paid 4,800 per person,
and they would be immobilized for 15 days.

20
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,880
Now however, since it's 100,000 ouguiyas per
dugout,

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,420
people are thinking twice.

22
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,260
We are talking about a system, or surveillance
setup.

23
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,930
This cannot be improvised,
or if it is, it has to be done in a planned

24
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,230
way.

25
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,700
For it to be effective, surveillance needs
to take a number

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,860
of means and requirements into account.

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,340
We're going to look at all of these characteristics.

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:51,030
Firstly, the means and equipment required,
then the training of the teams,

29
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,970
the organisation of patrols,
the different levels of surveillance

30
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,530
which must be complementary and organized.

31
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,710
We'll touch on the requirement of financing.

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,390
And lastly, we'll discuss data submission
and how to capitalize on surveillance.

33
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,819
Firstly, means and equipment.

34
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:12,370
Surveillance is generally done in a vehicle
or a boat

35
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,170
for maritime surveillance, as you can see
in this example,

36
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,010
but also on foot.

37
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,579
This is often an area of high expenditure.

38
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:26,639
For maritime surveillance, we're talking
about the purchase of speedboats and land

39
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,590
vehicles.

40
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,590
All this is very costly.

41
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,819
Maintenance is expensive too.

42
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:39,749
So it's important to secure sufficient funding
to invest in and to run this surveillance.

43
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:42,739
In this case, please note that poachers are
well-equipped.

44
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:47,629
Secondly, teams need to be trained.

45
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:51,069
You will have noticed
that the evolution of poaching means that

46
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:56,989
staff training in parks is vital
for their mission of protection to succeed.

47
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,809
Surveillance cannot simply consist
in stopping poachers.

48
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:04,609
The mission requires tight relationships with
the communities,

49
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:10,099
and so, an important part of surveillance
consists in explaining, clarifying,

50
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,810
alerting ,and raising awareness among communities
and visitors.

51
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,079
Things don't end when an act of poaching is
found.

52
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:22,459
It is up to guards to board and detain offenders,
and this is a tricky step

53
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,620
which requires method and experience.

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,209
So, in terms of training, please note these
points:

55
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,859
1) Teams must be fully aware of the rules
and regulations

56
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,790
of the site in question.

57
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,639
This seems obvious, but needs to be said.

58
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,519
2) It's vital to acquire the methods and tools
for negotiation.

59
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:49,469
3) They must have certain communication skills
so as to inform communities and to talk.

60
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,529
Please note that in certain countries in Africa,
the management of protected areas is undertaken

61
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:58,189
by civilians,
whereas in many other countries, such as the

62
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:01,510
Ivory Coast,
or the Democratic Republic of Congo,

63
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,469
managment and surveillance is carried out
by military bodies.

64
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:09,129
The organisation of patrols.

65
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:13,189
The organisation of patrols and surveillance
must be dissuasive,

66
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:16,340
and based on a strong presence on the ground.

67
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,549
There is a high chance for poachers and offenders
to be caught.

68
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:25,620
So teams on the ground must be optimally distributed
according to available resources,

69
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,669
and given the means
to be able to get around quickly based on

70
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,289
information,
to conduct both planned and random patrols,

71
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:37,080
for instance at night,
based on information received,

72
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,120
or even to improvise a response to new information.

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,210
The work of surveillance teams must be monitored
so as to be able to assess their activity

74
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,120
on the ground
and the areas covered by patrols.

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,490
The use of GPS now enables coverage to be
mapped

76
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,870
and to see which areas are monitored per day,
per patrol

77
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,490
or over longer periods.

78
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,000
Now let's look at this example
of maritime surveillance patrols

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,600
in the PNBA.

80
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,539
There are several levels of surveillance
and I'd like to insist on the complementarity

81
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:59,180
of these different levels.

82
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,990
Surveillance patrols must be on the field,
in speedboats or cars or on foot.

83
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,499
They must be able to get to locations
and also to be able to communicate with the

84
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:12,990
populations,
so as to intervene directly.

85
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,370
But there is also a extra level which is much
wider.

86
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:23,080
Today, with the help of GPS and aerial techniques,
surveillance can be carried out more remotely.

87
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,800
Then, groups on the field can intervene.

88
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,539
Let's look at the example of the PNBA, which
has

89
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:33,130
both surveillance on the field with surveillance
speedboats

90
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,529
as well as a radar station
which enables flying over and seeing the whole

91
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,140
maritime area.

92
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,589
There are also guards on the field.

93
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,600
It's very important
that these two complement each other.

94
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,320
I would like to draw your attention to the
fact that well-organized

95
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,959
and well-understood surveillance
will be able to include community participation

96
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,280
on top of that of the guards
and professional surveillance

97
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,820
and that of military bodies.

98
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,200
Let's look together at the example of the
PNBA,

99
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,100
for which tripartite surveillance has delivered
results.

100
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,470
Data submission is very important.

101
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,370
After a patrol, guards will submit
a certain amount of information

102
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,180
to their surveillance team.

103
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,430
Here again, you can see the example of the
PNBA.

104
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,149
All instances of boarding
which took place in the maritime territory

105
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,690
have been geo-logged.

106
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,180
And you can see over a 10-month period in
2009,

107
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,130
the map for boardings of "lanches" (non-motored
boats) and dugouts,

108
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,709
either from inside or the outside.

109
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:40,680
It's this type of tool that enables analyses,
and to determine where surveillance needs

110
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,070
to be increased,
and where its best understood,

111
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,870
or at which places changes and threats are
occurring.

112
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,800
By now you'll know that surveillance is a
key factor

113
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,400
in the effective running of a protected area.

114
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:04,130
Today's poachers are using more and more sophisticated
methods.

115
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,050
Surveillance teams and guards
must be able to compete with them

116
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,870
in a complementary way,
listening to the populations.

117
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,639
Frequently, tripartite teams have proven their
worth

118
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,610
and have communicated their results in a way
that enables communities

119
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,510
to better understand the role of surveillance.

120
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,910
Thank you.

121
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,430
That's this section over.

122
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,490
Good day.
