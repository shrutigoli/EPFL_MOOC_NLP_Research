Hello and welcome to this fourth module of
this MOOC

2
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,180
on protected areas management in Africa.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,510
This module focuses on protected areas management
effectiveness.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,520
In short, how to obtain the best results for
conservation.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,940
So this week, the module will be structured
in the following way.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,770
In the first lesson, we will look at this
notion of management effectiveness

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,600
and the different tools we have to evaluate
it in protected areas.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,850
The second lesson concerns
a particular aspect of the work in protected

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,070
areas,
namely surveillance of the territory and law

10
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,310
enforcement.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,039
Ecological monitoring, the cornerstone to
impact assessment

12
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,829
will be the subject of the third lesson.

13
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,960
In the fourth lesson we will discuss education
on conservation,

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,409
an essential subject for the future
and that we could do an entire MOOC about.

15
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:04,930
The fifth lesson tackles an approach, which
is just developing,

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,890
to know and recognize the best protected areas
in terms of management and governance,

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,120
which we call the Green List.

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,990
The last lesson concerns our weekly convention
and we will talk about world heritage this

19
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,460
time.

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:27,590
Finally, we will have a quick recap
of the important points discussed this week

21
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,159
in the form of an animation
and your assignment, which relates to that,

22
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,140
will be given out.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,460
So here we go.

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,049
Have an excellent fourth week with us.
