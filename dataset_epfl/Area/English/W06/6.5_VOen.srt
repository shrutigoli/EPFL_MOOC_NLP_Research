1
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,420
In this sequence, we will address the different
mechanisms 

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,309
that can be put in place to collect the funds
for protected areas.

3
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,460
note that I include here a special focus
on conservation trust funds, which

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,720
are mechanism and funding sources
that can enable innovative and additional

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,640
funding to be collected
to contribute to the financial sustainability

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,269
of protected areas
in the medium and long term.

7
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:36,610
Funding of protected areas can be obtained
through different channels.

8
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,890
Here are three in particular: projects by
various donors;

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:47,500
budgetary support from the government;
and finally, trust funds for conservation.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,019
Note as well the first point which is: setting
up a bank account.

11
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,450
Setting up a bank account
could be very beneficial to a park,

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:01,339
for example it helps to collect donations
from visitors, friends of the park.

13
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:07,220
However, it is clear that setting up a bank
account is not always easy.

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,090
Let's first of all have a look at the project
mechanisms.

15
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,710
Projects by donor agencies are frequently
a main source of fundings

16
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,969
for protected areas in Africa.

17
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:21,240
Here's the example of Masoala National Park
in Madagascar

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,369
over the 2009 to 2012 period.

19
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:29,009
Notice the successive projects from different
funding partners:

20
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:36,340
Zurich Zoo, here; WCS;
a project by KFW; a project by CI;

21
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,389
a project by the region Nord-Pas de Calais,
etc.

22
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:44,049
Note that the project funding are not always
transferred

23
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,350
into the protected area bank accounts.

24
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,350
We can then have various separate accounting
systems

25
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,829
and it is sometimes hard to consolidate everything,
as it was done here.

26
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,579
Notice as well that each funding partner may
have its own conditions and prerequisites.

27
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,359
Submitting a project, to, for example, the
GEF—

28
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,479
and the GEF-6 is on its way—
requires a certain level of skill,

29
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,300
writing skills and project implementation
skills.

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,930
In terms of fundraising from donor agencies,
I invite you to have a look at this little

31
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,260
guide:
Institutional Fundraising for Conservation

32
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,220
Projects
by Maaike Manten and Caroline Pridham for

33
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,380
BirdLife International.

34
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,910
This little guide offers a variety of options,
filled with experience, case studies that

35
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,989
can guide you as you prepare projects
intended for institutional sponsors.

36
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,180
Please don't hesitate to refer to it.

37
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,180
Budgetary support: we have mentioned it,
governmental and state support can be significant.

38
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,590
Support from governments represents more than
60% of funding for protected areas.

39
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,950
Also note that a protected area is a public
good.

40
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,459
It is therefore the state's responsibility
to ensure it continues to function.

41
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,829
Government funding
can come from several places:

42
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:07,549
of course, from annual public expenditure,
decreed by the government;

43
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:12,910
also from revenue from fines and taxes;
from mechanisms of converting debts with foreign

44
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,870
powers;
from payments for ecosystem services;

45
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,989
but also from exploitation agreements,
for example compensation from the fishing

46
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,140
agreements;
from income from the extractive industries;

47
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,299
and also from budgetary and institutional
support from external funding agencies.

48
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,659
It is important that protected areas managers
are fully involved in negotiations to find

49
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,380
agreements
for these different options.

50
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,299
It is, of course, the manager's role to convince
and to emphasize

51
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,379
the importance of the values of these goods
and services

52
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,250
of the protected area,
just as we saw in sequence 6.2.

53
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,799
Also, notice that once the compensation and
the funds

54
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,989
have been allocated to the government,
it will then be necessary to ensure the revenue

55
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:05,970
is received by the protected area.

56
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:12,620
Sometimes, that isn't easy.

57
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,749
Let's now have a look at conservation trust
funds.

58
00:04:15,749 --> 00:04:19,549
Before going any further,
I would just like to highlight two reference

59
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,140
books.

60
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,690
On one hand, Rapid Review of Conservation
Trust Funds,

61
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,540
in English here, and in French here, published
in 2008.

62
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,470
On the other hand, there is
Practice Standards for Conservation Trust

63
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,730
Funds.

64
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,050
All of a group of colleague's experience,
expertise

65
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,039
has been put in this book, in this guide to
introduce the best practices

66
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:48,580
in terms of running, operating
and creating conservation trust funds.

67
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,169
These are very precious guides.

68
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:53,430
What is a conservation trust fund?

69
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,039
The accepted definition, the one suggested
in the 2008 Rapid Review

70
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,069
and reused in publications by CFA, is the
following:

71
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:06,820
Conservation Trust Funds are private,
legally independent institutions,

72
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,729
that provide sustainable financing for biodiversity
conservation

73
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:13,670
and often finance part of the long-term management
costs

74
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:18,509
of a country‘s protected area (PA) system,
as well as conservation

75
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:31,780
and sustainable development initiatives separate
from protected areas.

76
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,080
The core focus of conservation trust funds
is to raise funds from various sources

77
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,860
and to transfer the revenue or the funds in
the form of donations

78
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,430
to multiple programs and field projects.

79
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,780
Therefore, conservation trust funds are above
all a financial institution

80
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,699
that raises additional, innovative funds
to benefit conservation actions through grants

81
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:58,930
to protected areas, to conservation partners.

82
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,110
It is a legally independant organization,
we have mentioned that,

83
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:09,139
which is governed by a joint board of directors,
generally with representatives of donor agencies,

84
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,889
government,
civil society, but also with qualified individuals,

85
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:20,170
mainly in terms of finance, investment,
regarding conservation and fund raising.

86
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,110
Finally, it's a mechanism that can manage
several accounts

87
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,450
for different objectives.

88
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:30,820
They are generally endowment funds, where
income funds the subsidies.

89
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,660
But there can also be a sinking find or revolving
funds.

90
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,729
We will have a look at that in a moment.

91
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:41,330
Let's have a look at the map of conservation
trust funds.

92
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,580
Today, there are about 80 conservation trust
funds

93
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,250
in the world,
but this number is increasing, since there

94
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,400
is greater interest
in trust funds from donor agencies and protected

95
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,210
areas themselves.

96
00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:01,639
The collected capital is estimated to be around
800 million, possibly more.

97
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,120
Notice that the distribution is mainly in
the Latin and Central American region,

98
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,020
but trust funds in Africa are developing and
more and more of those institutions

99
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,250
are being established in African countries.

100
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,380
Let's have a look at the situation in Africa.

101
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,319
In Africa, there are around 20 of these institutions
today.

102
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,849
Most of them were established at the end of
the 1990s,

103
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:32,220
mainly in east Africa, and set up to serve
to one or several protected areas.

104
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,320
There was a second wave of funds created after
2002.

105
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,860
So one can consider that they are still at
the initial stage of functioning and capitalizing,

106
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,520
essentially in the centre and in the west.

107
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,759
The average capitalization is still low,
around 10 million.

108
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,500
But it is increasing,
and more and more sponsors and partners are

109
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,789
interested in this tool
and they are feeling ready to invest in trust

110
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:00,460
funds.

111
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,849
Therefore, financial support mainly comes
from GEF

112
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:09,460
or bilateral donors,
like KFW, AFD,

113
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,800
who have clear support policies regarding
trust funds.

114
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,699
International NGOs and private foundations
also contribute.

115
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,199
Trust funds are financial institutions,
just as their name indicates.

116
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,439
They therefore should have attractive financial
returns.

117
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:33,260
And yet, financial returns these last years
have been similar to the benchmark indexes:

118
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,380
more than 9%
in 2013,

119
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,470
which is interesting.

120
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:43,390
Over a period of 3 to 5 years, there is a
return close to 7%,

121
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,950
which is similar to what many funds aim for.

122
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,680
More and more, donor agencies consider conservation
trust funds

123
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,279
to be promising tools.

124
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,930
They have developed general policies in favour
of trust funds.

125
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,570
It has been recognized that these institutions
are able

126
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,410
to generate a significant income over the
long term.

127
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,490
So, they can contribute
to the financial sustainability of protected

128
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,870
areas.

129
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,390
Nevertheless, take note that there are still
issues

130
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,120
regarding the effectiveness of these institutions.

131
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,920
First of all, in terms of the impact on biodiversity,
but also in terms of the quality of the governance

132
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,190
and the level of financial return
when financial markets are volatile.

133
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,920
So there are still many issues, but there
is a lot of good interest

134
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,350
for this mechanism that aims to complement
other mechanisms that we have studied,

135
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:47,550
namely projects and budgetary funding by
the government.

136
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:54,810
To finish off, I have asked my colleague,
Doctor Fanny N'golo, Executive Director

137
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,070
for the Foundation for the Parks and Reserves
of Ivory Coast,

138
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,300
to give us his opinion, his opinion as trust
funds practioner,

139
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,720
and to tell us about the Ivory Coast foundation's
experience.

140
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,230
Let's listen to him.

141
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,370
To what extent do the Ivory Coast trust funds
financially contribute

142
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,480
to the functioning of protected areas in the
country?

143
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,990
The Foundation for the Parks and Reserves
of Ivory Coast is a trust fund

144
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,010
created in 2004,
and at this point,

145
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:29,340
the foundation finances four national parks
in Ivory Coast,

146
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,630
which represents more than 80%
of the total area of the network of protected

147
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,360
areas in Ivory Coast.

148
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,730
For 2015 fiscal year, the foundation has brought
in nearly three million euros

149
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,560
for the Ivorian Office for Parks to manage
these four parks.

150
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,740
Our aim in the medium term, is therefore to,
of course, manage

151
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,500
to maintain this level of funding, i.e. three
million euros per year.

152
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,670
Mr. N'golo, in your opinion, what are the
biggest challenges

153
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,710
that conservation trust funds face in Africa?

154
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,780
With regards to conservation trust funds in
Africa,

155
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,470
there are two major challenges.

156
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:13,279
The first challenge is being able to sustain
this financial mechanism

157
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,730
that is this trust fund.

158
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,700
And the second challenge is raising funds.

159
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:25,940
Indeed, most of the financial resources
in trust funds come from donations,

160
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:32,760
and unfortunately, the tradition of giving
has not caught on that much in Africa.

161
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,970
For this reason, there needs to be a good
strategy for fund raising.

162
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,680
That is still a major challenge.

163
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,040
In your opinion, what are the foundation's
biggest successes?

164
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,080
Regarding the Cote d’Ivoire foundation,
there are three big successes.

165
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,420
The first is the members that make up the
board of directors.

166
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,540
Indeed, the board of directors
is composed of competent and committed people.

167
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,389
The second big challenge was being able to
gather,

168
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:08,020
during a slightly turbulent period in Ivory
Coast,

169
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,300
nearly 31 million euros, and that is therefore
a key element.

170
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,880
And finally, we think that the Ivory Coast
foundation

171
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,670
is an institution well positioned at the national
level,

172
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,860
because it is a respected institution, that
people listen to,

173
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,110
and that also has an opinion about all of
the conservation problems

174
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,020
in the national parks in Ivory Coast.

175
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,880
Can you give us the three factors
that lead to the success of conservation trust

176
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,920
funds?

177
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,149
In Africa, for trust funds to succeed,
I think there are three factors that play

178
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:48,389
a role.

179
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:51,459
The first factor involves the management team.

180
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:55,740
There needs to be a good team, at the level
of the board of directors,

181
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,590
as well as at the level of the executive management.

182
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,740
The second important element is to apply a
good governance

183
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,370
when managing the foundation.

184
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,560
Daily managing must, of course, be based on
good governance.

185
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,160
And finally, the third important factor
is to have a good return on investments, of

186
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,329
course.

187
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:20,000
All in all,
the aim is ultimately to be able to gather

188
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,740
enough funds
for the conservation of the park,

189
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,640
or more generally, for conservation.

190
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,089
There, this sequence is now finished.

191
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,410
You should now understand
that financial sustainability of a protected

192
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,519
area
relies on interactions between several mechanisms.

193
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,579
The sources of finance must be varied,
the financial mechanisms must be varied,

194
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:47,519
and there must be a whole range, short term,
small grants,

195
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,310
medium term, long term,
to be able to really target

196
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,450
financial sustainability for the protected
area.

197
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,470
I suggest you visit whenever you want the
CFA website,

198
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,290
the Conservation Finance Alliance website;
the link is here.

199
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,630
It is bursting with information, case studies
and facts,

200
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,269
in particular on conservation trust funds.

201
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:10,860
Thank you and have a good day.
