1
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:10,580
In this first episode, we are going to look
together

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,839
at the basic concept of financial planning.

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,199
This is about assessing several things.

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,529
On the one hand, the needs of a protected
area,

5
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,000
identifying possible revenue, funding deficiencies.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,820
Then studying preconditions for the set up
of any financial mechanism.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,849
Is this possible?

8
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:29,849
Feasible?

9
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,940
Do institutional, legislative conditions,
the capacity of a protected area

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,030
lead it to the establishment of a certain
mechanism?

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,070
And finally to consolidate everything,
it is recommended to develop a business plan;

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,850
we will look at that together in part three.

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,260
First and foremost, let's look at financial
requirements.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,260
When identifying financial requirements, note
that it is important

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,539
on the one hand, to make the link between
the management plan's objectives,

16
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,629
in terms of activity, required investment,
and this, based on needs and priorities over

17
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,770
time,
and I will come back to this soon.

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:12,630
Secondly, to study opportunities to reduce
costs, optimization.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,340
Also to take into account the effectiveness
of the financial management system of a protected

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,060
area,
that is the accounting system, the classification

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,920
of expenditure,
cash flow management, transparency of financial

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,770
data
and the requirements of audits.

23
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,040
I cannot emphasize enough, the need for good
skills

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,189
when it comes to the financial management
for a protected area.

25
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,240
Also to analyse carefully
the actual financial situation of previous

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,439
years.

27
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,009
But keep in mind
that budgets for protected areas are generally

28
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,119
determined,
depending on available funds

29
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,950
and not on the actual needs of a protected
area.

30
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,090
This management by default is of course a
pragmatic one,

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,869
but it does not always allow us to see good
results on the field,

32
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,409
hence the need to set up a business plan.

33
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,850
And finally, extrapolating future needs.

34
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,789
As I have mentioned,
the financial needs of a protected area are

35
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:09,229
to be evaluated
depending on the management plan's goals and

36
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,619
activities.

37
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,510
But you will have noted that a protected area's
financial needs

38
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,060
are also dependent on its life cycle.

39
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,120
Financial needs and priorities are not the
same

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,129
throughout the life of a protected area.

41
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:27,650
Let's look at a fictional example
of a protected area's budget over 20 years.

42
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,840
At the very beginning of the life cycle of
the protected area

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,760
in the identification phase,
we note the great financial needs

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,010
for monitoring,
for scientific expertise, to determine baseline

45
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,819
situations.

46
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,790
Fairly important needs
also in consultation with the communities,

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,650
with all interested parties.

48
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:58,440
Then, in the creation phase,
often supported by donors, by projects.

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,540
It is at this time that the infrastructure
of the protected area is built,

50
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,120
that personnel is recruited,
which are important needs.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,330
Then throughout the operations,
of the protected area in an operational phase,

52
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,170
budgets are more or less balanced.

53
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,239
However, you will note the differences.

54
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,290
For example, here,
with a tourism project,

55
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,620
a donor project most likely.

56
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,900
A little further on, we have a community development
project.

57
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,930
Still a little further on,
a conservation project or a restoration project.

58
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,110
You can see that these different projects
involve jumps

59
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,900
in the budget of a protected area.

60
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,680
You will have understood that on the basis
of identifying

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,870
the protected area's needs,
the identification of plausible sources of

62
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,400
finance,
we can identify the shortfall, the funding

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,580
gap.

64
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,810
Before searching for potential funding,
it is important to look at preconditions,

65
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,860
on the one hand, in society, in that country,
and also the protected area's own capacities.

66
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,080
Firstly we will look at the preconditions
on a macro level.

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,729
Are the roles and the values of the sites
and ecosystems assessed and shared by all?

68
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:22,880
Do general policies fully recognise the roles
and values of the MPA?

69
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,120
And have laws been adopted
that implement these PUBLIC policies?

70
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:35,130
Are there technical capacities, abilities,
able to develop certain financing options?

71
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,390
And finally, is there a system of governance
that provides

72
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:44,570
and emphasizes the values of transparency,
responsibility and confidence?

73
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,270
The key questions to ask.

74
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,600
Firstly a practical question.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,460
Which mechanism can be set up the most efficiently?

76
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,849
Then, we look at the current legal
and administrative provisions of the country

77
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:00,779
which can allow for the SET UPof the new mechanism.

78
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:08,760
Are difficulties anticipated in administrating,
implementing, in raising or distributing funds?

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,150
Look to see if this new mechanism
will be seen as fair and legitimate.

80
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,550
And I emphasize this point:
the financial collection mechanism must be

81
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,659
seen
to be fair and legitimate

82
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:22,909
by all the parties involved.

83
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:26,729
We look at the support by the interested stakeholders
and government

84
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,010
for setting up this new mechanism.

85
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,659
And finally, we remain vigilant to the environmental
impact

86
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:37,280
of this mechanism on the protected area's
goods and services.

87
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,130
To consolidate all this information,
we will prepare what we call a business plan.

88
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,120
The business plan is used in all sectors of
the economy.

89
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,050
It serves to compare different options
and to study the financial viability of a

90
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:59,150
certain initiative.

91
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,839
Adapted to protected areas,
the business plan allows us to maximize environmental

92
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,160
results
with an often limited financial contribution.

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,250
It allows the comparison between different
options in the long term

94
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:18,980
and future planning, to better plan incomes
and financial needs of a protected area.

95
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:25,959
The business plan must allow to put into perspective
over five to ten years, on the one hand, expected

96
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,720
expenditure,
investments, personnel, operations, activities,

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,330
and on the other hand, expected revenue,
self-financing, national budget, donors

98
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,779
and projects and other mechanisms.

99
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,500
Note that is a tool of internal management
which gives us a technical and financial long

100
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,520
term vision.

101
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,250
You will have noted that protected area budgets
are generally determined based on available

102
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,720
funds.

103
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,330
A business plan allows us to implement
and identify the actual needs of a protected

104
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,460
area.

105
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,240
It allows us to determine priority investments.

106
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,380
Also, don't forget, the business plan,
allows us to communicate and present a clear

107
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,649
and concise view
of the activity of a protected area in the

108
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:17,130
long term
and to show financial needs.

109
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:22,500
Here you can see a fictional example, once
again, of a business plan.

110
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,990
Don't be concerned with all the numbers,
it's just to give you an idea.

111
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,580
This table has been adapted from the business
plan

112
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,270
of the Iwokrama protected area in Guyana.

113
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,320
You will note that expenditure is organized
based on activity programs.

114
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,589
conservation expenses,
administration, Etc. it's a good thing.

115
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,330
This allows us to make the connection with
the management plan.

116
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,430
You will note that revenue is defined as best
as possible

117
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,149
according to information, and outlook,
and total revenue,

118
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,210
whether from sales, tourism revenue,
merchandise, and handicrafts,

119
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:05,160
is recorded and extrapolated over the coming
years.

120
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:12,590
Finally, you'll note that we can identify...
the gap, the shortcomings,

121
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,000
throughout the five years of the business
plan.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,330
THEN It's about, for THE protected area, to
identify fundraising actions

123
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,060
marketing
and external relations to bridge this gap.

124
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,940
The procedure to elaborate the business plan
is well defined in this guide

125
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,360
which I suggest you take a look at.

126
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,149
It is a guide on how to formulate a simplified
business plan

127
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:42,340
for protected areas
written by Benjamin Landreau for FIBA.

128
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,940
Note particularly the different stages.

129
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,930
Firstly, define the process of the business
plan.

130
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,089
Who is in charge?

131
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,660
What consultations are necessary?

132
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,930
Then, analyze past financial execution.

133
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:02,440
Then, determine the medium and long term needs,
investments, operating expenses,

134
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,160
salaries, staffing requirements.

135
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,980
Then, indicate the existing sources of finance
and extrapolate potential revenue.

136
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,690
Finally, analyze the funding gap and different
possible scenarios

137
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,280
and evaluate other sources of funding.

138
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,250
This episode has given you the basics on financial
planning.

139
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,120
Note that striving for financial sustainability
is essential for a protected area.

140
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,770
It is about identifying financial requirements
in the long term,

141
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,860
studying and evaluating the preconditions
of the country, the site

142
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,860
and the protected area itself
and to define financing options.

143
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,190
And all this generally within the framework
of a business plan.

144
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,570
Several reference manuals are available.

145
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,430
I have suggested one of them.

146
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,850
I also invite you to have a look at the UNDP's
BIOFIN website,

147
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,290
the work of the TEEB initiative,
mine is blue, this is green, but...

148
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:06,860
The Economy of Ecosystems and Biodiversity,
a guide which will be available very soon,

149
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,410
Financial Planning for National Systems of
Protected Areas,

150
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,270
and finally, the reference guide, Sustainable
Financing of Protected Areas,

151
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,580
A Global Review of Challenges and Options.

152
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,540
We have reached the end of this episode.

153
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,160
I suggest you have a look at the reference
materials

154
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,390
and I wish you a good day.
