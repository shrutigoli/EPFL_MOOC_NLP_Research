1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,430
Hello.

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,570
In this sequence we will talk about the options
in terms of financing sources for protected

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,570
areas.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,100
A number of documents and reference guides
are available.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,500
I would recommend this one : Guide to Conservation
Finance

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,380
published by WWF in 2009.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,699
An excellent guide that contains almost
all of the options and financing sources that

8
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,699
exist.

9
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,640
It only exists in English.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,340
I also invite you to read two texts, again
from WWF,

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,129
Raising revenues for Protected Areas - a menu
of options, published in May 2001

12
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,410
and another guide, more specific on marine
conservation:

13
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,289
Financing Marine Conservation, a manual of
options

14
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:58,270
from 2004, by Melissa Moye and Boris Spergel.

15
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,890
I also invite you to look up these two websites.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,950
First, the Toolbox developed for the RAMPAO
the West African Marine Protected Areas Network,

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,200
to guide and assist them in setting up
sustainable financing mechanisms.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,020
Finally, on the website of the Conservation
Finance Alliance or CFA, you will find

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,810
a significant amount of information, guidelines,
references, and experts' advice.

20
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,950
Feel free to have a look at it.

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,689
Before we look at possible sources of funding
for Protected Areas,

22
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,479
let's first take a look at the deficits.

23
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,090
It is commonly accepted that Protected Areas
and their management

24
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,049
are suffering from great budgetary deficits,
especially in developing countries.

25
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:44,620
Recent studies have underlined a deficit in
funding

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:51,000
in developing countries ranging from $1 to
1.7 billion per year

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,550
regarding management of existing Protected
Areas.

28
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,000
The study showed here: Financial Cost of Meeting
Global

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,159
biodiversity conservation targets current
spending and unmet needs

30
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,469
published in Science magazine, underlines
that current expenditures

31
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,490
are no higher than $0.5 billion per year.

32
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,150
And that the additional needs,
only for the management of current Protected

33
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,000
Areas,
would be of $1.09 billion per year.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Finally, that additional needs, would there
be an extension

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,720
of the Protected Areas network, as advised
by the Aichi targets

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,459
would amount to an extra $1.69 billion.

37
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:40,730
Stuart Butchard from Birdlife International
pointed out, at the World Parks Congress,

38
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,040
that current spendings have to be at least
doubled

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,540
to guarantee the efficient management of existing
Protected Areas

40
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,470
in developing countries, and increase by a
factor of 6

41
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,769
to ensure efficient management on a bigger
network.

42
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:59,080
The goal is thus to find additional funding
sources for Protected Areas.

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,000
Together let's look at the different options.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
First, budgetary contributions
from the State and governments.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,090
Then, we will look at
individual donors' contribution, often in

46
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,010
the form of projects.

47
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:19,420
Finally, private resources, which we can call
auto-financing of Protected Areas.

48
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,310
Public Funding allocated to Protected areas
is an essential part of their budget.

49
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,920
On average, this public funding amounts to
around 60%

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,760
of the funds made available for Protected
Areas.

51
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,959
It's an average, it is certainly less than
that

52
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,120
in developing countries.

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,750
But that means it's important to reach out
to government bodies,

54
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,110
especially the department of Finance,
to explain, present, and negociate budgets.

55
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,980
For further information on this topic, I invite
you to refer to this guide

56
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,440
which should come out soon, and is based on
the experience

57
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,379
of 3 Latin American countries : Chile, Guatemala
and Peru.

58
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:02,879
A popular option is calling to individual
donors

59
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,410
in the form of projects.

60
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,670
You all know the project management cycle.

61
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,500
Who are these individual donors?

62
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,489
The main ones are bilateral donors:
foreign cooperations, German, French,

63
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:25,010
through the KFW, the AFD, multilateral cooperations
like the GEF (Global Environment Facility).

64
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:31,260
GEF 6 is on its way
and should propose significant grants to Protected

65
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,330
Areas.

66
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,110
There are also international NGOs.

67
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,640
In Africa WWF, IUCN, Conservation International,
Nature Conservancy

68
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,670
MacArthur, Wildlife Conservation Society,
all these international organizations

69
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,950
are present in Africa and can offer contributions.

70
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,170
There are also private foundations, sometimes
significant in some countries.

71
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,470
Other than substantial projects, you should
know that you can

72
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,660
call on small subsidies.

73
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,360
Again, there are many types of organizations
that make available

74
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,510
those small grants for Protected Areas
In terms of private and direct resources available

75
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,540
for Protected Areas,
you can see here a list of often used options.

76
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,240
These profits can either go directly to the
Protected Area,

77
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,560
or transit through authorities at the Ministry
of Finances.

78
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,980
Note that it is sometimes difficult to gain
back a significant percentage.

79
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,980
Among the options, you can also see fishing
or hunting permits,

80
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,490
permits or commercial fees regarding resource
consumption,

81
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,360
for example tourism, fishing, diving.

82
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,970
Commercial permits for touristic installations
and camps.

83
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:52,140
You could also earn royalties
on networks or underground or submarines cables.

84
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,440
Used more often, entrance fees to Protected
Areas.

85
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,130
In the Galapagos, the entrance fee is $125
per person,

86
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,630
90% of which goes directly to the Protected
Area.

87
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,090
In terms of entrance fees, look at the numbers
of the Quirimbas Park in Mozambique and that

88
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,610
of Cocos island in Costa Rica.

89
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,860
You will notice that Quirimbas applies fees
to

90
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,710
research programs and science programs.

91
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,480
On the other hand, the Park of the Cocos islands
applies fees to video or movie shootings.

92
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,560
There again, innovative initiatives.

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,890
There is also the sales of local products,
guides, goods, etc.

94
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,790
The Protected Area will also be able to impose
a tax on film shooting

95
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,660
or events, here, a wedding ceremony.

96
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,700
The jackpot being, potentially, the shooting
of a TV show,

97
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,450
which could bring in a lot of money.

98
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,290
Allow me to underline as well the potential
income

99
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:59,190
that would come from illegal activities involving
degradations in the Protected Area.

100
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,050
Of course, they are to be outlawed
and every measure must be taken to cut down

101
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,560
these activities.

102
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,760
Nevertheless, when they are happening, it
is important to ensure that the income

103
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,920
of these deteriorations and fines go to the
Protected Area.

104
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:24,350
For example, illegal hunting or fishing fines
or measures of compensation for degradation:

105
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,770
an extractive industry, farm pollution, etc.

106
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,110
We will look at this soon enough in sequence
6.5.

107
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,210
You might have noticed that there is more
and more talk

108
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,880
around income that could be taken
from products and services relative to the

109
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,680
Protected Area.

110
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,030
The expression "Payment for ecosystemic services"
is then used.

111
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,230
Services like water, carbon, nursery grounds
of commercial species

112
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,460
or coastal protection.

113
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,320
Take the example of water that the Protected
Area can provide.

114
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,680
Protecting a watershed that provides water
to a population downstream can mean income,

115
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,650
as the Protected Area receives a financial
allocation

116
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,130
to protect its water resources.

117
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,320
Using the example of carbon: the Protected
Area, with its forest cover

118
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,220
but also its mangroves, sea grass beds or
mudflats,

119
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,300
contributes to capturing and sequestration
of carbon.

120
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,460
There again, the Protected Area could be compensated
for its efforts invested in the protection

121
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,400
of those ecosystems.

122
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,800
We can also consider the service provided
by a Protected Area

123
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,890
in the growth of the commercial stock of fish
as a kind of assistance on the Protected Area's

124
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,800
behalf
to the fishing industry of the country.

125
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,000
Therefore, the protected area could also have
a share of the fishing income

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,220
or be included in the fishing agreement signed
between powerful industries

127
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,470
and the country in question.

128
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,650
Note that, in order to perceive this fee,
it is generally considered

129
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,200
that a very precise ecosystemic service one
that would permanently supply

130
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,110
a set amount of quality and quantity, would
be connected to

131
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,150
at least one seller, one buyer, within a well-framed
transaction.

132
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,890
For example, in the context of the carbon
market.

133
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,090
It can either be intentional, or legal, but
it must always be verified,

134
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,080
to insure that the service is well provided,
as agreed.

135
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,710
This sequence is over, it is strongly connected
the sequence 6.4 that follows

136
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,760
and I invite you to study these two sequences
together.

137
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,280
Thank you and have a nice day !
