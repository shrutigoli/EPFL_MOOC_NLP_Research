00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,100
Hello.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:16,160
For the end of this module on funding conservation,
I would like to shed some light,

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,250
on one hand,
on the mechanisms of compensation & offset,

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,970
and on the other, on the most innovative and
modern approaches:

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,740
initiatives from a private investor perspective.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,849
First of all, let's see the mechanisms of
compensation.

7
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:35,290
Several guides and documents are available
and I invite you to have a look at them in

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,660
your course file.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,880
Most of them are in English,
in particular the handbook from the BBOP organization,

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,220
which is a benchmark organization in this
field.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,469
There is, for example, this document that
is in front of you,

12
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,210
that lays out the steps on how to set up a
compensation project.

13
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,560
There is also the guide for South Africa.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,249
And there are two studies that are in French:
one on the economy and biodiversity mission,

15
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:06,030
and the other by the Commissioner-General
for Sustainable Development.

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,440
To address this topic, I have asked Ray Victurine
to talk to you;

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,630
he is the director of Conservation Financedivision
in an NGO called WCS:

18
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,909
the Wildlife Conservation Society.

19
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,920
Let's hear from him now.

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,750
What is compensation?

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,710
Compensation is the last step in a mitigation
hierarchy

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:32,079
avoid, minimise and then compensate the impacts
on biodiversity.

23
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:42,610
It is essential that this sequence be respected,
first of all, by avoiding, then reducing,

24
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,210
and then if necessary, compensating.

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,539
It is necessary to compensate for the residual
impacts.

26
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:55,740
Usually, it is not possible to have large
development projects without residual impacts.

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:06,979
Usually, it is necessary to actually compensate.

28
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:13,400
Businesses must finance the compensation
and ensure that the results have a lasting

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,730
effect.

30
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,250
The elaboration of policies and mechanisms
to sustainably manage funds from compensation

31
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,110
mechanisms
need to be and are a priority.

32
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:32,700
The terms must be established to ensure existing
or new protected areas

33
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,410
are financed in the long term.

34
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:43,090
The conservation trust funds offer,
for example, a financial medium

35
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:50,750
for efficient and transparent management
of these compensatory funds in the long term.

36
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,060
What can compensation do?

37
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,620
First of all, it can improve the management
of protected areas.

38
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,590
There are many examples such as restoring,
rehabilitating a zone,

39
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:15,260
reintroducing species that used to be there,
to put a halt to the current deterioration,

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,620
and recreate or build a lost habitat.

41
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:26,290
Secondly, by reducing or stopping the current
loss.

42
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,200
We could offer protection,
or link together or strengthen the priority

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,970
zones,
reduce or eliminate the current threats to

44
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,970
conservation.

45
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,300
For example, we could introduce appropriate
substitutes

46
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,280
for the targeted biodiversity,
look for ways for alternative resources,

47
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,530
or compensate users for not using or harvesting
biodiversity.

48
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:02,570
Thirdly, we can pay
the private land owners or communities

49
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:08,590
for managing the grounds, for preserving biodiversity.

50
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,200
How do they benefit to protected areas?

51
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,370
Compensation mechanisms have been used
as a

52
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,960
conservation tool since the 1970s.

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:33,800
In the United States, from the year 1977,
the adoption of laws at a national level

54
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,340
have been the main motivation for using this
mechanism in wetlands.

55
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:48,240
Several countries are looking into "no-net-loss"
policies.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,450
If we consider the regulated market and the
voluntary market,

57
00:04:52,450 --> 00:05:02,469
the annual total has gone from
between $1.8 billion

58
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:09,009
and $2.9 billion
to between $2.4 and $4 billion

59
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,939
between 2009 and 2010.

60
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:20,810
It is estimated that the funds made available
by these compensation mechanisms

61
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:29,909
could generate annually $5 to 10 billion from
now until 2020.

62
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:35,430
To summarize, an increasing use of compensation
mechanisms

63
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,770
is explained by four main reasons.

64
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:46,250
One: more and more financial institutions
- banks, investors, funding agencies, etc.

65
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,669
-
demand compensation for residual impacts

66
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:56,820
as a prerequisite to access funds - loans
or contributions.

67
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:06,970
More and more governments are enacting compensation
policies and laws,

68
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,789
because the governments demand that all of
the businesses

69
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:20,340
compensate for residual impacts.

70
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,449
Businesses are becoming more and more involved
in compensation projects

71
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:30,069
on a voluntary
basis,

72
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:35,650
to have a good image,
to be well-positioned in the market, for the

73
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,669
risk, etc.

74
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:49,389
Finally NGOs and civil society organizations
are increasingly placing pressure on the companies

75
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:55,139
to encourage them and to support them into
compensating.

76
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:03,800
As a result, there is significant potential
for the funds from the private sector

77
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,599
to increase and fund conservation and the
protected areas.

78
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,059
Another potential source of finance for protected
areas is the private investment sector.

79
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:21,650
I suggest that you refer to this essay named:
Conservation Finance

80
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,460
Moving Beyond Donor Funding Toward an Investor-Driven
Approach.

81
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,750
This essay is surely a turning point in conservation
finance.

82
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,689
Indeed, it is written from the financial investor's
perspective,

83
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:40,449
for whom investing in the protected area
can be good for business,

84
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:44,349
as well as an ethical and responsible move.

85
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:47,650
Let's have a quick look at the main characteristics.

86
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,279
This document highlights the perspective of
an investment

87
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,699
of $200 or $300 billion per year
for the conservation of important ecosystems

88
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:56,919
around the world.

89
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:03,020
It also highlights that the main constraint
would be the lack of investable projects.

90
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,629
These are projects with a clear outline of
the risk versus return tradeoff

91
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:12,759
and of the benefits to conservation,
which can be specified, measured and quantified.

92
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,819
Notice a significant appetite from investors
for this type of investment product and their

93
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,819
interest
for impact investing in conservation and protected

94
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:22,949
areas.

95
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:29,979
This will require effort, new roles,
maybe new tools to collect the investments,

96
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,080
and finding common ground
between the investors and the protected area

97
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,830
managers.

98
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,750
This is a field that will grow further, that's
for sure.

99
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,510
To finish off, here is a short video,
that documents an interesting initiative

100
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:50,000
in Madagascar: the Tahiry Honko project, 
a community mangrove carbon project.

101
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,200
It is by the NGO Blue Ventures and filmed, 
documented and produced by Chris Scarffe.

102
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,200
It is also an interesting and innovative project.

103
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:16,680
Let's watch it together.

104
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
You will have noticed there is room 
for innovation

105
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,720
in terms of financing conservation 
and protected areas.

106
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,360
I am sure you know of initiatives 
in this field near you

107
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,640
Let us know about them.

108
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,280
It is important to document and share

109
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,000
our experiences and these new initiatives.

110
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,400
The objective is to increase the level 
of finance for protected areas

111
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,680
for these sites to be managed 
in the long term.

112
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:11,800
Thank you, and have a good day.
