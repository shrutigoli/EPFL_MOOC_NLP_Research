Hello, and welcome to the sixth module in
the MOOC

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,450
on the management of protected areas in Africa.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,330
This module focuses on a crucial question
for the conservation of protected areas:

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,990
how do we fund them.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,300
Sylvie Goyet will be fully running this module.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,710
So this week, the module will be structured
like this:

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,429
the first lesson will be on financial planning.

8
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:36,700
That answers the question
about the financial needs of protected areas.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,590
As for the second lesson,
it will look into the economic values of protected

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,190
areas,
How do we assess them,

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,300
is there an under-valuation of natural capital,
etc.?

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,390
The different possible sources of obtaining
funds

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,120
will be the topic of the third lesson.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,180
The fourth lesson will then talk about the
financial mechanisms

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,800
that can be considered for protected areas.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,970
Projects, trusts funds, for example, etc.

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:13,130
The fifth lesson will focus quickly
on compensation mechanisms and biodiversity

18
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,720
income mechanisms.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,440
The last lesson will examine this week's convention,
once again,

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,360
and this time, we will talk about CMS,
which looks after migratory species.

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,440
And finally, we will do a quick summary
of the important points mentioned in this

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,580
module,
and we will give you assessment related to

23
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,000
this module.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There we go.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Let's get going,
and we hope you have an excellent sixth week

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:42,920
with us!
