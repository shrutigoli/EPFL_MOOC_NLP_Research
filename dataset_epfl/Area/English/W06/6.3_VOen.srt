00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:08,799
Hello.

2
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:14,230
In this episode, we are going to study
the concept of the value of a protected area.

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,610
As in, which goods and services have a value?

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,200
What is this value?

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,369
How do we measure it, how do we quantify it?

6
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:25,369
Finally, which methods should we use?

7
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:30,240
Protected areas have ecological goods and
services that have an ecological value.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,419
That is why they are protected.

9
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:37,070
But they also have social, cultural and economic
values.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,520
And they can be for different groups, for
different levels of populations,

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,700
for communities, for the state,
for the whole of humanity.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,650
Each of these levels place a value on these
goods and services.

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:54,479
But be careful, you can't put a price on the
environment, of course.

14
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,220
Several guidelines and documents are available
for you to refer to.

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,950
On the one hand, I recommend
the FFEM's valuation report on its Marine

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,530
Protected Areas projects,
and especially Section 8:

17
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:17,160
Economic Valuation and Calculation
of the rate of return of AMP Projects.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,431
There's also IUCN's guidelines:
Economic Values of Protected Areas: Guidelines

19
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:28,610
for Protected Area Managers
These guidelines were written in 1998,

20
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,190
and so the methods probably need a little
update,

21
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,570
but the basics are in there.

22
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,260
Economic valuation of a protected area's goods
and services

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,350
involves identifying its goods and services
and quantifying and measuring their value.

24
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,160
First of all, we need to identify these goods
and services.

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,409
What are they?

26
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,370
And who are they for?

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,350
We will look at placing a value on these goods
and services

28
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,130
for the groups involved.

29
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,750
And finally, we will consider
whether or not the benefits of these goods

30
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,620
and services
are being received and by whom, by which groups?

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,420
Are some groups receiving the benefits more
than others,

32
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,110
and that's why the protected areas are threatened?

33
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,280
Let's look at it together.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,510
Why do we need to assess the value of
the goods and services of a protected area?

35
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,310
It is to justify important investments that
are needed to protect a site.

36
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,790
The decision makers, i.e., the state most
often, will need to make decisions between

37
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:33,040
different investments ; a protected area and
an education system for example.

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,909
It's about demonstrating
that protecting a site produces important

39
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:38,469
values.

40
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:41,889
Applying economic methods
to assess the value of services linked to

41
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:45,769
the environment
therefore allows us to compare the costs and

42
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:50,989
the benefits of a protected area
or the extent to which an ecosystem has improved.

43
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:56,290
It enables us to compare different uses and
different scenarios.

44
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,779
Notice that the studies are not yet widly
spread in this field,

45
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,680
but they are informative.

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,439
It is also noticeable that nearly everywhere
managing long term resources and ecosystems

47
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,010
is more cost-effective and profitable
than exploiting these goods and services in

48
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,689
the short term.

49
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:19,480
For example, in Canada, overfishing of cod
drove the collapse of stocks.

50
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,790
In the short term, the fishing industry gained
an enormous amount of money,

51
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,950
but the stock has run out,
and that cost the state in social expenditure

52
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,239
more than two billion dollars, mainly to compensate
fishermen.

53
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,639
These two billion would have been quite useful
and would have easily been enough

54
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:43,419
to develop a strict and sustainable management
system for this fishing industry.

55
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,439
Notice that the valuation of these goods and
services

56
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,400
does not necessarily result in a financial
flow

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,099
that guarantees sustainability and protection
of the site.

58
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:58,690
Measures must be taken to capture these values
and to generate revenue that will enable the

59
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,959
site to be protected
and the sustainable development for communities.

60
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,769
I've already highlighted that economic valuation
involves

61
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,889
identifying and assessing the quantitative
value

62
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:12,059
of the goods and services.

63
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:17,530
We're talking about exchange value,
the price of a good or service on the market,

64
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,880
of the use value of the good or service.

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,830
This could be different from the market price.

66
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,930
For example, water has an important value
in use,

67
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,430
but its exchange value per cubic meter of
water is low.

68
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,630
There is also the emotional value
that we attach to certain goods and services.

69
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,720
So we talk about a total economic value,
that breaks down, as you can see here,

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,630
into the use value and the non-use value.

71
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,560
Frequently, only the use value is taken into
account and monetized.

72
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,509
The use value is what you identify
through fishing, tourism, leisure revenues

73
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:56,870
etc.

74
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,870
Indirect use value is coastal protection,
sewage treatment, waste treatment,

75
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,650
or erosion control.

76
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,199
There are also option values,
which could be the interests of pharmaceutical

77
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,400
industries,
who look to preserve ecosystems that are not

78
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,060
yet well known.

79
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,610
They would do this to exploit genes and plants
for medicine.

80
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,180
Note also that in the non-use values,
there is the existence value,

81
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,199
which is the habitat itself,
the beauty of the site, which we should not

82
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,960
forget.

83
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:39,280
We also identify the bequest value,
which is the preservation of resources for

84
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,849
future generations.

85
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:44,849
If the concept of total economic value technique
is relevant

86
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:48,919
for helping decision-making,
it is important to remember the limitations

87
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,889
of these methods
and of the technique itself.

88
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,409
On one hand, notice that the technique is
considered from a human point of view.

89
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:03,060
The intrinsic value of biodiversity
or the value that an animal species would

90
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,380
place on another species or habitat
is not taken into account.

91
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,580
Notice also that different groups can place
different values

92
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,719
to the same good or service.

93
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:16,639
The obvious example is the antelope.

94
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,689
Some might place the value as just looking
at the antelope

95
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:23,580
and others might prefer to eat it.

96
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,000
Calculating a total economic value therefore
generally brings with it

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,159
problems with conflict of values,
and sometimes, with double-counting, or with

98
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,500
values not taken into account.

99
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,539
Finally, note that it is a long, difficult
and expensive exercise.

100
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:45,970
Frequently, it is not necessary to conduct
a full study.

101
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,280
It could therefore be useful to conduct relevant
analysis

102
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,830
that depend on the manager's needs.

103
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,330
For example, it could be only on the use values.

104
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,820
Putting a price on the environment is not
simple.

105
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,919
Despite the difficulties, economists have
suggested multiple methods

106
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,650
to assess the value of an environmental asset.

107
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,719
Before anything else, it is important
to define the good's user and client for that

108
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:12,719
situation.

109
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:17,110
Is it the protected area's inhabitants, those
who live on its outskirts,

110
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:23,770
the government, the country's businesses,
the NGOs, the international community etc?

111
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,130
After that, we need to frame,
confirm the study's limits,

112
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,560
the timeframe, the data and the available
budget.

113
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,120
Finally, the valuation method needs to be
chosen.

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,749
Regarding the method,
the easiest is to refer to the economic values

115
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,159
of the market
to measure the direct use values,

116
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:46,680
for example, the value of the protected area,
in terms of the tourism service, is measured

117
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,910
by hotel nights,
rights of entry and the location of vehicles.

118
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,610
When no market exists,
we will try to estimate the value

119
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,250
that the clients and users can place on that
good.

120
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,909
We could directly ask those involved.

121
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:06,930
This method is called a contingent valuation
and it generally relies on their willingness

122
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,480
to pay.

123
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,759
We would ask them,
"How much would you be prepared to give to

124
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,219
save pandas?

125
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:15,449
To have clean beaches?"

126
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:19,159
We often use this method for existence or
option values.

127
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,409
They are however subject to a lot of criticism.

128
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:26,819
The other option is to observe the behavior
of those involved.

129
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,639
Some of the methods used are the following.

130
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,400
The hedonic valuation: we compare the price
that the consumers are prepared to pay

131
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,039
for goods that are similar, but in different
environments.

132
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,120
For example, to determine the value of the
sea,

133
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,520
we assess the difference in price between
two similar apartments,

134
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,840
but where only one has a sea view.

135
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,500
The method for the cost of transport:
we estimate the value that people place on

136
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,670
a good
by measuring how much they spend in terms

137
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,030
for transport.

138
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:03,040
We can also look at and value their spending
on protection and restoration.

139
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,550
We measure the cost of the deterioration of
the environment,

140
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,130
by calculating how much we would have to pay
to replace or restore that good.

141
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,520
Notice that none of these methods really meet
our full satisfaction from a theory perspective,

142
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,420
and in practice, it isn't much better,
since several methods employed simultaneously

143
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,820
can amount to different results.

144
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,980
We must therefore be cautious.

145
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,000
But considerable progress has been made in
this area,

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,230
and the valuation tool is essential
to help the decision-makers to make the choices

147
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,160
that need to be made.

148
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,150
In terms of case studies,
there are relatively many economic studies

149
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,620
on coral reef ecosystems.

150
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,050
Here is one that you will also find in your
course documents.

151
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,120
Here, an example of a study
on the total economic value of coral reefs,

152
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,200
mangroves,
and seagrass in Martinique.

153
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,230
This document is also in your course documents.

154
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,470
Please note that the use values linked to
fishing and tourism

155
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,120
have been well documented,
such as for example, this study on iQoliqoli

156
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
in Fiji.

157
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,860
I said it in the introduction,
identifying goods and giving them a value

158
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,920
is not enough
to ensure that large revenues are generated

159
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,070
for the protected area.

160
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:21,760
It is a question of capturing the value
of the goods and services of a protected area.

161
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,770
For example, by using taxes
on the use of the protected area's resources,

162
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:33,370
i.e., access fees.

163
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:39,560
For tourism, it is clearer: entrance fees,
concessions on infrastructures, taxes, fees

164
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,250
for tours.

165
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,210
For a service, such as carbon sequestration
from mangroves, it's more complicated:

166
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,230
there is the REDD+ project.

167
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,370
They are difficult projects to design, to
develop.

168
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:58,330
Finally, for example, for scientific benefits,
we can impose scientific access fees to the

169
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,330
site.

170
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:04,620
You see, these different tools, taxes mean
that we can gain a certain revenue

171
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,110
for the protected area, for it to function
and operate.

172
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,450
To conclude, I want an expert to speak to
you.

173
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,870
Nicolas Pascal has worked a lot
on the study of the values of goods and services

174
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,890
of protected areas.

175
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,350
Nicolas works at CRIOBE,
the Center for Research on Islands and on

176
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:30,070
the Environment
at the University of Perpignan, France.

177
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,790
We can conduct economic assessments of the
benefits of protected areas,

178
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,770
or of marine protected areas with a variety
of aims.

179
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:42,620
I think to make it simple,
it all depends on who wants the study to be

180
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,620
done.

181
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,550
When it comes to governments,
it may be to value the costs and benefits

182
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:53,180
of a public investment in nature,
and therefore to assess exactly the role of

183
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,770
this investment
in developing the economy of the local community

184
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,200
or of the territory or land in general.

185
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,050
For development banks,
it's quite a similar aim.

186
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,860
It's a loan or an investment in nature,
in a protected area, for example,

187
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,500
and it's trying to demonstrate a link between
this investment

188
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,620
and the economic development of the local
communities.

189
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,930
For conservation NGOs, it's a little different.

190
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,020
It's more about identifying who benefits from
these protected areas,

191
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,570
trying to demonstrate what these stakeholders
receive.

192
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:35,310
And so after maintaining certain values
or certain biodiversity ecosystem services,

193
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:41,410
they also impact the economy,
so, here we identify who the beneficiaries

194
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,410
are.

195
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,990
So there we go, there are always multiple
roles and uses.

196
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,540
Let's say that through different stakeholders,
these are possible roles and uses.

197
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,070
The tools and methods
that are best adapted for the African context...

198
00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:00,280
I think we can distinguish two big cases,
or two major situations.

199
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:09,070
A first situation where we deal with a study,
is, we'll say, on a national or regional level.

200
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,040
In this situation, we use an approach that
is obviously quite global,

201
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,610
where we will try to assess
who are the main beneficiaries of the areas.

202
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:24,290
So here, we're still looking at a preliminary
economic analysis.

203
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,480
Another situation, much more precise, is on
the level of a protected area.

204
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,050
So here, we have interviews, investigations
in the area itself

205
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,370
to be more precise about the benefits,
and, especially, about their geographical

206
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,480
division -
about their geographic distribution.

207
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,850
So, are we in the protected area's area of
influence?

208
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,850
Do the...

209
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,850
I'll give an example.

210
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,620
Do the tourism service providers,
based 60 miles from there,

211
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,440
but who use the protected area for their activities,
benefit from it?

212
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,260
We have another geographic distribution of
these benefits.

213
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,420
So here, there are two levels of methods,
which can be put in place.

214
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,940
And that's the first step to determine: the
degree of precision that we want,

215
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:13,570
and especially the geographic distribution
of the benefits and impacts on the areas.

216
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,600
There we go, it is the end of this video.

217
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,010
You will find more details and more information
in the course documents, feel free to have

218
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,480
a look at them.

219
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,760
You will now understand
that determining the value of goods and services

220
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,010
of an area
can be a bit complicated, but it is an essential

221
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,750
tool
to help with decision-making, with managing

222
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,110
a site.

223
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,180
Have a good day.
