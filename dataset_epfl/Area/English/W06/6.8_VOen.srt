00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,400
Throughout this module,
we have tackled topics linked to funding protected

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,380
areas
and conservation in general.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,960
We have seen that it is essential to have
a good financial plan.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,859
It involves identifying and appreciating the
financial needs of the protected area

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,910
in the medium term, and predictable incomes,
the prerequisites of the country and of the

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,699
protected area
to implement certain mechanisms,

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,619
and the conditions that could determine whether
one tool or another is used.

8
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:35,890
So, it involves consolidating everything into
one business plan.

9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,610
The functionalities that the protected area
generates

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,390
are important for the interested parties:
for communities, for the State,

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,080
and even for the whole of humanity.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,789
An economic assessment involves bringing to
light

13
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,301
and reestimating quantitatively
the goods and services the protected area

14
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:57,690
provides or could provide.

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,250
These studies enable investment into protected
areas to be justified

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,540
and compared with the costs and benefits of
conservation.

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,110
We have tackled the breakdown of the total
economic value,

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,540
the process and the methods to carry out these
evaluations,

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,850
and we have highlighted the precautions and
the limits of these studies,

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,250
all while insisting on their usefulness for
managing them.

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,620
To make up for protected areas' substantial
financial deficits,

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,409
we found different funding sources and options
for protected areas,

23
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,630
mainly in the form of state subsidies,
contributions from donors, and various internal

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,850
revenues,
or self-financing from protected areas.

25
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,740
Amongst the finance mecanisms that we have
discussed,

26
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,640
we have mainly highlighted
the project mecanisms by donors,

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,799
budgetary support from the state,
and trust funds for conservation.

28
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:03,340
All of this while still insisting on the necessity
of diversifying

29
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,550
where the finance is sourced from,
and while still insisting on associating several

30
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,340
different mecanisms
to contribute to the financial sustainability

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,940
of the protected area.

32
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,319
Finally, we discussed a new option,
which, on one side, involves compensation

33
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,230
mecanisms,
and on the other hand, involves potential

34
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,700
promising contributions
by financial investors.

35
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,310
We highlighted the potential of these approaches
in the future

36
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,090
to finance the protected areas and for conservation.

37
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,790
That's it; let's now tackle the test for this
module.
