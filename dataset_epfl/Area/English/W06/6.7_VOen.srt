00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello and welcome everyone. 

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,020
Today's lesson will be
about the Convention on the Conservation of

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:23,520
Migratory Species of Wild Animals,
also known as the Bonn Convention or CMS.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,580
We are going to do an overview of CMS,
look at why migratory species are important,

5
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,180
discuss the threats that weigh on migratory
species,

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:40,430
see why CMS is necessary,
how CMS works,

7
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:49,239
consider the organizational structure of CMS,
and understand how CMS's strategic plan 2015-2023

8
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:50,539
was developed.

9
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:56,420
To find out more, you could visit CMS's website,
shown here.

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,969
What is CMS?

11
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:05,000
The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory
Species of Wild Animals

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,630
is a global treaty whose aim is to ensure
the conservation

13
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,470
of land, sea, and air migratory species
within the entirety of their distribution

14
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,470
area.

15
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,479
International collaboration between the distribution
area's countries

16
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,689
is essential in preserving migratory species
that they share.

17
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:33,799
This is especially when, each year,
they cross one or several national jurisdiction

18
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,990
borders
in a cyclic and predictable manner.

19
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,810
121 countries attended the convention
on the conservation of migratory species.

20
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,229
Why are migratory species important?

21
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,700
Wild animals in their innumerable forms
are an irreplaceable part of the earth's natural

22
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:02,000
system,
which must be conserved for the good of mankind.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,880
Wild animals are constantly taking on a greater
importance

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,470
from mesological, ecological, genetic,
scientific, esthetic, recreational,

25
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,350
cultural, educational, social, and economic
perspectives.

26
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,079
Migratory species form the basis of economic
activities

27
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:27,000
that generate billions of dollars,
such as hunting and commercial fishing on

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,579
a larger scale,
hunting and fishing for pleasure, as well

29
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:34,790
as tourism.

30
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,750
Many rural communities depend on the seasonal
and predictable

31
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,019
comings and goings of wild animals for their
survival.

32
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:50,609
Migratory species also contribute to the functioning
of local ecosystems

33
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:57,239
through their moving from one site to another,
and so participating in the pollination and

34
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,790
dispersal of grains.

35
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,019
They also regulate non migratory species'
populations

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,820
by being predators and sources of essential
food.

37
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,530
What threats are there to migratory species?

38
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,590
Due to their nomadic nature, migratory species
are particularly vulnerable to factors of

39
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,910
an entropic origin.

40
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:31,139
They depend on many habitats and on many different
migration corridors.

41
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,710
Significant threats include bycatches when
fishing,

42
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:43,810
the destruction and changes to habitats,
the introduction of exotic and invasive species,

43
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,479
non sustainable fishing and hunting,
industrial and agricultural pollutants, and

44
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:56,209
migration obstacles,
like dams, fences, and electric lines.

45
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:02,139
Furthermore, climate change negatively affects
reproduction,

46
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,250
increases the transmission of diseases, diminishes
the ecosystem's resilience

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:14,000
and modifies migration patterns,
thus have a negative and cumulative impact

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,370
on long distance migratory species.

49
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,820
Why is CMS necessary?

50
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,850
CMS is the only environmental multilateral
agreement

51
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,090
that deals with all migratory species.

52
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,730
It's a unique and necessary approach
to take up the conservation challenge for

53
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:40,160
species that do not live in one place.

54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,800
It is also necessary to preserve their migratory
routes.

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,680
How does CMS work?

56
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,070
CMS have a variety of instruments
that are legally constraining on an international

57
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,720
level
and other agreements between states regarding

58
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,980
the distribution area
of species and of groups of migratory species.

59
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,590
These agreements can be adapted to the needs
of specific regions.

60
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:14,540
19 memorandum of understanding and 7 agreements
are actually set up.

61
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,780
Another legal instrument used is the classification
of species

62
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,570
on the lists of one or several annexes, updated
every three years.

63
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,800
Annex one records the migratory species categorized
as endangered

64
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,160
in all of or in a significant part of the
distribution area.

65
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,050
No takings are allowed unless they are for
scientific use

66
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:51,230
for reproduction, for traditional use,
for survival or even in exceptional circumstances.

67
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:57,900
Annex two contains migratory species with
an unfavourable conservation status

68
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,930
or that would benefit in a significant way
from international cooperation.

69
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,840
The organizational structure of CMS is as
follows.

70
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,470
The Conference of the Parties is the convention's
decision-making body.

71
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,030
It meets every three years.

72
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,970
The Standing Committee provides political
and administrative guidelines

73
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,370
between the meetings.

74
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:29,500
The Scientific Council meets
between the Conference of the Parties sessions

75
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,139
to provide opinions and scientific advice
and to identify priorities for research and

76
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:38,850
conservation.

77
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,650
The Secretariat is the body that develops
and promotes these agreements,

78
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,230
supplies the necessary services at the meetings,
supports and supervises research and conservation

79
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,460
projects,
and cooperates with governments and partner

80
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,990
organizations.

81
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,510
The Secretariat is administered
by the United Nations Environment Programme.

82
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,570
How was CMS's Strategic Plan 2015-2023 developed?

83
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:09,580
The Strategic Plan for Migratory Species was
developed

84
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,660
based on the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity
2011–2020

85
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:19,389
and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

86
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:24,680
An approach like this enables the strategic
plan to benefit

87
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,150
from the exposure and political support that
already exists for biodiversity

88
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,110
in general, at national and global levels.

89
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,830
The CMS strategic plan was developed
by using already existing support mechanisms,

90
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:46,290
for example, through capacity building
or by revising national strategies and biodiversity

91
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:51,740
action plans:
that is number 20 of the Aichi Targets.

92
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,610
The CMS's strategic plan was drawn up
by developing objectives specific to migratory

93
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,270
species,
by using the Aichi Targets as a framework,

94
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,320
but without constraining it to those targets
in order to preserve the identity of and the

95
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,310
added value of migratory species.

96
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:17,980
To conclude, as an environmental treaty
of the United Nations Environment Programme,

97
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:25,710
the CMS offers a global platform for conservation
and the sustainable use of migratory animals

98
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,919
and of their habitats.

99
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,110
CMS brings together states that migratory
animals cross

100
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,050
or states in a distribution area, and it establishes
legal bases

101
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:43,820
that conservation measures, coordinated internationally
can base themselves on, by migratory species.

102
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:50,170
CMS acts as a convention framework.

103
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,510
These treaties can vary from being legally
constraining,

104
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:00,080
known as less formal instrument agreements,
such as Memorandums of Understanding,

105
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,130
and they can be adapted to the requirements
of specific regions.

106
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:11,230
Moreover, CMS has the ability to develop models
built

107
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,110
based on conservation needs for the whole
of the migratory routes.

108
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,750
Here we are at the end of the lesson.

109
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,900
The next episode will be the conclusion for
this module

110
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,980
in the form of a short animation
and of course, there will be this week's assignment.

111
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,700
Meanwhile, have an excellent day.
