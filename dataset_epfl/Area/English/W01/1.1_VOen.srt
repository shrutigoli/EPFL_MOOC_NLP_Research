00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,970
Hello and welcome to the first module of the
Mooc 

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,500
on protected areas management in Africa.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,230
This module introduces
a few important notions to know beforehand,

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,099
a few key concepts that will be helpful throughout
the module.

5
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:27,240
So, this week, the module works as follow:
The first class will be about the history

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,120
and importance of protected areas:
where they come from, what they have become

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,420
over time,
what they represent today for nature conservation.

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,480
The second class will deal with their very
role:

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,469
what their purpose is,
how they help to preserve nature.

10
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,370
In the third class we will see how a protected
area is defined.

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,850
Knowing exactly what protected areas are
will allow us to better understand them

12
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,489
and to better identify the tools, the methods
adapted to them.

13
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,339
The forth and fifth class will allow us to
classify them

14
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,650
into management categories to distinguish,
to better understand their identity

15
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,080
and better understand their specificities.

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,210
The last class will be about the convention
of the week.

17
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,110
We will talk about the Convention on Biological
Diversity,

18
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,700
an essential convention, when dealing with
protected areas in the world.

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,110
Finally, we will have a brief summary of the
items we discussed

20
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:39,729
this week in the form of an animation
and we will present this module's homework.

21
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,310
Here we go,
have a great week with us!
