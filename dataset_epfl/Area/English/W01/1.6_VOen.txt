Hello and welcome to today's class in which we will introduce the protected area management categories.
The reference book to consult as a complement to the class
Is once again the Guidelines on the management categories developed by
WCPA.
But you can also find a summary of everything in the NAPA letter 59.
In the previous module, we have learned how to determine categories and that what matters in doing so is the protected areas management's objective.
Sometimes, there is a gap between that objective and reality, as can be seen in the field.
You must always refer to the management objective.
Too bad if the manager strays from it - hopefully only temporarily.
Now, let's see what those categories are.
There are six of them, as you can see on this list, and they are globally and roughly following a progressive evolution from territories intended to be kept in their natural state as much as possible
(categories I to III) to territories where the human intervention is increasingly visible (categories IV, V and VI).
The first of these categories here is presented to us by Fabrice.
Category I protected areas are protected areas where we are trying to limit human intervention and any alteration of the environment.
So, these are truly protected areas where you protect the environment in its natural state as much as possible.
Now, let's look at category II, which is commonly known as â€œnational parkâ€�.
This name is actually somewhat inappropriate but we have seen that the name of a territory doesn't necessarily determine one, whether it is a protected area and two, the way it is managed.
But that's the way it is.
Well, I work for the national park of Kahuzi
Biega.
It is a category II park, which means that we really ensure the protection of natural resources through patrols and anti-poaching leagues, we do authorize scientific research in cooperation with the local universities.
There is tourism.
You know, we are in the Great Lake.
Tourism is thriving and of course, there is environmental education.
All the schools in the region come here to take walks in the forest and look at rare species.
The third category is relatively rare in Africa.
It concerns territories that are classified to protect a specific natural monument, that is a specific topographical element.
It may be a mountain, a cavern, an underwater cave, a small island or a remote forest.
The fourth category is much more common, like for example the Diawling park in Mauritania seen here in this photo, where a system of dams allows constant control on the water level in order to manage nesting areas for birds or for example, fight against invasive aquatic species.
Let's go back to Fabrice who will tell us more about this.
Speaking of protected area management category
IV, we are talking about protected areas which primary objective is to protect the specific species or habitats in environments that generally require regular and active interventions to preserve these specificities or habitats.
So, we understand right away that these are not completely natural environments.
These are really environments where there is already a human intervention in order to preserve these species or habitats.
So, it's really different from protected areas of categories I to III, where the protected areas are mostly natural protected areas.
The fifth category comprises of what is commonly known as landscapes.
Yussuf tells us more.
Protected areas of category V are territories where interactions between man and nature produce specific or even cultural characteristics of their own.
The management of these territories is then interested in the conservation of these specific characteristics but also incorporates the alterations made by man.
So, here, we are far from categories I to
III that are interested in the preservation of the original character of the area.
Here, we are interested in the altered nature in order to conserve its specific characteristics.
The biosphere reserve of the Senegal river delta is an example of a category V protected area that associates traditional reserves surrounded by village land and ensures their connectivity.
Finally, category VI is the one that has experienced the strongest growth in recent years, as seen on this graph that is now familiar to you.
Here are categories VI currently.
Let's listen to Razingrim who tells us about it.
It is used to protect and preserve ecosystems and natural habitats while promoting the development of the sustainable management of the natural resources found there.
In general, category VI protected areas are large territories the largest part of which preserves or presents a natural condition but another part of which is subject to the moderate and rational use of the natural resources found there.
Of course, the distinction is imperative because we are not talking about industrial natural resources but the natural resources that the residents may use in a sustainable way.
And many of the category VI protected areas that have been created recently are of this type.
Finally, I can say that I for instance am from Burkina Faso and in my country, we have the Nazinga ranch which is a category VI protected area where we preserve, we protect nature but residents can go hunting or fishing though in a controlled and monitored manner.
That's it.
Now, we know what these categories are and why we use them.
Let's simply clarify a few essential characteristics of these categories.
First of all, this system is international, shared by all, to allow us to communicate with each other easily.
For example, a meeting of park managers interested in sharing their experiences should if possible gather managers of protected areas of the same category to make more sense.
We should keep in mind that in no case does the ranking in a category reflect the efficiency of the management of a territory.
So, if a park doesn't meet the objective it was assigned,
It is no reason to change its category to accommodate its manager in any way.
It's actually the opposite that should happen and the manager should do everything possible to bring his management in compliance with the objective of the park.
Finally, all categories are important.
Actually, a good network should include protected areas of various categories to make sure that the various management tools available are being used.
Assigning a category to a park isn't complicated if you follow these few rules.
Practice by examining the protected areas that you know.
Look at their classification objective and deduce what their category is.
Also, make a quick comparison with the reality on the field and ask yourself whether the park is actually in compliance with its objectives.
It frequently is not the case.
Do this for 3 or 4 parks and classification should become a second nature for you.
So, a park can only belong to one category since it only has one primary management objective.
Sometimes, it is difficult to determine precisely what this objective is but you must always do so in order to know which category it belongs to.
If a park comprises of various areas with different management objectives
- as happens rather frequently - in order to determine the category of the whole - if this whole is managed by the same entity we will refer to the main objective of the whole, which is generally the one applying to the largest surface.
We often speak of the 75-25 rule, as the category is determined by the management objective applying to over 75% of the territory.
Now, if a park is divided into areas that are managed differently, with different objectives, by different entities, each of them may be assigned a different category as though they were actually two completely different parks.
A good example of this type of situation is a cross-border park composed of two different parks on each side of the border that may be managed differently and be of two different categories or may be of the same category, if they share the same management objectives.
For example, the so-called W ecosystem between
Niger,
Burkina and Benin comprises of three parks managed separately, which means that each has its own category.
In the present case, it so happens that all three of them are category
II.
That's it.
It's the end of this class.
The next episode will look at the Convention on Biological Diversity, which is of course a fundamental text for the management of protected areas, as you will see.
This text will be presented to us by Paul
OuÃ©draogo.
Have a great day!
