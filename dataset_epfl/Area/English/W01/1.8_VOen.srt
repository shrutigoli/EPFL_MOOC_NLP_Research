00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,120
Here we are now at the end of the first module
on the general presentation of protected areas,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,650
and on a few essential concepts
for a good understanding of those territories.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,929
The key points that we have addressed this
week

4
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:19,400
are the following:
First off, there are more and more protected

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,750
areas
and they are more and more diverse.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,279
From a few ones in the dawn of the 20th century,
they are now more than 200,000

7
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:34,700
all kinds of them, big and small,
forest, mountains, marines and deserts.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,650
This diversity is their strength,
but requires more skills

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:46,260
from their managements,
and more efforts to conserve them.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,370
Those protected areas are indispensable tools
for nature conservation.

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,230
And even if they do not always
halt the decline of the biodiversity of the

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,330
planet,
they are part of the solution that will eventually

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,470
help us achieve this
and, as such, they deserve our full attention.

14
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,909
However, they are evolving and turning more
and more

15
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:16,719
towards the inclusion of local populations
and the production of related natural services.

16
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,429
All territories called protected areas have
something in common.

17
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:23,690
The reason why they exist: the conservation
of nature.

18
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:29,060
There are many other territories
that can contribute to protect the environment,

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,100
but the specificity of protected areas is
that this is their main purpose,

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:40,929
it is somehow their trademark.

21
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:44,319
Finally to help us better understand and identify
them,

22
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,079
those protected areas are grouped into six
categories

23
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:53,899
based on their primary objective of management.

24
00:01:53,899 --> 00:02:01,810
For category I, what prevails is nature protection;
For category II, it's to preserve nature

25
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:08,600
in organizing activities like tourism, research,
or education.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,670
Category III aims at conserving a natural
monument

27
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,330
like a cave or a mountain.

28
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:21,530
In category IV, we actively manage the environment,
to maintain a particular environment or a

29
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,820
species,
Category V, is interested in preserving a

30
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,730
landscape, an ecosystem
that has been shaped by man.

31
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:37,030
Finally, Category VI, allows for
the sustainable use of natural ressources

32
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,170
for the benefit of populations.

33
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,960
These categories range from a very strict
preservation of ecosystems

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,890
to the sustainable use of ressources
that accommodate many interventions of man.

35
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,590
But the first intention is always the conservation
nature.

36
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:03,610
There you have it, you can now start the homework
of this module.
