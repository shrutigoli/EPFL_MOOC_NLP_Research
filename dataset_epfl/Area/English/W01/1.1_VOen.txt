Hello and welcome to the first module of the
Mooc on protected areas management in Africa.
This module introduces a few important notions to know beforehand, a few key concepts that will be helpful throughout the module.
So, this week, the module works as follow:
The first class will be about the history and importance of protected areas: where they come from, what they have become over time, what they represent today for nature conservation.
The second class will deal with their very role: what their purpose is, how they help to preserve nature.
In the third class we will see how a protected area is defined.
Knowing exactly what protected areas are will allow us to better understand them and to better identify the tools, the methods adapted to them.
The forth and fifth class will allow us to classify them into management categories to distinguish, to better understand their identity and better understand their specificities.
The last class will be about the convention of the week.
We will talk about the Convention on Biological
Diversity, an essential convention, when dealing with protected areas in the world.
Finally, we will have a brief summary of the items we discussed this week in the form of an animation and we will present this module's homework.
Here we go, have a great week with us!
