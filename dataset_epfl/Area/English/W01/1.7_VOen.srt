1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,270
Hello and welcome everybody.

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:18,610
Today's class is devoted to the presentation
of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

3
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,540
We are going to review the history, the bodies
and a few recent decisions

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,020
of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:33,410
I invite you to read the text of the Convention,
which includes only 42 articles,

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:40,170
but also to visit the website of the Convention
which is indicated here.

7
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,330
Biodiversity or biological diversity
means the variability among living organisms

8
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,220
on three levels:
genes (these are genetic resources),

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,409
species (the species level) and ecosystems
(the habitat).

10
00:00:54,409 --> 00:01:01,610
The biological resources of Earth are vital
for the economic and social development of

11
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,760
mankind.

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,080
Consequently, there is an increasingly greater
recognition

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,800
that biological diversity is a global asset
of incalculable value to present and future

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,320
generations.

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,240
At the same time, to date, the threats to
species

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,350
and ecosystems have never been greater.

17
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,100
The extinction of species because of human
activities

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,240
has continued at an alarming pace.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,350
In 1988 the United Nations Environment Programme
convened

20
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,909
the ad hoc working group of experts on biological
diversity

21
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,390
in order to explore the creation of an international
convention

22
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,070
on biological diversity.

23
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,420
The Convention was opened for signature on
5 June 1992,

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,810
during the United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development,

25
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,280
the Earth Summit of Rio.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:08,950
Nowadays, 196 countries are contracting parties
to the Convention on Biological Diversity.

27
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:14,000
The Convention on Biological Diversity has
three main objectives:

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,500
the conservation of biological diversity,
the sustainable use of its component

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,560
and the equitable sharing of the benefits
arising out of their utilization.

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,280
These are its three main objectives as stated
in its article 1.

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,260
These three aspects, conservation, sustainable
use

32
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,060
and sharing of benefits,
are at the root of the whole philosophy of

33
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,569
conservation
since the Rio Summit.

34
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:54,050
It is important for you to know this and assess
its impact.

35
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,780
Other articles are important to us.

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:05,450
For example, article 8 on in-situ conservation,
article 9 on ex-situ conservation and article

37
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,400
10 on the sustainable use
of components of biological diversity

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:17,390
are very relevant for protected areas.

39
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,600
Article 8 has 13 paragraphs that are all of
interest to us.

40
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,570
Pay them special attention.

41
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,360
In particular, paragraph a of article 8
on the establishment of a system of protected

42
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,330
areas,
paragraph b on the development, where necessary,

43
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,530
of guidelines
for the selection, establishment and management

44
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:49,400
of protected areas
and paragraph h on the prevention of the introduction,

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,750
control or eradication of alien species which
threaten

46
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,280
ecosystems, habitats or species.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,380
Through these articles, what does the CBD
remind us?

48
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,500
Protected areas are the cornerstone
of the conservation of biodiversity.

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,550
They preserve key habitats, offer sanctuaries,
allow for the migration and displacement of

50
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,959
species,
and maintain natural processes

51
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,459
in the whole landscape.

52
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,300
Protected areas don't just safeguard
the preservation of biodiversity.

53
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,270
They also ensure the well-being of mankind.

54
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,620
Protected areas allow some 1.1 billion people
to survive,

55
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,419
are the main source of drinkable water
for over a third of the world's largest cities,

56
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:47,039
and offer a major guarantee for global food
security.

57
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:52,740
The bodies of the Convention are the following:
the Conference of the Parties

58
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,099
(it gathers all signatories
and meets every two years

59
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:06,180
in order to review the implementation of the
Convention);

60
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,809
the Subsidiary Body in charge of providing
scientific, technical and technical advice;

61
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:18,369
the Intergovernmental Committee for the Nagoya
Protocol

62
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:23,570
which we will discuss in a later module;
the Working Group on Protected Areas

63
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:32,909
(as there is a specific programme
of the Convention in charge of protected areas).

64
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:40,419
The Convention has a Strategic Plan
for Biodiversity for 2011-2020,

65
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:45,130
in which are defined the famous Aichi Biodiversity
Targets,

66
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,360
which there are 20 of.

67
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,759
We will talk about this in more detail in
the next module.

68
00:05:52,759 --> 00:06:01,400
The CBD also has mechanisms for implementation
and a framework for cooperation and partnership.

69
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,689
The Conference of the Parties is the governing
body of the Convention.

70
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:10,529
It advances implementation of the Convention
through the decisions it takes at its periodic

71
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:14,259
meetings.

72
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:18,289
Over 23 years, the Convention on Biological
Diversity has taken

73
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:23,009
a little more than 250 decisions, including
several on the creation,

74
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:32,110
governance and restoration of terrestrial
and marine protected areas.

75
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,629
Recent decisions taken by the Convention illustrate
topical subjects.

76
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:43,080
For instance, integrating biological diversity
in the United Nations Development Programme

77
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:51,710
and the sustainable development goals,
ensuring that biological diversity serves

78
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,689
the fight against poverty
and for sustainable development,

79
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:00,180
promoting the sustainable use of biological
diversity,

80
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,210
for example through bushmeat and the sustainable
management of wildlife.

81
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:15,789
Other types of decisions:
the inclusion of gender equality concerns;

82
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:20,059
an increasingly important issue also focuses
on the conservation

83
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:25,439
and restoration of ecosystems;
and finally, the CBD recognises the need to

84
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,830
improve the efficiency of the structures
and mechanisms of the Convention,

85
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,589
in particular the work of the Subsidiary Body
on Implementation.

86
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:40,349
The Convention on Biological Diversity is
a multilateral agreement

87
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:44,249
on the environment which seeks to protect
and restore the global environment

88
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:50,080
and contributes to sustainable development.

89
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,770
The work undertaken under the Convention has
increased in volume

90
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,449
and specificity and has an increasingly important
impact,

91
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,979
especially due to the growing attention paid
to issues

92
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,399
of implementation.

93
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:11,159
More and more, governmental officials from
all over the world

94
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:16,199
participate in international negotiations
in the framework of the Convention on Biological

95
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,919
Diversity.

96
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:25,319
Their work, their decisions, their recommendations
have a daily impact

97
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:33,380
on what we do or want to do in protected areas
in Africa.

98
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,810
But we have to remember that this is first
and foremost a multilateral agreement,

99
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,539
which requires a lot of consensus and that
this may sometimes limit

100
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,940
the impact of the decisions that are taken.

101
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,940
That's it.

102
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,100
This is the end of this class.

103
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,460
The next episode will be the conclusion of
this module in the form

104
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,840
of a short animation and of course,
the assignment suggested for this week.

105
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:06,910
In the meantime, have a great day!
