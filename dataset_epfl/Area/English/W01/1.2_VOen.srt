00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,700
Hello. 

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,600
Today, the class will help us better understand
the importance and the role of protected areas

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,840
in the world and in Africa in particular.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,160
The publication to be read additionally
is the annual report on the state of protected

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,731
areas
called the Protected Planet Report (as you

6
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,570
can see here)
and the World Database on Protected Areas

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,399
hosted
on www.protectedplanet.net

8
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,560
First, let’s talk about history.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:49,330
Nowadays, more than 15% of the planet
is under some sort of formal protection.

10
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,030
We call these territories protected areas.

11
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,610
The protected areas are seen in green on this
world map

12
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,290
and the marine areas are in blue.

13
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,409
The first park formally recognized in the
modern sense of the word

14
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,180
was the Yellowstone, in North America in 1872.

15
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,680
Its designation comes from the American pioneers'
ambition to preserve an exceptional landscape

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,460
that colonisation would no doubt have damaged.

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,390
It is about preserving nature in its original
state.

18
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,750
But, obviously forms of protection already
existed,

19
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,360
some more or less formally.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,170
For instance, natural sites that were considered
sacred

21
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,710
were pioneers in the preservation of nature.

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,159
Even though it is hard to say when they first
appeared,

23
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,210
some of them have been known and recognized
for hundreds or thousands of years.

24
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,330
But in general the protection of territories
responded above all else

25
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:51,730
to a targeted use, like for example
hunting reserves, which were created for a

26
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,310
certain elite
in the Middle Ages in Europe.

27
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,410
The sudden increase in number of protected
areas,

28
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,620
and the surface they cover,
is a really recent phenomenon.

29
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,610
Their number went from a few dozen at the
beginning of the 20th century

30
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,790
to progressively more than 200,000 today,
spread across the globe.

31
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:19,360
The graph here depicts this evolution,
that is almost exponential since the 50’s

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,830
and that doesn’t seem to decrease
as the recent international commitments appeal

33
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,150
to cover more surface.

34
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,010
Changes in the future will lead towards more
protected areas

35
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,620
and more covered surfaces.

36
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,790
So, the recent history of protected areas
in Africa

37
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:41,140
and in particular French speaking Africa
can be split up schematically into three periods.

38
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,860
During the colonial period and until the end
of the 50’s,

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,180
a lot of classified forests were created
according to the model of state-owned forests

40
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,390
in Europe.

41
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,830
The goal of these forests was mainly the preservation
of a resource, generally wood,

42
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,190
but sometimes their goal included the preservation
of the ecosystem as a whole.

43
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,340
Nevertheless, a few forests would only be
protected for their wood,

44
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,870
for instance, to feed the rail transport with
coal.

45
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,629
The reserves or hunting reserves, on the same
principle,

46
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,030
protected the game for growing the animals
as trophies or for commercial purposes,

47
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,670
like ivory for instance.

48
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,270
This is what lowered the number
of a lot of African species.

49
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,670
Of course, there are exceptions, like for
example,

50
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,430
the natural reserve of Mount Nimba in Guinea.

51
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,420
We can see here that its establishment dates
back to 1944

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,660
and that it was fully protected from the beginning.

53
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,430
The decolonisation is followed, generally
speaking,

54
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,620
by a neutral period as far as creation
and management of protected areas are concerned,

55
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,489
simply because the young States had other
priorities

56
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,269
and few means to invest in this sector.

57
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,960
We have to wait until the 80’s and especially
the 90’s,

58
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,720
after the Rio Conference, for a new momentum
to begin with

59
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,750
the creation of new protected areas
in countries which used to have none.

60
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,190
For example, we can see here the Lopé National
Park in Gabon.

61
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,400
Another example: in the 2000's,
Guinea Bissau formally established its park

62
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,109
network
and the agency managing it today, the IBAP.

63
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:21,720
This recent period in time also showed the
evolution of some territories

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,900
from one status to another, including classified
forests,

65
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,889
that were often classified for the preservation
of a resource,

66
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,190
and sometimes become national parks directed
toward tourism,

67
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,580
like here in the Deux Balé forest in Burkina
Faso.

68
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,889
Above all, in this period of time the management
of

69
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,509
abandoned protected areas was addressed, at
least in theory,

70
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:50,800
and sponsors started supporting them again
and in some cases continue to do so today.

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,060
So, let’s have a closer look at the history
of a park

72
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,840
like the Niokolo Koba in Senegal because it’s
representative enough

73
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,430
of what happened, at least, once again, in
the French speaking Africa.

74
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,330
The Niokola Koba was created in 1926 as a
hunting reserve.

75
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:14,810
It then evolved from a strict hunting reserve
to a classified state-owned forest, and, at

76
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,690
last, in 1954,
to a national park.

77
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:29,340
In 1969, after extensions, the Niokolo Koba
reached its current surface area of 2,256,072

78
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,120
acres
and evictions led to the removal of a number

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,370
of villages
such as Badi, Damantin and Nionghani.

80
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:46,960
In 1981, thanks to its rich biodiversity
the Niokola Koba became

81
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,670
a World Heritage Site.

82
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:59,280
In 2007 due to pressures from human activity
such as poaching, the expansion of agricultural

83
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,080
lands,
and livestock wandering,

84
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
but also the threat of the Sambangalo dam
project

85
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,490
the Niokolo Koba was listed as endangered.

86
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:18,350
Today, the situation in Africa is quite contrasted
for historical reasons (we saw it),

87
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,740
for legal reasons (we’ll see it)
especially between French-speaking Africa

88
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,110
and the English-speaking one,
for cultural reasons too,

89
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,410
sometimes for security or geopolitical reasons,
and finally due to opportunism.

90
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:39,680
The map here gives you the current protected
areas coverage.

91
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,140
The darker it is, the more protected areas
there are.

92
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,710
The more green spots there are, the more it
is covered by protected areas.

93
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:51,240
But there is no real reliable data
and the reality on the field can be very different.

94
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,490
Generally speaking, let’s remember that
today there are

95
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:03,780
more than 7000 protected areas in Africa,
that represent more or less a 14% land coverage

96
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,069
and almost a 4% sea coverage.

97
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,090
In reality it is probably even more as the
data comes

98
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:22,390
from the World Database on Protected Areas,
which is obviously incomplete.

99
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:30,130
This coverage is not homogeneous nor representative
at a global level and at Africa’s level.

100
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,889
Some of the territories are underrepresented,
like deserts or coastline areas that,

101
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:43,590
even though they are very important for biodiversity,
are often not protected, simply because

102
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,889
they are densely populated and harder to deal
with.

103
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:54,360
For instance, on the left, these maps show
important areas for birds

104
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,669
whereas on the right,
we have the protected areas

105
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:01,460
for the same area, West Africa.

106
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,169
Taking a closer look, we can see that a number
of areas

107
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:10,669
that are important and should be preserved,
but are not.

108
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,139
There is no overlapping of these two approaches,
of these two maps.

109
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:20,449
So, as I told you today
the data on protected areas is gathered

110
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:31,110
in a world database whose acronym is WDPA
for World Database on

111
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,570
Protected Areas.

112
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,610
You will find this database on the website
www.protectedplanet.net.

113
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,409
Take your time, read the information
on protected areas that you know.

114
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,809
I chose, for example, the page of the Comoe
Park in the Ivory Coast, here.

115
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:52,959
Go to the website, use the tool on a few parks
to learn how to use it well.

116
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,480
It will be really useful throughout this course.

117
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,689
Unfortunately, you will see
a lot of information is still incorrect.

118
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:03,720
It’s up to you to make it right.

119
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,589
That’s the end of the class.

120
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,129
The next class will be about the role of the
protected areas

121
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:12,009
in the world and especially in Africa.

122
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,689
Have a great day!
