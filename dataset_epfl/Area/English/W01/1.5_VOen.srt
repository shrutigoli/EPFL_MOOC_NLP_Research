00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,680
Hello and welcome to today's class, which
is intended to help us 

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,840
better understand what the protected area
management categories are.

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,720
The reference book to consult as a complement
to the class

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,619
is once again the Guidelines
for applying protected area management categories

5
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,030
developed
by the World Commission on Protected Areas.

6
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,280
You can see the publication here.

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,539
Let's take this opportunity to listen to Charlotte,
who gave us the definition during the previous

8
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:44,190
module
and is going to tell us a bit more about this

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,719
commission that is very important for us
and which we will discuss again later.

10
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,609
Visit the website of WCPA which I'm showing
you here

11
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:56,260
as you will find a lot of useful material
there

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,489
over the course of this MOOC.

13
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:05,270
WCPA is the World Commission
on Protected Areas.

14
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,350
It is one of the six specialist groups of
IUCN.

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:16,930
It was created in 1958 and today,
it is managed by the global program of IUCN

16
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,140
on protected areas.

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,110
The commission today counts about
1,800 members in 140 countries in the world.

18
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,440
What is interesting is that its mission is
to set up,

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,640
or at least promote, an international representative
network

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,840
of marine and terrestrial protected areas
that are managed efficiently.

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,110
For Africa, we consider that there are two
regions

22
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,060
at the level of WCPA.

23
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,240
There is the West and Central African region
and of course, the East and Southern African

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
region.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,640
So, I'm going to talk to you mostly about
the West and Central African region

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,220
which counts today about 110 members
coming from some 20 countries.

27
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,380
Unfortunately, we have a few countries
that are not yet represented.

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,910
But what is great is that in this Commission,
we have members who come from different categories

29
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,590
of stakeholders.

30
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,390
For example, you have directors of protected
areas,

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,689
You have specialists – practitioners as
you say –

32
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:28,230
the protected area managers themselves.

33
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,469
We also have people working
in international organizations.

34
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:37,590
We have people working in NGOs,
non-governmental organizations.

35
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,609
We also have other experts who don't necessarily
work

36
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:46,409
on protected areas but work on
other themes in connection with biodiversity

37
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,069
and the protection of nature.

38
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:54,459
So, it's a really dynamic and inclusive network
that seeks to gather all of the expertise

39
00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:00,760
that we have at the regional level
in terms of protected areas management.

40
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,969
In order to become a member of the World Commission
on Protected Areas,

41
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:09,370
you must be ready to take an active part
and contribute to the Commission's mission

42
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,489
voluntarily.

43
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,980
So, it's really volunteer work.

44
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,880
To become a member, there are two steps.

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,730
First, you must complete an online form.

46
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,930
It is a form you can find on the IUCN website.

47
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,799
The applicant will complete this form
and provide information on his interests,

48
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,669
his expertise and also the way he wishes to
contribute

49
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:35,790
to the different components of the Commission.

50
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,180
Next, he or she
must send a resume

51
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,049
to the IUCN Secretariat which deals with members.

52
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,409
Then, the resume together with the form will
be analyzed

53
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,110
by the management of the Commission at the
level of

54
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,480
West and Central Africa.

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,489
Finally, the person will receive a response
from the Secretariat confirming or not

56
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:06,389
whether he is officially a member of the Commission
and he will receive at the same time information

57
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:11,620
on what is expected from a Commission member
and all the advantages you may enjoy as a

58
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,400
WCPA member.

59
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:25,060
In the previous module, we have learned to
identify what

60
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,220
a protected area is, according to the definition
that I remind you here.

61
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,910
Working on the categories means first inquiring
about the nature of the territory as these

62
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,660
categories only interest us
if the territory is indeed a protected area.

63
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:47,420
So, the first step is always asking yourself
whether it is indeed a space which main objective

64
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,560
is the conservation of nature.

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,200
It is essential.

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,250
So, what is the use of these categories?

67
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,790
As we're going to see, they have several possible
uses

68
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,600
but the main one is simply to make it possible
to classify the different protected areas

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,190
into rather homogeneous boxes
based on their common characteristics.

70
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,240
Let's take a simple example.

71
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,310
Imagine that one day, you develop a cataract.

72
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,680
You then go to your local clinic
to see your usual ophthalmologist.

73
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,230
But once at the clinic, his secretary tells
you that he's gone on holiday

74
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,370
and will not be back for another month.

75
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,300
But she has an idea and suggests that you
get an operation

76
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,140
from his obstetrician colleague who, granted,
has never performed surgery on an eye but

77
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,810
is always up for a new experience.

78
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,090
In addition, he's very dexterous since
before becoming a surgeon, he was a lumberjack.

79
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,430
What are you going to do?

80
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,260
Are you going to entrust your eyes to this
enthusiastic experimenter?

81
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,660
Are you going to look for another ophthalmologist?

82
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,570
Well, the same holds for protected areas as
for clinics.

83
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,160
They all look alike but they don't all have
the same role,

84
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,970
the same objective or the same management.

85
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,290
So, classifying the more than 200,000 protected
areas of the planet

86
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,720
in different categories, as described on this
graph

87
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,080
that shows the surface covered, will help
us

88
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,050
better identify them, work more specifically
on each of them and develop tools

89
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,140
that are better adapted to their management
or governance style,

90
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:28,420
according to the different categories that
you see here.

91
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,780
Even if many believe that to be a park custodian
is like being the custodian of any park,

92
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,850
that is not true and there are actually different
jobs,

93
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,620
different profiles, different responsibilities
according to the different protected area

94
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,030
categories.

95
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,640
Being able to distinguish sites according
to their main management objective

96
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,120
is therefore the central function of these
categories.

97
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,550
Now, let's have a look at other possible uses.

98
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,250
By identifying different protected area categories,
you are able to know whether the network

99
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,700
that you manage includes precisely all the
possible methods of management

100
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,700
or whether it is monospecific,
which may suggest that it is incomplete.

101
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,870
On this map for example, we can see the network
of the Ivorian Office of Parks

102
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,140
and Reserves, which includes 14 parks.

103
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,710
You see them here in hatched but all these
parks

104
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:30,800
belong to only two categories: category 1
and 2.

105
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,920
Why exclude other management methods?

106
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,120
Another similar function relates to governance.

107
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,720
Even though categories refer to the management
objective of a site,

108
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:50,080
it is often directly or indirectly
related to who will manage the territory.

109
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,250
Having different management categories
is a good way to expand the list of the various

110
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,050
stakeholders
that you will involve in the network.

111
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,340
For example, by creating around the Pendjari
national park -

112
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,120
that you see here - various protected areas
of other categories

113
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,290
(hunting, villages, etc...

114
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,680
another hunting area here),
other areas that are protected areas

115
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,110
but of other categories, the co-management
with other stakeholders

116
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,940
(for example the populations or the hunting
concessions),

117
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,550
may take place
while it would be difficult if you took into

118
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,820
consideration only the park itself.

119
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,700
Another very important function is to be able
to better organize the collection and analysis

120
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,520
of data from the parks.

121
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,950
Since data is better collected when targeting
specific categories,

122
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,389
they are easier to read and to compare between
sites.

123
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:52,060
Similarly, comparative park evaluations
should only concern sites of the same category,

124
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,950
at the risk of comparing mangoes with bananas
:

125
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,980
an additional good reason to classify our
protected areas

126
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,900
into boxes that make sense.

127
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,620
Other functions are appearing all over the
place.

128
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,030
They are interesting to take into account
for the future in Africa.

129
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:14,279
In particular, you may create one regulation
for each category and then simply

130
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,840
make a list of parks by category.

131
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,680
In this way, instead of having a usually unreadable
text,

132
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,520
like this text on the Mount Nimba dating from
1944,

133
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,230
or even a lost text, you only have to manage
a list of sites

134
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,200
for which everyone can easily check what is
authorized or not

135
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,960
according to its category.

136
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,300
This leads to more clarity, more transparency
and brings us back to the idea that the staff

137
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,050
of a park should not
move from one site to another at the whim

138
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,700
of transfers
but instead actually go where their skills

139
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,779
are the most needed.

140
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,560
So, categories simply aim at improving the
management

141
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,030
and organization of protected areas by classifying
them better.

142
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,880
And if somewhere, the use of these categories
leads to

143
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,950
the opposite result, it is simply that they
are being used badly.

144
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,830
In particular, you can't decide to change
the category of a park

145
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:16,820
in order to limit its uses or evict its inhabitants
who had the right to live there until then.

146
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:24,710
You don't assign a category to a park
to decrease its level of protection.

147
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,760
None of this is the proper use of these categories.

148
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,540
To sum up, categories are simply a tool to
assist

149
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,620
the planning of protected areas.

150
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,860
They are related to the management objective
of the territory,

151
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,690
which is given to us by the classification
text

152
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,560
for a traditional site or the decision
of the authority in charge since - it may

153
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,700
be an oral tradition
in the case of a sacred site for example.

154
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:59,260
So, you must refer to the objective
in order to determine the management category.

155
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,820
We've reached the end of this class.

156
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,900
The next episode will focus on the categories
themselves.

157
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,300
Have a great day!
