00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,170
Hello.

2
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,970
Today, this class will help us better understand
the role played by protected areas in Africa.

3
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,630
The additional reading for this class
is once again the annual report

4
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:34,090
on the state of protected areas entitled “the
Protected Planet report”.

5
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,870
You can also read the reports of the studies
done by Papaco in Africa in the past few years.

6
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:46,980
They are on our website www.papaco.org.

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,030
Protected areas are known today
to be a useful tool to manage

8
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,860
and to preserve the biological diversity.

9
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,900
Some people even say they are the cornerstone
of conservation strategies.

10
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:06,670
This explains their dramatic increase in number
and in surface over the recent years.

11
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,770
These protected areas preserve species,
sometimes threatened species, as we can see

12
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,590
here,
specific ecosystems, or rare habitats.

13
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,650
They are trying to preserve the environment
in its natural state

14
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,570
or at least with as little change as possible.

15
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,350
This historical vision of parks and reserves
has changed, though.

16
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,189
From glass case protected zones, protected
areas,

17
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:34,920
or at least some of them,
are gradually becoming territories of sustainable

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,320
environment management,
where human activities,

19
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,670
for instance fishing, when compatible
(and this is very important to underline)

20
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,790
can be integrated
into the management of protected areas and

21
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,640
therefore strengthen their future.

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,979
There is obviously a paradox that everyone
can notice:

23
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,000
while the number of protected areas on the
planet

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:04,439
is growing, biodiversity continues to decline.

25
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,229
Let’s have a look at this census analysis
of large mammal species in some parks of Africa,

26
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:16,230
like in West Africa, as shown here.

27
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,040
Their number decreased by 85% in 35 years
and today there is only 15% of of what was

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,319
left in the 70’s
when the number was already quite low.

29
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,400
Let’s remember that this is the case in
protected areas.

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,650
Imagine the situation elsewhere!

31
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,360
Let’s also look at this analysis of the
Panthera NGO

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,170
in the Mole National Park in Ghana.

33
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,770
We can see that the changes in number of some
herbivores

34
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,650
is catastrophic.

35
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,790
We go from this situation to this one.

36
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,510
There are now many species whose population
is more important outside the areas that are

37
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:05,440
supposed to protect them
than inside, like the tiger for example;

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,330
the number of tigers remaining in the wild
(more or less 3000, in India, in Malaysia,

39
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,590
Russia etc.)
is below the number of tigers held in captivity

40
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:20,160
in gardens of individuals in the United States
(it is estimated at over 5000)

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,310
An example closer to us is the Oryx Dammah,
that we can see in this picture.

42
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,629
He has vanished into thin air.

43
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:34,530
It only exists in captivity whereas before
it was found in Senegal, in Mali, and in Niger.

44
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,760
However, it is currently subject to a reintroduction
program

45
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,250
in Senegal and in Chad.

46
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:46,340
The question we can legitimately ask
is whether protected areas are really useful.

47
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,549
I'll let you think about it.

48
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:53,000
Take 5 minutes to answer this question
for yourself based on your field knowledge.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,519
Gather your arguments.

50
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,569
This is not a pointless question, because
critics of protected areas

51
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,050
are everywhere.

52
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,690
Among the reasons mentioned to explain this
situation,

53
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,290
first there was the fact that some protected
areas are not effective,

54
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,090
either because they were poorly built,
because they lack the means or because they

55
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,300
are poorly managed.

56
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,959
Anyway, they do not achieve their conservation
goals.

57
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:20,519
Some protected areas are even purely virtual,
hardly existing as a single line on a map,

58
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,530
such as the giraffe reserve of Ansongo Menaka
in Mali,

59
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,870
that I'm showing you here, where there has
been no giraffe

60
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,690
for a long time, and, in reality, no reserve
anymore either.

61
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,420
Here, we can clearly see that the territories
outside

62
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,200
and inside the protected area are the same.

63
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,980
There is no difference between the villages
and the park.

64
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,800
There are many other examples like this one.

65
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,510
We will come back to it.

66
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,760
Another reason commonly mentioned
focuses on the system of protected areas globally

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,200
and not on individual sites anymore.

68
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,950
Often incomplete (which means that they do
not include

69
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,140
all places where strong biodiversity issues
exist)

70
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,160
these systems are also often not representative.

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,200
Take for example Benin, whose map we can see
here,

72
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,660
and where the two national parks in the country,
the Pendjari here or the W,

73
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,170
are in the same ecosystem in the far north
of the country.

74
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,420
Consequently, other areas, that are different
and

75
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,080
potentially valuable are not protected.

76
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,480
Finally it is these territories' governance
that is questioned,

77
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,630
especially their failure to gain support
of the local populations directly affected

78
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:39,080
by their existence,
making their protection all the more difficult.

79
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,320
This concept is taking more and more space
with the development of protected areas of

80
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,640
category 6,
where the exploitation of natural resources

81
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,490
is possible,
as we'll soon see.

82
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,580
But be careful, it is not necessarily always
realistic

83
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,380
to think we can consistently associate local
participants;

84
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,720
some protected areas are created to prevent
all human activity,

85
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,370
making the local population's involvement
rather complicated.

86
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,880
But the functions, the roles of the protected
areas

87
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,880
go beyond their simple and essential role
of preservation.

88
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,190
They are places of recreation and of nature
discovery

89
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,980
and they raise awareness among people, young
and old,

90
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:25,160
on the challenges of conservation.

91
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,990
This is an absolutely essential function,
often underestimated,

92
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,090
while the future of these territories, of
our protected areas,

93
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,290
actually depends on the support of others.

94
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:41,710
They also offer relatively preserved territories
to conduct the necessary research actions

95
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,600
helping us better understand the world around
us.

96
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,220
They provide goods and services to us all,
to people living in and around protected areas,

97
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,940
of course
(which is easy to understand)

98
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,220
such as forest produce,
bamboo, honey, medicinal plants, etc.

99
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,530
But they also provide to distant places, because
they play a role

100
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,610
in purifying water
in keeping the air devoid of human pollution,

101
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,610
etc, etc.

102
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,090
In this respect, they are also actors of
climate change mitigation

103
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,790
and open laboratories of nature’s evolution
during these changes.

104
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,880
There is a lot to learn about the ecosystem's
ability to adapt.

105
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:28,090
That’s what we call resilience.

106
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,090
Protected areas also preserve sites
of cultural or spiritual value.

107
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,870
And increasingly, culture and nature intertwine
to form the global value of the territory.

108
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:44,500
For example, some archaeological sites,
like here in the Great Rift Valley in Kenya,

109
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,730
are preserved within protected areas.

110
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,960
Another interesting example comes from Madagascar,
where some people recognize lemurs,

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:59,750
like this Sifaka, as their ancestors
and thus provide them very strict protection.

112
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,740
Culture and nature can therefore totally support
each other.

113
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,470
Finally, these territories represent today’s
commitment

114
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,920
to the future, the ability to put aside
some resources and wealth for future generations

115
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,510
that may meet their needs when the time comes.

116
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,920
It’s not the least important function of
protected areas

117
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:25,000
but it’s certainly not the easiest to understand.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,040
Protected areas have so many roles that add
up,

119
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,670
as we have just seen.

120
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,110
Yet they are not sufficient to stem the erosion
of biodiversity,

121
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,830
and fortunately there are other environment-friendly
forms

122
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:42,880
of territory development
which may also contribute to conservation.

123
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,720
For example, sustainable practices in agriculture,
balanced management of forests,

124
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,529
and infrastructure limiting their impact
on species and on places.

125
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:57,029
All this must be added up in an attempt to
achieve the expected results

126
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:01,490
and we can’t rely only on protected areas
if we wish to preserve our environment as

127
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,490
a whole.

128
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,180
So, fortunately, the areas of highest priority
for conservation

129
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,160
are generally well known today.

130
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,839
There are several ways to identify them.

131
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:19,560
For instance, the eco-regions we can see here,
which were determined by WWF.

132
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,500
Another approach is key biodiversity areas.

133
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,000
The most well-known of which are the important
bird areas,

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,459
defined by Birdlife and that we can see
on this map in green.

135
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:41,690
Based on this data, it is actually quite easy
to prioritise where and how to intervene.

136
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,639
One way to do it is certainly to create new
protected areas

137
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,759
but then again, they alone cannot meet all
challenges

138
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,470
and nature conservation must be understood
as a whole.

139
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,110
Protected areas are only one aspect of it.

140
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,819
That’s the end of the class.

141
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:01,860
The next episode will focus on the precise
definition of these protected areas.

142
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,499
Have a great day!
