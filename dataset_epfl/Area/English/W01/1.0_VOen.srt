00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:23,680
Hello and welcome to this Mooc on the management
and the governance of protected areas in Africa. 

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,480
This Mooc is a general training course
on the way these particular territories are

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,480
being managed.

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,070
It will help us thinking about
and better understand their contribution

5
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,430
to the conservation of nature on the continent
and to the sustainable development of the

6
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,890
territories around them,
because protected areas are more than fauna

7
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,290
and flora reserves.

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,510
They also provide resources,
goods, useful services to the local populations,

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:54,070
and beyond them, to all humankind.

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,670
Three key people have contributed to the development
of this Mooc

11
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,090
and they will coordinate it with me: Sylvie
Goyet,

12
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,789
Paul NDiaye from the Cheikh-Anta-Diop University
in Dakar

13
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:09,430
and Paul Ouédraogo from the RAMSAR Convention
Secretariat.

14
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:16,280
Several other speakers will share
their experience through interviews or videos.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,530
Their names will be listed at the end of this
introduction

16
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,190
and you will soon see them on your screens
of course.

17
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,909
So, this Mooc has 7 modules spread over 7
weeks.

18
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,300
Each module contains 6 sequences
allowing us to address a specific topic,

19
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,840
and reading material is also provided for
you to go deeper.

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,160
So, depending on your expectations
you will have the possibility to go more or

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,080
less into detail.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,770
At the end of each module, an animation sums
up

23
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,530
the important points of the week, and an assessment
test

24
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,530
is available.

25
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,939
It is optional,
but if you succeed, you will receive a certificate

26
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,750
of achievement.

27
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,820
Those who wish to will be able to take a final
classroom exam

28
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,150
and get EPFL certification.

29
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,209
We will talk about this during the Mooc,
don't worry.

30
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,480
The first module will introduce a few key
concepts

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,130
to really understand what protected areas
are:

32
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,890
their nature, their importance, their role,
their specificities.

33
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,019
The second module will be more specifically
about their management:

34
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:32,609
planning, networks,
the use of the land around and between the

35
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,660
areas,
transboundary protected areas.

36
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:43,329
The third module will be about their governance,
a cucial topic:

37
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,550
who does what and how to manage those territories.

38
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,600
We will talk about State, communities, private
sector etc.

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,980
In the fourth module we will cover some of
the aspects

40
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,900
regarding the areas' effectiveness:
surveillance, ecological monitoring,

41
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,560
raising awareness among partners and also
recognition of good practices

42
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,540
thanks to the green list.

43
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,959
The fifth module will cover a few specific
aspects

44
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,310
of these protected areas:
the link with culture for instance,

45
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,820
the importance of training, the marine environment,
species conservation and also tourism.

46
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:32,350
The sixth module will be about funding
conservation activities in and around protected

47
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,810
areas.

48
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,340
We will talk about the economic values (and
others)

49
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,780
of protected areas, about financial planning,
the sources of funding and its mechanisms,

50
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,479
compensation and so on.

51
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:53,169
Finally, the last module will be dealing with
topical issues related to African protected

52
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,510
areas.

53
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:03,290
We will talk about climate change, connectivity,
ecological restoration, gender and equity,

54
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,320
corruption and all kinds of traffics.

55
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:13,470
Each week, an important international convention
will be presented:

56
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,750
The Convention on Biological Diversity
and its related agreements like

57
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,410
the CITES, the RAMSAR Convention,
the World Heritage Convention,

58
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,100
and also the Convention on Migratory Species
(CMS).

59
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,180
This Mooc will be the opportunity for us to
share

60
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,690
our experiences through the discussion group
put in place.

61
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,360
We count on you for sharing your opinions
and suggestions

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,820
to improve this course.

63
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,530
Don't wait until the end of the Mooc to talk
to us.

64
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,680
All good ideas are welcome.

65
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,940
Finally, I'd like to thank the organisations
and people

66
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,980
who made this Mooc possible.

67
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,010
We benefit from the financial support of André
Hoffmann,

68
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,720
of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
and of the partnership between France and

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,090
the IUCN,
in particular the French Development Agency.

70
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,100
This Mooc is the result of a technical collaboration
between

71
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:23,630
the EPFL, the IUCN, the Cheikh-Anta-Diop University
and the RAMSAR Convention.

72
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,630
That's it.

73
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,570
Here we go, for 7 weeks that we hope to be
fascinating.

74
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,780
Have a great day!
