Protected Areas Management
Dr. Geoffroy Mauvais 

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,820
There’re many ways to look at Africa

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,670
but there is one picture everyone has in mind:
that of its outstanding nature,

4
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,470
of its fauna and flora
untamed to this day.

5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,280
All this exists today
in the continent's parks, reserves and protected

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,110
areas,
but for how long?

7
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,330
Africa is changing, it's moving,
balances are tilting traditions are fading,

8
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,000
nature comes in second behind development
concerns,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,350
which are legitimate, but often damaging
to the environment

10
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,810
For African protected areas
to keep playing a role in the conservation

11
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:03,860
of this unique heritage,
they also need to be moving.

12
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,799
More actions effectiveness,
more transparency in decision-making,

13
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,310
more results, and above all,
more impact on the field,

14
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,770
more equity, more legitimacy,
more support of populations,

15
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,040
locally, and also
wherever citizens can work for

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,910
the conservation of nature.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:26,479
There you go,
this is this course's objective;

18
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,670
Learning, understanding,
and putting our heads together

19
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,940
to improve the governance and the management
of these territories.

20
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,380
Every week during 5 weeks,
we will address a key topic,

21
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,369
planning, governance, financing, important
conventions etc.

22
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,190
We will talk about spatial planning, about
surveillance,

23
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,460
about environmental education,
about gender, about ecosystem services,

24
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,130
about local populations, tourism, climate,
about marine protected areas...

25
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,630
In short,
about everything you need to know

26
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,130
to sustainably preserve
these protected areas.

27
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,420
Sylvie Goyet,
Paul Ndiaye,

28
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,119
and Paul Ouédraogo,
will help me with this course.

29
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,220
Each week,
they will share with us everything they know.

30
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,409
Several experts will also intervene,
and share their experience, challenge our

31
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:20,870
certainties,
and share their solutions.

32
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,120
Each week we'll have videos,
documents to read to dig deeper into the subject,

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,829
some quizzes for fun,
and an assessment test

34
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,409
nothing too complicated.

35
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:32,290
And a good opportunity to learn, as a group.

36
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,569
Because during the entire Mooc,
we will meet on the forum, to discuss, share,

37
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,900
learn or teach,
and I hope, develop a network of players,

38
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,939
of "friends" of protected areas,
that will go beyond the duration of this Mooc.

39
00:02:45,939 --> 00:03:03,969
There is no prerequisite to register,
only an interest for African protected areas.

40
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:07,540
So go ahead and join us for this Mooc.

41
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:14,629
See you soon.

42
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:19,069
A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ANDRE HOFFMANN,
ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FEDERALE DE LAUSANNE,

43
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:26,239
AND IUCN (VIA THE PARTNERSHIP FRANCE – IUCN)
THIS MOOC IS THE RESULT OF THE ACADEMIC COLLABORATION

44
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,969
BETWEEN THE FOLLOWING INSTITUTIONS:
IT WAS PRODUCED AS PART OF THE RESCIF

45
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:34,049
AND THE INITIATIVE OF THE EPFL MOOC FOR AFRICA
