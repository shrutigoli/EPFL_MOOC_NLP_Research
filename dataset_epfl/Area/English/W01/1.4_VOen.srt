1
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,930
Hello.

2
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,790
In today's class we'll look at the definition
of protected areas.

3
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,320
This may seem incidental to you and yet,
it is extremely important as we're going to

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,320
see.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,680
The document to consult as a complement to
the class

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,940
are the IUCN Guidelines
on management categories.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,160
They are published by the World Commission
on Protected Areas.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,210
So, why should we be interested in this definition?

9
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,780
Well, because, as we have seen,
there are more and more protected areas.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,370
Over 200,000 today covering more than 20 million
km2,

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,710
as shown on this graph.

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,190
They are more and more complex
as we will see when we look at management

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,720
categories
and forms of governance.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,510
Here, we can see the different categories
that will be presented

15
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,810
in our next class.

16
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,610
So, it has become necessary to clarify what
is

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,210
and what isn't a protected area so that the
tools,

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,780
the knowledge and the practices that are developed
specifically for their management or good

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,110
governance
may be put to good use.

20
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,000
The work to define protected areas
already has a relatively long story

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,150
which starts in the 1930s,
when experts started to try and clarify

22
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:36,750
the terminology used to name
all the protected areas then in existence.

23
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,490
Many works followed afterwards,
in the course of international congresses,

24
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,229
parks,
and various meetings that took place,

25
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,060
with a constantly improved definition
that has progressively adjusted to the evolution

26
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,409
of these territories.

27
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,950
The definition currently in force,
which we will look at today,

28
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,450
was set in 2008,
during the World Conservation Congress organised

29
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,840
by the IUCN in Barcelona.

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,689
So, let's have a look at this definition.

31
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,000
Charlotte Karibuhoye,
vice-president of the World Commission on

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,860
Protected Areas
for Western and Central Africa, presents it

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,860
for us.

34
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,989
A protected area is a clearly defined geographical
space,

35
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,530
recognized, dedicated and managed, through
legal or

36
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,030
other effective means,
to achieve the long-term conservation of nature,

37
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:33,800
with associated ecosystem services,
and cultural values.

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,040
It is extremely important to properly understand
each word

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,799
and what they represent.

40
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:44,190
The best way to do that is yet again
to read the Guidelines on the definition carefully.

41
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,620
This isn't very long.

42
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,950
It is covered in chapters 1 and 2 of this
book.

43
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,970
Less than 10 pages in total.

44
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,560
Every word in this definition is important.

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,180
I would like to insist here on a few of them
in particular.

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,910
They are the words "defined," "recognised,"
"managed"

47
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,780
and of course "conservation of nature."

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,340
So, "defined": a protected area
is a territory that can be identified.

49
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,580
We know where it starts and where it ends.

50
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,130
So, this means that its boundaries can be
identified

51
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,190
but this doesn't necessarily require markings,
signs or fences.

52
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,050
Sometimes, it can actually be very difficult
to follow the boundaries of a park,

53
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,250
especially when they are associated with
natural elements like a river or a forest

54
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,000
that can of course change with time.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,570
For example, the Mount Nimba integral reserve
in Ivory Coast:

56
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,639
a part of its boundary was created artificially
in 1944

57
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,079
by planting a bamboo line.

58
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,200
It has of course evolved over time into a
full-blown forest,

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,079
which makes it hard today to know where the
reserve starts precisely.

60
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,100
Ok, that might seem of little importance but
when there are mineral resources

61
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,850
which location depends on a few dozen meters,
this can become a serious issue.

62
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,360
This scenario is actually quite frequent.

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,160
Let's listen to Isidore talk about it.

64
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,590
The location of the Khuzi-Biega
is confusing in its low altitude part.

65
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:23,490
Decades ago, at the end of the 1970s
or in the early 80s, we ran experiments.

66
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:30,590
We lacked solid markers,
so we planted bamboos along the boundaries.

67
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,860
The land is fertile, so over time the bamboos
grew on both sides

68
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,600
of the boundary,
covering at least 30 to 40 meters.

69
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,860
Until today, we are struggling to find the
exact spot

70
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,000
where we planted the first bamboos.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,759
The stump has developed, it's a plant that
thrives very fast.

72
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,939
The stump developed and it's still causing
problems today.

73
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:01,280
It is often not advisable
to put a plant marker, especially those that

74
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
grow fast.

75
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,430
That is really a serious problem.

76
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,419
Let's look at the word "recognised."

77
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,110
A protected area is a human construction.

78
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,639
It may include various territories, ecosystems,
associate various stakeholders,

79
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,240
but it must be recognized at a certain level,
national, international or local.

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,759
However, that doesn't necessarily mean there
must be a text -

81
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,250
a decree or a bylaw for example.

82
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:36,110
So, a protected area may be recognized
by a traditional authority such as for instance

83
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,300
the community of a specific area or sacred
sites

84
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,419
and there are many of them in Africa.

85
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,490
Of course, a protected area may also be recognized
by a private entity

86
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,360
that owns it or an international or local
NGO.

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,629
As for the word "managed," a protected area
is a defined recognised territory, as we've

88
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:58,780
just seen, and it is managed.

89
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,689
This means that decisions are made for this
territory,

90
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:05,879
so it can't be a mere line on a map,
like those famous paper parks we've mentioned

91
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,340
and will certainly discuss again.

92
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:17,680
However, this doesn't necessarily imply interventions,
as a management decision may consist for example

93
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,379
in leaving the ecosystem
without any human intervention,

94
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:24,680
as is the case in some sacred sites that are
completely

95
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,400
off limits or in island reserves
like the Aldabra island in the Seychelles

96
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,349
which you can see here.

97
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:35,999
Finally, let's talk about the "conservation
of nature."

98
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:39,780
It is of course the most crucial notion in
the definition.

99
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,949
A protected area is a defined territory
that is recognised and managed to conserve

100
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:45,949
nature.

101
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:52,919
So, it is about preserving the environment
as a whole in-situ and long term.

102
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,289
It is nature that is concerned as a whole,
globally.

103
00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:00,819
A zoo for example protects animals but outside
of their environment.

104
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,660
It is not a protected area.

105
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,669
Another example: a military area where grazing
has been deferred for years

106
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:10,090
will gradually host a wealth of different
species of fauna

107
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,090
and flora.

108
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,090
It's obvious.

109
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,010
But it remains a military area that may be
used as such overnight.

110
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,350
So, it is not a protected area.

111
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,349
There are of course many possible names for
protected areas.

112
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:28,169
Let's take a few examples that are found in
Africa:

113
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:31,919
national park, natural reserve, classified
forest,

114
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,610
community area, sacred site, game sanctuary,
marine park.

115
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,800
What matters in order to know whether those
territories are protected areas

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,430
is not their name but their final goal.

117
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,560
Some classified forests are protected areas
because they were classified to conserve a

118
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,479
complete ecosystem.

119
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,610
But other forests are only for the production
of timber,

120
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,610
eucalyptus for example, and are not protected
areas.

121
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,940
This applies to all designations.

122
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:06,680
In conclusion, a protected area is a territory
with certain specific characteristics, as

123
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,169
we've just seen,
and the primary goal of which is the conservation

124
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,370
of nature.

125
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,180
Other territories may also be useful
to protect the environment.

126
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,440
Let's not forget that protected areas
only cover about 15% of the planet.

127
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,229
It's already a lot but it isn't enough.

128
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:27,430
Fortunately, other areas
also contribute to the preservation of nature.

129
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,620
Now, take some time to think about the different
sites

130
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,010
that you know and try to apply the definition
to see if they are protected areas or not.

131
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,200
Do it with 3 or 4 sites to get used to the
definition.

132
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,290
Also try the reverse exercise and find sites
that are important for nature

133
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,080
but are not protected areas.

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,030
You know some of those for sure.

135
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,579
That's it.

136
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,490
We've reached the end of this class.

137
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,209
The next episode will be
on the management categories of protected

138
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,209
areas.

139
00:08:58,209 --> 00:08:58,730
Have a great day!
