00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,081
Hello and welcome to today's class
in which we will introduce the protected area

2
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:19,520
management categories.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,160
The reference book to consult as a complement
to the class

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,340
Is once again the Guidelines
on the management categories developed by

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,660
WCPA.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,500
But you can also find a summary of everything
in the NAPA letter 59.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,880
In the previous module, we have learned how
to determine

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,500
categories and that what matters in doing
so

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,570
is the protected areas management's objective.

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,440
Sometimes, there is a gap between that objective
and reality,

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,980
as can be seen in the field.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,500
You must always refer to the management objective.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,320
Too bad if the manager strays from it - hopefully
only temporarily.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,780
Now, let's see what those categories are.

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,640
There are six of them, as you can see on this
list,

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,970
and they are globally and roughly following
a progressive evolution from territories

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,210
intended to be kept in their natural state
as much as possible

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,430
(categories I to III) to territories where
the human intervention

19
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,049
is increasingly visible (categories IV, V
and VI).

20
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:24,980
The first of these categories here is presented
to us by Fabrice.

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,950
Category I protected areas
are protected areas where we are trying

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,159
to limit human intervention and any alteration
of the environment.

23
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:44,049
So, these are truly protected areas
where you protect the environment in its natural

24
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:46,470
state as much as possible.

25
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,010
Now, let's look at category II, which is commonly
known as “national park”.

26
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,229
This name is actually somewhat inappropriate
but

27
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,810
we have seen that the name of a territory
doesn't necessarily determine

28
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,409
one, whether it is a protected area
and two, the way it is managed.

29
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:03,439
But that's the way it is.

30
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,060
Well, I work for the national park of Kahuzi
Biega.

31
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,170
It is a category II park, which means that
we really ensure the protection of natural

32
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,760
resources through
patrols and anti-poaching leagues, we do authorize

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:28,090
scientific research
in cooperation with the local universities.

34
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,090
There is tourism.

35
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,680
You know, we are in the Great Lake.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,730
Tourism is thriving and of course, there is
environmental education.

37
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,769
All the schools in the region come here
to take walks in the forest and look at rare

38
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,249
species.

39
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:46,769
The third category is relatively rare in Africa.

40
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:52,090
It concerns territories that are classified
to protect a specific natural monument,

41
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,010
that is a specific topographical element.

42
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,569
It may be a mountain, a cavern, an underwater
cave,

43
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:04,099
a small island or a remote forest.

44
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:10,200
The fourth category is much more common,
like for example the Diawling park in Mauritania

45
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,849
seen here in this photo,
where a system of dams allows constant control

46
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:19,189
on the water level
in order to manage nesting areas for birds

47
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:25,150
or for example,
fight against invasive aquatic species.

48
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,510
Let's go back to Fabrice who will tell us
more about this.

49
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,510
Speaking of protected area management category
IV,

50
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,919
we are talking about protected areas which
primary objective is

51
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,370
to protect the specific species or habitats
in environments

52
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,709
that generally require regular and active
interventions

53
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:48,459
to preserve these specificities or habitats.

54
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:54,340
So, we understand right away that these are
not

55
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,900
completely natural environments.

56
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,349
These are really environments where there
is already a human intervention

57
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:04,859
in order to preserve these species or habitats.

58
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:11,299
So, it's really different from protected areas
of categories I to III, where

59
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:17,560
the protected areas are mostly natural protected
areas.

60
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,950
The fifth category comprises of what is commonly
known as landscapes.

61
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,590
Yussuf tells us more.

62
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,260
Protected areas of category V are territories
where interactions between man and nature

63
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,250
produce
specific or even cultural characteristics

64
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,640
of their own.

65
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,420
The management of these territories is then
interested in the conservation

66
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,230
of these specific characteristics
but also incorporates the alterations made

67
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,300
by man.

68
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:58,600
So, here, we are far from categories I to
III

69
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:06,390
that are interested in the preservation of
the original character of the area.

70
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:18,630
Here, we are interested in the altered nature
in order to conserve its specific characteristics.

71
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,260
The biosphere reserve of the Senegal river
delta is an example

72
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,930
of a category V protected area that associates
traditional reserves surrounded

73
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:34,440
by village land and ensures their connectivity.

74
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:43,810
Finally, category VI is the one that has experienced
the strongest growth in recent years,

75
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,960
as seen on this graph that is now familiar
to you.

76
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,060
Here are categories VI currently.

77
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,310
Let's listen to Razingrim who tells us about
it.

78
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,410
It is used to protect
and preserve ecosystems and natural habitats

79
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,280
while promoting the development of the sustainable
management

80
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:12,500
of the natural resources found there.

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,340
In general, category VI protected areas are
large territories

82
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,800
the largest part of which preserves or presents
a natural condition

83
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,580
but another part of which is subject to the
moderate and rational use

84
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,180
of the natural resources found there.

85
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:37,910
Of course, the 
distinction is imperative

86
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,060
because we are not talking about industrial
natural resources

87
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:52,650
but the natural resources that the residents
may use in a sustainable way.

88
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,470
And many of the category VI protected areas
that have been created recently are of this

89
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,210
type.

90
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:08,680
Finally, I can say that I for instance am
from Burkina Faso

91
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,780
and in my country, we have the Nazinga ranch
which is a category VI protected area

92
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,020
where we preserve, we protect nature
but residents can go hunting or fishing

93
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,670
though in a controlled and monitored manner.

94
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:28,470
That's it.

95
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:34,480
Now, we know what these categories are and
why we use them.

96
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,560
Let's simply clarify a few essential characteristics
of these categories.

97
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,780
First of all, this system is international,
shared by all,

98
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,800
to allow us to communicate with each other
easily.

99
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,490
For example, a meeting of park managers interested
in sharing their experiences should if possible

100
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,830
gather
managers of protected areas of the same category

101
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,310
to make more sense.

102
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,889
We should keep in mind that in no case does
the ranking in a category

103
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,170
reflect the efficiency of the management of
a territory.

104
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,850
So, if a park doesn't meet the objective it
was assigned,

105
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:14,400
It is no reason to change its category to
accommodate its manager in any way.

106
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,169
It's actually the opposite that should happen
and the manager should do everything possible

107
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:24,430
to bring his management in compliance with
the objective of the park.

108
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,360
Finally, all categories are important.

109
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,440
Actually, a good network should include protected
areas of various categories

110
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,839
to make sure that the various management tools
available are being used.

111
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,130
Assigning a category to a park isn't complicated
if you follow these few rules.

112
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,300
Practice by examining the protected areas
that you know.

113
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,970
Look at their classification objective and
deduce what their category is.

114
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,040
Also, make a quick comparison with the reality
on the field

115
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,519
and ask yourself whether the park is actually
in compliance with its objectives.

116
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,250
It frequently is not the case.

117
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,839
Do this for 3 or 4 parks
and classification should become a second

118
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,460
nature for you.

119
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:18,399
So, a park can only belong to one category
since it only has one primary management objective.

120
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:25,800
Sometimes, it is difficult to determine precisely
what this objective is but you must always

121
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,740
do so
in order to know which category it belongs

122
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,820
to.

123
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,399
If a park comprises of various areas with
different management objectives

124
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:47,259
- as happens rather frequently -
in order to determine the category of the

125
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,589
whole -
if this whole is managed by the same entity

126
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,319
-
we will refer to the main objective of the

127
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:57,399
whole,
which is generally the one applying to the

128
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,559
largest surface.

129
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:04,769
We often speak of the 75-25 rule,
as the category is determined by the management

130
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:09,959
objective
applying to over 75% of the territory.

131
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,649
Now, if a park is divided into areas that
are managed differently,

132
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:20,720
with different objectives, by different entities,
each of them may be assigned a different category

133
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,269
as though they were actually two completely
different parks.

134
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:35,959
A 
good example of this type of situation is

135
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,009
a cross-border park
composed of two different parks on each side

136
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:44,950
of the border that may be managed differently
and be of two different categories or may

137
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:59,550
be of the same category,
if they share the same management objectives.

138
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,019
For example, the so-called W ecosystem between
Niger,

139
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:07,089
Burkina and Benin comprises of three parks
managed separately,

140
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:12,950
which means that each has its own category.

141
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,199
In the present case,
it so happens that all three of them are category

142
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,199
II.

143
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:19,209
That's it.

144
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:20,310
It's the end of this class.

145
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,029
The next episode will look at the Convention
on Biological Diversity,

146
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:27,740
which is of course a fundamental text for
the management of protected areas,

147
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,759
as you will see.

148
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,569
This text will be presented to us by Paul
Ouédraogo.

149
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:33,189
Have a great day!
