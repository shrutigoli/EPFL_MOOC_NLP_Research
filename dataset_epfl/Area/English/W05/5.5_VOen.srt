00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,860
Hello and welcome to this slightly different
class 

2
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,919
on the conservation of plant & animal species
inside protected areas.

3
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:28,581
For more information,
on IUCN's website you can read about the Red

4
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:31,710
List that we'll talk about.

5
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,710
You can also read this leaflet
that briefly explains what the red list is

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,949
and how it works.

7
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:43,399
Our colleague Jean-Christophe Vié from the
IUCN headquarters in Switzerland

8
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,449
will be with us today.

9
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:48,309
He's the assistant director of the IUCN Species
Program.

10
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:52,249
So, why are those plant and animal species
important to consider

11
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:57,079
in the management of protected areas?

12
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,039
All wildlife, whether plant or animal,
is what defines the wealth of the protected

13
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,039
area.

14
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,270
Each species has a specific role in the ecosystem.

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,420
It's the changes to the species inside the
protected area

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,909
that allow us to measure the performance of
the area's management.

17
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,189
So, it's an important parameter since protected
areas

18
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:23,070
are mostly created to preserve biodiversity
across the planet.

19
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,420
Hence, following the changes in multiple species,
that will become our witnesses over time,

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,100
will allow us to know if we've been correctly
managing the protected area.

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,600
There are some species though, that are more
important than others

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,640
in assessing certain aspects of the management
inside and around protected areas.

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,540
Inside each area, there are species more charismatic
than others,

24
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:55,039
that will draw tourists, that will become
symbols,

25
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:00,390
will provide a specific service,
such as disseminating certain plant species,

26
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,530
becoming a sort of gardener to the forest;
take for instance elephants, in many African

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,170
protected areas.

28
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,580
Those species are often seen as success indicators.

29
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:17,620
So, we won't be following every species present
in the protected area,

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,110
we're going to pick a few species in particular
to create good indicators, indicators that

31
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,610
we will follow,
and that will define the results of the management.

32
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,670
Some of those species are the ones that are
targeted by activities

33
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,209
such as poaching,
as it is the case right now in a lot of places,

34
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,430
in many African protected areas.

35
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,150
Not all species are targeted.

36
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,680
Don't forget that protected areas are also
a biodiversity reservoir

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,260
for the surrounding areas,
and will contribute to the food security of

38
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,110
the local inhabitants and communities.

39
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:58,239
Some species are particularly important,
but others can be a source of management constraints

40
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,659
that can take many forms.

41
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,980
Jean-Christophe explains this.

42
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,470
The role of protected areas is to guard a
region's biodiversity

43
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:13,030
but, of course, there are species that create
problems for the managers.

44
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,930
Some are caused by the nature of the species
itself.

45
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,370
An elephant needs a lot of land, carnivores
need preys,

46
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,300
this can cause problems with the neighboring
communities.

47
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,330
This creates an issue to manage.

48
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,480
On the other hand, issues can also come from
the attractive species

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,799
that allow the development of tourism activities,
that people come to see.

50
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,550
From the outside, as well, the following can
occur:

51
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,459
species can come from around the area and
become invasive,

52
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,659
settling in the heart of the parks
creating pretty serious damages to the integrity

53
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,970
of the protected area.

54
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,400
Various species can cause very different management
issues

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,370
and those are often very specific cases.

56
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,340
Among the species found in protected areas,
like this crowned crane,

57
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,400
how can we tell which are especially threatened
and what special measures should be taken

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,879
for its protection?

59
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,230
To identify the threatened species in a protected
area,

60
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,290
and then decide which protection measures
to take,

61
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,630
there is a tool,
that the IUCN has been working on for the

62
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,280
last 50 years,
it's the red list of threatened species.

63
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,940
For a lot of categories of species,
we know where are the threatened ones,

64
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,550
what is threatening them,
and we know what to do to help them.

65
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:47,639
Whole categories of species have been evaluated
such as all mammals, all birds, all amphibians.

66
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,160
In Africa, we work specifically
on the biodiversity of fresh water sources.

67
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,320
All the species of aquatic plants,
of dragonflies, of fish, of crustaceans, have

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,360
been evaluated.

69
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,490
With that data,
we know where the endangered species congregate,

70
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,660
where the threats are the strongest,
this allows us, for instance,

71
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,280
to say which zones are the most important
in protecting biodiversity.

72
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,410
This tool exists, it is available online,
you need to get familiar with it.

73
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,840
The basis is a set of criteria
that have been crafted over many decades

74
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,789
so they are very robust.

75
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:35,870
We have five criteria for animals,
to sort them in various categories of threat.

76
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:43,470
The worst scenario is extinction,
and the best is the category "least concern".

77
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,340
Unfortunately, for a large number of species,
we still don't have enough data,

78
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,530
they are in the category "insufficient data",
maybe they haven't been studied yet.

79
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,880
It's a huge task.

80
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,500
The type of species that people are most familiar
with

81
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,590
—in the animal kingdom—
have been assessed.

82
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,199
So we have information available for Africa.

83
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,720
We still have a lot of work to do on plants
and invertebrates.

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,250
Let's see in a few words,
how is the red list updated in practice?

85
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,830
The list is compiled by the UICN, by experts,
sometimes, by associate organisations.

86
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,040
This is how it works: we rely on experts,
we don't do research ourselves, we build on

87
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,150
the research
that has been done over decades, and sometimes

88
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,150
centuries.

89
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,319
And we plan expert meetings.

90
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,080
We've done quite a few of them in Africa already.

91
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,349
We get the best experts together for a given
group of species,

92
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:43,880
for instance fresh water fish.

93
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,310
We plan a meeting and, together, we review
every species from the region

94
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,039
and we sort them in the right category.

95
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,830
In practice, what are the possible uses of
the red list?

96
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,800
The red list has a lot of applications.

97
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,490
It helps create action plans,
which means that from the data we have on

98
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,639
groups of species,
we can determine,

99
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:19,699
and identify the threats, the priority habitats,
which will guide the management of protected

100
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:20,699
areas.

101
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:28,699
We can also use the red list as an indicator
of the state of biodiversity,

102
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,950
even for particular species.

103
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,660
We've just published a paper
on the state of ungulates around the world,

104
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,580
which showed
that the preservation of nature has a colossal

105
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,379
impact,
the situation would've been much worse if

106
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,990
nothing had been done,
if there hadn't been any conservation measures.

107
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,000
So, we've documented the conservation effort.

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,451
Also, on the global level, this allows us
by doing more complex analyses of the red

109
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,550
list data,
to identify the areas that are a priority

110
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,479
in terms of conservation.

111
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,940
The species where we have a unique biodiversity,
unique species, only found in one area.

112
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,789
So this guides our strategy in creating new
protected areas.

113
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:12,520
We help identifying zones, for example,
where there are species, endangered or not,

114
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,379
that do not have any form of protection.

115
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:20,830
It's important to get acquainted with the
red list,

116
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,759
that you check the website at the address
shown here,

117
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,449
for a few species that you already know
or for an entire set of species.

118
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:35,060
It's an essential tool to prioritize
the conservation activities in protected areas

119
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,950
as we've seen in Module 2 when we talked about
gap analysis.

120
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,670
This is the end of the lesson.

121
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,950
The next episode will focus on tourism in
protected areas.

122
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,630
Have a nice day.
