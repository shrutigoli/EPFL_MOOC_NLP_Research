Hello and welcome to this fifth MOOC module
on the management of protected areas in Africa.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,300
This week we will look at some specific aspects
of the management of protected areas.

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:29,449
This module is structured as follows:
The first class will be about culture

4
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:34,030
and how it can, not only
be part of the values of a protected area

5
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,440
but also how it can enhance conservation.

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,830
The second class will focus on the training
of staff

7
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,830
and partners of protected areas.

8
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,860
You can imagine that this is a vital point
for us.

9
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,580
In the third class, we will dive into marine
protected areas.

10
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,320
The fourth class will be about the conservation
of species

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,600
of fauna and flora through protected areas
with a particular focus on the red list.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,710
The fifth class will focus on an important
tool for promoting

13
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:16,210
and valuing protected areas: tourism.

14
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:22,570
The last focus for the week,
and this has become a habit, will be about

15
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,330
a convention, this time
about CITES.

16
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,540
This deals with the international trade
of endangered species.

17
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,909
And finally, we will have a brief recap
of the main points covered in this module

18
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,159
and then the homework.

19
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,990
Here we go!

20
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,090
Enjoy an excellent fifth week with us!
