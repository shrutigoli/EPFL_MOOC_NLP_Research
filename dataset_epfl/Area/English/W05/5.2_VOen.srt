1
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,960
- Hello Geoffroy.

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,120
- Hello Paul.

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,019
Hello everyone.

4
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:29,390
Today's lesson is dedicated to culture
or, more precisely, to the benefits of taking

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,210
culture in account
in approaches that relate to protected areas.

6
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,719
You can refer to the guidelines
of the World Commission on Protected Areas

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,329
for sacred sites, in addition to this lesson.

8
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,820
Of course, it's important to keep in mind
that the religious side you're talking about,

9
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,270
like all these sacred sites, that the guidelines
are refering to,

10
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,661
this religious dimension is just a part of
culture.

11
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:59,829
Culture is a bit complicated, it's a human
institution

12
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,739
based on customs, traditions and conventions.

13
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:09,560
On the contrary, nature has been for a long
time perceived as a solid reality

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,000
on which mankind didn't have any control,
or little.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,950
Obviously today, we see that the action of
man

16
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,010
is changing the world,
this is what we call anthropocene.

17
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,110
So culture, that seemed to derive from nature
is about to become

18
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,820
on the contrary, one of the elements that
determine its evolution.

19
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,060
Yes, now we do not perceive nature
in opposition to culture

20
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:42,640
but as two elements that are closely related.

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,130
For a few decades in Africa,
and as we saw in the class on governance,

22
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,060
decentralization policies encouraged
some local communities to dedicate themselves

23
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,369
to conservation
of the areas they control

24
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:59,840
by building on their cultural framework.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,460
Exactly, sometimes sacred territories
got the status of protected area,

26
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,400
which sort of legalized their role in conservation
that was initiated by the religious approach,

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,420
local sanctuaries thereby became respected
protected areas.

28
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:26,470
They have the double advantage of combining
cultural and natural

29
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,590
dimensions, that African communities refer
to a lot

30
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,230
even today.

31
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,590
When it happens,
the creation of such protected areas gives

32
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,370
the possiblity
to collect knowledge and traditional wisdom

33
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,780
that reinforce the viability of the conservation
network.

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:54,890
Indeed, the existence of terrestrial sites
usually relies on

35
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,870
the practice of initiation, which uses forest
areas

36
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,849
that have usually maintained a great diversity
of flora,

37
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,540
and occasionally fauna,
because of prescriptions, like prohibitions

38
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,600
and taboos
that are sometimes advocated, reinforcing

39
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,980
the interest for conservation.

40
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,180
Yes, absolutely.

41
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,080
Some swamps or river sites exist as well.

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,430
Their identification is sometimes harder
because marking the area is more difficult

43
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:35,010
or it is temporary and evolves with time.

44
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,940
The example of Bijagos in Guinea-Bisseau is
interesting

45
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,099
because lots of small islands are accessible
only at certain times, and only for certain

46
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,680
initiated people.

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,030
So this tendency to use culture
in order to preserve the environnement,

48
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,710
is global,
widely supported by international commitments,

49
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,379
like the Aichi targets for instance, that
you talked about earlier and

50
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,630
that we see here.

51
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,370
We listen to Paul Ndiaye talking about Agenda
21.

52
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,440
Agenda 21 mentions that indigenous populations
and communities

53
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,250
and other local authorities have a vital role
to play

54
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,910
in the management of environnement and developement
because of their knowledge of the area and

55
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:27,710
their traditional practices.

56
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,180
States should recognize their identity, their
culture

57
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,900
and their interests, providing every necessary
support.

58
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,789
Here we have another justification for taking
in account

59
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:44,169
cultural realities
in order to reinforce the conservation system,

60
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:49,669
especially in Africa.

61
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,059
The Convention on Biological Diversity also
recognizes

62
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:59,509
the importance of culture in conservation
and the necessity of promoting the traditional

63
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,530
knowledge
that supports it,

64
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,699
especially the article 8 (j) and the Nagoya
protocol.

65
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,419
Let's see how it works in the field.

66
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:16,680
A play is being performed
about the settling in of new users

67
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:27,969
that kill lamantins
which is forbidden by the rules

68
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:30,530
of the commnunity protected area.

69
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,759
It's very important because culture
is one of the pillars of marine protected

70
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,669
areas,
here we can organize cultural groups,

71
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:45,719
start an animation process
and encourage cultural updates by young people.

72
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,319
It's important to be careful.

73
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,690
Even if nature and culture are frequently
associated in Africa,

74
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,310
they have characterics
that make it sometimes difficult for their

75
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,469
effective integration
within a conservation approach.

76
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:08,169
Here's an example to understand the problem.

77
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:14,020
Here we see the map of Niokolo-Koba in Senegal,
it's a pretty homogeneous natural space,

78
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,240
surrounded by different cultures.

79
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,539
It can be pretty complicated to harmonize
the rules,

80
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:27,490
between, on one hand the north,
essentially mobile muslim shepherds ,

81
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,039
and on the other hand, in the south,
sedentary Bassari hunters gatherers, mostly

82
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,520
animists
who developped all sort of practices

83
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,460
to catch animals.

84
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:45,430
They all speak with the manager of the park
but the way he is going to approach them depends

85
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,800
on
their cultural differences

86
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,479
and the manager will have to take their cultural
identities

87
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,210
into account to manage his park.

88
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:04,940
Many areas that became protected
are the results of a reconversion of sacred

89
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,419
territories,
such as sacred wood, places for libation,

90
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:16,199
totemic elements, or various sanctuaries for
spirits:

91
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:23,120
for instance the national Park of Orango
in Bijagos islands of Guinea Bissau

92
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,129
or National Park of the Madeleine islands
not far from Dakar, Senegal, that we see on

93
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:30,689
this picture.

94
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:35,729
The cultural dimension becomes more significant
when it is the origin of the guarantee

95
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:40,649
of respect of integrity for the protected
area.

96
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:46,789
Then, it's not surprising that pilgrimages,
mystic rituals

97
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,680
and all kind of ceremonies take place there.

98
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,960
Apart from sacred sites,
obviously, for culture and nature to go together,

99
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,099
requires a good amount of communication
between different stakeholders.

100
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,029
Some studies actually show that
biological diversity often goes

101
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:09,919
with cultural diversity,
because different cultural frameworks

102
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,569
can help preserve different values.

103
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,860
Therefore, knowledge, customs, traditional
practices

104
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,189
can be the basis of the persistence
of a protected area, and even of its resilience.

105
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:26,759
We think, for instance, about the use of fire
for maintaining savanna landscapes,

106
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,419
in particular in sites of category four or
five

107
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:35,130
where the influence of humans is major.

108
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:42,300
Protected areas, made from cultural values
present specific requirements.

109
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:50,160
They can belong to almost every IUCN category,
especially categories number two,

110
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,620
four, five,
or just to a small number of them, depending

111
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,600
of the diversity,
of the conditions of their creation.

112
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Most protected areas
that result from this process

113
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,820
have small territories,
sometimes only a few acres,

114
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,070
like the Madeleine islands.

115
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,899
Unless a decision from the State gives them
a more bigger

116
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:21,830
territory extension,
for example in the case of Orango, here on

117
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,390
this picture.

118
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,129
I agree with you.

119
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:31,060
But their is still a doubt about the sustainability
of these protected areas

120
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,079
because they are threatened by the erosion
of values

121
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,480
that were the reason for their creation.

122
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,519
They depend of the survival of practices
that are, themselves, sensitive to the decrease

123
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,180
of traditional values,
especially in the cities.

124
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,240
Plus, people who hold
knowledge and traditional power are almost

125
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,779
always old,
in small numbers and often poorly known

126
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,750
and less and less recognized.

127
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,889
This raises the problem of knowledge transmission
useful to preserve this kind of protected

128
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,250
areas.

129
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:14,410
So, using the strengths of local cultures
to stimulate the conservation of natural heritage

130
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,250
is a challenge
and at the same time, I want to say,

131
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,350
almost a duty,
because it's now admitted

132
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,990
that the values of protected area, which we
talked about a lot,

133
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:32,699
combine culture and nature
in an intangible whole

134
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,290
which is greater than the sum of its parts.

135
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:42,329
One of our goals must be to use every opportunity
to enlarge the network of conservation

136
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:46,800
and spaces traditionaly preserved
for cultural reasons

137
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,490
represent an interesting potential use of
territory.

138
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,640
Indeed.

139
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,310
Here we are.

140
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,790
Already at the end of the lesson.

141
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,680
The next episode will be on capacity building
for protected areas.

142
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,980
- Bye Geoffroy.

143
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,570
- See you soon
Have a great day.
