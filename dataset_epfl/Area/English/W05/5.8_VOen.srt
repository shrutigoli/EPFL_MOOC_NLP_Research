00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,800
In this module,
we have seen how important it is to consider

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,340
culture
when looking into the conservation of protected

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,340
areas.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,660
Sometimes, this can oppose conservation objectives,
but it is most often the case

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,849
that it is a quality that can help in the
protection of parks and reserves

6
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:23,330
when it is well understood and respected,
and enables the association of population

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,250
and local knowledge
to conservation efforts.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,259
By the way, Ssome protected areas, make it
one of the values to be conserved

9
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:35,040
for the same reasons as the flora or fauna,
and some parks are directly born out of sacred

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,390
territories for example.

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,150
Education is another aspect in the development
of protected areas.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,739
The management of these territories and their
partners need specific skills,

13
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,109
and these must be passed onto them
by programs which are adapted to the specificities

14
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,960
of Africa.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,879
This training is also a crucial factor
when addressing necessary changes for protected

16
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,610
areas,
in terms of management and governance.

17
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,680
There are already many training courses available,
but there is a tremendous need,

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,130
whether in the classroom or online,
and this MOOC, we hope, will meet this need

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,160
on a modest scale.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,740
The management of marine protected areas meets
the same requirements

21
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,180
as that of the protected areas in general.

22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,119
However, specialized knowledge, methods, and
equipment are necessary,

23
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,869
as they are natural environments with different
balances and issues.

24
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:38,729
The areas are fluid and open,
resources are less visible and often not well

25
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,009
known,
even if they are especially coveted,

26
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:50,049
as much for food safety of the local populations,
as for the economies that depend on fishing.

27
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:55,250
Marine protected areas must also be considered
as one of the tools in coastal management,

28
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,240
more generally.

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,460
We can also approach management of protected
areas

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,039
via the species that inhabit them.

31
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,630
These are often good indicators
of the stakes and the pressures of the area.

32
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:15,400
These are also significant resources,
no matter how they are used, consumed or not.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,440
They are unfortunately sometimes a source
of conflict

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,860
with neighboring populations,
and this requires the development of strategies

35
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,030
to control these nuisances.

36
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,720
A specific tool can help us to understand
and protect these species: the Red List

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,360
which defines their status and the urgency
of their conservation.

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,800
Tourism in protected areas can itself be linked
to these species in territories

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,280
which are still rich in emblematic animals
and flora.

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,070
It can be a source of revenue, for a good
number of sites,

41
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,550
providing advantages
both to the communities and to the protected

42
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,550
area itself.

43
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,900
It is also an important vehicle in raising
public awareness

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,650
of the importance of protecting these zones.

45
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,940
The manager's role is
partly one of support for tourism development,

46
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,800
in order to reduce the risks and the negative
impact, if there are any,

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,810
and partly a role of encouraging the development
of sustainable ecotourism,

48
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:24,000
producing, most often,
direct benefits for neighboring communities.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,650
And finally, relating to plant and animal
species,

50
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,520
a specific agreement concerns the trade in
endangered animals and plants

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,100
to fittingly prevent their disappearance.

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,890
It is the CITES, which prohibits, or at least
regulates,

53
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,900
trade in these resources according to its
three appendices.

54
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,490
It is here particularly, that the major question
of the ivory and the rhinoceros horn trades

55
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,290
are discussed.

56
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,030
Let's now start the tests relating to this
module.
