1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,420
This sequence will focus on marine protected
areas.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,800
We will look at the definition of a marine
protected area,

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,930
its key-features,
why marine protected areas are created, their

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,800
purpose,
and lastly, the main challenges in the management

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,050
and the creation of marine protected areas.

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,269
Let's look at the definition.

7
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:31,630
What is a marine protected area?

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,320
The first definitions were written
at the Fourth World Parks congress

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,280
in Caracas in 1992.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,670
In 1999, IUCN adopted the following definition:
"Any area of intertidal or subtidal terrain,

11
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,960
together with its overlying water and associated
flora and fauna,

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,980
historical and cultural features,
which has been reserved by law or other effective

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,710
means
to protect part or all of the enclosed environment."

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,620
This is the definition that is commonly adopted
and is found in most manuals and reference

15
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,750
guides.

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,100
Note however, that in 2008,
the IUCN congress adopted a new definition

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,030
of protected areas.

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,780
This definition, to my mind,
hightlights marine protected areas.

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,120
they are a clearly-defined geographical space,
recognized, dedicated, and managed

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,830
through legal or other effective means to
achieve

21
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,700
the long-term conservation of nature with
associated

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,570
ecosystem services and cultural values.

23
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,390
I want to emphasize three points:
First, it is a defined space,

24
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,890
so delimitation is required.

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,620
This is a challenge for marine protected areas.

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,290
Note the strong emphasis on conservation.

27
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,210
Conservation is the primary objective of the
protected area.

28
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:01,350
This implies a clear demarcation, in my opinion
between sites that have as their main objective

29
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,430
conservation,
and sites for which the primary purpose

30
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:14,890
may be sustainability or extraction of resources,
such as fishing.

31
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,890
Note also that this space must be managed.

32
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,810
This involves management actions of the protected
area.

33
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,840
There are now some 12,000 marine protected
areas.

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,360
Coverage of 2.8% is the official figure given
at the IMPAC Conference 3

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,440
in October 2013, held in Marseille.

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,150
I would emphasize
that recent studies suggest even higher figures.

37
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,930
The Protected Planet Report 2014 mentions
3.4%.

38
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,620
Please note that until recently, we were talking
of only 0.65% coverage

39
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,690
of the oceans and seas as marine protected
areas.

40
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:06,990
The number of MPAs therefore jumped
from about 200 in the 1970s to over 12,000

41
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,990
today.

42
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,990
We've done well.

43
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,330
However, please note:
1) We're still well below the Aichi target

44
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,470
of 10% by 2020
and 2) It remains to be seen that management

45
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,630
is effective
in all these protected areas.

46
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,070
Note also, on this map,
that their distribution is very uneven.

47
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,270
Some regions have high coverage,
such as Oceania, in particular.

48
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,281
Africa, on the other hand has less than 3%
coverage

49
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,540
in most countries.

50
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,850
There's a lot of work to to do, especially
in Africa.

51
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,800
Let's see the characteristics of an MPA.

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,410
First of all I would like to emphasize that
a marine protected area,

53
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,830
is firstly a protected area.

54
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,800
The IUCN guidelines state
that the same management principles apply,

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,040
the same modes of governance can be applied
to an MPA,

56
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,300
for instance, a Community MPA.

57
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,319
So, all you have studied so far
will apply to the marine protected area.

58
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,230
But let's have a look at some of its special
features.

59
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,380
First, it is a fluid environment,
which is open in three dimensions.

60
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,380
A marine protected area incorporates,
in general, multiple ecosystems

61
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,320
such as marine, terrestrial, and wetlands.

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,290
This makes things a little more complicated.

63
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,770
The value of a marine protected area is less
visible,

64
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,449
and is more difficult to quantify.

65
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,319
It is under water, hidden, and inaccessible.

66
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,089
The applicability of the principles of management
frameworks

67
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,680
is not always clear-cut,
and these are often difficult, if not impossible,

68
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,449
in the case of monitoring, for instance.

69
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,740
Also, note that the guides and manuals
were often written for terrestrial protected

70
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,380
areas
with few references to marine specifics.

71
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,539
It is particularly difficult to control inputs
and activities, to delineate areas

72
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,880
and the installation of demarcation buoys
in the marine environment

73
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,930
is a special challenge and often impossible.

74
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:08,669
The level of scientific knowledge
is considered less advanced than on terrestrial

75
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,770
ecosystems
as there's less education, less funding, and

76
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,029
consequently, less knowledge.

77
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,659
Let's see now why we would create an MPA.

78
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:21,939
You will have noted that the first reason
to create a marine protected area

79
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,849
is the conservation of its resources,
ecosystems, habitats, and species.

80
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:30,979
I know you're going to say
that a marine protected area is pretty, and

81
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,599
this is true,
beauty and wellness is important for communities

82
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:38,330
and for visitors
and should not be overlooked.

83
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,630
But let's look at all the other reasons
to create a marine protected area.

84
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,970
Among the many motivations alongside the goal
of conservation,

85
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,900
MPAs have an important role to play
in protecting marine and coastal biodiversity.

86
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,199
Known as "The blue planet",
more than 70% of the surface of earth is covered

87
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,050
by water
and is the host to remarkable marine and coastal

88
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,589
biodiversity
and an important gene pool.

89
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,360
I would also point out
that MPAs are one of the tools of coastal

90
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,430
management.

91
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,189
As part of an integrated policy on the management
of coastal areas,

92
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:18,249
MPAs play a fundamental role in managing and
minimizing the pressures

93
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:22,839
on the environment and resources
so as to mitigate and reduce the impact of

94
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,479
global change.

95
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,060
Look at this map:
over 60% of the population lives in coastal

96
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,099
areas.

97
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:34,250
This creates pressures,
both in terms of urban planning and in terms

98
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,509
of pollution and waste.

99
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,969
Here we have the global map of human impacts
on marine ecosystems.

100
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,969
You can see that certain areas of the globe
are particularly impacted.

101
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:48,090
Finally, here's a world map on climate risk.

102
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,090
Take a look at this map which highlights the
pressures

103
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,449
and the multiple effects of global change
and climate change.

104
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,740
So you will understand
that the coastal zone is subject to strong

105
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,199
pressures,
and it plays a vital part in fighting these.

106
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:08,409
I'll refer here to the role of mangroves
in mitigating the impacts of natural disasters,

107
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:11,389
such as tsunamis or cyclones.

108
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,889
In terms of motivation, I would stress the
importance

109
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,960
of marine and coastal natural resources
for the food and economic security of local

110
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,440
populations.

111
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,210
The MPAs, through their fishery resources,
also contribute

112
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,080
to the economic development of countries.

113
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,349
Note that many MPAs were created with that
goal in mind,

114
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,509
such as preserving the breeding grounds and
nurseries,

115
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,220
thus being one of tools of fishery management.

116
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,990
However, this graph makes it quite clear
that fish stocks decline sharply,

117
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,460
and that they are either fully exploited,
as seen in the yellow column,

118
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,129
or overexploited, as seen in the the orange
column,

119
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:53,349
and the brown band represents those for which
the stocks have collapsed.

120
00:07:53,349 --> 00:08:00,159
None of the commercially exploited species
are seeing their stocks grow at present.

121
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,110
Let's look now at the main challenges
in the creation and management of a marine

122
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,559
protected area.

123
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:15,059
Firstly, these aim to strengthen
the management capabilities of marine protected

124
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,059
areas.

125
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:20,219
Training, awareness, and exchanges on the
ground are important.

126
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:24,479
This is so as to better define the values
and the effects of an MPA.

127
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,009
I invite you, if you have time to read over
these references.

128
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,930
One of the challenges too
is to establish coherent and representative

129
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,760
networks of MPAs.

130
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,469
Here, the example of the network of marine
protected areas

131
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,240
in West Africa called RAMPAO.

132
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Note also the Mediterranean network, MedPAN,
applies.

133
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,960
These networks have a charter and governance,
and they implement capacity-building activities,

134
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,590
grants, exchanges and sharing.

135
00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:00,810
They have a strong role to play,
both representing MPAs with policies and with

136
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,440
international donors.

137
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,210
Finally, in terms of challenges,
one of the main challenges right now

138
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,700
is to create marine protected areas on the
high seas

139
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,430
in areas which are very little protected.

140
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,970
The other challenge of course is funding,
finding how to finance

141
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,420
the creation of marine protected areas and
their management.

142
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,270
That's it, this sequence is completed, and
there's a lot in it.

143
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,010
I invite you to read the background documents.

144
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,370
For more, go and visit a marine protected
area,

145
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,080
and go and talk to their managers to find
out more.

146
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,960
Good day.
