00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,960
Hello. 

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,150
In this sequence, we are going to study
the different aspects of tourism inside protected

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,650
areas.

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,850
Tourism can have a positive impact on protected
areas.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,400
It can provide funding for the protected area
and its communities,

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,990
help to raise awareness among visitors and
communities alike,

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,210
and maintain the landscapes.

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,960
It can also have a negative impact:
pollution, degradation,

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,690
it usually requires a lot of resources,
water, food, and space.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,840
It can also have a significant cultural and
social impact

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,730
with the population and with the communities.

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,540
Note that tourism differs a lot
across the protected areas.

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,540
In some countries, particularly in East Africa,
there are more than 100,000 visitors per year,

14
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:07,530
who want to see the wildlife, the megafauna,
present in these PAs.

15
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,960
Other protected areas only have a few.

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,250
Now, let's take a look at those differences.

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,110
For this sequence, I encourage you to refer
to three manuals and guides.

18
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:24,820
The first one is in French : Le tourisme dans
les aires protégées d'Afrique de l'Ouest.

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:31,020
I also invite you to read the analytical report
of the evaluation on Marine Protected Areas

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,010
by the FFEM,
and in particular the sixth section, on tourism

21
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,100
management in MPA.

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,590
Lastly, read the IUCN guidelines
Sustainable Tourism and Protected Areas,

23
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,490
It has stayed a reference guide and it is
in English.

24
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,100
The experiences accumulated in the different
protected areas,

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,420
as you will see it in your reference documents,
can lead us to distinguish different kinds

26
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,400
of tourism
in terms of their impact, the income

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,300
that these activities can provide,
on a local, national, or even international

28
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,030
level.

29
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,590
We can divide these touristic activities into
five groups.

30
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,450
On one hand, high-end tourism.

31
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,360
It is sought after to generate funds.

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,560
The drawbacks: generally not a very good impact
on the environment,

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,860
and most of the time, profits leaving the
country.

34
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,120
Medium to low-end tourism, can be a good source
of revenue

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,620
for the protected area,
most of it will be produced by concessions

36
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,709
entrance fees.

37
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,530
But it also has a lot of impact on the environment.

38
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,610
Sustainable and/or responsible tourism
can create a variety of jobs, easily accessible

39
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,970
for the communities.

40
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,670
There is little impact on the environment,
and profit that goes directly or indirectly

41
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,800
to the communities.

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,860
Be wary, this kind of tourism can be quite
volatile,

43
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,270
and you need a solid partnership to make it
work.

44
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,480
The community tourism is often the one preferred
by the communities.

45
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,950
Here again, direct jobs, although few in numbers
small impact, and direct and immediate profits

46
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,569
for the population.

47
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:19,940
Only, it's often on a very small scale,
and needs a lot of supervisory work.

48
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,770
Lastly, scientific tourism, present only scarcely,
in protected areas,

49
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,290
but which can prove very profitable.

50
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,709
It requires significant investments.

51
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,660
Let's look together at ecotourism,
or community tourism in protected areas,

52
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,739
with an excerpt of a video shot in Senegal,
in Casamance, and in the Bamboung park.

53
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,010
The modern tourist wants
to go to villages inside marine protected

54
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,520
areas.

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,819
Because when you go there, you can see everything.

56
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:02,640
They come here, to la Pointe Saint-Georges,
to see manatees, because it's quite rare,

57
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,360
nowadays.

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,720
The customers who come here are interested
in ecotourism,

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,350
in the environment, and in what we are doing.

60
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:29,669
Also, the campsite is on a island,
where it's calmer, more quiet and relaxing,

61
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,979
with an important diversity.

62
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:42,699
I think that's why our clientele
comes here in Bamboung instead of going to

63
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,680
expensive hotels.

64
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,110
The campsite was built
in order to secure the future of the MPA,

65
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,800
the Marine Protected Area of Bamboung.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,990
The main goal is to be able
to pay the ecoguards,

67
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:11,850
pay for the oil so that they can
patrol the protected area.

68
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,379
Then, it's also contributing to the local
economy.

69
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:24,729
Every month, there is a part of the profit
that goes to the marine protected area, and

70
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:29,099
to the rural community of Toubacouta.

71
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:34,439
One of the assets of the campsite
is that we put forward the discovery of the

72
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,050
area,
the visitors find themselves in the heart

73
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,379
of the mangrove,
so it's both beautiful, pleasing, but also

74
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:52,099
very enlightening
because they can be in contact

75
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:59,499
with the wildlife,
with the ecosystem of the mangrove.

76
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:05,860
Now, let's take a look at the role of the
Protected Area's manager

77
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,139
with regard to tourism.

78
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:12,740
First, he will have to promote
the development of sustainable tourism.

79
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,960
We are looking for community or ecological
tourism

80
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,360
to develop as an alternative or additional
activity

81
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,199
for the communities and local population.

82
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,300
The manager will also have a preventive and
accompanying role

83
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,979
for the touristic development.

84
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,629
The goal is to anticipate and reduce the risks
and impacts.

85
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:38,659
We will then conduct impact studies, a survey
to establish

86
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:43,119
if the protected area can sustain a large
enough number of people.

87
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:47,149
We will conduct a business plan in order to
anticipate risks,

88
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:50,069
and manage conflicts between the parties involved.

89
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:57,889
For example, between the fishermen and tourism,
we will study in particular, the social aspects.

90
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:06,219
Lastly, we will make informative content available,
for both the visitors and the population.

91
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:09,270
The other role of the manager is to keep some
of the income

92
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,190
from the tourism activities for the protected
area,

93
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,099
to fund part of its operations,
for example, the surveillance in some protected

94
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:18,729
areas.

95
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:23,149
All of this requires an active and attentive
role from the manager.

96
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:27,399
Now let's look at the benefits that the PA
can gain from this.

97
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,029
All the parties expect to get some profit
from tourism.

98
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:35,000
But the time scales to get these benefits
can vary.

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,949
Communities hope for quick earnings.

100
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,669
Private operators can't expect to obtain financial
equilibrium

101
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,649
before three to five years,
depending on the countries and the types of

102
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:47,150
hotel industry involved.

103
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,580
On an other hand, the autonomy of the protected
area,

104
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,529
thanks to the revenue of tourism,
cannot be achieved before many years, if it

105
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:58,879
ever comes,
even though substantial revenues can be earned

106
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,879
earlier.

107
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,179
The income from tourism falls into four categories:
The entrance fee to the protected areas, the

108
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:07,210
price of which can vary a lot.

109
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,469
It will be free in some areas
while it will cost 20 to 60 dollars in Tanzania,

110
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:16,039
or 9 to 20 dollars in South Africa, for example.

111
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,800
The license-fee on activities, in marine environment,
for example mooring sites, diving sites or

112
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,460
yachting.

113
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,339
License-fees on hotel concessions,
and other activities and sources of income

114
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:32,729
for the communities:
craft, local products, tourists guiding, etc.

115
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,881
Now let's insist on some key notions regarding
tourism in PAs.

116
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:40,610
Coming first, is the redistribution method
of the profits made.

117
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,800
It should be studied on a case by case basis.

118
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,650
The creation of a community fund is an interesting
solution.

119
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,580
It allows for the communities to claim a part
of the park's revenue

120
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,970
and to manage it directly.

121
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,050
In any case, it is important to evaluate
the potential benefits generated by tourism,

122
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,310
and to clarify in advance
the part going to the local population,

123
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:09,250
and the part going towards the operating of
the protected area.

124
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,860
We talked briefly about the manager's role
earlier.

125
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,540
We have to think about the role of the manager
in regards to tourism.

126
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,750
Sometimes, the protected area can be fully
involved

127
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,230
into managing and developing touristic activities.

128
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,870
Yet we can ask ourselves if the manager's
role

129
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,990
is really this one,
or if he should rather focus on making sure

130
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,140
that the touristic activities present in the
PA

131
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,180
do not impact it in any negative way,
like we saw earlier.

132
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,150
Note that tourism is also a business:
it is therefore recommended to establish partnerships

133
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,790
with tourism professionals
and to develop efficient tools with them:

134
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:53,050
a business plan, like we saw, is important,
so are load capacity studies,

135
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,640
and fair partnerships between the tour operator
and the park.

136
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:04,080
Lastly, good practices regarding tourism must
be developed at all levels.

137
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,400
In the relations with the communities, and
the choice of tourism sites,

138
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,230
in the adjustments needed
when construction or exploitation projects

139
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,430
are ongoing
where priority will be given to local materials,

140
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,310
workforce, etc.,
and in the field of touristic activities.

141
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,500
To develop a hotel industry that respects
the environment

142
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,010
is often a priority.

143
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,820
Take a look at some examples of labels like
Green Globe or others.

144
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:39,860
That's it, our sequence is over:
needless to say, tourism in protected area

145
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,930
also needs management.

146
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,330
It's not the jackpot,
even if income from tourism can bring substantial

147
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,700
revenues
and help to obtain financial stability for

148
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,400
the protected area.

149
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,260
I suggest that you read the reference manuals
for more information.

150
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,760
Have a nice day.
