00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,140
Hello and welcome to today's course
which is about protected areas staff training. 

2
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,130
For more information, you can check
the guidelines of the 17th volume

3
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,030
of the World Commission on Protected Areas
on the subject.

4
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,680
Also, take a look at this practical guide
developed by FIBA.

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,660
It is short, specific, and informative.

6
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,130
This is our colleague Elise Mazeyrac from
WCS in Gabon

7
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,930
who will be helping me today.

8
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,920
She heads the CEDAMM training center in Lopé
National Park

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,339
and trains many field practitioners.

10
00:00:53,339 --> 00:01:00,610
Elise, why is training for Protected Areas
so important?

11
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,220
Training is more than just learning,
it is a tool to respond to changes

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,910
and to respond accordingly in managing protected
areas,

13
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,640
so it is a strategic investment.

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,490
In Africa, the establishment of protected
areas

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,440
has unfortunately not always led
to needed policy changes or much-needed training,

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,190
and not often enough
to good training of people recruited to implement

17
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,520
these measures.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,760
Furthermore, we too often see continued education
as harm reduction,

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,730
whereas the lack of initial training
is the result of a lack of available courses

20
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,670
tailored to the management of Protected Areas
in Africa.

21
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,050
Training enables us to meet
both qualitative and quantitative staffing

22
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,480
requirements
for the management of Protected Areas and

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,000
their changing needs over time.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,170
For the individual, learning these skills
can strengthen personal motivation.

25
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,630
For a service provider, a Protected Area,
or an institution

26
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:02,970
in charge of the management of Protected Areas,
training enables to face issues of staff turnover

27
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,780
for some jobs or a lack of required skills.

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,870
Or it can motivate well-performing staff
by opening up new career opportunities for

29
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,180
them.

30
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:20,750
As the context of conservation evolves
so do the skills expected from managers.

31
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,970
We understand that we need to think and plan
ahead

32
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,770
if we want to align training with needs,
without forgetting the different categories

33
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,160
of Protected Areas.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,230
As we have seen in a previous module,
training is more than teaching.

35
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,960
Prior to conducting training there needs to
be the identification,

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,690
analysis, and understanding of the context
and needs,

37
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,120
and the development of training activities
according to a plan or a strategy

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,750
which will specifically address these needs.

39
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,750
It is only then that the completion of the
training itself can take place.

40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,640
Finally, of course, the training must be assessed.

41
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,240
Actually, here we find the steps
of the management-cycle of a Protected Area

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,700
as we encountered them in our lesson on planning.

43
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,990
So now let's see if Africa has any specific
needs

44
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,240
for the people involved
in terms of managing Protected Areas.

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,200
The needs of Protected Areas can differ wildly,
but have common aspects,

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,700
especially for countries in French-speaking
Africa

47
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,480
where there are some specificities related
to regional contexts.

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,180
Numerous studies have shown
that needs can be classified into two broad

49
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,180
categories.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,311
First, the specific needs
for the management of Protected Areas, for

51
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:42,190
instance ecological monitoring,
a knowledge of biodiversity, ecology, and

52
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,800
planning,
for management, anti-poaching, the rights

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,970
of Protected Areas,
of the environment, etc.

54
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,330
And then on the other hand,
there are the so-called cross skills that

55
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,540
are not specific
to the management of Protected Areas, but

56
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,430
which have a major impact on it.

57
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,830
For example, the management of human resources,
the planning and financial management, logistics,

58
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,200
mechanics, IT.

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,020
So in each of these categories, the tools
and the level of skills expected

60
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,720
will vary according to the position and context.

61
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,470
So, there many needs, which isn't really surprising.

62
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,650
But how can we respond effectively?

63
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,080
Training can be done in a room with a trainer,
but can include many other aspects depending

64
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,120
on the context
such as the objectives and expected skills,

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
or available means.

66
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,490
The first step is to plan training, by analyzing
the context,

67
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,490
the current situation, and the expected situation.

68
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,100
From there, it's possible to develop a training
program

69
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,910
which is as suitable as possible.

70
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,950
There are several methods for training.

71
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,699
There is obviously face-to-face training in
a room with a trainer

72
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,060
and a variety of teaching tools.

73
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,810
But there are also other ways such as distance
learning

74
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,280
be it with a tutor or in self-study like this
MOOC

75
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,080
you are currently taking.

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,350
There's also training at the workplace, apprenticeships
where the learner shares his or her time between

77
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,970
periods of theory and practice.

78
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,540
Some courses confer diplomas or certificates
whereas others only attest to training having

79
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,540
been followed.

80
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,020
They can be done on site, in the Protected
Area,

81
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,750
or in another place by relocating people.

82
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,970
They may be in a school, a university, a training
center,

83
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:26,770
and also in any place suited to the required
needs.

84
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,720
Let's see what types of courses are offered
to the managers of Protected Areas and their

85
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,260
partners, e.g. at CEDAMM.

86
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,770
In CEDAMM with PAPACO and at Senghor University,
we have developed a college degree

87
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,610
on the management of Protected Areas.

88
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,560
In two months, this course covers eight modules
of one-week each,

89
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,770
many required priority skills which are specific
to the planning,

90
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,610
monitoring, and evaluation of the management,
the rights of the environment.

91
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,770
It also includes techniques of inventory,
practices, and concepts of ecology, etc.

92
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,110
There are also short courses, ad hoc training
which last from several days to weeks,

93
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,580
e.g., training in GPS navigation to the use
of software such as SMART

94
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,370
for monitoring the application of the law
or the collection and analysis

95
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,870
of data on large mammals in the forest.

96
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,870
It also serves to collect socio-economic data
with tools like MARP, and BNS,

97
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,270
or the use of picture traps for ecological
monitoring.

98
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,270
We are always looking to develop flexible
training

99
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,570
which is reactive and based on tools and practical
skills

100
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,110
by involving more and more partners in conservation
but not only that,

101
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,870
also to meet the skill needs in Protected
Areas.

102
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,740
Finally, there is the difficult but essential
question:

103
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,820
How do we measure the impact of such training
in the field?

104
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,400
Measuring the impact of training on the field
is essential.

105
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,080
This will assess and develop our training
activities.

106
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,580
It is also a necessary step
to measure whether or not the training has

107
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,820
impacted the field,
changed practices, or improved the ability

108
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,020
to manage Protected Areas.

109
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,210
But it is often difficult to be sure that
improvements in practices

110
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,820
can be attributed to training.

111
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:06,130
And often the positive impacts are multifactorial:
the availability of resources, internal recognition

112
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,960
policy,
team motivation etc.

113
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,020
But thanks to recent studies, with former
graduates of our University Diploma,

114
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,100
for instance, we can see there is a change
in professional attitudes

115
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,949
and in improvement in knowledge, and its practical
implementation.

116
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:24,229
For example, the training in monitoring large
mammals:

117
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,639
more than half of those trained in this method
in 2012

118
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,259
conducted ecological monitoring in the year
following their training.

119
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,139
The courses also allow for personal development.

120
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,950
This is supported by a study
conducted with graduates from our DU in Central

121
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,080
Africa,
where 30% of graduates got a promotion

122
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,020
within the 18 months following their training.

123
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,139
In the same way, every graduate said they
feel more comfortable

124
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,750
in their professional activities,
and almost 3/4 have more responsibilities.

125
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,680
Finally, one of the effects of training which
is too often underestimated

126
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,540
is the fact that they lead to the networking
of practitioners.

127
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,360
This networking continues beyond the time
of training

128
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,639
and leads to the sharing of practices and
experiences.

129
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,930
It allows the creation and consolidation of
a network of practitioners.

130
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,610
Well, that's the end of the class.

131
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,660
The next episode will focus on the specific
management

132
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,060
of marine Protected Areas.

133
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,770
Have a great day!
