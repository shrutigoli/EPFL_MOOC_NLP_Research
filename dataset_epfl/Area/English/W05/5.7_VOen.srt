00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,369
Hello and welcome to today's lesson
which is about the Convention on International 

2
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,689
Trade
in endangered species of wild fauna and flora.

3
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,500
For more information, you can check out
the Convention's website, the address of which

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,099
is here:
For this course, I asked our WWF colleague,

5
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,760
Lamine Sebogo,
to help us this week.

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,350
He is based in Nairobi, Kenya.

7
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,590
He is specifically in charge of elephant conservation.

8
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,989
So, what is this agreement, and what is its
purpose?

9
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:51,500
This is CITES; CITES is The Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,170
of Wild Fauna and Flora.

11
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:04,430
We also call it the Washington Convention
because it was adopted in Washington in 1973.

12
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,130
This agreement is supposed to regulate international
trade

13
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:15,750
in species of wild fauna and flora
to ensure that trade does not lead to the

14
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:23,560
overexploitation of species
which may lead to their extinction.

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,679
But does the international trade
in endangered species or products derived

16
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:32,920
from them
really threaten the survival of these species?

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,399
This trade is a real threat to fauna and flora.

18
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,469
Let me make two points.

19
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:51,219
The first point is
that the trade is becoming increasingly important

20
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:58,340
because the demand for these products
is growing exponentially.

21
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,029
At some point,
nature itself may not be able

22
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:18,030
to supply the products that the market demands,
so that's a threat.

23
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,220
There will come a time when there will be
over-exploitation

24
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,220
which could compromise a species' survival.

25
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,970
The second remark is that CITES
specifically targets the trade in specimens

26
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:44,180
of certain endangered species threatened with
extinction.

27
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,060
Take the example elephants which are decimated
because of ivory,

28
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,710
and rhinos, because of their horns.

29
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:00,490
Even plant species such as rosewood from Madagascar
are affected.

30
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,710
There are many examples, but I will mention
only a few.

31
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:12,200
So when the trade
in these species is not regulated,

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,140
these species reach the threshold of extinction.

33
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,710
Let's see how the convention works in practice.

34
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,710
As we'll see, it's not so simple.

35
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:29,660
Under this agreement, species are grouped
into annexes.

36
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,900
There are a total of three annexes,
and species are combined according to their

37
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,370
degree of protection
which is their degree of threat.

38
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,650
You have for example, Annex 1,
which regroups really endangered species threatened

39
00:03:50,650 --> 00:04:01,960
with extinction,
and these are species for which trade is prohibited.

40
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:07,620
The export, re-export of any specimen of these
species is prohibited

41
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,100
except under certain conditions including
research.

42
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,810
Species that are regrouped under Appendix
1

43
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,560
include species of fauna and flora.

44
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,440
Regarding fauna, we must mention mammals,
reptiles, and birds.

45
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,919
The African Elephant, for instance, is listed
under Appendix 1,

46
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,150
as are the great apes, including gorillas
and chimpanzees.

47
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,949
All are in Appendix 1 of CITES.

48
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:54,979
So the trade and international trade of all
of these species is banned.

49
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,800
The second category covers the species listed
in Appendix 2.

50
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,469
Appendix 2 includes species
for which the international trade in specimens

51
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:11,949
is allowed but regulated.

52
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:19,629
The trade in specimens of these species
requires an export certificate

53
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:28,379
or re-export certificate
to be issued by the exporting countries.

54
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:34,939
All this is to ensure that there is no over-exploitation
of these species.

55
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:40,319
There is control and regulation
so that the resulting use of these species

56
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,259
is sustainable.

57
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:50,840
The Guinea baboon, the white-bellied bustard,
and among other birds, the Madagascar sparrow

58
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,030
hawk,
and even the Royal Cobra are among these.

59
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:04,729
There is also the wild cat found in sub-Saharan
Africa.

60
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:09,819
All these species are part of Appendix 2.

61
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:19,800
Appendix 3 contains the list of species
proposed by member states.

62
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,160
Proposing a species for inclusion in Appendix
3

63
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,300
assumes it’s overexploitated at a national
level,

64
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,550
and that steps have already been taken at
a national level

65
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,289
to protect the species,
and that the co-operation of other states

66
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:41,889
is required.

67
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:49,339
I will cite the Dorcas gazelle as an example
of a species nominated for inclusion in Appendix

68
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,770
3.

69
00:06:51,770 --> 00:07:00,029
The proposers were Tunisia and Algeria.

70
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:09,639
Regarding the species in Appendix 3,
the export document is the certificate of

71
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:19,229
origin
issued by the CITES bodies.

72
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:25,210
It must be said that both the export certificate
or re-export certificates

73
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,369
or other permits are issued by the country
of origin

74
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:34,770
under very strict conditions.

75
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,849
The elephant is a symbolic species for the
convention

76
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:43,180
as its possible trade for ivory causes many
problems.

77
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,580
What is the situation now?

78
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,249
The situation of the African elephant is as
follows:

79
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:53,310
the African elephant has a lot of problems.

80
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,879
The situation is not good!

81
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,199
The situation is not good,
and that is why all elephant populations in

82
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:11,130
Africa
were transferred to Appendix 1 of CITES.

83
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,330
Since 1989, if memory serves me correctly.

84
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,300
Meanwhile, there are other populations,
including elephant populations for four southern

85
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,789
African countries
which were transferred back to Appendix 2

86
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:26,050
of CITES.

87
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:36,599
The underlying reason for this reclassification
is that these populations are relatively well-managed.

88
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:43,700
There are four countries:
South Africa, Namibia,

89
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:50,000
Botswana, and Zimbabwe,
which benefited from a transfer to Appendix

90
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,830
2.

91
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:58,490
This allowed them
to legally trade their stocks,

92
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,560
twice, I think, under certain conditions.

93
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,250
Of course, this sparked much controversy.

94
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,760
There are people who think
that legal trade cannot coexist with illegal

95
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:22,130
trade,
believing that it is the legal trade which

96
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,120
itself contributes
to the exacerbation

97
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,890
of the illegal trade in ivory,
and therefore, increases poaching,

98
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:41,410
whereas others think that no, regulated legal
trade,

99
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:50,120
where it occurs,
does not lead to increased poaching.

100
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,690
Poaching however is not the only pressure
at work.

101
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,260
The loss and degradation of remaining habitats
and their fragmentation

102
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,140
poses a problem for the elephant's survival.

103
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,690
The elephants in West Africa are suffering
most

104
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,750
from the destruction and fragmentation of
their habitat.

105
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:15,200
There are also conflicts between them and
populations.

106
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,260
Many people have problems because they lose
their crops

107
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,170
and infrastructure is often destroyed.

108
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:31,700
But there are what we call indirect threats
which cause direct threats and demographic

109
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,250
pressure.

110
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,760
There are more and more people and more and
more mouths to feed,

111
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:47,240
and people need a lot of space
for human settlement and for their activities.

112
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:55,740
Added to this are major infrastructures
which are sometimes implemented

113
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,020
without their impact on conservation being
studied.

114
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,900
We now know the basics.

115
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:09,700
Please take the time to study the website
and browse CITES' Appendices to find out

116
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,510
what species you know or which live in your
Protected Areas

117
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,400
that are affected by this agreement.

118
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,850
This is the end of this lesson.

119
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,450
The next episode will focus
on concluding and setting your assignments

120
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,840
for next time.

121
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,820
Have a great day.
