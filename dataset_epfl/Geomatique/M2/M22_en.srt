00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:04,929
Hello.

2
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:10,065
This part of the Geodesy lesson
is devoted to units, 

3
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:15,114
units of measurement that we 
use in topography and geodesy.

4
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:20,931
The main units
used in land-surveying

5
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:26,638
and geodesy

6
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:33,347
are units of angle

7
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:38,749
and units of distance.  

8
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:47,025
These geometrical quantities
allow us to determine positions

9
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:53,760
in space. 

10
00:00:58,093 --> 00:00:59,254
Length:

11
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:02,894
throughout history, there have been
many definitions of length;

12
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:07,729
length has no absolute reference. 

13
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:20,340
It is defined relative  
to common objects, 

14
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,261
such as foot, thumb, 

15
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:34,092
etc. 

16
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:36,738
With respect to Earth, 

17
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:42,704
one could define the first 
definition of the meter.

18
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:44,840
It corresponds to

19
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,816
1/4 of the length of the meridian,

20
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,007
that is 10 millions

21
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:00,808
meters,

22
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:07,000
therefore 1/4 of this distance allowed 
us to define the meter. 

23
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:14,253
Then, one defined a more 
specific meter,

24
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:21,161
and more precise, using a
definition with respect to time. 

25
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:28,904
Time is defined
by periodic movement,

26
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:40,273
at the atomic level

27
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:47,492
which has a very high stability. 

28
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:53,541
This provides a definition of the meter,

29
00:02:55,361 --> 00:03:00,130
which has been used since 1983. 

30
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,879
The second dimension we are interested 
in are angles.

31
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,200
For angles, we have 
various units,

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,258
and the first that comes to mind, 
is the degree. 

33
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:16,905
We know that a full turn 
of a circle is 360º,

34
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:21,992
1º  is divided into 60 minutes

35
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:26,275
and 1 minutes is divided 
into 60 seconds.

36
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:31,009
This cutting system
is called a sexagesimal system.

37
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,089
These units are primarily
used in navigation,

38
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:47,818
and are found on
geographical maps.

39
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,255
We will stop for a moment 
to focus on the usage of degrees

40
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:59,458
relative to the dimensions of Earth. 

41
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:03,927
How did we first define a marine mile, 
or nautical mile?

42
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:07,315
I will let you reflect on that. 

43
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:13,950
The nautical mile is actually
the generated path

44
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,525
at the surface of Earth by an angle
measured at the center of 1 minute

45
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:27,506
So 1 minute corresponds to a path
at the surface of Earth,

46
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:32,271
which is 1 nautical mile.

47
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:39,764
To calculate this, we will take
this angle at the center,

48
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:42,336
so it's  1/60 º

49
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,668
that we can convert to radian,

50
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:50,452
that is, 1/60 times

51
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:55,066
π/180

52
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:58,169
so it gives us an angle in radians

53
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:04,002
of  π/10 800.

54
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:08,757
And I will multiply this now
by the radius of Earth,

55
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:13,145
which is equal to 6 400 km.

56
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:18,299
So, one mile is equal to 

57
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:23,619
(π times 6400)

58
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:27,839
over 10 800

59
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,979
which is equal to 1,85 km.

60
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:39,787
The second angular unit, 
that we will discuss is the radian. 

61
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:45,436
Radian is primarily used
in mathematics,

62
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:51,115
especially in trigonometry.

63
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:59,589
I recall here the definition of radian,

64
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:04,228
for this I draw a circle

65
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,627
whose radius is 1. 

66
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:13,926
1 radian

67
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:20,692
will generate an arc

68
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,738
with a unit length of 1. 

69
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:32,096
One rotation around the circle corresponds to 2 π,

70
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:37,568
and the conversion from 1 radian to degrees

71
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:41,249
is equal 

72
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:46,300
to 180º/π,

73
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,683
in this case 57º and 18 minutes.

74
00:06:55,383 --> 00:07:00,325
The third angular unit
that is certainly new to you,

75
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:01,713
is the gon. 

76
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:05,936
The gon is found in geodesy

77
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:10,191
and surveying. 

78
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:20,625
It can be defined by 
cutting of a meridian,

79
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:25,976
which I recall is 

80
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:31,197
about 40 000 km

81
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:33,850
into 400 parts.

82
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,072
So 1 gon,

83
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:45,144
is about 100km.

84
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:48,548
The gon is expressed
as following,

85
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,030
I give you here an example with

86
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:57,142
23 gon, 18 57.

87
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:06,674
The first 2 digits
here are the minutes,

88
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:12,874
the following 2 digits are the seconds. 

89
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:20,460
We are here in a centesimal system.

90
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:26,154
Conversions: 

91
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,724
conversions are useful
moving from one unit to another

92
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:34,240
First, we will look 
at the conversion 

93
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,068
of degrees, minutes, seconds
and centesimal degrees. 

94
00:08:38,598 --> 00:08:40,836
I use here an example expressed

95
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:48,964
in degrees, minutes, seconds, 

96
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:52,909
for example 36º

97
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,754
4 minutes and 57 seconds, 

98
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:00,699
I can calculate the following conversion,

99
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:06,664
with 36º + 4 minutes/60

100
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:10,170
+ 57 seconds

101
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,706
over 3600

102
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:15,264
which is equal to

103
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:21,892
36,0825º.

104
00:09:23,322 --> 00:09:26,671
For angles expressed in gons,
we have already seen that

105
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:28,296
if I have an angle, for example,

106
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:34,261
of 27,4372. 

107
00:09:34,461 --> 00:09:40,565
I would direct the minutes here, 
and then the seconds, 

108
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:44,559
since we are in a centesimal system. 

109
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:51,705
An important thing in surveying, 
is to find the relationship between 

110
00:09:51,705 --> 00:09:55,771
and angular value
and the arc it can intercept

111
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:57,720
at a certain distance. 

112
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,734
Here is an example
of a milligon, 

113
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:04,624
so one thousandth of a gon, 

114
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:11,457
so a small angle here of 0,001 gon, 

115
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:15,441
and a distance, here, 

116
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:19,475
of 100 meters. 

117
00:10:22,715 --> 00:10:24,856
I will intercept with an arc

118
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:29,997
of 1,6 mm. 

119
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,639
It is important to know
this relation

120
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:38,475
between a small measured angle
and an intercepting arc.

121
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:42,182
It is important
in the use of theodolites,

122
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,151
so topometric instruments. 

123
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:47,781
Other conversions
that are of interest, 

124
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:52,219
is the conversion from degrees to radians, 
and degrees to gon.

125
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:56,244
Here is a small example
to illustrate these conversions, 

126
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:59,392
with an angle of 30º

127
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,700
that we want to express in radians, 

128
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,395
it will be (30º times π)

129
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:12,710
over 180º,

130
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,114
which will give us a value 

131
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:19,748
of 0,524 radians.

132
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:26,804
If I take my 30º and I want 
to convert it into gon

133
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:29,317
I simply connect

134
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:36,220
30º times 10/9,

135
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,783
which is equal to 33,333 gon.
