00:00:03,861 --> 00:00:09,191
Hello. This part of the lesson 
of Geodesy is dedicated

2
00:00:09,196 --> 00:00:12,316
to geodetic references 
and coordinate systems

3
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:13,646
for the Earth. 

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,829
We can pose the problems 
as follows: 

5
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:21,219
A coordinate system
is a theoretical definition, 

6
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:26,949
it is composed of an origin, 
and axes with direction in space. 

7
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:32,217
If we look at Earth
we can naturally say

8
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:39,547
that the axis of rotation of Earth already
provides a referential direction

9
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:45,547
and equator also provides
a reference plane

10
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:48,767
for a coordinate system. 

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,110
The question is:
how do we achieve a system 

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,800
knowing that Earth is so large
and knowing that the surface

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,210
thereof, the different tectonic 
plates move.

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,180
The first part of the solution
is to find a geometrical shape,

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,030
which best fits Earth. 

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,080
In this case, we will choose
here an ellipse

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,130
that we rotate 
on the main axis, 

18
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:26,040
thus we have an ellipsoid of revolution,
which will give the mathematical form 

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,330
that represents Earth. 

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,520
This ellipsoid have a large axis <i>a</i>
and a small axis <i>b</i>,

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,080
and for Earth, 
<i>a</i> is equal to 6377 kilometers.

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,980
and <i>b</i> is equal to 6355 kilometers, 

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,780
a difference 
of about 22 kilometers, 

24
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,050
so, it's therefore relatively small
compared to the total size of Earth. 

25
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:05,859
What coordinates for the ellipsoid? 

26
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:10,539
Like the sphere, we consider
the geographical coordinates

27
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:19,019
with the latitude, which is the 
angle between the plane of the equator...

28
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:23,409
and the normal to the surface.

29
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:42,549
We see on this figure the normal here
on the surface, with my plane of the equator

30
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:44,573
and the latitude here.

31
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:50,063
For the longitude, 
like for the sphere,

32
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:56,663
it is the angle between the prime meridian,
here, and the meridian,

33
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:58,383
which passes through the point of interest. 

34
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:00,363
I have here my longitude. 

35
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:05,293
Finally, I have the height
on the ellipsoid...

36
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:16,921
that I find here on my figure, 
along the normal of the surface. 

37
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:19,731
A coordinate system
is a theoretical definition.

38
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:23,591
To use it, 
we have to complete the system

39
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:29,051
through a framework of coordinates
and I have here an example

40
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:38,061
of the measurement framework in Switzerland
with one materialization

41
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:41,681
of different points of the frame. 

42
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:49,245
So I have here an example 
with a pin, 

43
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:54,355
we also find terminals
and for each point, 

44
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:59,535
we have an identifier and the coordinates. 

45
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:06,588
I invite you now to try to find
the coordinate frame of the measurement

46
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:10,398
and explore some points
with your documentation. 

47
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:13,918
The second issue
with geodetic references

48
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:16,188
concern the vertical dimension.

49
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:19,768
In fact, the gravity field
affect many 

50
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:23,638
human activities, for example
in hydraulic constructions. 

51
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:27,808
What references do we
use for altimetry.

52
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,660
I take in this example here, 
three cases of figures: 

53
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,840
a simple object, a building, 
and I draw, here, the vector g

54
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,660
representing the gravitational force of the building.

55
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,870
So we have a reference here, simple, 
unique, for a specific object.

56
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,240
I will now move to 
a larger context

57
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,920
in a portion of a territory, 
where I may be next to a mountain

58
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,950
a vector here,<i>g1</i>,
and at the edge of a lake, here,

59
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,410
I have a vector here, gravity <i>g2</i>.

60
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:08,620
We can already here pose the question: 
is <i>g1</i> parallel to <i>g2</i>?

61
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:13,141
Do we have the same vertical reference 
in these two parts of the territory?

62
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:16,841
If we look at a global level, 
it is evident that if I am here

63
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:22,981
on the American continent
or even in this region here in Europe, 

64
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:30,441
the <i>g</i> here, <i>A</i>, and the <i>g</i> here, <i>E</i>,
is evidently not parallel. 

65
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:35,001
The solution to this issue, 
the vertical dimension pass through

66
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,511
a reference surface in physics 
is called the geoïd. 

67
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:44,441
We can imagine the geoid
like the ocean surface mean,

68
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,851
which is extended under the continents. 

69
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:50,641
We can draw the  geoïd here...

70
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:55,793
which is our surface, here, the reference. 

71
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,002
It is an equipotential 
gravity field

72
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:04,122
and it is our reference here, zero
for our altitudes.

73
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,390
Above the geoïd, I have my surface, 
here, topographic. 

74
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:19,945
And the altitude here, at a point <i>A</i> will be
on the vertical line here, of my geoid

75
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:24,525
with this height relative 
to the physical surface

76
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:26,875
that we call here the altitude. 

77
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:32,665
If I take a point  <i>B</i>  here, 
that I descend down here


78
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:39,895
to the reference surface, 
I have here, and altitude <i>HB</i>.

79
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:44,235
Knowing that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, 
the direction of the gravity field

80
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,755
is not necessarily parallel. 

81
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:50,993
As the Earth is not 
a uniform solid, 

82
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,463
there are masses with different densities, 

83
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:57,463
the reference surface, the geoïd, 
will vary in space. 

84
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:02,096
In this image, we see Earth,
with its correct form, 

85
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:08,146
namely this reference surface, 
with on the other hand, bumps, 

86
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:14,606
with here, for example, 
a little over 80 meters,

87
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:20,106
and then we have pits here, 
approximately 100 meters deep. 

88
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:27,746
We talk here about the geoid undulations, 
that should not be neglected, 

89
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:30,866
in our altimetric reference model.

90
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,106
The geoid is influenced
by the surrounding masses. 

91
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:37,116
We can see in the left image, 
a typical landscape

92
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:39,607
with a lake, mountains, 
and it is clear that  

93
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:42,927
the masses will influence 
the position of the geoïd. 

94
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:48,037
We see in this example here, 
at the first location, 1, with the lake

95
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:55,827
we have here a density of masses 
that is lower

96
00:07:55,827 --> 00:08:03,227
and, in this case, the geoïd
 would go down slightly.

97
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:08,457
In the second case, 
we are in the presence of a mountain

98
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:15,237
and here, we have one density, 
which is relatively strong, 

99
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:21,097
and on the contrary, the mass is placed
above the reference surface

100
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:29,887
so we will tend to attract the geoid
and the geoid in this case here move up. 

101
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,770
In the third case, here with 
a body of very high density

102
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:44,030
that is in the subsoil,
so that will increase here

103
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:50,100
the gravity field and the geoid
in this case will also be attracted

104
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,650
by this present mass. 

105
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,123
What is the relationship between the geoid, 
the physical surface, 

106
00:08:57,123 --> 00:09:00,063
and the surface of the mathematical reference, 
the ellipsoid? 

107
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:03,133
We mainly define
two geometric quantities. 

108
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:07,133
The first, that we call
the geoïd separation, 

109
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:11,133
which means the separation 
between the two surfaces.

110
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:20,429
In the example here, I have a dotted line
ellipsoid and a full line geoïd, 

111
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:23,339
so here I find my spot height.  

112
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:29,169
The second geometric element 
is the angle that creates the vertical

113
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:35,079
on the surface, do the geoïd, 
with the normal of the reference surface,

114
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:35,919
the ellipsoïd. 

115
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,069
We have here what we call
the deviation of the vertical, 

116
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:45,239
which is the angle between these two directions. 

117
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:56,801
The relationship between geoid and ellipsoid
is something that is documented 

118
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:58,911
in the different offices
of topography. 

119
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:06,011
We have this spot height which separate
geoïd and ellipsoïd

120
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:09,471
and finally, what interests us
for our topographical work

121
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:17,521
is the usual altitude, 
which is equal in this case 

122
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:22,291
the height in the ellipsoid
minus the spot height

123
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:27,681
<i>h</i> is the height of
the reference surface. 

124
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,959
In this way we may set up 
the geoid map,

125
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,209
whether it is on a global or local level.

126
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:49,529
We see here in this example
taken from the GOCE sattelite, 

127
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:53,599
so a mission by the 
European Space Agency,

128
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:56,049
which ended in 2013,

129
00:10:56,049 --> 00:11:03,339
we see here this example of a geoïd
world map.

130
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:13,813
We see especially the areas here, 
very low, apporximately 100 meters deep, 

131
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:18,803
and the higher areas, 
a little more than 80 meters.

132
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:25,934
The definition of the geoïd is one of the tasks 
of the national geographic institutes.

133
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:29,934
In Switzerland, it is Swisstopo
that has this responsibility.

134
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:41,757
They established a geoid map
based on the geodetic reference,

135
00:11:41,757 --> 00:11:45,757
in the case of the ellipsoid
Bassel for Switzerland. 

136
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:49,965
If we look on this map, 
we see for example

137
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:56,085
that the region here 
of Geneva have a geoid separation

138
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:58,875
of about two meters. 

139
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:04,975
And in the east of Switzerland, in
the region called "les Grisons",

140
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:10,075
I see that I have about
four meters of geoid separation.

141
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:13,905
So we see here a little bit of
the geoid amplitude, its variation 

142
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:16,185
throughout Switzerland. 

143
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:20,574
It exists in multiple 
geodetic references.

144
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:27,794
In general, we consider the distance 
between the reference surface, 

145
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:33,084
the ellipsoid, and the surface
level, the geoïd.

146
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:40,144
We search to minimize this gap
and whether we want a model

147
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:44,664
for all of Earth, 
we apply here a global ellipsoid, 


148
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:49,174
or as well a local ellipsoid if 
we are interested in 

149
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:51,064
one portion of the territory. 

150
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:55,064
Thus we have these two categories, 
the worldwide or gobal systems,

151
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:58,334
and the national or local systems. 

152
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:01,814
Here we have the example of the 
international system, ITRS, 

153
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:07,114
with an ellipsoid, GRS80, 
and then for the Swiss system, 

154
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:12,014
we have CH1903+ with
its ellipsoid of Bessel.

155
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:19,756
Attention, in this figure
the geometry is greatly exaggerated 

156
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:23,166
to illustrate this principle.

157
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:28,466
We have for example here, between the center
of the global ellipsoïd

158
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:34,896
and the center of the local ellipsoïd, 
only a few hundred meters. 

159
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,356
This is not at all the scale
shown here in this figure. 

160
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,156
To summarize this part on 
geodetic references,

161
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:48,206
we recall that planimetry and
altimetry are two different concepts. 

162
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:51,956
We define a mathematical
reference, the ellipsoid,

163
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:57,156
and we define a physical reference 
for altimetry, called the geoid. 

164
00:13:57,156 --> 00:14:03,026
Each country has its own
geodetic reference associated with a framework, 

165
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:08,446
namely a series of materialized points, 
and known coordinates. 

166
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:11,836
Then, when receiving 
a set of coordinated, 

167
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:15,836
we will always have to pose the question:
what is the geodetic reference

168
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:18,216
hiding behind?
