00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:09,736
Hello. This part of the lesson
of Geodesy is dedicated

2
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:12,086
to coordinate systems. 

3
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:17,505
We use coordinate systems
everyday. 

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,449
Here is one small example
of an ad for a public enquiry

5
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,449
where we find various 
information about the location. 

6
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:37,944
First, I find an address. 

7
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:46,951
Here, "chemin de Villard".

8
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,630
Then, I find a
parcel number.

9
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:08,274
And finally, I find 
the coordinates...

10
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:18,514
... a series of numbers here,
which gives me an indication

11
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:21,254
of the object's position on a map. 

12
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:25,315
We see with these three
concepts of location

13
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:28,065
things that we know, 
more specific things, 

14
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:31,215
such as a parcel number, 
and finally the figures 

15
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:34,495
that permits us to find 
a location in space. 

16
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:40,333
To find a location in space, 
there are several scales. 

17
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,333
If I am interested in finding 
this service station, 

18
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:49,493
I have many scales here: 
nominal, ordinal or cardinal.

19
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:55,103
So for this example, we can first
use the average, I would say,

20
00:01:55,103 --> 00:02:01,213
the most natural, ie a name
with the address here, 

21
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:08,833
that is "rue de l'industrie", 
number 12. 

22
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:14,293
One can also use order.

23
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:28,042
In this case, building number 12, 
is situated between number 10

24
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:32,632
and number 14. 

25
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:37,805
And finally, one can utilize 
a scale called cardinal...

26
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:45,222
... that make reference to 
a coordinate system.

27
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:53,745
In this example, I draw here
a small system

28
00:02:53,745 --> 00:03:04,045
and I can measure an offset here
towards east, and north, 

29
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:10,815
and I should have here the east and north
coordinates for my service station. 

30
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:16,296
In surveying and the systems
that interests us,

31
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:21,216
we have for most of the systems
a spatial reference

32
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,676
of nominal and cardinal scales. 

33
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,035
What is a coordinate system? 

34
00:03:28,412 --> 00:03:33,592
A coordinate system
it is primarily two axes,...

35
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:39,528
one origin,...

36
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:45,784
an orientation of these axes 

37
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:51,974
and a measurement scale along
these axes.

38
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:59,976
Our first example here, 
which is called a Cartesian system..

39
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:04,032
and that defines a plane. 

40
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:09,123
One can also define a coordinate
system along an axis. 

41
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:16,383
If I take here an example
with an axis of a road

42
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:28,953
I can also link to this axis, 
a scale, an origin... 

43
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:36,615
and thus I can find an object
or an event along this axis. 

44
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:42,675
If I take a little of the distance
and return to my earthly sphere,

45
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:49,525
I will define a spherical
coordinate system...

46
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:06,527
with the angular values relative to 
the reference planes. 

47
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:14,464
So I summarize here: I have here my spherical 
coordinate system, 

48
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:22,274
here my linear coordinate system,
and here my coordinate system

49
00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:23,724
on the plane.

50
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:29,979
A combined use of coordinate systems
is the road sector.

51
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:36,153
The interest in the road sector  
is that we have on one side

52
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:42,223
a representation on a plane 

53
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:46,463
and essentially, 
as the road is a linear object,

54
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:51,533
it can also be represented
in a one-dimensional space. 

55
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:57,211
We speak here of a tensile axis
type of representation,

56
00:05:57,211 --> 00:06:03,681
ie the geometry here on 
my path on the plane

57
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:09,641
I can draw it, represent it, 
along a rectilinear axis, 


58
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:13,641
namely that the measured length
on the plane will be found here

59
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,141
and this tensile axis,

60
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:20,779
which allow me to locate an event 
or an object on the map

61
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:24,009
and to represent it here on this axis. 

62
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,129
The advantage of this method is to
combine different types of information

63
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,129
and to analyze
specific locations. 

64
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:38,037
It is the object here in this example
with a layer of information

65
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:41,317
regarding the rate of accidents
and another layer

66
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,817
about the geometry of the road. 

67
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:50,776
And we see with this tensile axis
that the high rate of accidents here

68
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:55,676
is situated where there is
a change of slope on the road. 

69
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:57,802
The spherical coordinates. 

70
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,694
Before defining spherical
coordinates, 

71
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:05,194
we must characterize some
geometric quantities on Earth.

72
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:09,744
The first thing that comes 
to mind is the axis of rotation...

73
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:16,329
that cut the Earth 
at two characteristic points, 

74
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:21,779
the north pole and south pole. 

75
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,760
Then, the reference plane, 
which is common knowledge, 

76
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,950
is the equator,
and in the other direction

77
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,950
we have the meridians 

78
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:45,202
parallel to equator, 
we have planes called parallels. 

79
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:50,527
With these geometric elements
we can now define

80
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,247
a spherical coordinate system. 

81
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,159
The spherical coordinates. 

82
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,199
The first spherical coordinate, 
that interests us, is the latitude.

83
00:08:05,157 --> 00:08:12,367
Latitude is the angle
that is normal to the surface

84
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,367
with the plane of the equator. 

85
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:29,017
It is the angle between the normal
of the surface and the equator. 

86
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:39,504
The second spherical coordinate
is the longitude,...

87
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:46,659
which is the angle between 
the meridian planes, 

88
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:55,429
the prime meridian, 
passing through Greenwich,

89
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:59,429
and the meridian of a place considered.

90
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:03,807
So we have this angle here between 
these two meridian planes. 

91
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:09,667
In the figure, we see that, 
associated with these spherical coordinates, 

92
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:16,857
we also have a frame here
Cartesian, geocentric, 

93
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:21,897
with a z axis, which is the 
axis of rotation of Earth, 

94
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:27,007
a x axis passing through the plane 
of the prime meridian

95
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:32,877
and the equator, and a y axis,
which is perpendicular to the xy plane.

96
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,870
We will now look
at some questions

97
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,580
about the conversions of coordinates 
to proceed to the geocentric Cartesian space

98
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,580
the spherical coordinates, 
latitude, longitude.
