00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:04,937
Hello, 

2
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:07,497
welcome to this part of the exercise

3
00:00:07,497 --> 00:00:10,750
on calculating a displacement 
at the surface of Earth. 

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,145
We will consider our terrestrial sphere

5
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:16,463
with a tiny 
infinitesimal displacement

6
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:20,020
at a geographical coordinate 
on Earth.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,368
We recall here the terrestrial sphere, 

8
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:26,940
that I draw here with its equator, 

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,796
the prime meridian,

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,356
the rotational axis <i>z</i>, 

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,709
the axis that passes through the prime meridian <i>x</i>,

12
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:39,252
and then one point, in coordinates, 

13
00:00:39,312 --> 00:00:41,652
along a meridian, here, 

14
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:43,966
at a certain height <i>P</i>,

15
00:00:44,596 --> 00:00:48,915
I have here the latitude <i>φ</i>,

16
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:52,155
and the longitude <i>λ</i>.

17
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:55,314
What interests us in 
this exercise, 

18
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:57,641
is a tiny displacement, here, 

19
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:00,225
at the surface of Earth, at point <i>P</i>.

20
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:05,216
If we now decompose its coordinates
at the point <i>P</i>,

21
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:09,588
we see that the point <i>P</i>
is situated at a height, 

22
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:13,248
or latitude <i>φ</i>,

23
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,567
and that, at this height, 

24
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:19,773
we will consider 
the radius of the parallel,

25
00:01:19,773 --> 00:01:23,776
here <i>r</i>, which is the radian

26
00:01:25,396 --> 00:01:27,699
of the parallel at the latitude <i>φ</i>.

27
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,062
What interests us 
initially,  

28
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:34,908
is a small displacement, here, <i>dφ</i>,

29
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:39,429
at this point i>P</i> which will generate here

30
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,711
a displacement at the surface of Earth

31
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:44,390
<i>R.dφ</i>,

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,569
with <i>dφ</i> expressed in radians.

33
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:49,259
By analogue, we can consider

34
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,589
a small displacement in longitude, here <i>dλ</i>,

35
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:57,631
which will result 
in my parallel, here, 

36
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:04,416
a displacement <i>r.dλ</i> also
expressed in radians. 

37
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:07,943
Finally, what interests us
is the component <i>d2</i>,

38
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:10,165
that is to say, my <i>da</i> here, 

39
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:13,037
given that I will consider

40
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,293
this <i>da</i> as a tiny displacement,

41
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:21,566
and I can say that the triangle here
is a rectangular triangle, 

42
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:26,466
with my component <i>R.dφ</i> on one side, 

43
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:30,548
and then <i>r.dλ</i> on the other. 

44
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:35,705
Firstly, we need to calculate
the radius of the parallel, 

45
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:41,199
the <i>r</i>, radius of the parallel. 

46
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:47,273
We bring back here our latitude <i>φ</i>,

47
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:50,814
and this <i>r</i>, is nothing else than

48
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:54,957
the radius of the terrestrial sphere
times the cosinus <i>φ</i>.

49
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:57,348
If <i>φ</i> is zero,

50
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:01,186
so that at the equator, <i>r</i> obviously equals <i>R</i>

51
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:04,979
and if <i>φ</i> is equal to 90º, so at the poles, 

52
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,682
my <i>r</i> is equal to zero. 

53
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,095
I will now calculate

54
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:13,076
my displacement, here, <i>da</i>,

55
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,685
if I look at my triangle here, 

56
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:19,341
which I consider as a rectangle, 

57
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:25,112
the <i>da²</i> is nothing else than 

58
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:30,009
<i>(r.dλ)²</i>

59
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:35,736
plus <i>(R.dφ)²</i>

60
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:39,750
which is equal to <i>R²</i>

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,574
times <i>cos²φ.dλ²</i>

62
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:51,078
plus <i>R².dφ²</i>.

63
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:54,095
We can highlight <i>R²</i>

64
00:03:54,475 --> 00:04:00,675
that multiply <i>cos²φ.dλ²</i>

65
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:04,005
plus <i>dφ²</i>.

66
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,886
So for this value <i>da²</i>,

67
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,621
obviously, what interests 
us, is the root, 

68
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,207
 that is <i>da</i>.

69
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:13,690
I summarize here the approach, 

70
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,925
in plain text the formulas
which are returned

71
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,788
on this part of the screen.  

72
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:23,205
We take now 
a small numerical example, 

73
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:26,399
with a point <i>P</i>, located in Cameroon, 

74
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:29,922
at a latitude near
the equator, or 4º,

75
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,737
and a longitude of about 9º.

76
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:37,274
We consider the infinitesimal 
displacement for one second, 

77
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:43,222
that means <i>1/3600</i> degrees. 

78
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:47,893
We recall here the radius of Earth, 

79
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:52,575
which is <i>6400 Km</i>.

80
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,663
So the radius squared, 
expressed in meters, will be

81
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:05,322
<i>4,096.10¹³</i> m.

82
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:13,365
Our angular displacement, 
so <i>dφ</i> or <i>dλ</i>,

83
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,721
is equal to one second, 

84
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:22,261
so we saw that it was <i>1/3600</i>,

85
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:24,003
which equals

86
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:29,745
to <i>2,77.10⁻⁴</i> degrees, 

87
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:33,439
which we will express and convert to radians, 

88
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,384
which equals

89
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:40,479
to <i>4,85.10⁻⁶</i> radians. 

90
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:47,974
Taking our latitude, 
here at <i>4,03</i> degrees, 

91
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:52,934
I calculate the cosine of the latitude, 

92
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:57,963
namely <i>0,99753</i>.

93
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:02,370
And my <i>da²</i>, if I take the formula 
seen a while ago, 

94
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,715
equal to <i>R²</i> times

95
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:11,584
<i>cos²φ.dλ²</i>

96
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:14,543
plus <i>dφ²</i>.

97
00:06:16,553 --> 00:06:20,772
Therefore, this, by calculating,  

98
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:27,015
I get <i>4,689.10⁻¹¹</i>,

99
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:33,115
and this is equal to <i>1920,7</i>.

100
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:40,548
Taking the root, we get 
a <i>da</i> of <i>43,8</i> meters. 

101
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:47,545
We give here, clearly again, 
a resolution of this equation, 

102
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:51,134
with here rounding to 44 meters

103
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:53,087
for this numerical example.
