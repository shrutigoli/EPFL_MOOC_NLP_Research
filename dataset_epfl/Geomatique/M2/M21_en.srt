00:00:03,861 --> 00:00:05,048
Hello!

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:08,770
Welcome to this lesson of 
elements of Geomatics

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,323
which will be devoted to geodesy.

4
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:15,847
After a short introduction, 
we will cover different chapters

5
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:21,092
on first of all, the units we use 
in land-surveying and geodesy,

6
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:24,019
then the coordinate systems.

7
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:29,199
After, we will describe the geodetic 
references relative to Earth

8
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,101
and finally, projections

9
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,440
to use coordinates on a map,

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,229
as seen in this example 
with Switzerland

11
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:41,299
and its national coordinate system. 

12
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:43,361
Geodesy.

13
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:48,904
Geodesy is the science that studies 
the shape and geometry of Earth. 

14
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:54,054
We all have in mind
that our planet is a sphere, 

15
00:00:55,317 --> 00:01:00,699
with an axis of rotation, 

16
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:04,481
and a reference plane, 

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,345
which is the equator. 

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,019
The first approximation is 
that the shape is a sphere,

19
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:21,269
but we all know that 
Earth is oblate

20
00:01:25,724 --> 00:01:27,194
and therefore,

21
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,870
its true form is 
an ellipsoid of revolution.

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,672
If we look at Earth from afar, 
and we know its size,

23
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:51,022
we recall that the radius of Earth,

24
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:55,755
here, the radius is approximately

25
00:01:55,755 --> 00:02:01,302
6400 km,

26
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:07,510
and that changes in topography
between the highest mountains

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,840
and the lowest pits in the oceans

28
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:14,127
is more or less 10 km. 

29
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,070
If we apply this on a model, 
for example, here, my orange,

30
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:26,347
with a radius of 6 cm, 
it is already a beautiful orange

31
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:30,509
and well, these changes in topography

32
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:37,189
on this scale will be 
more or less 0.1 mm.

33
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:41,783
These ratios already give 
a good idea of the difficulty

34
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:44,444
of modelling a very large object,

35
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:47,958
when our interest lies in
the level of topography

36
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:51,029
with relatively small waves

37
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:53,809
compared to the overall size of Earth. 

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,166
What are the main challenges
of Geodesy?

39
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:03,818
First off, it is defined 
in a global coordinate system

40
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,368
across Earth.

41
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:08,831
I draw, here, three axes

42
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:14,098
of a cartesian coordinate system, geocentric. 

43
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:16,990
These are obviously imaginary lines

44
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,410
that needs to be concretizied,  
to realize the surface of Earth. 

45
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:25,474
In addition, it must be considered

46
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:30,003
that the different plates 
on the surface of Earth

47
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:31,784
move relative to each other,

48
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:35,383
therefore, there is a dynamic 
which should be taken into account

49
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,333
to complete
the coordinate system. 

50
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:42,613
These are the main issues
of interest in this lesson.
