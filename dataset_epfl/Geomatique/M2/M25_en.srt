00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:05,231
Hello, 

2
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:09,391
this part of the Geodesy lesson
is dedicated to projections. 

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,250
A projection consist of moving
a three-dimensional surface

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,047
to a flat surface: the map. 

5
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:20,810
The problem with projection, lies with 
the fact that there are deformations.

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,440
I transfer here a 
three-dimensional surface

7
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:27,626
to a flat surface in 2D. 

8
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,959
In fact, this will generate
deformations.

9
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:38,107
If I take in my coordinated lines, 

10
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:43,377
I will have on the 3D surface
a small difference, here, the latitude.

11
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:48,475
a small difference in the longitude, 
I have here a small surface element

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,050
and when I pass 
to the space on the map, 

13
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:58,352
my small surface element, 
here, is deformed. 

14
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:08,160
The maps and the planes
that we utilize

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,840
are planar representations
of a portion of the surface of the Earth. 

16
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:15,543
I draw here the terrestrial sphere

17
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:19,133
with a small difference of latitude,

18
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:22,104
an small difference of longitude, 

19
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:25,100
so I have here a Δψ,

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,989
here a Δλ.

21
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:32,617
And on my map, at this small surface,

22
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:37,577
I can have the element
correspondant on the plane. 

23
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:43,125
That is a ΔX here

24
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,445
and a ΔY here.

25
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:49,335
So I found my small surface

26
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:52,371
of the sphere or the ellipsoid

27
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:56,851
and its correspondence on the plane.  

28
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,388
The projection consist
of establishing the correspondenceses, 

29
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:06,408
meaning the formulas, 
in function of the latitude

30
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:12,408
and of the longitude for the two 
coordinate axes X and Y of the plane. 

31
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:17,388
Therefore, there are infinite
possibilities

32
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,338
of establishing 

33
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:24,547
We have seen that all projection
induce deformations.

34
00:02:25,142 --> 00:02:30,442
Here we take our small example 
with a surface element

35
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:35,429
on the sphere, 
with a difference here, of latitude,

36
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:39,619
a difference of longitude, 
I can trace, here, 

37
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:44,241
between a point P and a point Q

38
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,415
a small linear element

39
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:50,553
and I have compared coordinate
lines, an angle, here, θ.

40
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:54,343
I can also calculate
the surface of this element, 

41
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:57,645
That I will name here σ.

42
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:03,515
So I am here on the 3D surface, 
the sphere or the ellipsoid. 

43
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:08,768
I then project
this element on a plane. 

44
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:11,585
So I return to 

45
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:15,612
the coordinate lines, 

46
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,938
a point P', 
so the image of point P, 

47
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:23,328
a point Q', 
the image of point Q. 

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,706
I find 
my small linear element here:

49
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,812
an angle between the coordinate lines

50
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:30,832
that I call θ'.

51
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:36,578
And the surface here
of this small element is σ.

52
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:42,194
I have evidently here a ΔX
and a ΔY.

53
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:45,064
We have many types of projections. 

54
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:49,152
The first type, is the 
projections called compliant.

55
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:51,393
These are the types that
will keep the angles. 

56
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:52,696
In this case,

57
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:55,782
the projection here by my small angle θ

58
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:58,972
on θ' in the conserved plane. 

59
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:02,878
The projections called equivalents
will retain the area. 

60
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,850
In this case, 
the little surface, here σ,

61
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,140
is projected on σ'
and is conserved in this case. 

62
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:14,484
The distances, 
are always deformed. 

63
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:17,112
There is therefore one impossibility

64
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:20,571
to have a projection
that is linearly neutral. 

65
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:25,081
The principle is to project 
elements onto the reference surface

66
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,660
on a cylinder or cone surface. 

67
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:34,058
We find our terrestrial sphere here
with its equator, 

68
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:37,336
the prime meridian. 

69
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:42,726
We will define, for the purpose 
of the projection, an origin. 

70
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:47,367
Here, we have point M, which is the origin
of the projection system.

71
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:53,659
And passing through this origin, 
we have a parallel

72
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:58,109
contact. 

73
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:04,977
Then, the projection consist 
of projecting a point, 

74
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:09,957
for example here, the point P, 
on the surface of the cylinder, 

75
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,630
on the point P'.

76
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,584
There exists different types of projections

77
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:20,934
depending on where we place 
the projection surface. 

78
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:24,304
I have here my terrestrial surface 

79
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:27,504
I sketch here an axis of rotation.

80
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:33,734
I have a cylinder with 
a projection called normal. 

81
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:38,964
By placing the cylinder here, 
parallel to the axis of rotation. 

82
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:44,623
We also have a possibility 
by placing a cylinder transversly.

83
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:47,326
Here, in green. 

84
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:50,763
I have in this case
a projection called transverse. 

85
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:53,668
We can also 
place a oblique cylinder

86
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:56,428
and we have in this case 
a projection called oblique. 

87
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,313
To illustrate
the principle of the projection, 

88
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:04,246
I resume with my example here 
the cone applied on a sphere. 

89
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:08,647
We have defined the major
geometric elements of this figure. 

90
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:10,984
Now, we will 
develop a cone

91
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:13,633
and obtain here a plane figure

92
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:17,453
where we find the predefined 
elements. 

93
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:21,706
Namely, the parallel of the contact,

94
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:32,338
as well as the original point, here, M'

95
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:41,945
of my coordinate system. 

96
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:46,085
I have therefore now placed on M'

97
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:49,536
a cartesian coordinate system, 

98
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:52,196
I place here an horizontal axis, 

99
00:06:52,898 --> 00:06:56,033
the axe, here, which I name X, 

100
00:06:56,033 --> 00:07:01,033
which points towards geographic north, 
and my axe, here, Y. 

101
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:07,356
I will now turn
to the projection, here, of the point P',

102
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:13,167
this point P' is defined here 
in polar coordinates.

103
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:22,423
Namely, the coordinate r, 

104
00:07:23,587 --> 00:07:26,887
which is a function of the latitude, 

105
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:32,572
and ε that is 
a function of the longitude. 

106
00:07:33,895 --> 00:07:38,625
The projection consist now
to define functions

107
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:45,227
That will associate here r and ε.

108
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:48,985
Respectively, 
latitude and longitude. 

109
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:52,825
I have a function f
for the component X

110
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:57,155
and a function g 
for the component Y. 

111
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:02,566
Thus I have my function of the projection

112
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:06,568
defined here conceptually. 

113
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:10,871
Here is an example of 
a well known projection:

114
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:13,185
the projection called the Mercator. 

115
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:16,907
It is a projection mostly utilized 
in the field of navigation. 

116
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,085
It is a compliant projection. 

117
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:21,348
So, that preserves the angles.

118
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:26,518
And that is very practical because if 
we draw here a navigation route,

119
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:35,550
I have this that we call a rhumb line, 
namely that my route, here, will cut

120
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,369
the meridiens, always
at the same angle. 

121
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,829
We see in this image
that this projection

122
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:47,179
generates substantial deformations
at high latitudes.  

123
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:52,749
Switzerland, like most countries, 
has defined its geodetic reference

124
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:54,853
and a projection system. 

125
00:08:54,853 --> 00:08:57,687
This work was made
in the early twentieth century, 

126
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:00,627
with the definition 
of the projection system

127
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:05,186
based on a reference surface 
the Bessel ellipsoid. 

128
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:09,898
The Swiss projectopn
is a compliant projection, 

129
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:12,153
so, which preserves the angles, 

130
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:14,211
and it is a double projection

131
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:18,431
that will first project 
the Bessel ellipsoid

132
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:22,671
reference on a sphere and then, 

133
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:26,851
the sphere on a cylinder that is oblique. 

134
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:30,774
The origin of the system
is placed in Bern, here. 

135
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:34,473
And then, the cylinder is unrolled

136
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,713
to have a Cartesian grid
coordinate system.

137
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:43,751
In this figure, we see 
our Cartesian axis system. 

138
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:50,195
So we have here an axis X
that points towards north.

139
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,706
This was defined by convention. 

140
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:57,556
Then, we have the axis, here, Y, 

141
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,556
which points towards the east. 

142
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:04,302
The origin of the system is in Bern.

143
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:09,725
It is therefore the zero coordinates
in this Cartesian system. 

144
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,742
We see in this image 
that the parallels

145
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:17,303
and the meridians
is not evidently straight

146
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:21,103
on this projection,
and there is an effect of deformation. 

147
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:25,612
We translated the origin of the system

148
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:30,942
a way, to always have 
positive coordinates

149
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:35,471
and the Y coordinates
larger than the X. 

150
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:38,911
If I take this region of Lausanne, 

151
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:43,811
I have the coordinates on the axis,

152
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:48,761
here, Y about 550 km,

153
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:51,897
and on the X axis, towards north, 

154
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,226
about 150 km. 

155
00:10:56,226 --> 00:10:59,696
So I have always my Y
that is larger

156
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:06,724
than X, which is 150
and here, 550. 

157
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:12,669
What are the main 
deformations of the Swiss projection. 

158
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:17,135
First, we consider the 
deformation called linear.

159
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:19,469
I have here on this abacus

160
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:23,758
the values of these deformations, 
starting here by

161
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:26,568
the representation of the neutral axis. 

162
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:28,511
That means, 
it is the the axis where 

163
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:31,120
the distances are projected
in real size.

164
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,191
The more I move away from this axis,

165
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:35,570
the more significant is the deformation. 

166
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,550
It is express here in ppm,

167
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,663
namely in mm per km. 

168
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:45,773
I have here the scaling factor, 

169
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:48,038
in ppm. 

170
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:54,128
And I give you,
some values here, representatives.

171
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:58,784
25 km from the neutral axis, 
I have 8 ppm, 

172
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,049
namely 8 mm per km, 

173
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:05,529
at 50, I will have 31 ppm, 

174
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:09,983
and at 100 km, I have 123 ppm. 

175
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:16,470
Meaning that 
for a point situated here, at EPFL, 

176
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,301
so 50 km from Bern, 

177
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:24,938
if I measure a distance of 1 000 m, 

178
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:30,738
it will elongate 31 mm. 

179
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,245
So we have, finally,

180
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:38,955
a distance of 1 000,031 m. 

181
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:43,877
This, due to the deformation of distances.

182
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:46,923
At the origin of the Swiss projection, 

183
00:12:46,928 --> 00:12:48,708
meaning at Bern, 

184
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:53,294
the north on the map, 
and the geographic north are mixed. 

185
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:56,441
On the other hand, once 
I move away from this axis, 

186
00:12:56,441 --> 00:13:01,491
I have a difference between the north on the map
and the geographic north. 

187
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:05,020
We call this difference 
the convergence of the meridian.

188
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,360
And on this figure, 

189
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,769
we find the values
for this covergenece. 

190
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,087
Namely, for the region, here, of Geneva, 

191
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:15,704
a difference of about -1,1 degrees, 

192
00:13:15,704 --> 00:13:19,052
And for the east of Switzerland, 
the region of Grisons, 

193
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:22,625
we have here +2,3 degrees.

194
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,456
We must consider 
this convergenece of the meridian

195
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:30,396
when we do calculations 
between the relative bearing and azimuth.

196
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:33,011
In summary, 
projections are

197
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:36,564
a mathematical application 
of a three-dimensional surfaces,

198
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:39,754
sphere or ellipsoid, on a plane.

199
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:43,126
All projections
generate deformations. 

200
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,635
We distinguish the projections
names complaint, 

201
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:47,630
which will retain the angles, 

202
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,680
and the projections named equivalents, 
which will retain the area. 

203
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:56,187
Each country has defined, 
with their geodetic reference, 

204
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:59,107
a projection system,
to meet its needs,  

205
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:03,576
of the national measuring, 
or for the production of maps.
