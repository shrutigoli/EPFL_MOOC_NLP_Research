00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:06,062
Hello.

2
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:09,602
This part of the lesson is dedicated
to the survey by ray and distance.

3
00:00:09,602 --> 00:00:13,722
The survey by ray and distance is 
the operation that consists of determining

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,312
the coordinates of a terrain
object of interest

5
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:19,372
which can either be natural or constructed.

6
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:22,242
We'll see the procedure of the 
survey by ray and distance

7
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:28,492
with the placing of a theodolite,
its orientation and the measuring of parameters

8
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:33,722
such as directions, distances
in order to determine the coordinates

9
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,292
of points of interest.

10
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:38,012
Finally, we will see
the topometric calculations

11
00:00:38,012 --> 00:00:41,862
that allow the determination
of these coordinates.

12
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:45,232
You will first watch a movie
taken outside

13
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:48,322
that presents the principles of the survey by ray and distance.

14
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:52,133
Theodolite. Survey by ray and distance.

15
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:55,905
Theodolite surveying is
a topometric operation

16
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:58,785
that allows to determine the coordinates
of new points

17
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:01,705
which are used to make a terrain
map or model.

18
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,777
More specifically, the survey by ray 
and distance is the process

19
00:01:04,777 --> 00:01:08,497
that consists of measuring the directions
and the distances towards these new points

20
00:01:08,497 --> 00:01:10,217
from a station.

21
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:13,765
A tachometer and a theodolite
equipped with a device

22
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:15,225
of distance measurements.

23
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:17,695
It allows to aim at
each point

24
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:19,805
with a prism fixed on a rod.

25
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:24,614
After the station's centering,
tuning and orientation

26
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:26,854
the operator can start the aiming.

27
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,279
It requires good coordination
between the operators

28
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:36,279
by correctly describing and
numbering the surveyed objects.

29
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:39,749
It's also important to make
a sketch of the survey

30
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:43,749
so as to document the operations and the
objects lever without any ambiguity.

31
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:53,095
To pick up the important
terrain elements

32
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:56,765
the operator places the rod
on each point of interest.

33
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:03,662
As for the theodolite,
she centers then stalls the rod

34
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:06,902
so that the prism is
plumb with the ground point.

35
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:09,791
For this the rod is set
to a spheric leveling.

36
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:13,991
To guarantee a good aiming,
the operator orients the prism

37
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:15,591
in the station's direction.

38
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:21,651
The operator aims the prism and measures
the distance and the direction.

39
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:26,777
The values are automatically
saved in the apparatus.

40
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,699
So the survey by ray and distance proceeds rapidly.

41
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:41,822
The position can be transferred 
to a map with a mark

42
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:46,502
of national coordinates,
the North, the origine of the horizontal ring,

43
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:49,002
and a fixed point
of the station's orientation.

44
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:54,249
So we have a measurement for each point,
the distance and the direction.

45
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:02,483
From the recored polar measurements
and the orientation elements

46
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:05,773
of the station, one can proceed to calculate
the coordinates.

47
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:09,764
After this video, we'll recall the
principle of orientation here.

48
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:14,764
First of all we have the point P,
which is the station's point.

49
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:21,537
From this point P, we will aim at a point M
which is the orientation point.

50
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:25,558
Since we know the
coordinates of P and M

51
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:33,488
we can calculate  ΦPM,
which is the grid azimuth on this side

52
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:36,508
with regards to the map's north.

53
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,508
Next, we'll measure the direction rM.

54
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:49,541
And finally, we can calculate
the unknown orientation, <i>ω</i>.

55
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:03,542
Here we'll recall that the orientation
unknown is nothing other than

56
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:06,742
the grid azimuth of the zero of the horizontal ring.

57
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:11,252
We'll give the equation here for the calculation
of this unknown orientation.

58
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:17,804
Once the orientation is made,
we can proceed with the theodolite measurements

59
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:31,804
in polar coordinates,
namely the horizontal directions

60
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,804
as well as the distances.

61
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,780
On this example here, if we take
the point Q, the angle of the house,

62
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:49,670
we have a horizontal direction 
RQ here towards this point,

63
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:55,820
as well as the distance SPQ between
the station and the house's corner.

64
00:04:56,448 --> 00:05:02,698
The way our station is oriented
we can calculate the grid azimuth PQ.

65
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:17,596
This grid azimuth  φPQ is nothing
other than the direction rQ

66
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:19,936
and the unknown orientation.

67
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:27,000
Here on this figure
we find our  φPQ.

68
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:34,405
Next, we will proceed with calculating
the rectangular coordinates.

69
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:51,611
Namely the ΔY which is the same
as the horizontal distance SPQ

70
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:55,811
times the sine of the grid azimuth φPQ.

71
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:07,188
The ΔX is the same as the horizontal
distance times the cosine of φPQ.

72
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,600
Next, from these
ΔY et ΔX,

73
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,210
we can calculate the coordinates
of the point Q by summing up the coordinates

74
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,860
of the station of point P.

75
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:26,332
After having calculated these ΔY, ΔX,
we'll go from the point P,

76
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:31,492
whose coordinates we know,
sum up these ΔY, ΔX

77
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:36,002
and obtain the rectangular coordinates
of our point Q

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,940
in the national coordinate system.
