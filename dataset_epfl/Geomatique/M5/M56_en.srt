00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,110
Hello.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,871
We will go over the second
part of the exercise

3
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:10,511
after having seen the grid azimuth calculation,

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,801
we're interested in the station's 
orientation.

5
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:16,878
As can be seen on the right image,

6
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:20,668
a station, so a theodolite,
is positioned on a fixed point

7
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:24,878
and it's horizontal circle
is oriented arbitrarily, 

8
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:27,648
there's no reference
to a preferential direction.

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:31,838
We'll recall here what
the station's direction is,

10
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:35,128
which consists of determining
the orientation unknown

11
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:39,468
or omega (<i>ω</i>), that's to say the grid azimuth
which gives the direction

12
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:43,468
of the theodolite's zero
with respect to the map's North.

13
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:46,218
To determine this 
orientation unknown,

14
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:48,748
two fixed points are required.

15
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:53,138
Here on this example we have
the points S and M,

16
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:58,428
so we have our vector which allows
calculating a grid azimuth here,

17
00:00:58,428 --> 00:01:03,028
and then when I will come
with my theodolite,

18
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:08,348
I will place, here, my theodolite
on the station S.

19
00:01:08,744 --> 00:01:11,444
For example, like this one.

20
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:17,813
And then I have, here, a zero direction,

21
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:24,263
which is arbitrary,
which is my origin 0.00.

22
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:27,823
And what interests me here,
the orientation unknown,

23
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:32,973
well, it's the <i>ω</i>

24
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:35,543
with respect to the map's North.

25
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:38,873
From my zero zero, clearly,
I will take my readings.

26
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:42,873
For example, here, the r,
the horizontal direction,

27
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:44,373
towards the point M.

28
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:49,883
I will take the same figure here with 
these calculated and measured elements.

29
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:54,983
Initially, I can
calculate or, on my figure here,

30
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:58,983
measure my <i>ΦSM.</i>

31
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:02,983
I measure here, and it's 70 gon.

32
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:08,969
Coming with my theodolite,
I will place myself here arbitrarily

33
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,699
with my direction, here, of zero.

34
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:16,877
And here I'd have a value
for the direction rM,

35
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:21,425
so measured in the terrain
in this case,

36
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:26,585
which is 125 gon here.

37
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:31,548
The <i>ω</i>, if I measure it on my figure,

38
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:37,438
well, here I have 345 gon.

39
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:45,747
And via calculation, I know that <i>ω</i>, 
is equal to my  <i>ΦSM</i>

40
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:48,397
minus my direction rM,

41
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:55,687
in this case 70 minus 125,

42
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:59,687
which is equal to negative 55 gon.

43
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:02,987
And takes us to in-between zero and 400,

44
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:05,797
with  <i>ω</i> which is equal to

45
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:10,797
negative 55 plus 400,

46
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:14,547
which is equal to 345 gon.

47
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:20,533
Let's take a small numerical exmaple here
with the coordinates of a station S

48
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,753
and of a point M.

49
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:27,736
I can trace the vector here
which links these two points.

50
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:37,636
Likewise, I give the direction, here,
X, of the map's North.

51
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:44,851
And I know that I read a value here
of 53,485 gon,

52
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,701
which I can reconstruct on my canvas

53
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:52,661
by setting this value to 53 or 54 gon,

54
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:56,071
if I round up or down with my protractor.

55
00:03:56,071 --> 00:04:03,271
I find the direction of my circle here
when doing the field measurement

56
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:09,828
So I can now trace
this direction here from zero,

57
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:17,773
and I effectively have,
with respect to the map's North,

58
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:22,913
I have my  <i>ωS</i>
which I can draw here

59
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:29,603
and likewise I can read the value
with my protractor,

60
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:36,403
which is approximately 11 gon.

61
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,150
The  <i>ω</i>, if I also know

62
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:49,206
my  <i>Φ</i>, here, <i>SM,</i>

63
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,476
I can take the reading
or I can calculate it,

64
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:53,246
it's 65 gon.

65
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:56,076
So graphically, the <i>ω</i>

66
00:04:56,076 --> 00:05:00,076
it's my 65 minus the direction,

67
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:04,516
53,5 gon, which I rounded up,

68
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:08,516
and I obtain my 11,5 gon,

69
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:13,066
which verifies my reading well here
on this graphic.

70
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:19,541
We'll now move on to
the part of actual calculations

71
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:24,111
with a repetition of the calculation of

72
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:30,931
the grid azimuth of <i>ΦSM</i>.

73
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:37,894
Earlier I calculated a <i>ΔY</i>
which was 33,03,

74
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:44,214
a <i>ΔX</i>, which is equal to 20,49.

75
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:50,967
The <i>ΦSM</i> is the arc tangent

76
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:57,401
of 33,03 over 20,49,

77
00:05:57,401 --> 00:06:03,147
which is equal to 64,652 gon.

78
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:05,687
We are in the first quadrant,
so we can keep

79
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:07,877
this value as it is.

80
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:18,111
The <i>ωS</i> is my grid azimuth,
so 64,652

81
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,431
minus the reading 
of the horizontal direction

82
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:27,371
towards the orientation point,
so 53,485,

83
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:34,551
which is equal to 11,167 gon.

84
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:39,183
Comparing this to the graphical value,

85
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:45,403
we can say the check is ok

86
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:51,593
with respect to the graphical value.

87
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:56,605
This shows that it's important
to make a graphic,

88
00:06:56,605 --> 00:07:00,355
to have a estimated value
for the orientation unknown

89
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:03,195
in order to check the calculation.

90
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:06,998
In topography,
a measurement isn't enough.

91
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:08,958
One needs to be able to check it.

92
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,888
This is also valid
for the orientation.

93
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:13,818
A single point isn't enough.

94
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:16,268
We cannot detect a
measuring error.

95
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:20,268
We'll take a small example here
to show

96
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:23,658
that at least two points are required

97
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:25,858
to check the orientation.

98
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:29,835
So I have my X axis here,

99
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,205
my Y axis.

100
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:36,121
I take my station S again

101
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,897
with a point M

102
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:42,745
and a second orientation point N.

103
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:49,155
We can consider my vectors here,

104
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:55,575
towards the orientation points N and M.

105
00:07:55,575 --> 00:08:01,755
If I come with my theodolite,
I will place it here, at the station

106
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:09,475
clearly with a direction of 
zero, here, arbitrarily,

107
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:12,645
and i have, from this zero,

108
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,810
a direction value towards the point M

109
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,790
and a direction value 
towards the point N.

110
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:29,974
So I have two direction measurements

111
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:33,974
and I have two orientation points.

112
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:40,531
So I can determine a <i>ω1</i>,

113
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:44,931
starting with the measured direction
towards the point M,

114
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:50,911
a <i>ω2</i>  with the direction
towards the point M,

115
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:52,811
and so I have a check,

116
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,311
even if the two measurements
aren't coherent, 

117
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:58,251
in this moment the operation 
should be repeated

118
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:00,941
or possibly be applied
to a third point.

119
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:06,064
If there are several points
the average is taken

120
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:09,024
of the orientation unknowns.

121
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:13,024
As can be seen here
with a set of measurements

122
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:17,514
that are coherent because we can see
that the results are coherent,

123
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:22,384
so in this case, there are no errors

124
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:27,889
and we can take the average
of these determinations,

125
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,009
which is given here to
have the orientation unknown

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,600
of this station.
