00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:04,814
Hello.

2
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:08,064
Welcome to this part of the
solving of exercises.

3
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:12,964
Step by step we will take up again the
calculation of grid azimuth,

4
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:16,964
the station's orientation
and the survey by ray and distance.

5
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:18,676
Let's start with the grid azimuth.

6
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:20,786
We'll recall the definition of the grid azimuth,

7
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:24,786
which is the orientation of a direction
with respect to the North of the map.

8
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:28,509
We'll draw two points here,

9
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:33,549
a point S, a point M,

10
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:41,024
trace a vector here
between these two points,

11
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:49,532
the direction, here, of the map's North,

12
00:00:50,203 --> 00:00:58,333
and we recall that the grid azimuth
is measured from the map's North

13
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,066
to the considered direction.

14
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:09,726
Here, I have a grid azimuth <i>ΦSM</i>
which is equal to 65 gon.

15
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:12,585
If I consider another point,

16
00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:15,395
for example the point N here,

17
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:24,041
well, I have <i>ΦSN,</i>

18
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:32,144
from the North, here, <i>ΦSN</i>,

19
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:37,014
which is equal to 280 gon.

20
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:44,366
We'll take a numerical example here
to calculate the grid azimuth

21
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:47,476
starting with these two points S and M.

22
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:52,496
We'll take the canvas up again here
and we'll first graphically measure

23
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:54,286
this grid azimuth value.

24
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:58,417
So I take the station S here
and the point M,

25
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:04,439
I trace my vector here between these points,

26
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:11,276
and likewise I give here,
from the station S,

27
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:15,276
the direction X of the map's North.

28
00:02:15,797 --> 00:02:20,707
In this case, I take my 
protractor here in gons

29
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:28,963
and I can trace my grid azimuth <i>ΦSM</i>,

30
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:32,963
which is equal to 65 gon.

31
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:35,181
This is graphically.

32
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:38,581
I take the numerical example now,

33
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:41,981
so the calculation with equations
that are given here,

34
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:45,931
I will calculate the <i>ΔY</i> and <i>ΔX.</i> 

35
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:51,701
So I have my YM minus YS,

36
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:54,941
which, with the coordinates that are
here, is equal

37
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,571
to 33,03 meters.

38
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,580
Next, XM minus XS,

39
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,870
which is equal to 20,49 meters.

40
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:19,144
My grid azimuth,  <i>Φ</i>, is equal to
the arc tangent of <i>ΔY</i> over <i>ΔX,</i>

41
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:25,354
so 33,03 over 20,49,

42
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:33,154
which here is equal to 64,652 gon.

43
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:39,027
And in this case, I find myself
in the first quadrant,

44
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:46,692
I have a positive <i>ΔY</i>

45
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:53,325
and likewise a positive <i>ΔX</i>.

46
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:57,365
So I'm in the first quadrant.

47
00:03:57,478 --> 00:04:01,758
Likewise, I'll verify my orientation, here,

48
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:08,758
with the graphical values measured

49
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:11,568
which was equal to 65 gon,

50
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:15,568
which is perfectly coherent
with the result of my calculation.

51
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:19,034
Now we will consider
several points

52
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:20,394
distributed in space

53
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,844
to illustrate the problematic 
of quadrants.

54
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:25,054
Here, I have a certain number of points,

55
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:26,434
data and coordinates,

56
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:31,354
with the station S, a point P1,

57
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:37,964
a point P2, a point P3 and a point P4.

58
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:42,301
Now I will trace the vectors
that link my station

59
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:43,701
to these different points,

60
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,251
S towards P1.

61
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:50,144
S towards P2.

62
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:53,577
S towards P3.

63
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,359
and S towards P4.

64
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,860
Likewise, I trace the reference
direction,

65
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,140
namely the North or X axis of the map.

66
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:11,804
And now, I can note the different
grid azimuths here

67
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:17,994
that I have towards the point P1,

68
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:24,627
towards the point P2,

69
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:32,657
towards the point P3,

70
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:40,327
and finally, towards the point P4.

71
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:43,267
So I have my four grid azimuths
that I will now measure.

72
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:48,397
So I will measure <i>ΦSP1,</i>

73
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:52,626
<i>ΦSP2,</i>

74
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:57,183
<i>ΦSP3,</i>

75
00:05:57,722 --> 00:06:01,302
and <i>ΦSP4.</i>

76
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:04,027
I take my protractor. 

77
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:12,062
<i>ΦSP1</i>, I can read, is approximately 70 gon.

78
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:20,282
<i>ΦSP2</i>, I have approximately 130 gon.

79
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:29,633
<i>ΦSP3</i>, I have approximately 270 on.

80
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:37,292
And finally, <i>ΦSP4</i> gives me 330 gon.

81
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,698
So I graphically measured
the four quadrants,

82
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:46,698
knowing that we always have
values between zero and 400 gon.

83
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,808
We'll now move on to calculations.

84
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,378
I take my first point P1,

85
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:58,588
I will calculate my <i>ΦSP1</i>
with the <i>ΔY</i>

86
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:06,268
which is equal to 40 minus 20, according
to the coordinates that I have on the left here,

87
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:08,168
which makes 20  meters.

88
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:14,662
The <i>ΔX</i> which is equal to 30 minus 20,

89
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:16,792
which is equal to 10 meters.

90
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:28,652
My n <i>ΦSP1</i>, that's the arc tangent
of 20 over 10,

91
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:33,882
which is equal to 70,48 gon.

92
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:39,531
In this case here, I have my positive <i>ΔY</i>,

93
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:42,591
my <i>ΔX</i> also positive, 

94
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,741
I'm in the first quadrant,

95
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:50,001
as can be seen on this graphic. 

96
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:56,196
Similarly, I will now calculate 
the <i>ΦSP2</i>

97
00:07:56,196 --> 00:08:02,926
with a <i>ΔY</i>
which is equal to 40 minus 20,

98
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,996
which is equal to 20,

99
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:09,616
a <i>ΔX</i> which is equal to 10 minus 20,

100
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:12,396
which is equal to negative 10.

101
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:19,836
So my <i>Φ</i>, here, <i>SP2</i> is equal to

102
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:25,666
the arc tangent of minus 20 over 10,

103
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:31,576
namely negative 70,48 gon.

104
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:37,972
In this case ehre, I have a positive <i>ΔY</i>,

105
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:41,268
a negative <i>ΔX</i>,

106
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:46,116
I'm in the second quadrant,

107
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:51,476
I need to add 200 gon to the result
of the arc tangent.

108
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:58,106
So the <i>ΦSP2</i> is equal to

109
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:04,756
negative 70,48 plus my 200 gon,

110
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:11,056
which gives us 129,52 gon.

111
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,618
So I can verify this well
on my graphic

112
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:17,888
with the value, here, which is
in the second quadrant.

113
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:22,528
We could make a similar calculation
for the points P3 and P4

114
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,528
to have values comprised
between zero and 400 gon.

115
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:30,948
Here are the numerical results
that the calculations give you

116
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:35,688
with their resolutions
for the points P1 to P4.
