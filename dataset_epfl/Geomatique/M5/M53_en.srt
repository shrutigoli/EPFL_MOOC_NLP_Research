00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:05,171
Hello.

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:09,072
This part of the lesson on orientation 
and the survey by ray and distance

3
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:11,458
is dedicated to the theodolite.

4
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:16,127
The theodolite is a geometric instrument
that allows the measuring of angles.

5
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:18,055
The components of a theodolite.

6
00:00:19,324 --> 00:00:22,949
The theodolite is made of a telescope
with its vision axis

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,080
that allows to observe targets.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,850
There are reading rings : the vertical 
ring as well as the horizontal ring.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,465
We find levels, that allow to 
control the instrument's tuning.

10
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:45,947
The tuning is done with switches
here, that are connected to the base.

11
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:49,262
The following little video,
taken outside,

12
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:52,368
presents you the different
parts of a theodolite.

13
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,752
The theodolite - 
instrument presentation.

14
00:00:58,113 --> 00:01:00,296
This here is an ancient theodolite.

15
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:03,988
It's easier to visualize its
elements than for a more modern apparatus.

16
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:07,748
Here is the base that rests on a tripod.

17
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:11,038
The switches
of which there are three.

18
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:18,052
The horizontal ring
to measure the direction.

19
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:25,158
The alidade that pivots
around the main axis.

20
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,451
The vertical ring
to measure the vertical angles.

21
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:41,453
The telescope pivots around the tilting
axis to perform the referencing.

22
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:48,579
The screws for focus, reticle
and for sight.

23
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,624
Next, the leveling ring.

24
00:01:54,227 --> 00:02:01,409
The tuning - The tuning consists of rendering
the thedolite's main axis vertical.

25
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,410
For this, we will proceed
in two stages, first with

26
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,168
a rough tuning by means of
the spheric leveling

27
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:11,836
we'll bring the bubble here
in the center of these marks.

28
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:15,023
And we'll have a rough
tuning of the apparatus.

29
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:19,006
Next the fine tuning is done
by means of a leveling ring.

30
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:24,140
We'll also bring the bubble here
to the middle of the marks.

31
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,085
We'll first work on an axis
between these two screws

32
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:34,675
in order to make this axis horizontal.

33
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:40,761
Next, we'll work perpendicular
to the first axis here

34
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,438
which is now horizontal.

35
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:48,197
We'll work perpendicular
in order likewise get the bubble,

36
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:50,685
in this case, into the center of the marks.

37
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:55,351
So now the theodolite's base
is perfectly horizontal.

38
00:02:55,351 --> 00:03:01,302
We'll look at a video taken outside
that presents the principles of tuning.

39
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:06,422
Theodolite - 
Stationed on a fixed point.

40
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:10,226
To start the operation
place the tripod

41
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:14,018
above the point
he wishes to station.

42
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:18,983
For this, he adjusts the tripod legs
so that the apparatus has a good height.

43
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:26,064
By eye he modifies the position and
eventually the length of the legs

44
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:32,025
so that the base is as horizontal as
possible and the most vertical to the point.

45
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:48,282
Next he sets the base on the tripod.

46
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,122
At this stage, he proceeds centering
which will allow a precise installation

47
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,764
of the verticale set of the fixed point.

48
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:06,230
To do this, he uses a plummet
which he fixes to the base.

49
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:20,280
This rough centering occurs
by a slight displacement

50
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,157
of the tripod legs.

51
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:28,297
Once the plummet is near the point,
a final centering

52
00:04:28,297 --> 00:04:31,363
can be done by displacing
the base on the tripod's head.

53
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,531
One controls that the plummet
is well centered above the fixed point.

54
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:51,717
Here, it's a cadastral landmark.

55
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:53,746
It's a fixed point of the measurement.

56
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,041
The operator now proceeds to the tuning,

57
00:04:57,128 --> 00:05:01,120
an operation that consists of rendering
the instrument's main axis vertical.

58
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:03,988
With the help of switches,
the operator brings

59
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:07,808
the bubble of the base's spheric
leveling to the center of its mark.

60
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,951
This is the rough tuning.

61
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:22,255
Next the operator sets the theodolite on
the base before doing the fine tuning.

62
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:26,603
The fine tuning is made with
switches

63
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:29,437
either by means of a solitary leveling
ring on the thedolite

64
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:31,285
for ancient instruments,

65
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:33,900
or like here by means of
a numerical leveling

66
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,651
functioning with sensors
inside the theodolite.

67
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,472
The instrument is now
ready to use.

68
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:44,978
The instrument's height is
the vertical distance that separates

69
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,614
the secondary axis from the ground point.

70
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:52,893
The secondary axis, here, is characterized
by this little red point

71
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:56,877
which we also find materialized
on the apparatus by this point.

72
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:05,844
Effectively it's the vertical distance that 
separates my secondary axis from the ground,

73
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:09,054
namely my instrument height here.

74
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:14,041
A little video taken outside
presents you this principle.

75
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,345
Theodolite - Instrument height.

76
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:22,325
When placed at its station, the theodolite
must be placed at a height

77
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,112
comfortable for the operator.

78
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:27,097
The telescope must be a close
to eye level.

79
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,612
The theodolite's height is measured
with a tape measurer

80
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:36,153
or with a device specific
to the instrument.

81
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:39,059
It corresponds to the vertical space
between the point fixed on the ground

82
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,635
and the theodolite's secondary axis.

83
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:47,630
Here, for example, this height
is 1,638 m.

84
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:52,221
After having placed my apparatus,
I can measure angles.

85
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:57,950
I'll remind you that with the tuning
process we've defined a vertical here.

86
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:03,755
Perpendicular to it, we'll find
a horizontal that gives

87
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:07,152
a local benchmark
to measure height angles.

88
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:10,183
Likewise we'll recall that
for angle measurements

89
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:15,362
or for horizontal directions,
the origin is arbitrary.

90
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:21,675
As it happens,  here I'll measure
with regards to my origin, here 0,

91
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:25,282
an angle alpha
in the direction aimed for.

92
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:28,225
For the height angle,
or the vertical angle,

93
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:34,394
I can measure with regards to
the horizontal said height angle.

94
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:39,210
This scheme summarizes the different
angle measurements of the theodolite.

95
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:46,545
We have the following situation with
a point S here that is the station point.

96
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:50,870
And I aim at two points,

97
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:00,931
a point called Q here and a point P.

98
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:06,706
Between these two points,
I can determine the horizontal angle

99
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:15,863
via the direction difference
towards Q : rQ and rP.

100
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:21,950
α = rQ - rP.

101
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,794
For the height angles,
the apparatus, the theodolite will generally

102
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:34,814
measure with regards to the zenith,
an angle here, the zenith angle.

103
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,914
In this case to the point Q.

104
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:47,896
And the height angle βQ is 
complementary to 100 gon of my zenith angle.

105
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,804
On the following video taken
outside you will see

106
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:55,735
examples of angular
theodolite measurements.

107
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,745
Theodolite - Vertical angle measurements.

108
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:02,976
Here's the situation : a station
and two points A and B`

109
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,333
placed at different altitudes
and with reflectors.

110
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,645
The theodolite measures the zenith angles.

111
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:11,719
Their reading is made
on the vertical ring

112
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,407
so the origin is
vertically to the instrument.

113
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:18,648
The operator aims at the first point
with the instrument's telescope,

114
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:22,489
and then points at the prism center
with the reticle.

115
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:25,219
He records the measurement
and then turns the instruement

116
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:30,177
in the direction of the second point.

117
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:36,498
Again he points the prism
and records the measurement.

118
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:41,078
Now the operator has measure
the zenith angle ξSA,

119
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:45,308
the zenith angle  ξSB,

120
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:48,308
and the height angles 
whose origin is the horizontal

121
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:50,115
which are what interests us.

122
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:52,685
Now we still have to transform
these measured angles.

123
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:57,588
So, we have βSA = 100Gon - ξSA

124
00:09:57,588 --> 00:10:02,426
and  βSB = 100Gon - ξSB.
