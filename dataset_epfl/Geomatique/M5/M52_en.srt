00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:05,562
Hello.

2
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:12,372
This part of the lesson on survey by ray and 
distance and orientation is dedicated

3
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:16,272
to fundamental orientation problems.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,780
To illustrated this 
problematic a little

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,550
we can ask ourselves some questions.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,500
How to define a direction
in space?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,560
I'll take a little example here with
this map, with a road here,

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:36,960
near Wabern, and I have a river here
that flows through the area.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,780
I can express a relationship between
the river's orientation

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,880
and the road.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,190
In this case here, the two axes
are almost parallel,

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,550
I have a notion of
relative orientation here.

13
00:00:49,827 --> 00:00:53,647
Even so, if I desire to create a map
or a topographic survey,

14
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:57,647
I need to have
an absolut reference,

15
00:00:57,647 --> 00:01:02,527
namely a north, in this case
the map's north.

16
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:08,504
In this case, I'll be interested
in the direction that defines

17
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:11,644
for example my road here,
with the North

18
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:16,074
and I will talk about the grid azimuth here,
that's to say the direction

19
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:19,164
that defines the road with regards to the
map's north.

20
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:21,417
What are the different norths?

21
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:25,307
We have the map's north,
the geographical North,

22
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:27,107
and also the magnetic North.

23
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:29,707
Everyone has used a 
compass once,

24
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:33,707
it's also a method
to define orientation.

25
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,631
Summarized we describe the
magnetic North here.

26
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:41,881
Effectively, in surveying the compass
is barely used as an orientation method,

27
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:44,511
it's not precise enough
for our works.

28
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:47,668
We have a map here with magnetic
declinations,

29
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:52,288
namely the differences between
the directions of the geographical north

30
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:54,598
and the direction of the magnetic North.

31
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:58,138
We see the different lines here
that represent these values

32
00:01:58,138 --> 00:02:01,558
that can represent several
dozens of degrees.

33
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,590
We see a green line on Europe
that represents the zero,

34
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,530
that is to say the difference is zero
for the year of 2010 represented here.

35
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:16,579
For orientation questions
we have two possible references.

36
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:19,569
The map's north or
the geographical North.

37
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,699
Regarding the geographic North,
we can define the azimuth

38
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:26,699
as being the orientation of a direction
with regards to this North.

39
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,699
And on the map we'll talk about 
the grid azimuth here with regards

40
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,769
the map's north.

41
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,799
We'll recall the definition of
the Swiss projection here

42
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:39,799
with the convergence of the meridian
as being the difference

43
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,719
between the direction of these two norths. 

44
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:47,429
As an example we'll take Lausanne
with a convergence of the meridian

45
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:52,479
under 0.7 gon,
so here we effectively have

46
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,039
a grid azimuth that's bigger
than the azimuth.

47
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,119
We'll recall several values here.

48
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:04,019
If we find ourselves in the western region
of Switzerland, in Geneva,

49
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,509
the convergence will be
approximately minus 1 degree

50
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:11,269
and if we find ourselves all the way east,
in Grison,

51
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:15,269
it'll be approximately plus 2 degrees.

52
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:18,943
To be more concrete with
this notion of orientation

53
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:22,153
I'll take up my example
of a building survey.

54
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,980
I've modeled my building here
with its base print...

55
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:34,193
so I've drawn it here with the four
points of it's base.

56
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:39,743
To attach this to
a coordinate system,...

57
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:44,547
defined here by my little
red triangles.

58
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:51,259
So here I have a set
of fixed points

59
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:55,259
that will serve to define an orientation.

60
00:03:56,184 --> 00:04:01,864
If I take a first point P here,
whose coordinates I know,

61
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:07,134
and if I consider the vector towards
a point Q here,

62
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:19,954
with regards to my map's north
I have a grid azimuth here, big phi (i>Φ</i>),

63
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:23,854
between the point P and the point Q.

64
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:29,064
So here I've defined a spatial vector
that gives me an absolute orientation

65
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:31,274
with regards to the map's north.

66
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:42,481
Now I can associate this system with
let's say polar measurements,

67
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:53,584
namely the angles and distances
that allow to determine

68
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,354
the coordinates of the my
building's base

69
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:59,674
in the national coordinate system.

70
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:04,679
If the coordinates of some points
in space are known

71
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,569
the grid azimuth can be calculated.

72
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:10,419
The calculation of the grid azimuth will be done
by the coordinate differences

73
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,919
and the arc tangent function.

74
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:18,549
What should be known is that
angles in topometry are measured

75
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:21,259
between zero and 400 gon.

76
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:25,909
If I have the map's north here,
I have a first direction towards a point,

77
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,929
a second direction towards
another point.

78
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:33,207
For example here I have the center point,
which is the point P,

79
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,157
I have a point Q1 here,...

80
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:42,084
here a point Q2.

81
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:50,179
From the map's north
I have a first grid azimuth

82
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:55,919
towards this point Q1,
which I can call Φ1 here,

83
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:04,029
and a second grid azimuth here, Φ2,
between the map's north

84
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,269
and the point Q2.

85
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:13,849
Let's recall that the grid azimuth Φ
are comprised between zero and 400 gon.

86
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:20,246
We recall that the arc tangent function
will give us values

87
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:26,026
between minus 100 gon and plus 100 gon.

88
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:36,136
So if I consider my quadrants,
in topometry I will have values

89
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:41,372
here comprised between zero and 100 gon,

90
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:46,468
here between 100 and 200 gon,

91
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:50,941
here between 200 and 300 gon,

92
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:57,744
and finally, here between 300 and 400 gon.

93
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:06,209
So we need to think clearly about
which quadrant we are dealing with,

94
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:12,729
for this we can do tests
on the signs of ΔX, ΔY,

95
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,439
as you can see here on this table.

96
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,959
Depending on the quadrant in
which we find ourselves,

97
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:23,809
for example here in the quadrant II,
we'll have to add 200 gon here

98
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:28,649
to the value <i>Φ'</i> that results
from the arc tangent function.

99
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:32,661
We'll illustrate this orientation
principle by using

100
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,531
a protractor. 

101
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,132
I'll place my protractor here on
a fixed terrain point,

102
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:40,752
in this case the point P,...

103
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:45,166
and I'll use an orientation
point,

104
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:49,166
here, orientation, the point Q.

105
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:55,787
I'll trace a vector here
between my point P and my point Q

106
00:07:55,787 --> 00:08:02,907
which defines a spatial vector
with regards to the direction here

107
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:10,347
of the map's north
in this case the axis X,

108
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:19,037
and so, I have my grid azimuth here,
<i>Φ</i>, between P and Q.

109
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:23,995
The protractor was arbitrarily
placed on the ground.

110
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:35,685
It's zero is in an unknown direction
but it will serve as a reference

111
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:37,995
to mesure the direction.

112
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:48,115
In this case, I will measure the
direction of r between P and Q here.

113
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:53,213
So I have this horizontal
direction, rPQ.

114
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:57,552
I'll still have to determine the unknown
orientation from

115
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:00,992
my spatial vector, here.

116
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:10,582
With my rQ measurement I will be able to calculate
the direction of my zero,

117
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:14,972
namely this unknown orientation.

118
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:19,338
Transposed on the terrain
this orientation principle presents itself

119
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:20,848
in the following way :

120
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:24,848
I have my measuring device here,
the theodolite, which is placed on

121
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:29,848
a station point, the fixed point,
and I will use a known point here,

122
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:33,678
for example a bell tower,
to have this spatial vector

123
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:35,978
which will serve the orientation.

124
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:40,088
Here we'll recall that the origin
of the circle here is nondescript

125
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:44,948
and it's necessary to measure
the direction towards the bell tower

126
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:48,448
to determine the unknown orientation.

127
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:52,948
To summarize this part about orientation,
we have seen the different definitions

128
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:58,048
of norths, the usage the map's
north in topometry,

129
00:09:58,048 --> 00:10:01,228
the definition of the azimuth,
which is the direction with regards

130
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:04,728
to the geographical North,
the grid azimuth being the direction

131
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:09,098
with regards to the map's north,
and the utilisation of fixed points

132
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:14,528
of the coordinate system for orientation
when making topometric measurements.
