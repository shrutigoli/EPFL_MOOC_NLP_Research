00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:05,353
Hello, 

2
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:07,749
welcome to this 
third part if the exercise

3
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:11,887
where we first saw the grid azimuth, 
the calculation of the orientation

4
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,413
and now survey by ray and distance.  

5
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:16,700
We recall here
the principle with ray and distance surveying

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,878
that consist of measuring directions

7
00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:21,001
and distances from a station 

8
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,195
to determine the coordinates 
of new points. 

9
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:28,994
With the implementation of a station, we determine
the plane coordinates of a point

10
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:31,113
as seen here in this small example. 

11
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:35,816
I have a station here S

12
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:40,319
with a new point P.

13
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:46,572
After my station, I can mark the 
direction of North here, 

14
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:49,241
the direction of the X axis. 

15
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:53,671
Previously, I did the orientation
of my station. 

16
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:57,869
So, I have my horizontal circle 0

17
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:59,859
whose direction is determined. 

18
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:04,534
So I have here an omega S, 
an unknown orientation 

19
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:06,769
and what interests me now

20
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:12,016
is to determine
the new vector to the point P. 

21
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:18,275
The measure I am going to do, 
will be a direction rp 

22
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:19,674
(horizontal direction)

23
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:22,442
and a distance here, 

24
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:27,837
horizontal S of sp, 

25
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:31,532
which is measured by the apparatus. 

26
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:37,498
I know the coordinates 
of my station Ys, Xs

27
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:41,360
and the unknowns here will be

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,122
Xp and Yp.

29
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:55,585
In order to show this principle, 

30
00:01:55,585 --> 00:02:01,332
I give here a small figure
with a building that I wish to survey

31
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:03,932
with a small point P here, which is the angle. 

32
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:09,736
I know here the orientation 
of my theodolite,

33
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:13,068
I determined the unknown omega, 

34
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:17,877
I have the direction here
of the origin of the circle

35
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:21,864
and I will effectively measure here

36
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:27,082
a direction rp

37
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:34,390
and a distance, here, of sp.

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,999
From this point S, I will determine

39
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,877
the coordinate differences, namely

40
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:48,548
a delta Y and a delta X. 

41
00:02:48,548 --> 00:02:52,619
I will have a delta Y here, 
a delta X, 

42
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:59,162
and knowing, 
by measurement and calculation, 

43
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:02,606
the grid azimuth of s to p

44
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:05,540
and through trigonometry, 
I will be able to determine

45
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,882
these values delta Y and delta X.

46
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:13,000
We will take here a numerical example

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,437
with fixed points, in this case

48
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:20,092
a station and its point of orientation. 

49
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:25,877
I trace here the vector 
between these two points. 

50
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,795
My new point to determine, here, 

51
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:31,397
point P. 

52
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:36,221
I also trace the vector 
between these two points. 

53
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:41,646
I obviously continue with my 
original direction, 

54
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:49,511
namely the x-axis

55
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:55,538
and then we will now, 
graphically, measure, determine 

56
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:59,730
the magnitudes we have on this graph. 

57
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,491
We measured a direction here

58
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:09,793
of S to the point M:  53, 485 gon

59
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:12,812
that allows me to determine
my unknown orientation

60
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:17,253
so I place this direction
of about 54 gon

61
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:25,545
that gives me here the origin of my circle. 

62
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:28,494
So, now I can also

63
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:33,731
trace the direction of the original circle

64
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:42,744
and I can, from this circle, 
control my measurement, 

65
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:51,413
here, rp, 

66
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:55,222
which is about 27 gon

67
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:59,743
and I can now measure

68
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:05,894
my unknown orientation omega,

69
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,341
which is 11 gon, 

70
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:15,187
the phi sp, so the grid azimuth of s to p. 

71
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:26,303
Here, phi sp.

72
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:32,791
Graphically, I read 38 gon. 

73
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:38,187
Then the value of delta Y

74
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:44,093
and delta X.

75
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:55,299
Delta X and delta Y
that I can measure on my graph.  

76
00:05:55,299 --> 00:06:00,030
Delta Y is 14 meters, 

77
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,661
delta X is 20 meters

78
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:08,134
that I can add to the coordinates

79
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:13,495
of the station, here, 
I obtain here for Yp

80
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:19,447
565'367  meters

81
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:25,756
and for Xp 156'274 meters. 

82
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:29,939
I can also control, 
starting from my point

83
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,633
on my graph, 
the coordinates, here

84
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:41,462
and I can see that it is quite consistent. 

85
00:06:41,462 --> 00:06:45,018
We now move on to calculating
the actual ray and distance survey. 

86
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:46,860
The first thing
I will calculate, 

87
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,463
is the grid azimuth phi of S to P,

88
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:57,635
which is equal to my unknown
orientation omega S

89
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:03,515
plus here the direction of S to P

90
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:12,927
which equals 11, 167

91
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:18,409
plus my 27, 382 

92
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,234
which is equal to 

93
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:28,619
38, 549 gon.

94
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:31,684
So this is my grid azimuth phi SP. 

95
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:37,176
I can calculate delta Y
with this formula, 

96
00:07:38,026 --> 00:07:43,880
which is equal to 25, 237.

97
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,484
So this is the distance 

98
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:48,920
measured in the field

99
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:56,753
times the sine of 38. 549,

100
00:07:57,693 --> 00:08:02,456
which is equal to
14, 36 meters.

101
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:09,162
Delta X will be equal to 25, 237

102
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:15,098
times the cosine of 38. 549

103
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:20,146
which is equal to 20, 75 meters. 

104
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:28,417
The coordinates of P: Yp, 
is equal to the coordinate

105
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:34,840
of the station Ys plus my 14, 36

106
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:40,232
which makes 565'

107
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:47,514
367, 97 meters

108
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:52,931
and Xp is equal to Xs

109
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:56,388
plus 20, 75

110
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:58,940
which is equal to

111
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:05,952
156'274, 32 meters.

112
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:11,885
Looking at these values compared

113
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,793
to the graphical values, 
I also have a control 

114
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:22,808
over the graph

115
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:28,510
that shows me that my approximate values
were consistent

116
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,379
with the calculated response. 

117
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,491
Finally, I give you here in plain text 

118
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:40,773
the results with the different steps of
calculating ray and distance surveying.
