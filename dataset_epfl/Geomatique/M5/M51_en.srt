Hello.

2
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:09,054
Welcome to this part dedicated
to topographic surveys.

3
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:14,027
In this lesson we will tackle
the principles and concepts of surveying ;

4
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:17,918
next the different
orientation modes,

5
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:21,587
and then we'll describe the main
topometric instrument

6
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:24,511
used for surveys,
namely the theodolite; 

7
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:25,546
and finally

8
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:28,147
we'll present the survey by ray and distance.

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,187
The concept of surveying

10
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:31,990
First we'll make some definitions.

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,005
Surveying is the operation
that consists of measuring

12
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:38,739
and localizing the necessary elements
to establish a model,

13
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,462
the model being
a simplified representation

14
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:45,106
of an objects generally composed
of lines and points.

15
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:48,009
We'll take the example of a building here.

16
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:51,703
The most simple modeling 
consists of giving

17
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:55,211
a point at the base of the building,

18
00:00:55,211 --> 00:01:00,419
and the opposite point, I can trace a 
line here that connects these two points.

19
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:04,034
This gives me a part
of this building's base.

20
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:09,195
Likewise I can consider the building
in its spatial dimension

21
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:15,570
by modeling the different sides
of the walls and edges of the building

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,515
in order to have a complete element.

23
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:20,954
Similarly I can 
go more into detail

24
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:23,352
by modeling the stairs,

25
00:01:23,962 --> 00:01:24,921
the windows,

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,565
all depending on the objective
of the survey modeling. 

27
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:32,175
The principal of  surveying

28
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:37,300
The principle will consist of connecting
a series of coordinates,

29
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,695
with its fixed points,

30
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:44,193
to the points that describe the object
that interests me,

31
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:45,860
namely the building here,

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,863
with the points that describe its model,

33
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:53,618
namely the building's corners.

34
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:58,483
This connection will be made through
geometric quantities,

35
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:00,010
like angles

36
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:02,936
and distances.

37
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:08,223
From the angles and distances

38
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:12,733
we will make a certain number
of topometric calculations

39
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:17,295
that will render the coordinates.

40
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:24,309
Then arises the problem
of attaching to the frame,

41
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:30,970
of coordinates where it's about
adjusting the orientation problem.

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,858
The survey result
is presented here on the map,

43
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:36,676
which was established by students,

44
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:39,578
during a topographic
campagne at Biasca.

45
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:43,665
On this map we can see
the different modeled objects,

46
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,217
namely the buildings
with their ground base,

47
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:48,194
we also have the complimentary
elements,

48
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:49,921
like the stairs,

49
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:51,391
the walls,

50
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:53,389
we find diverse objects,

51
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:54,927
like the vegetation,

52
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,520
and also the roadsides,

53
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,543
as well as other ground
coverage objects.

54
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:07,042
So we see the result which 
is the object of a topometric survey.
