00:00:04,473 --> 00:00:07,961
Hello, this part of the course
on digital models

2
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:11,614
is dedicated to modeling
and interpolation.

3
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:16,315
Modeling and interpolation
consist of establishing a model 

4
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:18,525
from field measurements

5
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:21,713
in order to create a surface 
that allows to interpolate

6
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:24,085
altitudes of new points. 

7
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:27,704
To establish a digital 
terrain model

8
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:31,080
the basic principle consist of 
finding the best surface

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,640
that will pass through measurement points,
also called support points. 

10
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:40,242
I take here a small example in 2D 
with an altimeter profile

11
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:45,428
where I have prior crude measurements
- these are my small circles here- 

12
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:52,425
and I will look for the best curve 
passing through these points. 

13
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,503
I take here an interpolation curve

14
00:00:57,584 --> 00:01:09,474
that pass through my points and in
this way I have a method called exact

15
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:14,810
with my interpolation curve. 

16
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:24,845
We can speak about 
an approximate method

17
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:33,208
when the selected curve does not 
necessarily pass through the support points.

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,611
Here we talk about an approximative method. 

19
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,993
For the digital terrain model
we talk about a 2D or 2-and-a-half-D. 

20
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:47,487
We don't have the true 3D, 
we will explain this principle 

21
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:49,617
with the following small example.

22
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:56,537
I draw here a terrain profile
with an overhang here

23
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,740
and when modeling this terrain, 

24
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:02,355
-I draw here measurement 
points in red- 

25
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:08,151
we cannot take into account 
the effect of the overhang

26
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:15,134
because we will then model
our surface by small facets

27
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:17,505
triangles or a grid. 

28
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:22,540
I draw here a curve which 
will pass through these points

29
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:32,391
and we don't allow to put 
modeling points here

30
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:38,178
inside the overhang
because we will find ourselves

31
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:42,687
in a model where, for a 
a planimetric value

32
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:48,592
a value of X,Y we have two different 
values of Z.

33
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:53,050
This is not possible with most 
digital terrain models

34
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:58,586
We summarize here this principle of modeling 
with a 2D surface. 

35
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:07,275
Firstly, we have point measurements. 

36
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:16,055
I draw my measurement points
in red, so the small circles here.

37
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,828
From these measures, 
I will establish a model

38
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:34,454
that is my 2D surface, 
my continuous surface

39
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:41,017
in this case, what is already 
marked in brown

40
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:48,429
and after I can interpolate
the new values

41
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:54,863
for example here on my drawing

42
00:03:54,863 --> 00:04:07,940
I take a point E, it has Y,X coordinates
of which I don't know the altitude

43
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:15,542
and then the intersection with my 
surface will give me altitude HE

44
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:26,222
so there I have my interpolated point
E(Y,X) HE.

45
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:30,031
A terrain model will rely 
on raw measurements. 

46
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:33,489
We recall here what we saw 
in the course "Geomatic Elements"

47
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:37,102
namely topometric methods 
which allow to measure points

48
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,080
and lines in the territory. 

49
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:43,867
The restitution of the digital 
terrain will first

50
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:54,489
go through a set of points as seen here in 
the figure to the right with small crosses. 

51
00:04:54,489 --> 00:05:00,426
These are the points determined
by the Y, X and H coordinates. 

52
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:07,170
The density of these points
depend on the terrain. 

53
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:16,914
If the terrain is rough or 
if the terrain is relatively flat.  

54
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:23,792
With a rough terrain, we will have 
a high density of points. 

55
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:28,761
With a flat terrain, we will have a weak 
or a low density of points. 

56
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:32,731
We will also add
characteristic lines, 

57
00:05:34,897 --> 00:05:39,302
namely breaklines or 
structure lines of the terrain. 

58
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:54,654
We see in this example 
to the right, typically

59
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:58,212
the roadside as a prominent 
feature of the landscape

60
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:00,124
that will be a structural line. 

61
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,271
We also have ridge 
or bank elements

62
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:10,271
that are prominent elements that 
will return in terrain modeling. 

63
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:13,896
To illustrate the principle 
of raw data input

64
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:17,569
we see the orthophoto 
with contour lines

65
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:19,986
where we find these structural 
landscape elements

66
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:23,395
like the road, like the
small descending stream here

67
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:26,816
and some elements 
that have resulted in here 

68
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,706
the restitution of characteristic 
curves. 

69
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,682
After the sound recovery method 
of terrain points and lines,

70
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:38,996
we have here an approach with 
new survey technologies

71
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:43,815
where we do a survey of mass
or of high density.

72
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:48,069
We have methods called 
laser scanning 

73
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:52,507
or photogrammetry
with digital processing

74
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:57,624
that can restore
a very high density of points 

75
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:02,592
with several points per square meter. 

76
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:10,614
The problem with this "blind" surveying

77
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:14,586
is that we measure
all of the terrain. 

78
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:22,575
We recall here the digital 
surface model

79
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,614
meaning, we measure the 
points that are on the ground 

80
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,905
but we also end up 

81
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:33,970
with points that will be on 
constructions

82
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,361
or vegetation. 

83
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:44,297
It will be, from this scatterplot

84
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:50,583
to make a filter and a classification.

85
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:59,486
We see in this example here, 
the survey of a small village

86
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:02,599
with a wine-growing region, 
with some forests. 

87
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:07,132
We have here this classification 
with buildings in red,  

88
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:14,131
areas of terrain in brown 
and high vegetation in green. 

89
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:20,215
The principle of the classification 
is illustrated with this small example in 2D. 

90
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,913
We have here the raw measurements. 

91
00:08:22,913 --> 00:08:26,311
First we see the points that 
are on the terrain. 

92
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,912
We also have the 
elements of construction. 

93
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,799
We see here the roof with its 
characteristic shape

94
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:41,905
and finally we have low vegetation 
and taller vegetation. 

95
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:47,147
It is algorithms that separate
these different groups of points

96
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:52,190
in order to separate the ground surface 
for the terrain model

97
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:59,166
and above-ground elements 
such as vegetation and buildings

98
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,312
for their own modeling. 

99
00:09:02,036 --> 00:09:07,403
Modeling consists, on the basis of 
raw measurements or terrain measurements

100
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:11,534
to construct a surface 
with help of elements

101
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:14,494
such as a regular grid 
or triangles. 

102
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:20,555
First, we have observations, namely 
our raw points with their altitude, 

103
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:27,643
and I can model my surface 
either with a regular grid

104
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:33,675
that I draw here on my plane

105
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:40,094
or with a triangulated model

106
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:48,622
that will link my different nodes or 
observation points. 

107
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:51,196
Finally what interests me

108
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:54,019
is to be able to interpolate an elevation

109
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,190
for a new points with 
known coordinates X,Y. 

110
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,413
I will first deal with the regular grid. 

111
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:05,892
The first operation consist of 
determining the spatial resolution

112
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:09,456
or choose the grid section. 

113
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,318
This resolution depend on the application,

114
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:20,165
why I want to use my digital 
terrain model

115
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:25,374
and it also depends on the density 
of the measured points

116
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:35,771
as well as the morphology of the terrain. 

117
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:47,166
In this example here, I will 
take one grid

118
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,252
a little larger than what is drawn. 

119
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:53,581
I take it here in red, with three squares

120
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:04,291
and so I have chosen my spatial 
resolution, namely here one cell

121
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:10,546
and here we see that the density is
about one point per grid.

122
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:14,750
How are we going to interpolate the nodes 
of the grid? 

123
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,521
There are many methods. 

124
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:19,397
I take here a graphic example
with the node there. 

125
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:24,324
I can, in a first step, 
take the elevation of the nearest point

126
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,014
so, the closest neighbour.

127
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,881
For example this altitude 531 
that I assign here

128
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:43,665
or I can take an average. 

129
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:51,776
In that case, I will consider 
points near my node, 

130
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:55,707
and take a weighted average in terms of

131
00:11:57,536 --> 00:12:01,191
the distance between the node 
and the measurement points. 

132
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:05,167
We can use more 
rigorous methods 

133
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:07,493
so-called estimation methods

134
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:13,916
such as kriging. 

135
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,444
Another way to model the terrain

136
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,196
consists of constructing 
a network of triangles

137
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:24,201
based on the raw measurements. 

138
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:32,321
A triangle is composed on three nodes
three peaks

139
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:37,238
and three sides or edges. 

140
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:42,499
The question that arises is
how to select these edges?

141
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:47,169
We see here in this pre-established example

142
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:51,339
the triangles that are drawn

143
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,908
but I could have also connected 
my point 531 to point 570

144
00:12:56,908 --> 00:13:01,473
and have here a triangle like this

145
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:07,929
instead of linking here 
my nodes 531, 541 to 550.

146
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:13,761
We will now see how to appropriately 
choose these edges.  

147
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:17,847
One method of establishing 
this triangulated network was developed

148
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,059
by the mathematician Delaunay.  

149
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:30,911
It consists of considering the circumscribed
circle passing through three nodes 

150
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:48,284
and the task is to control that the 
circle contains no other point. 

151
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:58,778
We see in this example a triangle 
said Delaunay, with my circle 

152
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,729
and I see that inside the circle
there are no points. 

153
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:05,566
In this example here, 
if I look at this circle

154
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:07,570
I see that I have a point inside

155
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,853
we are in a case that does not conform
to the Delaunay triangulation.

156
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:17,193
The Delaunay triangulation is used 
to triangulate a network of points

157
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:19,390
in accordance with the condition of Delaunay

158
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,933
meaning that the circumscribed circles
of the triangle don't  contain any points. 

159
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:27,495
Here is the internal process of an algorithm.

160
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:31,840
We add a point to the network, 

161
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,498
The circumscribed circle 
have a facet and a trace.

162
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,888
If another point is included 
inside this circle

163
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:41,062
then the facet is reversed, 
otherwise it is conserved. 

164
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:07,053
In addition, we often associate the Voronoi 
diagram to the Delaunay triangulation. 

165
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:10,808
Geometrically, this association
leads to the fact that 

166
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:14,624
the bisectors of the facets are also 
the sides of the Voronoi diagram. 

167
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:16,404
As well as the peaks of the diagram

168
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:19,843
are the center or the circumscribed circles
of the triangulation. 

169
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,039
How are we going to integrate the structural 
elements of the landscape?

170
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,648
I bring back here my example of 
photogrammetry

171
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:42,385
and I zoom into the restitution with 
the set of points - my small crosses here - 

172
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:52,450
that I draw as well as a structural 
element namely a structural line

173
00:15:52,450 --> 00:16:02,124
that I will draw in red, 
in this example.

174
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:07,041
The triangulation will be constructed
with the condition

175
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:10,332
that it does not cut this structural element

176
00:16:10,332 --> 00:16:16,673
so the triangles will be constructed without 
ever cutting my red structural line.

177
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:25,194
Finally, what interests us in 
the digital terrain model

178
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:29,725
is to interpolate the elevation for 
points only known in planimetry.

179
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:31,946
We take here the example with this point E

180
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:37,316
and a bi-linear interpolation 
from a grid. 

181
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:40,770
We have four known points in altimetry
A, B, C, D.

182
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:46,153
For each of these points, I have 
a known elevation

183
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:52,584
that I refer to in this figure. 

184
00:16:52,976 --> 00:17:01,440
I can also draw the lines
that connect two nodes of this grid

185
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:05,896
and then I have my point E
somewhere in between, 

186
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:09,976
that I will draw here in red.

187
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:15,432
And at point E, I can also 
draw a line here

188
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,832
that will cut the sides of my grid

189
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:23,154
that I can note here vertically

190
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:29,401
and finally this will give me 
here a line in space 

191
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:32,999
and starting from my point E, 

192
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:37,614
I will find my intersection

193
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:44,325
and I will have the elevation HE with 
this bi-linear interpolation

194
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:46,162
from the points of the grid. 

195
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:51,136
To summarize this part 
on interpolation and modeling

196
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,528
we repeat here that the acquisition 
of raw data 

197
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:57,589
is either by photogrammetry/
othopometry

198
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:02,125
with the restitution of characteristic 
points and lines

199
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,827
or with a survey of mass 
or high density

200
00:18:05,827 --> 00:18:08,141
with Lidar techniques

201
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:10,210
or with digital photogrammetry.

202
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:16,511
Finally the modeling is a surface
called 2-and-a-half-D

203
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:18,403
this is not real 3D

204
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:20,794
and we approach this surface

205
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:23,237
either with a regular grid, 

206
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:25,630
or with triangles.
