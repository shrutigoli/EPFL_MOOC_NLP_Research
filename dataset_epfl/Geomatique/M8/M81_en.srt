00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:07,652
Hello, welcome to this lesson dedicated

2
00:00:07,654 --> 00:00:08,898
to digital elevation models.

3
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:10,695
Digital elevation models

4
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,702
are used as the name indicates

5
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:14,909
for the modeling of altimetry 

6
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:18,349
for topography, 
for construction work

7
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:20,163
for development work 

8
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:23,354
where we use digital models

9
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,430
for establishing calculations 
and projects. 

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,729
This course will consist of three parts

11
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,169
First of, an introduction

12
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:33,468
with some notions about the relief

13
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:38,905
then some notions about 
the representation of relief 

14
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,040
and geomorphometry

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,178
and finally, the actual 
modeling itself

16
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:47,320
with the principle of interpolation

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,947
and modeling of altitudes.

18
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:54,592
In this introduction, before discussing 
the modeling of altitudes

19
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:57,490
we return a bit to the 
history of cartography 

20
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,394
here with an example of a map from 1513.

21
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:08,851
The relief on this map is 
represented figuratively  

22
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:18,110
with landmarks such as hills

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,284
mountains

24
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:29,695
that allow for orientation
in the landscape.

25
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:32,927
However, we must remember that, 
in these maps

26
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,974
there is no metric.

27
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:43,438
Making a big jump in history

28
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,039
we come to topographic maps 
as we know them. 

29
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:51,387
These topographic maps
possess a metric. 

30
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:57,563
It relies, as we have seen, 
on geodetic references

31
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:05,914
and it contain a lot 
of situational elements.

32
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:07,854
We can ask the question:

33
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:14,335
on this map, how is
altimetry represented? 

34
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,384
I give you some time to reflect

35
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:20,807
on the elements that show 
altimetry in this map. 

36
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,081
We have in fact elements

37
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:30,855
such as coloring, shading

38
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:35,291
as well as elements

39
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,280
for example water stream

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,964
which give an indication of the relief.

41
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,164
We now come to the 
question that interests us: 

42
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:48,672
how to measure, how to model?

43
00:02:48,672 --> 00:02:56,606
We have on this map a certain 
number of altimetry indicators

44
00:02:56,606 --> 00:03:12,831
starting with the side points, 
found here: 2005 meters, 1975

45
00:03:12,831 --> 00:03:18,063
then, like on all 
topographic maps

46
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:23,904
the contour lines, as we 
see in this figure

47
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:28,200
with here the curve of 1900 meters. 

48
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,257
This is already a stage of modeling.

49
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:40,931
A way of giving 
this third dimension

50
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:43,487
to our topographic map.

51
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:47,489
How to quantify altimetry, 
how to use the elevation?

52
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,331
In order to illustrate this problem

53
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:51,234
I take here an example

54
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:53,673
with the rockslide of Randa

55
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:58,069
with a situation here before 
the rockslide, in 1982

56
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,841
and the current status here in 2011. 

57
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,475
We see already on the two maps

58
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,345
the difference in the contour

59
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,562
here at 1900 meters, here at 1500 meters. 

60
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:10,397
I have the same curves in 
the current map. 

61
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:13,317
We already see that this landform 
has changed. 

62
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:15,023
If we want to go more into detail

63
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:18,458
we can establish a profile here

64
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,164
take this same profile
on the current map

65
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:24,366
draw, compare

66
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:26,827
but it's long and tedious. 

67
00:04:26,827 --> 00:04:28,811
For this we will establish what is called

68
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:34,375
the digital elevation models.

69
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:39,683
We will use a computer
model of altitudes

70
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:42,193
to make a series of 
calculations.

71
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:44,686
In summary, in this lesson

72
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,034
we will look at how

73
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:48,980
to characterize landforms 

74
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,389
how to model terrain

75
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,359
how to interpolate elevations

76
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,675
and, finally, how to use
these models

77
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:58,332
to make derived products

78
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,735
slope maps, 
orienteering maps 

79
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:03,763
and maps with 
contour lines.
