00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:05,873
Hello!

2
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:08,970
This part of he lesson on 
digital elevation models

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,027
is dedicated to the representation 
of relief and geomorphometry.

4
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:17,734
We first have to outline
some definitions concerning

5
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:19,609
digital elevation models.

6
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:24,205
First we have digital 
surface model or DSM.

7
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:28,758
It is the envelope that covers
all of the objects on the surface

8
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,205
built objects, vegetation, 
and waterways. 

9
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:38,510
Here, we have a crude model from which 
we can remove all objects

10
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,242
and we will have a 
digital terrain model.

11
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:48,335
where we only have the ground 
surface which is shown here.

12
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:52,133
These two terrain and 
surface models

13
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:56,141
are the family of 
digital elevation models.

14
00:00:56,141 --> 00:01:02,495
The relief is characterized by the shapes
and inequalities of the terrestrial surface

15
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,365
or in a given territory. 

16
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:08,235
It can be described in two ways

17
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,100
either quantitatively
or qualitatively. 

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,823
Qualitatively, we can describe
a territory with some adjectives

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:30,022
like flat, hilly, rough, etc....

20
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,948
This is useful for 
geography books. 

21
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:35,492
On the contrary, for our engineering work

22
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:38,247
we must have a quantitative approach 

23
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:50,300
that is to say, we will measure
elevation of characteristic points.

24
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:59,777
We can also on this map section

25
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:01,873
describe one of these regions

26
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:06,153
for example here with a relatively 
steady slope.

27
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:11,909
We have in this region, maybe a rougher 
terrain with the presence of rocks. 

28
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:17,198
In the region, we can have
an average altitude.

29
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:20,196
We can also find some 
characteristic elevation points. 

30
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:27,543
which are given on this map and 
the swamp regions that are flatter. 

31
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:32,843
Here are some relief interpretations 
in this region of Simplon.  

32
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:39,624
The geomorphometry is the technique
that allows for determining variables 

33
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:43,081
which will characterize 
the different landforms. 

34
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:48,141
We also have two approaches, 
the global approach and the local approach.

35
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:56,673
The global approach is the one that
will characterize the entire survey area

36
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:59,462
for example, a watershed. 

37
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:04,960
In this case, we have a characteristic,
which may be the average elevation. 

38
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:17,054
For the global approach,  it will
be the geometric properties

39
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:34,509
like for example, 
slope, orientation, etc...

40
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:46,102
In this example, my surveying zone is 
what is outlined in red

41
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:51,066
I can calculate 
the average elevation

42
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:56,538
or more locally, 
if I place myself in this region

43
00:03:56,538 --> 00:04:05,284
I have a certain slope, 
as well as an orientation

44
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:12,821
if I have the north of the map here, 
the region will be oriented northeast.

45
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:16,677
Locally, I have two indicators: 
the slope and orientation

46
00:04:16,677 --> 00:04:21,368
that will characterize 
this portion of the map.  

47
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:24,982
On of the global geomorphometry 
characteristics

48
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:27,095
is the hypsometric curve. 

49
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:31,134
The hypsometric curve is 
the distribution of the surface 

50
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:36,623
of a given zone 
as a function of elevation.

51
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:51,739
For example, if I confine my perimeter
I have a first zone of 500 m 

52
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:55,094
with a certain surface, 
then I have another zone

53
00:04:55,094 --> 00:05:03,253
of 1000 m with another surface, 
etc..., here 1500 m

54
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:12,375
We construct hypsometric curves
like in this graph with for example

55
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:35,040
at 2500 m, I find myself at 12%
and at 1500 m, I am at 50%.

56
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:42,027
I have 38% between these 2 zones: 

57
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:55,294
I have 38% of the surface area 
between 1500 and 2500 m. 

58
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:57,611
This type of curve is useful

59
00:05:57,611 --> 00:06:01,469
to characterize a watershed
for hydrological studies.

60
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:05,614
Another global characteristic 
is the roughness. 

61
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:09,926
We can look, in a given perimeter, 
at some statistical values

62
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:24,160
in particular classes of elevation,
classes of slopes.

63
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,814
These are the values that allow us
to get an idea of the terrain roughness.

64
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:35,251
Another way to approach this 
global variable is already looking

65
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:42,441
at a map where we see regions 
with a certain steady slope

66
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:50,211
with smooth terrain, flat and more
troubled regions like here

67
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:56,607
where this notion of roughness 
can also be interpreted intuitively.

68
00:06:56,607 --> 00:07:03,146
It is even more interesting to see 
what we call a shaded model

69
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:08,615
made from digital elevation model, 
in particular laser models. 

70
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,299
We see on this map
that the regions called rough 

71
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:20,205
stand out as soon as we
have very bumpy relief areas

72
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:23,706
it is apparent on 
these shaded models. 

73
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:31,271
To quantify this relief roughness, 
we can use the fractal index. 

74
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:39,754
We will relate the length of a curve 
with a fractal dimension

75
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:46,089
like in this small example
with the the completly straight line

76
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,940
the red curve slightly wavy

77
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,159
and the yellow curve very wavy, 
so in other words very rough. 

78
00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:02,378
In this small example, we have
the sinusoidal character or a curve.

79
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:13,385
In this example, the fractal index, 
the fractal dimension

80
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:28,726
for the right is 1, for a
very wavy curve, D is equal to 2. 

81
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:33,787
It is an example for a straight line, we
can use a model for surfaces

82
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:37,071
with other fractal dimensions. 

83
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:41,624
In geomorphometry, the most important
local characteristics

84
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,885
are slope and orientation. 

85
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:46,246
To illustrate these elements

86
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:57,558
I draw a horizontal reference plane
as well as a small surface element

87
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:02,704
that will cut through my horizontal plane 
at a certain angle.

88
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,897
I can draw in the center of 
my small surface dS

89
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:23,110
the slope vector 
of this small surface element.

90
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:28,663
From my horizontal plane, 
I have an angle i, 

91
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:38,418
which is the inclination angle or 
slope that can be expressed

92
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:43,562
in either degrees or %. 

93
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:51,936
Then. we must characterize
the orientation, ie here the vector

94
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:54,620
from the intersection
of my two planes

95
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,136
and I can have, in this case, 
the direction of north on the map 

96
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:04,497
which is somewhere here. 
I will find East

97
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:10,375
and the orientation relative to the
cardinal points will be northeast. 

98
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:23,189
We can therefore cut the portion of land 
that interests us in small pixels

99
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,617
or small terrain elements, 
and in each of these elements

100
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:31,924
we can describe these 2 variables, 
the orientation and the slope. 

101
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:36,431
We can then create a complete map
with these pieces of information. 

102
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:40,212
From the digital elevation models 
that cover the territory

103
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:44,509
we can create slope maps, 
orientation maps

104
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,359
as we find them in
 the cartographic shops 

105
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,742
with the example of the NeuchÃ¢tel canton. 

106
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:53,494
First, we have here a slope map

107
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:57,858
in this image, with a scale
that is not linear.

108
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:04,007
We see here 0 degrees, a relatively 
flat region between 0 and 2 degrees, 

109
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:07,443
and at the other end,
very steep slopes

110
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:12,847
as we have here in this valley 
with rather dark colors.

111
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:18,337
We can quickly interpret this map
and see where we have steep areas

112
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:21,358
in this region. 

113
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:24,359
The other element, is the orientation.

114
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:30,700
I bring back the little valley with in red
the slopes facing west

115
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:35,574
and in green, areas facing east.

116
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:39,932
We can easily see the areas

117
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:44,850
facing north or northeast
illustrated here in blue, dark blue.  

118
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:51,084
Here are two more local characteristics;
convexity and concavity.

119
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:56,313
To explain these 2 parameters,
I draw a terrain profile

120
00:11:56,313 --> 00:12:04,793
where I will place planes 
or tangential straight lines. 

121
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:10,782
Here for this area
here for this region. 

122
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:18,731
I have 2 possible scenarios, the first with 
a tangent plane above the surface. 

123
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:24,731
I have here a area called convex 
for example a bump

124
00:12:26,873 --> 00:12:35,641
or I have here an area called
concave with a pit. 

125
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:41,318
To summarize this part of the lesson 
on digital elevation models

126
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:45,741
we recall that the digital surface model
and the digital terrain model

127
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:51,737
are the main elevation models. 
Then, the geomorphometry allows

128
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:57,534
us to characterize the different 
landforms globally or locally.

129
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:02,713
with quantitative or qualitative 
approaches.

130
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:07,399
And finally, there exists a number 
of products derived from elevation models 

131
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,289
that allows for creating slope maps, 
orientation maps

132
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:15,481
as we find in
the different cartographic shops
