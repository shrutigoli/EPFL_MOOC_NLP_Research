00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:08,308
Hello, this introductory section
of the <i>Éléments de géomatique</i> course

2
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:13,471
talks about the representation,
acquisition and management

3
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,286
of spatial references data.

4
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:20,409
Representation. One of the first parameters
of representation is the scale.

5
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:23,879
On the example that is given
on this slide

6
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:30,480
you first have a map that gives
an overview of a scale

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,062
of 1:25 000

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,461
in this case, we speak of a small scale.

9
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:44,489
And for 1cm measured on the map
we have on this scale

10
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,949
250m in the field.

11
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:56,940
Or for 1mm, which can be
measured with a ruler,

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,776
I effectively have 25m in the field.

13
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:02,280
So this gives us an idea
of the scale of objects

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,647
that can be represented on a map.

15
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:09,360
If I take a bigger scale
like the map, 1:1000 for example

16
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,642
here we speak of a large scale.

17
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:23,445
In this case, 1cm measured on my map
is 10m in the field.

18
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:33,296
Or with my small ruler in mm,
I have an object of one meter.

19
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:35,462
This much for the scale.

20
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:39,359
In terms of types of information,
we distinguish information

21
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,501
say vectorial and information
of a raster type.

22
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:46,253
If I take the example here of an aerial
vue of our campus

23
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:51,322
I will be able to draw some objects
on this map

24
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:55,621
typically a roadside,
like this, with two lines,

25
00:01:55,621 --> 00:02:01,462
or a building
whose contour I draw here.

26
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:07,941
Or I have here a wooded area
whose contour I'll also take.

27
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:11,688
All these are vectorial elements.

28
00:02:11,688 --> 00:02:21,341
For the raster, I'll actually
overlap my vue with a regular grid.

29
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,182
I'll draw here some
elements of this grid.

30
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:32,272
Then the raster will be assigned if we want,
to each element, to each pixel.

31
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:41,140
Like here, I have a wooded area, so
this would be a pixel that represents the forest.

32
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:49,487
Here I have a construction element, so
here I have a building, in this case here,

33
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:53,911
and then I can find myself 
in this section here

34
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,917
with a lake area in this case here.

35
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:04,529
So here are the two types of information,
vectorial or raster.

36
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:07,674
In terms of some examples
with the vectorial data,

37
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:13,660
here you have some maps that
already have the cadastre that we've already seen,

38
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,604
with the borders of land,
the location of buildings,

39
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:21,610
You have a national map
with the ground cover,

40
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,783
the hydrography, the wooden areas,
the urbanized areas

41
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:31,428
and you have here an execution plan
for construction work, with the round-about here,

42
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:35,159
and the various 
components of the road.

43
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,680
In terms of raster data,
we understand everything that comes

44
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,458
from aerial shots, 
orthophotos that are compatible

45
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:48,694
with the scales of plans and maps,
satellite images and likewise

46
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:52,582
a series of maps
which has been rasterized,

47
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:57,997
plans like the one one we have here in these examples
which are not vectorial plans

48
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:00,966
but which are plans
that have been rasterized.

49
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:04,411
You can see in this example of
representation, the national map

50
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,175
at different scales.

51
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:08,985
An interesting effect
is the generalization.

52
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:13,494
You can see on this scale of 1:25000
a mountain road

53
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:16,325
with all the details
of the different contours 

54
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:19,006
with a certain accuracy. 

55
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:24,805
If we go on to a scale of 1:50000,
we can already see the generalization effect

56
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:29,569
where the switchbacks of these roads
are already a little simplified. 

57
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:34,823
If I now go on to a scale of
1:200000, a much smaller scale,

58
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:40,569
it's clear that the road is not as
detailed, but you can still see

59
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:42,892
that it's a mountain road.

60
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:45,955
In terms of topographique maps,
in the national offices,

61
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:49,856
you will find different
scales, with a representation

62
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:55,295
of the ground cover like
proposed by SwissTopo.

63
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,072
We will stop here with a little quiz
to think a little bit

64
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:01,568
about the generalization effect.

65
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:06,288
The plan, in its representation,
the plan offers an exact metric. 

66
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:08,508
It's used
for engineering projects,

67
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,285
it's used for cadastre.

68
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:15,890
We can see the different parcel boundaries
in this cadastre example,

69
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:22,278
with the precise documentation of position
of bounds and of boundaries.

70
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:26,680
Likewise we have the buildings,
with their footprint,

71
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,367
as well as a series of linear objects,

72
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:33,712
diverse objects like
stairs and walls.

73
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:38,129
The scales for this plan
go from 1:200 to 1:1000.

74
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,896
The overall plan offers
like for the national map

75
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:46,747
a view of the ground cover 
with this example here in Neuchatâtel

76
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:51,929
the vineyard areas,
the urban construction areas.

77
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:55,785
Likewise you have the communication
lines with the highway that passes here

78
00:05:55,785 --> 00:06:00,410
as well as the topography
with the contour lines

79
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,712
that give an idea of 
the terrain's slope.

80
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:06,263
Another form of representation
is the geo-scheme.

81
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:11,222
It's an approximative representation
of the positioning of objects in space

82
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:13,940
such as for example a network
of public transport

83
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,615
where you have the different lines,
the sequence of stations,

84
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:22,445
with an indication of the approximate
geographical position.

85
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:26,090
What's interesting here
is knowing the sequence

86
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,641
of stations rather than the exact
location in space.

87
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:35,382
Another form of representation are
the thematic maps that come from

88
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:39,756
statistics such as for example, here,

89
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:43,870
the average daily traffic
on the highways.

90
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:50,244
You have here the width of the line
that corresponds to traffic density. 

91
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:56,769
So we can clearly see that in the region of
Valais there's relatively little traffic

92
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:59,968
while in other regions such as 
Zurich or Lausanne

93
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,882
there's a high traffic density.

94
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:08,464
Another form of representation
consists of giving statistical values

95
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:12,841
compared to a unit kilometer.

96
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,703
This is the case on this map, where we
can see the evolution of built areas.

97
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:24,288
For every 1km² we have an color
index that will indicate

98
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:28,174
the progression of this evolution
over time.

99
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:33,506
Another form of representation are
the geo-services or geo-servers

100
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:39,360
which are available on the internet
to the different canton offices,

101
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,208
of the confederation or of the natinoal
geographical institutions. 

102
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,000
You have here an example
with the canton of Neuchâtel.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,173
We will present you a short film
that allows you to discover

104
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:52,676
a little bit what one of
these geo-services is.

105
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:56,009
The geo-services allow to access
geographical informations

106
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,832
thanks to internet access.

107
00:07:57,832 --> 00:08:01,497
The first goal of these services
is the visualization of data.

108
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:05,319
For example, for the canton of Neuchâtel,
the platform permits

109
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,387
to manage the data layers:

110
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,049
such as administrations,
cultural centers

111
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:13,593
the town plan
as well as the cadastral plan.

112
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,902
A set of layers on the same theme
can be visualized.

113
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:20,636
Different themes are proposed
for the portal of Neuchâtel.

114
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:23,046
A first example is
the map of the environment

115
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:26,193
of hydrogrqphic data 
with the zones of water protection

116
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:27,936
and the sites of water streams.

117
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:31,625
Next we can access the topographic
map with the contour lines

118
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,269
and the characteristic elements
of the terrain, or even

119
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:35,925
the map with invasive plants

120
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:38,806
that gives view of the propagation
of plant parasites

121
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,529
in Neuchâtel's environment.

122
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:44,710
Another form of representation are
the tridimensional representations

123
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,968
like you have here with an example
of a laser survey of a natural area

124
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:52,099
of a landslide.

125
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:56,436
And on the right you have an urban model
that's a little bit more complicated

126
00:08:56,436 --> 00:09:00,714
with a set of buildings,
forests and streams.

127
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,660
Acquisition 

128
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,244
Here we'll see the principles of
acquisition with a little example here,

129
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:08,744
of an aerial panoramic vue
where here we can see

130
00:09:08,744 --> 00:09:12,880
a small area of houses.

131
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,397
So we will first observe the terrain. 

132
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:19,163
We will then model
the different objects.

133
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:22,468
Here on this aerial shot we 
can see this area

134
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:24,419
with the different houses,

135
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,037
with the roads,
with parts of meadows and gardens.

136
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:34,533
And, with the topometric methods we will
measure and then take in-situ

137
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,995
the different objects that are
the houses,

138
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:44,807
their footprint,
the part of the road

139
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:47,921
as well as other objects, like here,
the border of the forest.

140
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:52,929
So we have these principles of acquisition that
are illustrated here with this little example.

141
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:57,406
Among the methods that are already described,
we find surveying

142
00:09:57,406 --> 00:10:04,640
with the theodolite, with the level, the GPS
with the methods of spatial acquisition. 

143
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,808
Photogrammetry which 
utilizes aerial shots,

144
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,966
and the laser scanner
which is a new method

145
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:15,229
which permits to record
a large number of points

146
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:18,321
on ground's contour
and on buildings. 

147
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:22,772
For the raster techniques
we will utilize satellite images

148
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:26,826
with tele-detection,
with orthophotos

149
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,508
and also with radar
which is a technique

150
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:33,730
that permits the measuring
of terrain models

151
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,242
but also to penetrate the soil and to see
the subsoil composition a little bit.

152
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:45,545
Amongst the methods, surveying, it
permits with measurement of angles

153
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,921
and distance to return
the coordinates of objects.

154
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:55,421
If I have a small example here with
a building and its footprint

155
00:10:55,421 --> 00:11:00,160
I will come with my device,
in this case the theodolite,

156
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,805
stationed at a point, here, known.

157
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:11,705
I will use another point
to orient my station

158
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:18,445
that allows me to determine here
the building's representative points

159
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:24,025
with distance measurements, d1, d2

160
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:27,416
as well as angle measurements. 

161
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:34,580
So, on one hand we have the distances
and the angles that then permit

162
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:41,348
the determination of plane coordinates,
of points of interest in the building.

163
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:46,862
For the GPS, the principle is similar,
namely that it's positioned somewhere

164
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:53,735
on the Earth's surface with a receiver
and we will pick up the signals

165
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:59,238
with a series of satellites
that fly 20 000 km high

166
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:04,697
and these signals translated into
geometry terms, are nothing other than

167
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:09,629
the distances d1, d2, d3

168
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:18,238
and by crosschecking these distances
we can determine

169
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:25,734
the coordinates of the GPS receiver.

170
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:32,714
Among the methods of acquisition,
photogrammetry permits

171
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:35,556
to photograph
a portion of the ground.

172
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:41,617
So if I have my part of the ground,
with photogrammetry

173
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:45,692
I will be able to define
my image plan,

174
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:53,180
which would be somewhere in the airplane,
that flies over the terrain that interests me.

175
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,559
I will take a shot
from a certain altitude.

176
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,040
So I will be able to
take a part of the ground.

177
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,150
If I have an object of interest, for example
the a little building here

178
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:16,367
and well from the photo I have
an impression of the building's image

179
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:20,513
and from the measurements in the image,
from the coordinate measurements in the image

180
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:24,170
I will be able to determine
the terrain's coordinates

181
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,516
by this photogrammetry principle.

182
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:33,006
The other method based on the collection
of a large number of points is the laser scanner

183
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:36,005
that allows for a very large
density of points

184
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:38,267
as we can be seen
here in this example.

185
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:41,698
You have a laser system
here that we will place

186
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:47,201
in front of the object that interests us with here
a very high velocity scan,

187
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:51,132
where we will be able to collect
thousands of points of the building.

188
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:53,911
You have the building here,
which is returned

189
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:56,835
and which is composed of millions of points

190
00:13:56,915 --> 00:14:02,344
with a representation there
that's quite accurate that then allows

191
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,644
to measure,
to make cuts in the building,

192
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,367
to obtain geometric information.

193
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:12,382
Finally, the last pillar of this
introduction: the management methods.

194
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:16,322
The most simple management method
comprises of introducing

195
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,924
the elements acquired on the terrain
into an informatics system

196
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:23,129
We speak of assisted design
via computers that we use

197
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,057
for construction
or for development.

198
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:29,768
More sophisticated, it's the adding
of a data base

199
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:34,576
and of a GIS

200
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:39,911
like we have it here that allows to associate
objects with spatial references

201
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:44,919
such as buildings, streams,
roads, a database

202
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,332
with its structure here that associates
the buildings with their addresses

203
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:51,730
and a table here that represents the roads.

204
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,427
We can introduce a certain number
of attributes and elements

205
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,700
in these databases
say a spatial reference.

206
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:03,036
In summarize this geomatics
introduction,

207
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:07,121
we have seen a number 
of methods and techniques

208
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:11,979
for acquisition management
and representation of geo data.

209
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:17,384
We have seen that natural or constructed
objects can be modelled

210
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,051
by means of two large classes

211
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,617
which are vectors if we want to 
accurately describe the objects

212
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:25,179
or by means of raster type images

213
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:28,550
where we want to see an overall
vue of the territory.

214
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,591
Finally, the information is
available on servers

215
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:38,104
geo-portals of public administrations
that make a series of geo-data

216
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:43,144
available to the public
at large and to professionals.

217
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:46,556
So I invite you to discover
these geo-servers

218
00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:51,651
through a quiz that will be suggested
during this week.
