00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:07,140
Hello, welcome to the 
Elements de Géomatique course.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,793
This is a basic course 
for civil engineering students,

3
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:16,378
as well as for other people 
interested in topography,

4
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:18,719
in geographical 
information systems

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,918
and in the gathering of data 
for spatial references.

6
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:27,373
This introductory part is composed of 
the following elements:

7
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:30,966
some definitions
an introduction with examples,

8
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,957
what is geomatics?

9
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:36,942
A description of the course objectives,
course syllabus,

10
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:41,405
as well as the didactic approach of the different educational resources

11
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:43,276
that are at your disposal 

12
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:49,221
and finally the evaluation 
methods for the course.

13
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:53,841
Geomatics! Geomatics is 
a relatively new term

14
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:56,723
that is composed of <i>geo</i>, Earth

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,312
and <i>matics</i>, 
which comes from informatics.

16
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:03,229
So, it's ultimately 
information technologies

17
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,569
in service of geography 
and all the data

18
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,902
that affect the spatial domaine.

19
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,972
Among the different 
geomatics disciplines 

20
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:18,960
we can already mention land surveying

21
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:24,885
which is a set of methods 
that allow you

22
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:34,481
to obtain geographical data 
from the ground or from an airplane.

23
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:42,023
There's also the discipline 
of geodesy,

24
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:52,322
which is the science of the study of the shape 
and geometry of the Earth.

25
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,649
There are also other disciplines related
to the gathering

26
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:15,205
such as, for example, photogrammetry 
as remote sensing.

27
00:02:15,205 --> 00:02:19,740
This methods are image based
and permit the observation of earth

28
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,576
and also a measure
of objects on the territory.

29
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:27,370
It is finally all the elements
that permit the representation

30
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,818
of geographical objects
with cartography methods,

31
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,878
3D visualizations

32
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,483
and management systems called

33
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:57,394
"Geographic Information System"

34
00:02:57,663 --> 00:03:02,481
which is usually just called GIS.

35
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:06,894
In order to illustrate what geomatics is,
we will take two examples.

36
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:11,191
A first example in natural terrain
is the Arolla glacier.

37
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,807
We are interested in measuring
the retreat of the glacier's front.


38
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:17,823
On this image you can see

39
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:26,569
the typical scenery with the 
front of the Arolla glacier here

40
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:34,380
and this part in front here
characterizes the moraine

41
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,852
and a watercourse also,

42
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:41,966
because it's summer
and the glacier is melting.

43
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:47,123
If we get closer to the glacier,
we can see the elements that interest us

44
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:52,429
In this case, here the measure
of a series of particular points

45
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:56,376
that I will connect here with a line

46
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:59,004
and that effectively
describe the glacier's front.


47
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:03,924
You can see a stake here
with a specific measuring point

48
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:12,649
so the objective here is to measure,
with surveying methods,

49
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:22,857
in this case, a theodolite or GPS.
We will measure particular points

50
00:04:22,857 --> 00:04:31,575
in coordinates, so that we can
document the observed state in this year

51
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:35,626
and view its evolution over time.

52
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:40,279
If I now look at up
the points on a map,

53
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:46,478
I have on this example here
my coordinate system

54
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,123
with the different time periods, here,

55
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:57,096
between 2000 and 2002, I have here
the glacier front for the period of 2002,

56
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:01,941
and I have in the upper part
the glacier front for the period of 2000.

57
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:05,054
So we can see the separation
of the two front lines.

58
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:10,592
More concretely, if I come here
on an enlargement of the zone

59
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:15,226
and look at what is happening here
between the two periods

60
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:24,030
and I have a difference, that I can measure here,
planimetric of about 15m

61
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:30,973
as the annual regression
of this glacier tongue.

62
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:36,601
What is more interesting compared to
the map, is to transfer these elements

63
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:40,606
to the terrain and for this,
we will undertake a surveying process 

64
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,870
that's called implantation.

65
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:49,208
Impantation consits of,
starting with coordinates

66
00:05:49,208 --> 00:06:05,065
of the previous state, if I take
my coordinates of the previous year here,

67
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:08,434
and I can
implant these points

68
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:14,844
it means, move from my collection
of XY coordinates

69
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:20,099
to a reality on the field. 

70
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:30,441
This reality is represented by a set
 of stakes planted on the field

71
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:33,186
at the location at which the front line

72
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,958
of the previous year was effectively measured.

73
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:41,658
And if I now look
at the current front line

74
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:46,975
well, there is a discrepancy here
in life size, in actual size,

75
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,242
you can see here a student's height.

76
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:56,515
And we can effectively see these 15m
of discrepancy that we have in this example. 

77
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:58,402
Another example related to cartography. 

78
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:03,108
You have a territory here that is 
well known to EPFL students:

79
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:08,430
It's our campus grounds,
but in 1953.

80
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,701
So you have here the national map
with the area of EPFL,

81
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,438
which at that time wasn't
anything but fields and crops.

82
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:27,563
On this map, you can find
the soil cover

83
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:33,020
you can find construction
elements,

84
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:41,828
you can find the 
hydrographic network.

85
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:51,553
And you can also find
the different communication lines:

86
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:54,966
the streets and country roads.

87
00:07:55,286 --> 00:08:04,400
If I move to a subsequent time period,
to 1980, which corresponds

88
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,786
to the first construction
phase of our campus.

89
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:12,543
You can see the evolution
the way it was mapped in 1980

90
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,621
with a form of urbanization 
that's starting to develop

91
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,268
around the school.

92
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:22,502
If I now move to the state,
I'll say more recent, 2011

93
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,773
where we find our campus
the way we know it.

94
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:31,566
You can see this strong urbanization
and the map effectively seves

95
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:34,419
as a support to document
the history

96
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,783
of our territory's evolution. 

97
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:40,486
It's a valuable document
that the Géomatique uses

98
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:47,115
to understand the dynamics of the evolution
of our territories and landscapes.

99
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:50,841
Géomatique, what is finally
needed to document

100
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:56,115
the evolution of our natural and built
environment?

101
00:08:56,115 --> 00:09:01,552
We have talked about the glacier example,
of a repository of coordinates. 

102
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:06,228
So the first thing that
needs to be used effectively is

103
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:13,477
a coordinate system,
if possible in 3 dimensions

104
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:21,466
with planimetrics and a vertical
altitude component. 

105
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:28,468
Next, we will come to measure
objects in the world surrounding us.

106
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:34,497
that we'll refer to as the "real world".

107
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:41,357
We will come with a certain number
of instruments which are for example

108
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:51,257
surveying instruments 
that are terrestrial

109
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:58,365
or today with the help of satellites
such as GPS for example.

110
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:04,713
And we will be able to measure this real world,
measure objects in this world.

111
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:10,460
Next, we come to a section,
I'll say more informatic. 

112
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,795
I'll draw a little screen here

113
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:23,141
With an information system stored
in a database.

114
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:27,549
So, we have here all the methods
of managing and representing

115
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:30,023
spatial information.

116
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:33,199
Here is a little about the elements that are
required to document this evolution.

117
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:39,056
We can see them on this figure
with the different pillars

118
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:43,966
that are the acquisition
of spatial reference data.

119
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:48,582
Next all the their processing,
their representation, whether it's

120
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:52,252
on the maps or
on tridimensional models

121
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:57,023
and finally a diffusion
via different Internet channels

122
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,627
that are known today
with different geo data servers

123
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:04,296
available to everyone.

124
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,966
What are the objectives
of this geomatics cours?

125
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,769
First of all, it's about giving
an overview of geomatics

126
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,824
And the different measurement 
techniques

127
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:18,115
Next, about presenting methods
utilized for the acquisition,

128
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:22,147
the representation and management
of spatial references data.

129
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:25,218
If we take an example here
of an engineering project,

130
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:30,263
we will first plan interventions,
prepare a project,

131
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:34,529
for this we need
field operations

132
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,238
where we model objects,
we will make the aquisition

133
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:40,033
with topometric methods. 

134
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,817
Next, we will return to the office with
the cartographie operations,

135
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:51,119
of representation. We'll have to create plans
and maps for the making of the survey.

136
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:54,966
And finally, we will go to into the field
to realize the project

137
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:57,041
with implementational operations.

138
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:02,434
Once the project is completed, 
we will do a survey which will be archived

139
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:05,492
for the purpose
of conserving documents.

140
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,061
What is the content
of the geomatics course?

141
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,485
First of all, we'll give an
introduction of geomatics.

142
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:15,159
Next we have the basics of geodesy
with all the definitions

143
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,993
the coordinates systems.

144
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:22,441
Next, a section dedicated
to cartographic representations

145
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,466
and afterwards we have the different
methods of acquisition.

146
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:32,652
We'll concentrate on the geometric
level, on the utilisation of theodolites

147
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:37,442
for its orientation
and its lifting operations.

148
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:42,761
Next there are distance measurements,
also related to the levées

149
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:49,001
and afterwards we tackle
the spatial surveying with GPS.

150
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,406
Finally, we process the numeric 
terrain model,

151
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:56,918
its modeling and its utilisation
for altimetry questions.

152
00:12:56,918 --> 00:13:02,476
The didactic approach proposed
in this course is

153
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:05,114
between the basic sciences
that you have

154
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:06,652
in the different engineering schools.

155
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:11,212
These are mathematics, physics,
algebra, informatics

156
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:13,655
and finally engineering sciences,

157
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:18,869
namely construction, civil engineering,
development, environment.

158
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:22,562
It's a little bit at the interface
between the disciplines.

159
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:27,005
And in this course we will put
an emphasis

160
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:32,346
on modeling concepts
independent of technologies.

161
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:36,021
On the level of basic knowledge,
it's not necessary to have

162
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:40,313
in-depth knowledge.
It's a first year course.

163
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:42,190
On the other hand, it's necessary
to have some knowledge

164
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,877
of geometry, algebra and trigonometry. 

165
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:49,087
These are the main equations
that we will use

166
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:52,675
for the topometric methods.

167
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:57,304
An important point in this approach
is the rigor in the calculation work.

168
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:01,331
Concepts of precision, of reliability
are fundamental 

169
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:03,704
in geodesy, in topometrics. 

170
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:10,354
So we will focus on these issues
in different calculation exercises.

171
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:14,120
In terms of pedagogic resources, 
you have an entire series of course

172
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,777
videos that explain the principles
and methods a little bit

173
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:22,476
with some sets of questions
that allow you to reflect

174
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:26,546
the problematic
in a video sequence.

175
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:29,865
Aside from that, we have
an entire series of hands-on videos,

176
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:33,707
because surveying and geomatics
happen in the field.

177
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:39,212
And because of this, we have a video series 
that illustrates the methods

178
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,814
in a more concrete context.

179
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,717
This field aspect is
important for the course.

180
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:49,622
You also have a quiz series,
with multiple-choice questions

181
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:53,960
or with numeric answers 
when it's about calculations.

182
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,156
As another pedagogic resource
you can find the handouts,

183
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:02,201
"éléments géomatiques" that are
for sale for courses here at EPFL.

184
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,705
But for people who are taking
this course from far away there are

185
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:11,774
pd files for each lesson
that resume the principal chapter

186
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:14,695
that is discussed in the module in question.

187
00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:19,844
You also have some calculation
tools online on the internet,

188
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:23,089
to help you a little in approaching
topometric calculations

189
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:28,193
And finally, you have topometric
calculation exercises

190
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,964
as well as the use
of some software tools

191
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,718
for the representation
of spatial data,

192
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:38,564
for the calculation of 
numeric field models.

193
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,005
How will the course 
evaluation be conducted?

194
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,123
It will be done for each lesson,
for each module,

195
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:48,395
with a quiz series
and a main exercise,

196
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:53,252
which will often be a calculation exercise
or data representation 

197
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,964
with spatial reference

198
00:15:54,964 --> 00:16:00,902
and at the end of all the modules and 
lessons you will have a certain number

199
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:05,746
of quizzes that will be evaluated and graded
and a certain number of exercises.

200
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:09,735
You'll have a weighting for 
the final grade

201
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:15,093
with 40% for the quizzes
and 60% for the exercices.

202
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:18,251
This will give you the final 
grade for the module.
