00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:08,060
Hello, this part of the course
on measuring distances

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,047
is dedicated to 
trigonometric leveling.

3
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:13,545
Trigonometric leveling

4
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:16,048
allows, from measuring 
distances and angles, 

5
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:19,466
to determine height differences.

6
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:21,315
The question that must be asked

7
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:22,776
in topographic measurements

8
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:25,934
is: how to define a distance 
unambiguously? 

9
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:29,596
I take here a small example 
with a station P

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:35,487
an aiming point Q, a slant distance S'
measured here

11
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:38,772
as well as an angle of height beta (β).

12
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,240
We can reduce this distance
to the horizontal

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,166
here S horizontal (HZ) and calculate 
a height difference.

14
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,934
The question that we must ask: 

15
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:50,021
at what point should we consider
the distance 

16
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:52,253
like a spherical distance?

17
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,267
And also the question is knowing

18
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:57,062
that the measurement is done 
at a certain altitude

19
00:00:57,062 --> 00:01:01,396
in this case here Hp = 1000 meters

20
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,031
and that a distance measured
at a certain altitude

21
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,781
is not necessarily the same

22
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:07,468
as a measured distance

23
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,112
at a lower or 
higher altitude. 

24
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:15,309
So we must proceed with 
what we call reductions

25
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:18,044
and these are the elements 
that we will see 

26
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,949
in this part of the lesson

27
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:23,216
with the reduction due to altitude

28
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,556
as well as the reduction in 
the projection plane

29
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:27,988
in order to have distances

30
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:31,823
that are compatible with the national 
coordinate system. 

31
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:34,094
Flat Earth, round Earth

32
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,761
at what point do we take into account 

33
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,840
the roundness of Earth

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,763
in the measurements of distances?

35
00:01:39,763 --> 00:01:43,469
We take here an example 
between point P and point Q

36
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:46,774
with the chord which is the straight line 
between these two points 

37
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:51,678
and the arc that follows Earth's 
terrestrial reference surface.

38
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,888
If I have a chord of 10 000 meters

39
00:01:53,888 --> 00:02:02,327
my arc will be 10 000,001 meters 

40
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:07,088
a difference of about 
1 millimeter. 

41
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:09,505
So, in this case, for our 
topographic measurements

42
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:12,479
the arc and chord will be undistinguishable. 

43
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:22,043
On the contrary the arrow, which is the distance
here in the center, between the arc and the chord

44
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:26,780
- I have here my arc and my chord - 

45
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,951
in this case, the arrow
is equivalent to about 2 meters.

46
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,363
To illustrate this principle

47
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,659
we must stop for a moment 

48
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,645
at this figure, fundamental 

49
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:40,327
to understand the problems

50
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,289
with reduction of distance.

51
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,502
Firstly, we have here 
our station P

52
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:47,611
and the point Q which has been measured.

53
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:52,543
At station P I have a vertical here
with an altitude HP. 

54
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:54,930
At station Q I have another vertical. 

55
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,513
These two verticals are not
necessarily parallel.

56
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:59,413
From P I can consider 

57
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,749
the distance perpendicular 
to this vertical

58
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,689
namely the horizontal distance S

59
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:12,693
as well as the arc Sp here,
which will connect P to Q'.

60
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,427
I can also consider Cp 

61
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:19,007
as the chord that connects 
P to Q'.

62
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:21,233
I have thus three types of distances

63
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,540
to be considered in this figure.

64
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,790
How about for our 
topographic work? 

65
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,310
We recall here our three 
concepts of distance: 

66
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,899
namely the arc, chord

67
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:36,912
and the horizontal here at P.

68
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:43,353
So we have Sp, Cp and S. 

69
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:55,673
Cp - Sp = -1mm
for Sp = 10 km

70
00:03:55,673 --> 00:04:02,008
and then S - Sp = 1mm 

71
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:08,149
for Sp = 5 km. 

72
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:10,097
So in topographic work

73
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:13,658
where we have some 
kilometers of surface

74
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:16,389
we can neglect this effect.

75
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,837
Here we come back to the effect 
of the roundness of Earth. 

76
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:23,941
In this figure, we have first of all

77
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:29,673
the angle at the center of Earth
which is equal here to 2 ɣ (Gamma).

78
00:04:29,673 --> 00:04:36,381
We can consider the triangle OPQ'

79
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:48,589
and its relation to the radius of Earth
R x  2 ɣ = distance S between P and Q'.

80
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:53,736
Gamma ɣ is expressed in radians.

81
00:04:53,736 --> 00:05:01,201
Then we will consider 
the triangle PQ'Q'' 

82
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:09,679
in this case we can write
that E = ɣ x S.

83
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:14,586
Finally, our value E, 
by combining these two equations, 

84
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:22,424
E = S²/2R (radius of Earth).

85
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:27,097
For a distance of 10 km, 
if you do the calculations, 

86
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:33,436
you will get a value of
E = 8 meters. 

87
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:36,168
After having considered these 
spherical models

88
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,911
we now get closer to

89
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:40,807
a model called flat Earth

90
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,112
that we will use for 

91
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:45,512
most topographic works 
and construction sites. 

92
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,832
We have in this figure

93
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:52,086
a station P at a certain altitude Hp.

94
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:56,221
We measured here an oblique distance S'

95
00:05:56,221 --> 00:06:00,043
with a altitude angle Bêta (β)

96
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:03,396
we can reduce at the horizontal
the distance S. 

97
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,472
We also have to consider

98
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:12,042
the height here of the aiming point, namely Z 

99
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:19,857
as well as the height of the instrument 
namely i.

100
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:22,416
We have thus all 
geometric informations

101
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,897
to calculate the height difference.

102
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:25,351
In the case of flat Earth

103
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,963
the trigonometric formulas 
are relatively simple.

104
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:40,267
We have here the Delta (Δ ) Δ h which is 
equal to S' times sine of the altitude angle β.

105
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,169
If we look at the figure we can calculate

106
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:51,509
the altitude HQ = Hq + Δ h which I already calculated

107
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:57,118
+ I (height of instrument) - Z (height of shown signal)

108
00:06:57,118 --> 00:07:02,312
I start from P, 
I have the height of the instrument

109
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:06,555
+ Δh - Z which gives us Hq.

110
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:07,900
We will now consider

111
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,497
the different steps leading

112
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,366
to the reduction of distances

113
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:14,113
to finally have 
an unambiguous definition. 

114
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:17,768
The first step is 
the reduction due to altitude.

115
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:19,106
We see in this figure

116
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:24,683
that the distance considered at altitude Q 
or at altitude P is not the same.

117
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:28,189
We must therefore bring it back
a distance called S zero 

118
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,456
to the sea level. 

119
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,351
To calculate the reduction factor

120
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,588
we will simply take
the proportional ratio

121
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,856
between the spherical distances
and the altitudes. 

122
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:51,442
I consider here Sp/S0 and I take the
relation of the distance to the centre of the Earth

123
00:07:51,442 --> 00:08:00,612
so r + altitude Hp and then 
r (radius of Earth) at altitude H=0.

124
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:06,934
I can write that Sp, so at altitude Hp

125
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:13,760
= r + Hp/r x S0.

126
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,832
This is significant

127
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:20,490
I will here take an example with 

128
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:34,847
Hp = 500 meters and a distance S
equal to 1000 meters

129
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:45,632
Sp - S0 = 8 centimeters, in this case.

130
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:47,926
For trigonometric leveling

131
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,292
the following problem involves

132
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:53,453
the question of measuring 
the altitude angle.

133
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:55,408
We have actually in this figure

134
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:59,313
at station P, measured an angle beta

135
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:01,847
with respect to a horizontal

136
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:03,813
Or, we are interested here 

137
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:07,215
in the reference surface, 
namely the sphere

138
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:12,298
at altitude P, here the reference P Q'.

139
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,722
In addition, we have 
a refraction effect

140
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:19,328
which will impact the measured angle. 

141
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:21,657
In topography we must, in fact, 

142
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:24,876
consider the phenomena 
of atmospheric refraction

143
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:26,965
when measuring altitude angles. 

144
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:32,998
We have here our angle Tau (τ) which is 
the angle of refraction

145
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:44,948
which has the effect to curve
 the aimed beam

146
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:46,480
It is accepted in practice

147
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,724
that τ = a factor K that multiplies 
the angle at the centre of the Earth

148
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:56,365
so the farther away the aiming point is 

149
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:59,336
the more important 
is the effect of refraction.

150
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:03,636
Gamma (ɣ) is obviously expressed in radians

151
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:09,586
and with experience, K is a value 
that we fix to 0.13.

152
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:13,535
If I bring back my figure
measuring the altitude angle 

153
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:16,159
I can consider the 
following different parameters: 

154
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:23,996
Firstly
I have my measured angle beta (β)

155
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:32,066
β: measurement of altitude angle.

156
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:45,611
I have Gamma (ɣ) here, which is half
of the angle at the centre of the Earth.

157
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:55,954
I also have here Tau (τ) which is 
the angle of refraction

158
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:57,720
and finally, what interests me 

159
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,861
is the reduced angle beta, namely

160
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:12,639
β bar = = β + ɣ - τ 
(beta bar = beta + gamma - tau).

161
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:23,089
Beware of the units, as we have 
measures in general gon

162
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:29,834
and then the values of Gamma and Tau
which are expressed in radians.

163
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,293
We must therefore convert 
to the right units

164
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:34,340
to do this addition. 

165
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,932
To calculate the reduction

166
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:38,560
we now consider 
this geometric figure.

167
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:47,516
We recall here that chord and arc 
are coincident

168
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:59,696
which allows us to consider 
here a triangle with points P Q' and Q

169
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:04,758
as well as the reduced angle beta bar

170
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:09,062
and the slant distance measured here S'.

171
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:15,822
We recall here that 
Gamma  [expressed in radians]

172
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:25,110
so the effect of the Earth's roundness 
is equal to S/2 times the radius

173
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:39,930
of refraction Tau [in radians]
= K times Gamma = 0.13 x Gamma.

174
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:49,732
Considering our triangle
we can apply the sine theorem

175
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:55,709
and find the value of Sp which is equal

176
00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:11,911
to S' x cosine of (β bar + ɣ) / cos ɣ

177
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:33,362
ΔH = Sp x sin β bar
/ cos β bar + ɣ

178
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:35,178
We thus have the formulas for

179
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:37,919
calculating the reduction of distances

180
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,387
on the horizontal and the height difference.

181
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:45,758
You find here a summary of the formulas 
for reduction of distances

182
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:50,085
and I encourage you to look
at the handout for more details. 

183
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:52,757
The last phase of reduction 

184
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:54,855
consist of  applying a scale factor

185
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:59,939
of the projection of our reduced 
distance at sea level. 

186
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,553
For this I refer to the chapter

187
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:07,367
dealing with the Swiss projection

188
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:17,346
and give you here the formula
for linear alteration

189
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:22,714
which is a function of 
the distance to the neutral axis. 

190
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:27,531
The more distant I am, the more
important is the scale factor. 

191
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:35,179
The value here, reduced S bar = S0
(my reduced distance at sea level)

192
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:43,120
x 1 + the distance squared
with respect to the neutral axis

193
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,820
/ two times the radius 
of Earth squared.

194
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,827
I take here an example for l'EPFL: 

195
00:14:53,827 --> 00:15:05,905
I am located -47 km from the neutral axis

196
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:21,379
the value is equal to 28 ppm 
ie 28 mm per 1 km.

197
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:26,626
To summarize, this problem
with reduction of distances  

198
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,211
contains a lot of elements.

199
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:31,733
I recommend you to do 
the exercise that allow you 

200
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:34,200
to step by step understand all the stages

201
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,361
in order to get a reduced 
distance in the projection system.
