00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:07,559
Hello, this part of the lesson 
about distances

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,114
is dedicated to the electronic 
measurement of distances. 

3
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:14,349
We will first see

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,495
the basic principles of 
these electronic measurements;

5
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:21,075
then we will see how to 
determine a distance, 

6
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:22,650
what is the method used, 

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,426
and finally,

8
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:27,441
what are the factors which
influence the quality of the measurement. 

9
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:31,001
<i>The principle of electronic measurements
of distances.</i>

10
00:00:32,263 --> 00:00:35,488
Firstly, we consider
the following device

11
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,303
with a theodolite having 
a distance meter

12
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:41,899
on which we have a transmitter

13
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,994
(written)

14
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:46,090
as well as a receiver. 

15
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:50,669
At the other end, we have a prism, 

16
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:54,155
placed on a cane, 
on the point of interest

17
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:59,740
and in between, we have waves that 
permit us to transmit a signal. 

18
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:04,313
One can determine here the path Go

19
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:07,450
then the path Back; 

20
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:12,784
the principle consist of measuring 
a travelling time...

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,156
(written...)

22
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:24,935
... of the signal between going

23
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:28,171
and coming back. 

24
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:34,301
Namely, 2 times the distance 
that interests me. 

25
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:41,756
The signal travels at 
the speed of light...

26
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:46,807
(written)

27
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:49,232
.... in this case, <i>C</i>.

28
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:53,740
Then, 2 times my distance

29
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,669
is equal to my delta t times 
the speed of light. 

30
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:02,980
We have here the value of this 
speed of light in vacuum, 

31
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,640
together with the refraction index 
that we apply for the atmosphere. 

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,227
The type of waves that we use 
are infrared waves

33
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:14,311
with this type of lengths

34
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:18,119
and gas lasers with here, 
also, 

35
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,837
these lengths expressed in nanometers. 

36
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:23,800
One can measure with these techniques, 

37
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,268
a few meters, tens of meters, 
hundreds of meters

38
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:29,088
for topography work

39
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:31,544
and for more important work, 

40
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:35,179
we can go up to several kilometers
or tens of kilometers. 

41
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:39,698
I invite you to reflect on the 
resolution of time measurements

42
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:42,280
for determining a distance. 

43
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:46,083
The first method of measuring
electronic distances

44
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,565
is a method called "by pulse". 

45
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:51,910
Firstly, we have carrier wave

46
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:54,255
of high frequency....

47
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:58,915
(written)

48
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:02,227
on which we will graft

49
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:04,662
a short signal, 

50
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,757
(written)

51
00:03:06,757 --> 00:03:08,852
that we call "pulse".

52
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:14,682
We see in this figure, 

53
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,830
this grafted signal on its carrier

54
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,928
that will go to the reflector, 

55
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:21,394
and return to the receiver,

56
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:26,044
and thus we will have a measurement of delta t

57
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,686
with the back and forth path. 

58
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,150
We can determine as follows: 

59
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:41,442
2 s as delta t
times the speed of light.

60
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:45,399
The second method of determining

61
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:48,008
is the measurement method 
called "phase shift".

62
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:52,607
We will use here the properties 
of the carrier, 

63
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:55,744
which had a wavelength here, 

64
00:03:55,744 --> 00:03:58,141
(written)

65
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:00,990
as can be seen in this figure...

66
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:05,416
and the principle consist of determining

67
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:09,672
a phase shift phi, 

68
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,983
between the transmitter and receiver.  

69
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:17,852
(written)

70
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:21,025
Measuring the phase difference
can be very accurate. 

71
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,944
However,  one 
problem remains to be solved, 

72
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:29,589
which is to determine the total number 

73
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,208
of the wavelengths

74
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:40,625
To resolve this ambiguity, 
we have the following solution, 

75
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:45,976
which consist of using the 
different wavelengths, 

76
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:55,575
with an initial length, here, 

77
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:57,564
lambda 2

78
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,030
which gives us a rough measure

79
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:07,599
and then a lambda 1 that 
permits us to get a fine measurement. 

80
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:13,274
The combination of these two observations
allow us to unambiguously determine 

81
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:18,366
the distance between the observer 
and the prism or reflector. 

82
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,996
To illustrate this principle, we take
an example here

83
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:24,102
with three wavelengths. 

84
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:27,446
First of all we have a rough measurement,  

85
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,862
with a measured phase shift, here phi 3

86
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,736
and for example here, 390 meters. 

87
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,509
We have an intermediate measurement here, phi 2

88
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:45,994
that will give us here,

89
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:50,694
93 meters. 

90
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:55,596
It remains to get the phase-shift 
measurement phi 1,

91
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:57,431
that is the fine measurement, 

92
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:04,269
with here, 2.84 meters.

93
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,586
It remains after to sum all the significant 
parts of these observations, 

94
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:19,249
namely 392.84 meters. 

95
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,726
We have thus our distance <i>D</i>

96
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:28,727
determined by the combination 
of phase observations. 

97
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,281
The electronic measurement of distances

98
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:34,165
will be influences by the 
atmospheric properties. 

99
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,074
Indeed, a change in 
temperature or pressure

100
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:41,926
will have an impact on 
the refraction index 

101
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:46,244
Here we have the Barrel and Sears formula

102
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:50,163
that creates a relation between 
pressure values

103
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:52,261
and temperature values, 

104
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:55,883
and that give here a correction, 
or a scale factor, 

105
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,755
expressed in ppm. 

106
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,840
We have on this chart on the right, 

107
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,880
the values of these correction factors, 

108
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,197
for example for a pressure 
of 900 millibars

109
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:12,228
and a temperature of 20 degrees, 

110
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:16,021
I will have 40 ppm of correction. 

111
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,416
40 ppm

112
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,339
(written)

113
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:24,544
that means 40 millimeters

114
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:29,465
for a distance of 1 kilometer. 

115
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:34,718
Please note that this formula is valid 
for one type of waves. 

116
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,920
Here, in this case,  
infrared waves. 

117
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:42,228
So, one must consult with the documentation 
of the measuring devices 

118
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,580
to find an adequate formula 
for the given wave 

119
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,619
of the device carrier. 

120
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:50,785
To illustrate this formula, 

121
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:53,024
we take here a small numerical example. 

122
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,629
We have measured a distance
of 1000 meters

123
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:00,150
with a temperature value of 20 degrees

124
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,753
and a pressure of 970 millibars. 

125
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:06,272
We can see here our 
chart at 20 degrees

126
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:09,395
and then 970 millibars, 

127
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:16,023
and we find here on the correction 
curve +20 ppm. 

128
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:19,353
So we can note here

129
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,035
+20 ppm

130
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:26,737
which corresponds to 
20 millimeters per kilometers

131
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:30,242
In this case, our corrected distance

132
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:36,034
will be 1000.021 meters. 

133
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:39,447
To summarize this part of the lesson

134
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:42,238
dedicated to electronic 
measurement of distances, 

135
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:46,091
it can be said that the properties 
of the electromagnetic waves

136
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:48,711
are used to determine these distances, 

137
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:53,777
mainly relying on infrared type of 
carriers or laser

138
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:59,061
and that these waves are influenced 
by atmospheric properties, 

139
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:01,567
namely the temperature and pressure. 

140
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:06,859
There exists formulas that allows for 
calculating a correction factor in ppm

141
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:11,660
and attention must be paid to the fact that, 
for each device, 

142
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,024
depending on the frequency, 

143
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:15,240
the formula will be different.
