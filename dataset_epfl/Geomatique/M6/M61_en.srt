00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:05,225
Hello!

2
00:00:05,225 --> 00:00:08,534
Welcome to this lesson
dedicated to measuring distances. 

3
00:00:08,694 --> 00:00:10,052
Measuring distances

4
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,964
is one of the fundamental 
problems of surveying.  

5
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:17,582
In this lesson, we will see 
first a short introduction, 

6
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:20,367
posing some questions 
with the notion of distances, 

7
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:23,641
which gives some historical background, 

8
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:27,585
then we describe the electronic 
method for measuring distances, 

9
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:33,471
and finally, we will address the fundamental 
problem with trigonometric leveling.

10
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:38,142
In this introduction, we will first 
ask some basic questions. 

11
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:41,369
Everyone has already measured 
a short distance

12
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:43,856
with a yardstick or a measuring tape.

13
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:46,505
When it comes to measuring 
longer distances, 

14
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:50,577
other methods should be used,
in particular electronic methods. 

15
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:52,824
Then we will ask

16
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:55,925
what are the factors that 
influence the measurements of distance: 

17
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:59,298
the physical factors,
but also geometric.

18
00:00:59,298 --> 00:01:01,812
And a fundamental question
we must ask, 

19
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:03,946
is "what type of distance?"

20
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:07,310
If I take my example here on the right, 

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,892
I can consider a horizontal distance
between the two lake sides, 

22
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:16,276
but I can also consider from 
this summit of the mountain

23
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,613
to the lake side, 
a slant distance. 

24
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:20,940
I have already two notions of distances. 

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,312
Then, if I take 
a small step back, 

26
00:01:24,932 --> 00:01:27,075
I can start asking myself the question:

27
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:30,177
"is a distance
necessarily straight

28
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:34,011
or do we have to take into account
the curvature of the earth?"

29
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,281
We will try to answer these questions

30
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:39,797
in this lesson dedicated
to measuring distances. 

31
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:43,675
Before addressing the electronic 
measurement of distances, 

32
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:48,853
we give a brief history of some 
principles of optical measurements

33
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:51,028
or direct measurement of distances.

34
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,860
We have in this example here, 

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,040
the measurements with a steel tape 
or with an Invar tape. 

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,335
These measurements are possible 
when we are near the objects.

37
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:11,923
In general, we make the measurements 
within a limited framework,

38
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:14,600
so it can be a small site,

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,902
it can be inside,

40
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:26,882
and in general we take
horizontal measurements.

41
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,261
To determine the distances,

42
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:38,959
surveyors used the optical concept  
of their measuring devices, 

43
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,271
namely, the theodolite or the level. 

44
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:47,776
In this figure, one can place
an observer with his theodolite, 

45
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:50,660
who look at a sight. 

46
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:57,649
I can measure an angle and determine 
a portion of the distance on the sight. 

47
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:04,346
I have a simple relationship, 
between the tangent of the angle

48
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:11,039
<i>α/2</i> that is equal to <i>(b/2)/S</i>,

49
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,719
<i>S</i> is the distance
I am trying to determine. 

50
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:24,495
So <i>S</i> will be equal to <i>b/2</i>
times the <i>cotangent of (α/2)</i>. 

51
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:28,486
In the optical principle
there are two approaches: 

52
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:33,016
when <i>b</i> is a constant, 

53
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:36,766
and <i>alpha</i> is measured, 

54
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:45,737
or when <i>alpha</i> is a constant, 
and it is <i>b</i> that is measured. 

55
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:52,618
The first method is the method 
called "stadia".

56
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:56,638
We have here the objective 
and what the operator can observe, 

57
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:58,786
namely stadia lines. 

58
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:04,837
We have here, a gap 
between two fixed lines, 

59
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:10,428
that means that <i>alpha</i>
is a constant in this case. 

60
00:04:10,428 --> 00:04:13,518
So we will determine the portion

61
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:16,655
intercepted by these 
two stadia lines

62
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:18,662
to determine the distance. 

63
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,663
The other method is called "parallax",

64
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:28,654
in which we measure the angle <i>alpha</i>

65
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:34,248
between the two sides of an Invar sight, 
the angle of 2 meters. 

66
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,604
For more details on these methods, 

67
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:42,392
you can refer to the handout 
that describes these methods, 

68
00:04:42,392 --> 00:04:46,273
which are practically no longer used
in surveying today, 

69
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:49,695
but that is good to review for 
historical purpose.
