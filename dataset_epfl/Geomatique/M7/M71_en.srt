1
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:09,002
Today we will address the
localization via satellites.

2
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:11,051
Plural!

3
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:13,107
We will see that we need several

4
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:16,072
and that at present their 
number is rapidly growing.

5
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:20,418
Everyone has already used
this technology

6
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:21,864
either driving or walking.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,127
Sometimes it happens
discretely,

8
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:28,106
for example for the following
of a training program

9
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,170
with the smartphone.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,694
But who really understands
how this works?

11
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:38,148
The success of GPS is amazing.

12
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:41,470
It's probably the military system
with the biggest impact

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,297
on civil activities.

14
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:45,863
If we look for a position: GPS.

15
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:49,679
To follow an itinerary by car: GPS.

16
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,438
By the way, we are talking about a GPS navigator, leaving

17
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:58,966
the road database and the visualization software
in the background.

18
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:02,809
Nonetheless, these components are essentials
to safely arrive.

19
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:07,691
The position is but one element
of a real service, it's not enough

20
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:11,109
to know what to do or where to go.

21
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:17,748
GNSS is a general term
trying to replace GPS,

22
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:20,367
which is seen as restrictive.

23
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:25,168
The various systems resemble each other
and their compatibility increases

24
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:30,769
which is shown here for GPS
and is also valid for other systems.

25
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:35,763
The GPS conception
dates in the fifties.

26
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:40,678
It's neither the first nor the only 
satellite localization system,

27
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:45,302
but during its deployment,
electronics and informatics

28
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:48,700
progressed so much
that the receiver market widened

29
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,093
beyond military
and science.

30
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:56,584
So it's the first system
which is spoken of so widely.

31
00:01:57,488 --> 00:02:01,640
This video concentrates
on some easy aspects

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,588
of channel communication,
especially of geometrics aspects.

33
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,009
For the system and signals
description

34
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,162
transparent statics
or tables and images

35
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:16,840
of the handout can be referred to.

36
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,636
It's often believed that GPS
presents an ideal solution

37
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:23,992
for all localization problems.

38
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:26,302
One needs to distinguish.

39
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:30,098
Satellite localization
doesn't work everywhere,

40
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:34,059
the positions are disturbed
if the sky is partially covered,

41
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:37,515
in forest, in the mountains or on the road.

42
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:41,729
Evidently, it's worse inside
of buildings or in a tunnel.

43
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:46,569
Here we see a diagram of the sky
above Sydney.

44
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:50,496
Depending on the layout of orbits

45
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,494
the satellites never pass by
above the poles.

46
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:59,506
The gap here in the South is also
the North of the Northern Hemisphere. 

47
00:03:00,572 --> 00:03:07,441
With GPS, we can make the point,
be located on the map or at sea

48
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:09,478
several tens of meters close

49
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:11,817
often a few meters close.

50
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:15,685
We can also determine
the displacement of a rock

51
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:18,347
up to a few millimeters

52
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:24,075
but with other receivers,
other signals and other procedures.

53
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:28,487
In summary, it's more complicated
and it's more expensive

54
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:31,534
around a hundred times more expensive.

55
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,786
Besides the application for the general public

56
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:36,187
there are market niches
for specialists.

57
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:42,461
A satellite is a known
point in space.

58
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:48,464
We'll note down the measured distance.

59
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:58,455
Our position has to be
on an arc.

60
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:05,240
We do the same with the second satellite.

61
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,283
Here's the second measured distance.

62
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,427
And here's the arc on which
we must find ourselves.

63
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:24,920
The intersection of the two arcs
gives the position sought-after.

64
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,568
Let's now suppose

65
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,870
that the distances have 
a small uncertainty

66
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,131
that can be represented by a strip

67
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:46,040
here for the second satellite.

68
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,018
And we'll do the same for the first.

69
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:01,593
We obtain an overlap region.

70
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:09,725
In general, these overlap
regions are represented

71
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,259
with an ellipse.

72
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,360
If the arcs intersect at a right angle

73
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,299
the ellipse becomes a circle.

74
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:23,725
Let's look at two other configurations.

75
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,257
First with a very narrow angle.

76
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:31,258
Here's the first satellite

77
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,960
with the measured distance,

78
00:05:42,197 --> 00:05:43,420
then the arc.

79
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:47,708
Let's take the second satellite now,

80
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,926
the measured distance

81
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:57,896
and the arc.

82
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:03,846
In this case the uncertainty
presents itself as follows.

83
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,586
The overlapping area
is much more stretched out than before

84
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:22,364
and the ellipse takes this shape.

85
00:06:25,878 --> 00:06:27,925
With a very wide angle

86
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,252
the situation is very similar.

87
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:45,595
Likewise, in this case 
the ellipse is very elongated

88
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:52,342
and the position determination
is very weak along its major axis.

89
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:58,305
Let's take up favorable bilateration again
and let's assume an error

90
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:00,040
on one of the distances.

91
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:05,744
The arc is displaced

92
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:10,620
and likewise the solution.

93
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:17,434
If the intersection of the arcs
is less favorable

94
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:22,212
the same error
causes the same displacement

95
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:29,301
of the arc but it also causes

96
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:32,643
a much larger
displacement of the solution.

97
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:37,632
Numerous errors
can affect the distance measurements.

98
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:40,975
One is inherent to the measurement procedures.

99
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:44,734
Unlike with terrestrial techniques

100
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:46,959
there is no reflector.

101
00:07:51,788 --> 00:08:00,011
The departure and arrival of the signal
are not measured with the same instrument,

102
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,989
so with the same clock.

103
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:08,958
The satellite emits a code
that has the departure time,

104
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:20,915
whereas the arrival time is determined
with the receiver's clock.

105
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:29,484
And so this shift is measured.

106
00:08:29,484 --> 00:08:32,795
Then one has to multiply the travel
time with the speed

107
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:35,548
of light to determine the distance,

108
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,898
even if a small synchronization error

109
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,156
can't be neglected.

110
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:43,314
The satellites have
atomic clocks

111
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,234
and the system synchronizes them
permanently.

112
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,783
So the shift from the receiver's

113
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:53,053
quartz clock is the same
with respect to all satellites.

114
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:56,567
It's as if one would measure
the distances with a tape measure

115
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:59,150
with a big knot

116
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:00,663
we would have lost the zero.

117
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:03,118
We speak of a pseudo-distance.

118
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:09,781
On this map, the constant bias
is a third unknown of the problem

119
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:12,963
in addition to the East and North coordinates.

120
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:14,865
To calculate the third unknown

121
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:20,334
we need at least three observations,
so three satellites.

122
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:25,264
The intersection doesn't necessarily
present itself as we would imagine.

123
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:30,776
We need to find the equidistant point
of the three arcs,

124
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:35,341
in this case it's here.

125
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,930
The same shift is applied
to the three arcs

126
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:45,761
which are shifted by the same amount.

127
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:59,889
It should be noted that generally
the solution is found

128
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:04,731
outside the triangle formed
by the three original arches.

129
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,346
The 3D passage doesn't present
any particular problems.

130
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:15,005
Simply, we have three unknown
coordinates and a clock error,

131
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,076
so four unknowns,

132
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:20,847
at at least four satellites
need to be observed.

133
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:26,201
Of course for a precise solution
some configurations need to be avoided :

134
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:28,968
typically that the satellites
are in the same plane.

135
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:33,326
This is obvious enough
for a meridian map :

136
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:37,071
the solution is well defined on the map,
but not outside of it.

137
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:46,363
A shift of the solution
outside the map

138
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:51,256
corresponds to a same shift
of each pseudo distance,

139
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:07,653
in this case a same elongation.

140
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:10,392
That means that the transversal displacement

141
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:14,142
is fully correlated
with the clock error.

142
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:17,090
Simultaneously, we cannot 
determine the two.

143
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,238
That's why in 
an urban canyon

144
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:24,952
the estimated position is often
located on a parallel road.

145
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,448
If the solution forms a cone
with the satellites

146
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:32,788
a displacement along the cone's
major axis corresponds

147
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:36,072
to the same bias of each pseudo distance.

148
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:47,380
The position, along the cone's major axis,
is fully correlated

149
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,600
with the clock error.

150
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,092
In this case, the altitude
and the clock error are inseparables. 

151
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:57,975
We cannot solve them simultaneously. 

152
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:04,773
It's similar for
the other two pseudo-distances.

153
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:08,821
Four satellites at the same height
on the horizon give a good position

154
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,113
on the map but
a very bad altitude.

155
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,030
It's not critical
if one navigates on the ocean.

156
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,225
In the mountains, where one receives
less satellites

157
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:20,324
it's better to have an altimeter.

158
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,279
The above is valid for the classical
GPS usage with code measurements

159
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,240
for a precision of a few meters. 

160
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,704
To obtain a precision
in the order of centimeters

161
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:36,457
phase measurements are used,

162
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:40,403
so the geometric interpretation is
significantly more complicated.

163
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:47,391
Some principles remain, in particular
that the measurements are unidirectionals.

164
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:52,524
These applications will be the object
of optional bachelor and mainly

165
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:55,214
master courses.

166
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:59,112
Satellites have revolutionized
localization.

167
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,231
Now the earlier terrestrial 
methods are applied

168
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:06,199
in areas that are less well known
but they will not disappear.

169
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,850
In contrary, they
are taught

170
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,501
within the context of a science history course

171
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:14,152
and not in a introduction
to geomatics course.

172
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:19,915
And now, I wish you lots of
fun in learning this field

173
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:24,007
in full fervour with the help
of other proposed media

174
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:26,107
in the context of this lesson.
