00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:07,574
Hello, welcome to this lesson
dedicated to cartography.

2
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,748
Cartography could be the topic
of an entire course,

3
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:14,007
but in this course
of geomatics elements

4
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,357
we will give an introduction,

5
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:19,029
talk about the different characteristics
of maps,

6
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:22,496
then we will discuss
the topic of semiology. 

7
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:26,759
The first topic to cover concerns
the characteristics of maps,

8
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:32,164
with the different types, the map quality
and the map components.

9
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:35,920
Before we discuss this topic,
we will look at a little example here

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,144
of a ground shot

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:43,888
that was made from this place,
of this little village here,

12
00:00:43,888 --> 00:00:47,872
we have this panoramic vue and
here on the map we can

13
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:50,861
observe different compartments,

14
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:55,202
the first that catches the eye
is this whole side here

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,486
this entire forest area,
which is well visible

16
00:00:58,486 --> 00:01:00,577
on the photo and on the map.

17
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:04,546
Likewise we have this part here,
constructed, a village,

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,746
that appears here
on this part of the image

19
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:13,340
and finally this whole countryside area

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,810
that's in the foreground. 

21
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:19,647
On this map we can see
a synthetic representation

22
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,316
with adequate graphics,

23
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:26,420
that facilitate the interpretation
done by the user.

24
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:30,878
To illustrate this,
I will let you look at an aerial vue

25
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:34,824
and a map for a few moments,
which correspond to this sector.

26
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:41,618
On this map we can see
different communication channels,

27
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:44,278
different types of paths 
and roads

28
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:47,140
that we can also locate
on this image.

29
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:53,146
Likewise we can see the constructed part,
as different isolated buildings,

30
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:56,450
and the part here, central, of the town.

31
00:01:57,542 --> 00:02:00,261
Likewise we also have vegetation,
which is represented

32
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:03,515
with its different types,
with orchards, here,

33
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:10,262
and with a separate forest
here in this region

34
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:14,467
Here we see the semiology approach

35
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:18,191
with graphics that allow
a direct reading

36
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:20,641
of the map elements.

37
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:23,133
After having introduced
a first map type

38
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,243
which is the topographic map,

39
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:27,809
we will see some examples
of thematic maps

40
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:29,774
like the choreographic map,

41
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,429
which represents
qualitative information,

42
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:36,810
the chorologic map, which allows
a quantitative representation,

43
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,061
contour maps and maps with
diagrammes and symbols,

44
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:44,498
finally we will present
a schematic example.

45
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:49,283
The first example is a map,
let's say choreographic,

46
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:52,900
here with a geological map
of Switzerland.

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,710
We see the different compartments,
here, of the territory,

48
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,326
with a color code
that enables to interpret

49
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:02,489
the different geological layers.

50
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,172
Effectively the legend is necessary
to understand this map well.

51
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:11,885
The second here is a chorologic map
with quantitative values

52
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:19,598
on the forest cover with
an expression in percentage

53
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:24,865
of the different values that are given
in this color scale,

54
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:28,179
and, the darker the green is

55
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:30,913
the more important the
forest cover is.

56
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:33,576
Here in the Jura region we
effectively see

57
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:35,870
we have the most important values

58
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,764
in terms of percentage
of forest cover.

59
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,345
The third example is
a contour map

60
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:46,623
which represent geoid undulations
on Switzerland's surface.

61
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:49,821
Here we have the different
contour levels

62
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:54,611
that represent the gap between
the ellipsoid and the geoid.

63
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:57,948
The last example is
a diagramme map

64
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:04,375
which presents the repartition
of the activities in the primary,

65
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:09,404
secondary, and tertiary sectors for each
Swiss canton.

66
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:14,179
Finally here we present
an example of a schematic map

67
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:18,857
with a very well known thing,
namely a public transportation network

68
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,303
which includes the 
different transportation

69
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,576
lines, the bus and the metro

70
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:29,071
with the names of stops
and the different nodes

71
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:32,599
which permit to transfer
from one light to another.

72
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:36,429
The quality of a map is given
by a certain number of criteria

73
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:38,418
which we will describe here.

74
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:41,327
The first that comes to mind is
the geometric precision

75
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:55,295
which is the difference between the elevated position
on the terrain, and the representation on the map.

76
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:03,436
First and foremost this precision depends
on the surveying method

77
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,140
and on the map's scale.

78
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:09,231
We can give a small example here

79
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:13,495
with the geometric precision 
of a centerline.

80
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:16,330
The second criteria is accuracy,

81
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,090
which is the compliance
with the survey specifications,

82
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:35,459
and as an example here we can take
the road classes.

83
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:44,456
Looking at the map we see
that we have a representation here

84
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:48,631
for the main road,
we also have the country roads

85
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:52,079
so the accuracy corresponds
to a good classification

86
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,545
of the communication paths.

87
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:58,145
The third criteria is 
completeness

88
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:06,066
namely are all the objects
completely represented?

89
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:10,325
Are no objects absent
for my map's content?

90
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:13,636
The following criteria is reliability,

91
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:21,455
we can summarize it as
the confidence one can have

92
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,712
in using the map.

93
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:33,292
And the main criteria is the updating
degree of this map.

94
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,019
The older a map is
the less reliable it is.

95
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:41,201
We can see it here on this small example
with the operation of a gravel pit,

96
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:45,143
it's expanded on this image

97
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:48,988
and on the map it isn't
yet represented.

98
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:55,903
The next criteria is legibility,
the content's perception

99
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:05,058
and here we will apply 
semiology rules

100
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:11,565
that we will specify in the
next part of the lesson.

101
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,079
The next criteria is selectivity, 

102
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,805
which is the capacity to distinguish
different object categories.

103
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:24,541
<i>distinction of object categories</i>

104
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:37,326
We see it on this example here,
with a dense forest here,

105
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:41,490
orchard areas or
isolated trees.

106
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:45,269
Finally the last criteria
is aesthetics,

107
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:47,182
which is a little more subjective

108
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:50,895
but which is also part
of map quality.

109
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:53,234
We'll recall the notion of scale here

110
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:56,382
which we have seen in the introduction
of the geomatics course.

111
00:07:56,912 --> 00:08:01,814
We'll recall here that a scale of 1:25 000
for example

112
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:07,226
means that 1 m on the map
corresponds to 25 000 m in the field.

113
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:11,358
Or that 1 mm corresponds to 25 m.

114
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:14,832
We'll also recall the 
generalization effect of maps,

115
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:18,081
as can be seen with the examples
of a map of 1:200 000

116
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,246
with this small perimeter,

117
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:26,453
which we find again here on the 1:50 000
and finally here on the 25 000.

118
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,176
I'll take an example of a road here.

119
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:38,142
In the field it has a width
of approximately 6 m,

120
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:48,360
on the map I can mesure
a road with of for example 0.5 mm

121
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:57,134
if I convert these 0.5 mm in 25 000
I'll obtain 12.50 m

122
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:01,665
and in 200 000 one hundred meters.

123
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:06,379
This values have got nothing to do
with the real size of the road

124
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:09,349
so here we have the generalization effect,

125
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:13,502
the road size was exaggerated
because they wanted to

126
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:19,358
show the communication paths
as important map elements.

127
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:22,462
What are the components
of a map?

128
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,021
For this we choose a good example here

129
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:29,167
produced by the cartography institute
of the ETH in Zurich.

130
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,905
We see a title on this map,

131
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:36,043
we find a scale on the map,

132
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:41,133
we find a legend
with different symboles and colors,

133
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:45,338
we have an orientation tool
with the direction of north.

134
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:48,948
We find diverse information,
data sources,

135
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:51,538
updating dates,
production dates,

136
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:54,128
here in this part of the map.

137
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:56,018
In other map types

138
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:58,703
there can also be
a coordination grid

139
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:02,369
or a synoptic overview of the area
in comparison to a more general map.

140
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:07,264
To end here we'll evoke
the conception and production of maps.

141
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:11,215
On this diagram we've got the representation
of different stages 

142
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:14,658
with the data part,
the topometric methods,

143
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:19,386
and next here the classical
production part, analog,

144
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:23,154
which next allows to draw
and reproduce the map.

145
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,234
The updating is directly done
in this loop,

146
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:29,293
between the production and
the complementary elements.

147
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:33,601
On this example here we see
the classical production,

148
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:38,209
the graphical product is
the central element.

149
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:51,985
The process here is a,
let's say analog, process

150
00:10:52,721 --> 00:11:00,653
even if there have been several evolutions
that have allowed to digitalize maps

151
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:04,364
and then to do the publishing work
on the computer.

152
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:11,007
As we can see here on this graphic,

153
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:14,951
where we have digitalized
the old map formats.

154
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:18,221
With the informatics evolution

155
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:21,091
the central element
of cartographic production

156
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,471
is a specialized data base

157
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:26,481
with a system
of geographical information.

158
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:31,693
So we have here our data base
and the graphical information system

159
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:41,905
which is the central element that will
rely on the data model here.

160
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:47,156
This will allow to directly
connect the survey part

161
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,253
that will feed this data base

162
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:53,613
and so also the updating process
of the data base.

163
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,666
From this data

164
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,239
we can produce the maps
with different numerical products

165
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:02,284
and also find 
the traditional way

166
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:06,324
of reprography and
of paper map production.

167
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:12,485
To summarize, this cartography introduction
has allowed to describe different examples

168
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:14,032
with different map types.

169
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:18,338
We have also looked at the different
criteria for map quality,

170
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:22,987
which are its components and, finally,
we have looked at some elements

171
00:12:22,987 --> 00:12:26,238
of the map production scheme.
