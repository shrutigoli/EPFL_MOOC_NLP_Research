00:00:04,388 --> 00:00:08,309
Hello, this part of
the cartography lesson

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,377
is devoted to semiology.

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,553
In the introduction we've seen

4
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:14,313
a certain number of examples

5
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:17,022
in which representation is well established

6
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:20,085
For the user, the lecture is easy.

7
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,690
It's neither chance

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,589
nor simply a question of esthetics.

9
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:27,062
Maps respond to
a certain number of rules

10
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:28,959
that are called semiology

11
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,933
and that we will describe in
this part of the lesson.

12
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,334
Here's a definition of semiology

13
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,671
with which we'll describe the principles.

14
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:40,943
Before that, we will stop
at this graphic example

15
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:43,314
With two questions that we can ask ourselves.

16
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:47,221
What do we perceive?
What draws our attention?

17
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:49,283
Looking at it a
little bit in detail

18
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,889
that multiple colors are used

19
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:55,759
that there are different shapes

20
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,868
that there is text

21
00:00:57,868 --> 00:00:59,923
that there are different orientation

22
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:02,331
there are symbols, a bunch of elements

23
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:05,232
and graphic codes that lead
to perceiving 

24
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,302
or to not perceiving
certain information.

25
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,340
We will itemize
these semiology rules.

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,303
To approach this semiology question

27
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:15,240
there's nothing better than an example.

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,558
We'll take the map of Switzerland here

29
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:20,347
with a statistic representation

30
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,657
of new buildings with housing.

31
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:24,615
The first question that we can ask ourselves

32
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:29,267
is: what information is transmitted?

33
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:40,228
On this map we can see that we already have
two types of information

34
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:46,807
namely by an absolute value:
the number of new buildings.

35
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,353
For example in Geneva we can see

36
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:50,809
that much has been constructed
in the big cities

37
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:53,447
like in Bern, in Zurich

38
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,301
and we have a second information

39
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,260
that's a relative information

40
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,392
expressed here as a percentage

41
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:05,551
namely the number of buildings
per 1000 inhabitants. 

42
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:09,029
In dark green we see here
with this color code

43
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:13,665
the zones where we've got a 
high rate of new housing

44
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,716
and if I take my example of Geneva again

45
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:18,837
we can see that here we have a very light green

46
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:20,623
so the rate of new housing

47
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:25,743
is relatively low even if
the absolute number is important.

48
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:31,583
With this little example, we already approach
two semiology rules or variables

49
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,725
namely color, with its gradient

50
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:39,210
and the dimension of an object to express
an absolut value.

51
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,293
The main variables 
utilized in semiology

52
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:44,398
were defined by Bertin.

53
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:48,607
On this figure here we can see
the six main variables

54
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:57,343
namely shape, size, value,
color, texture and orientation.

55
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,113
Shapes utilize symboles

56
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:07,194
that are either figurative or evocative

57
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:11,094
depending on whether we want to express
a class of particular objects.

58
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:17,466
Size permits
to variate the dimension

59
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:28,577
to express a value here
or a quantity.

60
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:33,345
There is also orientation

61
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:45,974
which is the symbol's direction
relative to the map's directions.

62
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:49,669
We should not forget that these elements

63
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,366
are represented on the map
with its coordinate axes.

64
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,300
Next we have the value

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:03,428
which actually defines the progression
of white towards a unit color

66
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:08,986
with different classes

67
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:12,052
and we have the following element
which is color

68
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,988
which is a little peculiar

69
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:20,871
because it appeals
to our physiological sensations

70
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,269
And, finally, we have the texture

71
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:34,920
which is a spatial organisation
based on individual elements.

72
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,354
as we can see in this example

73
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:54,324
with closely spaced lines
or with more or less widely space lines

74
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:57,254
to define different categories.

75
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:59,951
For the set 
of semiology variables

76
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,539
we have different properties

77
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:03,837
of which we'll summarize some here.

78
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,008
The first is differentiation

79
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:11,117
which allows to distinguish
different represented elements.

80
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:18,207
Next we have the order which is the hierarchy
that can be defined without any ambiguity 

81
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:39,707
and for this we can use
either size or value.

82
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,740
Here in this example we can see
with this legend

83
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,041
that we have different values, different shades of green

84
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,750
which effectively permit
to define an order.

85
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,757
Next we have quantity

86
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:57,595
which is the element's value

87
00:05:57,595 --> 00:06:03,797
but here, only the size permits
to define this quantity.

88
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:07,338
Here in this example we have
the use of a square

89
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:09,364
that allows the definition of different classes

90
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:14,773
and for each class
we associated a specific value.

91
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,609
Finally we have associativity

92
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:22,114
which allows the interpretation
of different related phenomena

93
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:40,475
and for this we'll be
able to use the value

94
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:50,882
with, for example, different
shades of red or of green

95
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:53,811
like we have here in this example.

96
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:57,584
Likewise we can use color

97
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,853
with different shades.

98
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:13,389
Finally, we can combine
these different variables of Bertin

99
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,553
for example by combining
size and color

100
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:20,114
as can be seen in certain examples.

101
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:23,243
To finish this 
semiology lesson

102
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:29,214
we'll take an example with
different representative elements here,

103
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:32,720
namely population density

104
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,021
and number of inhabitants.

105
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,991
On this map we can see
a division into neighborhoods

106
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:41,867
with a good fine-cut

107
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:45,165
and I'll let you to approach
this interpretation key

108
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:49,671
with different colors here,

109
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:54,774
used to classify density

110
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:59,248
and then the squares here
with their respective dimensions

111
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:02,881
to give the absolute
values of population.

112
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,181
Here's a second example

113
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:10,155
in which we take the unity
of the territorial divisions

114
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:12,759
as the district,
so a set of neighborhoods.

115
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,261
Effectively, as we have seen earlier

116
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,097
the division into neighborhoods
isn't necessarily ideal.

117
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:22,029
If we want to represent the
absolute population values here

118
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:24,604
we have many small neighborhoods
with only few inhabitants,

119
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,962
so with very small elements

120
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:31,006
and we can see that , if we merge elements by ward

121
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:33,666
We have a lecture that's also much easier

122
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,106
about the scale of Switzerland
and of a bigger territory.

123
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:39,089
So we end this
semiology component

124
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,443
and I'm sure that
the future readings of maps

125
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:43,982
will certainly be different

126
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:48,490
now that you have
different interpretation keys
