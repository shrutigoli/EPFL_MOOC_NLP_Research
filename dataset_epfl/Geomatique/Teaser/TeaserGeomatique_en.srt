00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,438
Hello, my name is
Pierre-Yves Gilliéron.

2
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:21,163
I am the main instructor
for the basic course in geomatics.

3
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:26,887
Hello, my name is Bertrand Merminod
and I am a professor in geomatics.

4
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:31,720
To be more precise, I head
the Geodetic laboratory :

5
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,691
the field measurements.

6
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:36,559
At some point, everyone has used
a topographic map

7
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,915
or a navigation system
to orient themselves or to find an address. 

8
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:46,928
These cartographic tools and materials
have been developed for centuries

9
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:52,741
by mankind, who has searched and explored
and has represented the world around him.

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,156
(Merminod) A map is
an accurate representation of territory

11
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,993
which has been the subject of a survey
with geometry instruments

12
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,949
such as the theodolite and the GPS receiver. 

13
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:08,750
Today, maps are available on
multiple computer programs.

14
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:11,197
For this, structured data
bases are necessary,

15
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:15,650
as well as geographical information systems
in order to process 

16
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,343
and visualize the results. 

17
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:20,109
Depending on the scale of the 
territory to map,

18
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:26,493
it is necessary to gain altitude and observe
from a drone, an airplane or a satellite

19
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:31,167
with image sensors and
with laser scanning systems.

20
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:35,663
The set of techniques,
of acquisition,  of management

21
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:40,321
and of representation of territory
data is called (geomatics).

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,487
Neither more nor less, it's the marriage
of geography and informatics. 

23
00:01:45,777 --> 00:01:47,973
Here are some application examples. 

24
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:52,542
First, there are the surveyor tools
that we find on a construction site

25
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:58,376
to implement construction works
and to control the stability of structures.

26
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:02,697
(Gilliéron) On the field, we have
several information layers

27
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:07,526
that everyone can consult,
thanks to the cartographical archives

28
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:09,683
maintained by public administrators. 

29
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:15,653
The last example shows the imagery
and laser scanning techniques

30
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:20,988
that allow the modeling of landscapes
and of towns over large areas.

31
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:23,623
In this basic geomatics
course

32
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:26,843
you will see the definitions
of coordinate systems

33
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:30,192
for the earth
and for the national maps.

34
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:33,919
You will learn
the basic surveying techniques

35
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,559
such as leveling,
the survey with theodolite and GPS.

36
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:43,413
You will have the opportunity to create a map
and to model the terrain elevations.

37
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:49,445
This course is addressed at students
who are starting in geomatics

38
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:53,262
and who intend to become
engineers or architects. 

39
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:58,649
(Gilliéron) Each of the eight weeks
contains three to six videos to watch.

40
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:03,061
Additionally, you will have specific
bibliographical resources available.

41
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,998
These resources should be looked 
at while watching the videos.

42
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:12,390
Each week a full exercise
and quiz will serve

43
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,233
as a basic knowledge control. 

44
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:18,463
We hope that we woke up
your interest for geomatics

45
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:22,552
and we very much look forward to 
welcoming you to this online course.
