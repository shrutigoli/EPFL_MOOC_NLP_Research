00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:05,099
Hello.

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,071
Welcome to this exercise part
on geometric levelling.

3
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:13,206
First of all we'll quickly revise
what the leveling principle is,

4
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:16,086
before solving the exercise step by step.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,360
So leveling consists of determining
a difference in levels

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,830
or a height difference between two points,

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,460
here A and B.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,830
I will place my level in the center,
in the middle of these points,

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,010
and on each of these points,
I can have a vertical sight,

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,190
and what will interest me,
is the height measurement here, rA,

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,370
so the rear reading,
and the front reading here, vB.

12
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:54,813
Delta h here being the rear reading,
rA, minus vB.

13
00:00:55,158 --> 00:00:57,248
If I come to my exercise now,

14
00:00:57,248 --> 00:01:01,698
I have quite a concrete situation
with this building.

15
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:07,718
Starting with a known altitude 
point here, a fixed point,

16
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:12,988
and via this path, I will be able to
determine the level differences

17
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:15,608
as well as the altitudes
of points of interest.

18
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:21,978
To visualize this scheme, I reproduce
my little altimeter element here

19
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:25,241
with the point 100, here,

20
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:30,134
and the point number 1 of the path,

21
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:35,938
knowing that I placed my
instrument in the middle here

22
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,838
with a rear reading, here, r100

23
00:01:40,838 --> 00:01:45,748
and a reading, here, front, v1.

24
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:51,628
So my first section here,
that would be my delta h here,

25
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:57,158
which would be the same as r100 minus v1,

26
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:03,378
which corresponds to this part, here,
of the path.

27
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:09,083
We'll now get to the calculation part
with the first step

28
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:15,893
where I have my station one, my station two,
with the rear and front readings.

29
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:21,718
The first section here gives me
a rear reading of 1,305,

30
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:24,908
a front reading of 1,502,

31
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,898
so I can calculate this difference

32
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:33,308
with here : negative 0,197 meters.

33
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:38,478
And for my second station,
a rear reading of 1,585,

34
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:41,928
a front reading of 1,283,

35
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:49,898
which will give me a level difference
here of 0,302 meters.

36
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,793
In this case here, I descended. 

37
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:56,053
In this case here, I ascended,
here, towards point two.

38
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:58,712
If I now sum up these two
height differences,

39
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:05,472
I'll obtain the altitude of point 2
with 352,257  meters.

40
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:10,303
I will go to the second step
with the calculation of point 10,

41
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:11,163
which is on the ground.

42
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:13,403
So the process is the same.

43
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:17,043
I carry my previously calculated
height differences over here,

44
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:20,519
so negative 0,197

45
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:25,665
and here, positive 0,302.

46
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:29,723
Now the height difference still
needs to be calculated with as rear reading

47
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:34,493
on the point 2, 1295 meters,

48
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:39,043
minus the front reading, 1,325,

49
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:45,453
which is the same as negative 0,030 meters.

50
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:48,173
Which gives me, if I sum up these
height differences,

51
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:55,393
a altitude for the point 10
of 352,227.

52
00:03:55,731 --> 00:04:01,151
I continue with my third step
to calculate the altitude here

53
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,561
of point 20,

54
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:06,401
which is located in the building's ceiling.

55
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:10,281
Si we start with
the altitude of point 10

56
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:15,461
and then we will sum up
the front readings,

57
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,831
which are a little bit particular
in this case here

58
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:22,931
because I have a front reading here
of the point 10,

59
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,741
which is equal to 1,325,

60
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:29,741
and a front reading, here, of the point 20,

61
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:34,871
knowing that the view is placed
towards the point on the ceiling,

62
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:38,461
which here is equal to 1,173.

63
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:41,506
So if I take my numeric
values up again here,

64
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:44,686
I have my altitude of point 10,
calculated earlier,

65
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:48,669
of 352,227

66
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:52,912
and my 1,325

67
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:57,806
and the 1,173

68
00:04:57,806 --> 00:05:03,756
which is equal to 354,725 meters.

69
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:11,108
Next, in the fourth step, I'm interested
in the ceiling's height,

70
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:17,238
that's to say from my point 20
up to my point 10.

71
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:19,668
I can, in this case,
take my altitudes

72
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:21,368
which I calculated earlier,

73
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:26,298
namely 354,725

74
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:31,308
minus 352,227,

75
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:37,608
and here I find 2,498 meters.

76
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:40,678
Evidently, if I take the sum
of the two readings

77
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:42,598
that I did with my instrument,

78
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:47,528
I'd likewise have 2,498 meters.

79
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:52,388
It's consistent so we checked
our calculations well.

80
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:58,043
We now pursue the path
in our building

81
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:01,613
continuing in direction
of the first floor

82
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:04,743
with the station three, here,

83
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:08,603
a front reading of the point three,

84
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:12,293
a station four with
a rear reading of the point three,

85
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:15,153
a front reading of the point four,

86
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:20,043
and a station five, here, with
a rear reading of the point four,

87
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:23,003
and a front reading, here,
on the point 30.

88
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:28,491
So we have a series of height 
differences in this part of the path

89
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,841
to be able to calculate, finally,
the altitude of the ground

90
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:34,791
floor, the point 30.

91
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:39,693
We'll now go over these height 
differences in detail

92
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:45,483
starting, here, with the altitude
of point 100.

93
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:50,852
We'll recall it here, 352,152.

94
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:57,508
Next, we calculated
the height difference 100 to point 1,

95
00:06:57,508 --> 00:07:01,264
negative 0,197.

96
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:04,820
Next, the height difference between 1 and 2,

97
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,826
positive 0,302.

98
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:13,038
The height difference between the 2 and 3,

99
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,219
which is equal to 1,295

100
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:21,020
minus 0,246,

101
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,582
wich is equal to 1,049.

102
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:29,597
The height difference between the point 3 and 4

103
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:34,207
which is equal to 2,324

104
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:38,507
minus 1,452,

105
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:43,427
which is equal to 0,872.

106
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,029
And finally, between the point 4
and the point 30,

107
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:51,897
we have 2,270

108
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:55,495
minus 1,371,

109
00:07:55,495 --> 00:08:00,533
which is equal to 0,899.

110
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:04,715
If we now take the sum
of all the height differences,

111
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:09,775
we receive 2,925 meters,

112
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:13,385
which I add to my initial altitude

113
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:16,301
and I obtain the altitude of point 30,

114
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:21,217
namely 355,077 meters.

115
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:25,245
We are now interested in step six,
in the slab's thickness. 

116
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:28,655
To know the slab's thickness,
we will take, in this case here,

117
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:30,185
the calculated altitudes,

118
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:34,805
so we see the meaning of these altitudes
with the altitude of point 30,

119
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:41,235
which we just calculated,
which is equal to 355,077,

120
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:45,305
and the altitude of point 20 that we 
calculated earlier,

121
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:51,345
which is equal to 354,725 meters.

122
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:58,112
The difference of the two gives us
0,352 meters,

123
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:00,952
which is our slab thickness.

124
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:06,932
In step seven, we are now
on the first floor

125
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:11,682
and we are interested
in the height under ceiling h1.

126
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:15,388
In this case here, we can directly
consider,

127
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,358
like with the lower floor,

128
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,828
the measurements that we made, here,
from the station five,

129
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:26,521
with the v40

130
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,634
and the v30.

131
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,539
Summing up these two values

132
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:38,834
we obtain 2,502 meters.

133
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:42,749
And the altitude of point 40,
which clearly would be

134
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,469
the altitude of point 30,

135
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:48,769
so 355,077

136
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,219
plus my 2,502,

137
00:09:54,319 --> 00:10:00,879
which is equal to
357,579 meters.
