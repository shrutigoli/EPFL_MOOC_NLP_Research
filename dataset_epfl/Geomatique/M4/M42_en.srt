00:00:04,663 --> 00:00:08,905
Hello, welcome to this part
of geometric leveling

2
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:11,891
where we will address a certain number
of definitions,

3
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:13,595
what is an altitude, 

4
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:19,658
and see the principle of measuring
with a level and a rod. 

5
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:23,772
The first definition that we will 
address is the true altitude;

6
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,223
what is an altitude? 

7
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:30,195
We have seen in the part that deals 
with Geodesy

8
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:32,947
the definition of a geoid; 

9
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:40,618
I remind you, the geoid is the
reference surface for altitudes,

10
00:00:40,618 --> 00:00:45,391
its a physical surface that depends
on the gravitational field.

11
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:51,819
Then I can draw 
a topographic surface

12
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:56,059
and the altitude is the distance measured 
by the vertical; 

13
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:59,840
if I consider her the point <i>A</i>,

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,815
I have my distance here along
the vertical 

15
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:09,459
is the altitude of point <i>A</i>, so 
the orthometric height

16
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,979
or true altitude, 
is this distance. 

17
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:19,348
If I consider here a point <i>B</i>,
I do the same exercise

18
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:27,747
I have my distance here <i>HB</i> that is the
true altitude at this point. 

19
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:30,781
What you should know is that the
gravitational field will vary 

20
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:39,149
so we will have here at point <i>A</i> a vector 
of gravity with its orientation 

21
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:45,913
and at point <i>B</i> I have another vector 
with its orientation

22
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:53,911
and the other orientations of these two 
vectors are not necessarily parallel, 

23
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,373
there may be variations
in the gravitational field,

24
00:01:57,373 --> 00:02:00,022
thus these variations 
must be taken into account

25
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:04,208
to have a rigorous model
of the altitudes.  

26
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:08,487
In the definition of the 
altimeter system

27
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:14,387
we have to go back to
what we call a fundamental point, 

28
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:18,178
in this case to define 
this mean sea level

29
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:22,685
we will use a tide gauge 
that will be placed on the coastline,

30
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:26,300
particularly, in this case,
in Marseille, 

31
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,653
and then we will use a method 
of measurement, 

32
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:31,660
in this case leveling, 

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,077
in order to propagate this horizontal
reference to the country.

34
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:43,539
This is what we did for Switzerland, 
where we went from Marseille, 

35
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:49,344
on a route along 
the Rhône valley 

36
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:54,314
to finally arrive here in Geneva

37
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:59,701
that is our fundamental point for 
the Swiss system.  

38
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:02,359
The third definition,
the geometric leveling. 

39
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:07,652
Geometric leveling is a direct 
measurement method for height differences 

40
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:10,236
that is also called vertical drop. 

41
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:16,446
This is a small example where 
I draw a topographic surface

42
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:24,975
and along this surface I will place
the vertical rods

43
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:29,370
that permits us to measure
the difference in levels. 

44
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:36,049
Between each rod, in a section here, 
I can draw a horizontal

45
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:45,071
and what interests me 
is the total of these vertical drops,

46
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:48,291
which will allow us to define
a height difference 

47
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:52,483
between two points of interest in the field.

48
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:56,847
The problem of altitudes, we have noticed,
depend on the gravitational field; 

49
00:03:56,847 --> 00:04:00,271
I redraw here my reference 
surface,

50
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:04,742
in this case the geoid, 

51
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:11,324
and the surface that interests me, namely,
the topographic surface here; 

52
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:17,462
and I place myself on two points of interest
here in the field, 

53
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:20,464
the point <i>A</i> here
and the point <i>B</i>,

54
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:25,784
and the problem I have is that we
are not on a common vertical

55
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:31,520
so the vertical at <i>A</i> and at <i>B</i>
is not necessarily parallel.  

56
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,781
I remind you here 
the gravitational field at <i>A</i>

57
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,727
and the gravitational field here at <i>B</i>.

58
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:47,210
Therefore the first assumption
to make our lives simpler, 

59
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,534
and this is often the case on 
construction site operations, 

60
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:53,666
or of the work across a neighborhood
or a city,

61
00:04:53,666 --> 00:05:01,773
is that the two surfaces here
passing through point <i>A</i> and point <i>B</i>,

62
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:05,887
so these surface levels,
are parallel

63
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:10,606
because we made an assumption that the 
gravitational field here is uniform

64
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:13,057
and that we are on the same vertical. 

65
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:17,029
We speak in this case of usual altitude, 

66
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:21,227
it is what we will use in most 
topometric work. 

67
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:27,167
The usual altitude, is based on a 
fundamental point, as we have seen, 

68
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,007
it is the point that is attached to the
mean sea level,

69
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,042
we have here materialized in Geneva
at "Pierre du Niton". 

70
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:40,090
a base point, as a reference, 
for our Swiss altitude system. 

71
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,613
The altitude system consist of, 
as seen on this map, 

72
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:48,808
this is not the roads but in fact 
it is the leveling paths

73
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:52,537
that have been made across the country
on the federal level,

74
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:56,834
so we have here a series of paths with 
points which are documented

75
00:05:56,834 --> 00:06:00,555
where we find information 
about the altitude. 

76
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:03,823
We talk here of an altimetric network.

77
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:08,748
The reference frame was defined
early in the twentieth century, in 1902, 

78
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:12,545
and it is called the Federal leveling, 
NF02, 

79
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:15,819
and it is effectively connected 
to this "Pierre du Niton"

80
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:18,996
as a horizontal reference 
for our country. 

81
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:23,176
I will remind you that it is a 
non rigorous system, 

82
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:27,587
the gravitational field influence 
the leveling measurement. 

83
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,069
We will stop now
for a small quiz

84
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:35,475
where we will look at two different
paths across Switzerland.

85
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:39,521
We will leave here in Lausanne

86
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:44,927
and we will do a first route 
along the plateau 

87
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:49,137
to reach Zurich. 

88
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:52,909
We will consider a second path

89
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:59,237
that will go through the Valais,
through the Alps, the canton Uri, 

90
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:01,928
and also reach Switzerland. 

91
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:03,816
The question that arises here is

92
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:18,045
is the <i>ΔH</i> between Lausanne and
Zurich across the plateau, 

93
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:23,554
or across the Alps, 

94
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:27,228
is this <i>ΔH</i> equal?

95
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:30,695
That is the question that is posed 
in this quiz. 

96
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:36,248
In 1995 Switzerland upgraded
its national Geodesy, 

97
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:40,687
in particular a rigorous system 
was defined for altitudes, 

98
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:47,493
namely the system <i>RAN95</i> which is
the new national altimetric network. 

99
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:51,019
It is a rigorous orthometric 
system,

100
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:57,179
so the altitude measurements according 
to the theory of potential gravitational field.

101
00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:00,286
We apply to the raw leveling 
measurements

102
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:03,879
the orthometric corrections

103
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:09,673
and we have now a perfect model 
for our altitude in Switzerland. 

104
00:08:09,673 --> 00:08:14,823
If we now compare the model 
defined in 1902, <i>NF02</i>,

105
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:16,339
with this new model, 

106
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:20,349
we have the following map
which shows these differences. 

107
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:26,061
We can note in the
plateau region, 

108
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:29,142
so here in this area, 

109
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:34,335
I see that the altimetry differences 
are near zero 

110
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:36,953
or a few centimeters; 

111
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:42,368
in contrast if I go to the
Alp region

112
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:47,620
where the geoid is more disturbed 
by steeper slopes,

113
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,242
and well, in this case, I see that 
I may have these differences

114
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:56,273
between the two models
up to 40-50 cm. 

115
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:58,574
So these elements are
now documented

116
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:04,434
and we have a rigorous network 
of altitudes for Switzerland. 

117
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,174
When talking about documentation, 

118
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:10,792
each of the points along the federal 
and cantonal leveling, 

119
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,665
is documented in the records
in which

120
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:17,763
we will find a certain number 
of information, 

121
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:21,018
namely, identification of the point, 

122
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:25,909
we have its region, we have a number 
corresponding to the national map,

123
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:31,303
then you will obviously have 
the approximate coordinates

124
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:34,380
to situate the point on a map; 

125
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,010
associated with this, you have a photo 
that can identify this point in the landscape 

126
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,295
in this case here, at the foot of a building, 

127
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:46,291
we have an indication of
the materialization,  

128
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,694
in this case a pin

129
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:52,487
that was realized by the Federal Office 
of Topography

130
00:09:52,487 --> 00:10:00,260
and we obviously have the value of 
the altitude here in the system  <i>NF02</i>

131
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,642
with an estimated precision here 
of 3 millimeters. 

132
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:07,159
We also see in this record

133
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,183
that there are regular updates and
the controls here

134
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:15,728
of these altitude points, which are 
made by the Federal Office of Topography. 

135
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:18,715
The measuring principle: 

136
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,478
to be able to measure with the level, 

137
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:24,053
it is necessary that the line of sight
is horizontal. 

138
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:30,699
We remind you here that the spirit level
used to calibrate the level, 

139
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:35,707
we have here the guideline; 

140
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:41,704
once the bubble is in the upper portion 
of the tube, 

141
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:48,912
the tangent in this upper portion
here gives the guideline. 

142
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:54,285
If the level is adjusted, this guideline
will be parallel to the line of sight 

143
00:10:54,285 --> 00:11:00,497
and thus enable us to make measurements 
on an horizontal plane.  

144
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:03,902
The measures is done on the staff; 

145
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:06,792
the graduations of the staff are as following:

146
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:11,408
you have first the meters,
the decimeters

147
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:17,343
and then the centimeters that are given here
by the small black and white markers. 

148
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:24,277
The millimeter will be estimated by eye with 
a precision of plus or minus one millimeter.

149
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:32,316
In this example here, we can say
that we have one meter, 

150
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:36,620
we have two decimeters

151
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:43,063
and we can count the number of 
centimeters starting from here to here

152
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:47,575
and we have seven centimeters,

153
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:53,650
and the estimation of millimeters we
give here is about eight millimeters,

154
00:11:53,650 --> 00:12:00,557
so that the height reading
is 1,278 meters.

155
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:05,740
The measurement principle is as following: 

156
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,127
you have the level that is placed 
here in the middle of the range, 

157
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:12,923
between point <i>A</i> and point <i>B</i>,

158
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:16,099
on point <i>A</i> we place a vertical rod

159
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:18,736
we will make a so-called back reading,

160
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:24,687
then this rod will move with its
operator to point <i>B</i>

161
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:27,162
and we will make a front reading; 

162
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:32,664
here we define a direction of measurement 
and direction of travel, 

163
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:37,394
that will give an indication 
of the height difference

164
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:41,100
+ if we ascend, - if we descend 

165
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,394
and height difference is, as
we have already shown, 

166
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:49,664
the difference between the back reading 
and the front reading. 

167
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:52,536
Now if we place it in 
the context of a path, 

168
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:57,241
we will move on to a known point 
in altimetry, for example,  

169
00:12:57,241 --> 00:13:06,112
and make a series of spans here
until reaching the point <i>B</i>

170
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:09,682
and the sum of these height differences

171
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:12,594
will give us the difference in elevation
between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> ;

172
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:17,191
so we have here in the first section 
a <i>Δh1</i>,

173
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:21,754
in the second section you have
a <i>Δh2</i>, etc.,

174
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:26,361
to finish at <i>Δhn</i> and terminate
at the point <i>B</i>,

175
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:30,485
and the sum of these differences 
of level or vertical drops

176
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:34,691
give the height between 
point <i>A</i> and point <i>B</i>.

177
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:39,064
For the field operations of a 
geometric leveling routing

178
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:41,730
we generally use 
the following formula

179
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,200
where we see 
the different points

180
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,535
with the back readings and 
the front readings,

181
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:51,547
that we have here in a first span, 

182
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:56,192
and we will directly calculate 
the difference in level with its sign,

183
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:58,337
it helps the along a path

184
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,108
to sum these differences of level
positive and negative  

185
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:08,304
and finally have the height difference 
along this section of the path.

186
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:12,194
To summarize this part dedicated
to geometric leveling 

187
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:15,635
we have seen a certain number of 
definitions of altitudes:

188
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:19,185
the usual altitudes, 
orthometric altitudes,

189
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:21,656
so an update of our system 

190
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:24,311
that takes into account 
the gravitational field, 

191
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:28,464
and we have seen the principles with
the description of the level,

192
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:31,733
the description of the staff on which 
we make a reading

193
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:34,748
and the principle of the path. 

194
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,124
I invite you to see

195
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:39,283
the different videos shot 
on location

196
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:43,991
that illustrate and complete these 
theoretical principles.
