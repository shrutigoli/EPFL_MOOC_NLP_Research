00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,796
Hello!

2
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:06,682
This part of the lesson

3
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:11,520
about geometric leveling
is dedicated to traverse.

4
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:13,627
What is traverse?

5
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:16,657
Traverse consist 
of measuring height differences

6
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:19,077
between benchmarks.

7
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:25,317
For example, we will pick here
a mark A, with known altitude, 

8
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:30,547
and we have here, at the center, 
a construction site

9
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:34,007
which is not equipped
with elevation points

10
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:38,057
and we are therefore interested in
getting the elevations for this region. 

11
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:40,647
So we will traverse, 
and we will measure the height differences, 

12
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:43,587
through the area of interest here

13
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:48,827
and thus densify the altimetric 
points in the region of interest. 

14
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:53,697
It can also be used to 
monitor an unstable zone

15
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:58,987
in which we will position the 
benchmarks for control.  

16
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:00,527
The types of traverses. 

17
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,757
We have many types of traverses.

18
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:06,957
The first type consist of making 
back-and-forth measurements. 

19
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:09,860
We start here at a point A

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,843
and we will go to a point B. 

21
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:19,777
So these are the benchmarks
we have on our path here

22
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:21,437
between A and B. 

23
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:26,957
We have first a direction of the
traverse that permits us to determine

24
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:32,637
a height difference <i>delta H</i> from A to B,

25
00:01:32,637 --> 00:01:35,506
and when returning, 

26
00:01:35,506 --> 00:01:39,935
we have a <i>delta H</i> from B to A.

27
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:47,334
Taking into account the direction of these height differences, 
if I take the sum of <i>delta HAB</i>

28
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:54,430
plus <i>delta HBA</i>, I theoretically obtain zero, 

29
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,146
here I will obtain a deviation 

30
00:01:57,656 --> 00:02:03,044
and this deviation must be relatively small, 
in this case a few millimeters

31
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:05,664
for a leveling of the construction site. 

32
00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:10,822
Another way of traversing
consist of relating

33
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:12,822
two known points in altimetry. 

34
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:18,742
I have here a point A, 
of which I know the elevation HA, 

35
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:24,652
and I have here a point B, 
of which I know the elevation HB. 

36
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:28,225
So I have here a difference in elevation, 

37
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:31,524
a <i>delta HAB</i>

38
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:37,123
that is known through documentation
of the leveling benchmarks. 

39
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:41,572
So I will walk between these points
and I have a traverse

40
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:46,961
that will give me a <i>delta HAB</i>

41
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:50,200
that is measured, 

42
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,741
that I will compare
to my delta HAB which is known, 

43
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:01,981
and again, if the difference between 
the two height differences is consistent, 

44
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:06,221
at this moment I can validate the elevation
of my intermediate points. 

45
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:10,212
The last example is 
the closed traverse. 

46
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:13,182
In this case, we are in a zone 
where we don't have access

47
00:03:13,182 --> 00:03:15,802
to the benchmarks.

48
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:20,972
It may be at the bottom of a pit for example,
where we have here a benchmark,

49
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:26,562
that is well defined, 
and we will do a loop here, 

50
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:31,495
that means to densify the altimetric 
points in the area of interest, 

51
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:35,005
and return here to this base benchmark. 

52
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:37,575
So here, the <i>delta H</i>

53
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:41,509
of my loop, 

54
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:47,802
is theoretically zero. 

55
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:52,432
So I can also control my height difference 
measurements with this principle. 

56
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:56,084
This last table summarizes the three 
principles we have seen, 

57
00:03:56,084 --> 00:04:00,784
namely the traverse back-and-forth, 
the connected traverse, 

58
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:05,044
so at the two known points, 
and finally, the loop

59
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,194
that close at the starting point. 

60
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:10,778
You will now be able to see 
a video

61
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:14,738
that illustrate this principle of 
traverse outside

62
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:18,428
with an apparatus 
and the measuring device. 

63
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:22,306
Leveling. Traverse, 
measuring and calculating the height differences. 

64
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:24,726
Located between the first two 
points of the path, 

65
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:27,236
the operator adjust the level 
then aim the leveling staff. 

66
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:30,798
The operator place the staff at 
the starting point of the traverse

67
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:34,798
materialized by a bolt
that is a fixed point of known elevation. 

68
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:37,963
The operator make a 
backsight to point A.

69
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:40,384
The measurement is 1,126 meters. 

70
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:45,376
Then, the operator moves to 
the first intermediate point. 

71
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:49,736
The operator simply turns
the scope of the instrument a half turn. 

72
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:55,218
This point is not materialized, 
so one resorts to the use of a change-plate

73
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:57,528
giving us a temporary benchmark.

74
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:03,527
The operator place the rod at the head 
of the change-plate and keep it upright. 

75
00:05:05,414 --> 00:05:08,564
The operator proceed with a
foresight to this point.

76
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,720
The measurement is 1,578 meters. 

77
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:19,889
This time, the rod is stay in place and 
it is the operator that install the level

78
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,319
in the middle of the range between the
first two intermediate points. 

79
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:27,304
The operator turns the rod
to face the instrument. 

80
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:31,917
The operator must re-calibrate the level 
before the backward sight

81
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,947
to this point is made.
 

82
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:45,826
It is again the operator 
that move to the next point

83
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:48,006
with the rod and the shoe. 

84
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:03,473
The operator do a forward sight
to the second intermediate point. 

85
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,411
The traverse continues then 
with the principle of the 

86
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,121
back and front reading. 

87
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,716
The measurements taken 
permits to calculate 

88
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:21,806
the difference in elevation 
between two points. 

89
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:25,897
For example, between the starting point
and the first intermediate point, 

90
00:06:25,897 --> 00:06:31,237
this difference is expressed in the 
back reading to point A, 1,126 meters, 

91
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:36,207
minus the front reading to 
point A, 1,578 meters. 

92
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:41,616
This gives a height difference of 
a little under 0.452 meters.
