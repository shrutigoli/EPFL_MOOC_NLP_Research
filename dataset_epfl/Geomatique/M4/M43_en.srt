00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:05,042
Hello!

2
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:09,457
This part of geometric leveling
is dedicated to control the level. 

3
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:13,049
The level control 
is an important operation

4
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:17,314
which is carried out before a construction
or before topographic work

5
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:21,391
to ensure that the level 
is set correctly.

6
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:26,151
Indeed, there may be 
parallel defects

7
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:30,950
between the guideline of the spirit level
and the line of sight. 

8
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,149
We can draw the following diagram: 

9
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:40,392
with a level here, 
placed on its tripod, its scope, 

10
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:47,953
and I have here my axis
which should be horizontal

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,681
and I draw here my directional line

12
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:54,799
with a small parallel defect

13
00:00:55,499 --> 00:01:00,382
that I note as angle <i>i</i>

14
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:04,616
that characterize this defected adjustment. 

15
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,712
In order to avoid a defect 
in the level settings, 

16
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:15,647
we will use the following principle:  
we ensure that the spans are equal

17
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,715
that means that the distance between 
the level and the front rod

18
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:23,954
is equal to the distance 
between the level and the rear rod.

19
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:30,679
If this condition is respected, 
we have a reading on the rear rod

20
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,322
which is equal to the value <i>r</i>
plus a small error <i>Δr</i>

21
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:39,941
which is the contribution
to the defected adjustment. 

22
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:44,312
I made the observation on the front rod: 

23
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:50,452
I have  <i>V+ΔV</i> with my small 
adjustment error. 

24
00:01:51,082 --> 00:02:00,181
If I have spans that are equal, the
contribution from my angel <i>i</i> will generate

25
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:05,629
a <i>Δr</i> will be equal to <i>ΔV</i>,

26
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:10,809
so when I calculate 
the difference <i>Δh</i>

27
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:15,990
as <i>r-v</i>, my errror
will be eliminated.

28
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:20,956
The procedure of level control
is an operation that must be made 

29
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:24,078
before any important
topographic work. 

30
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:31,020
So it can detect an excessive 
adjustment defect, because the spans

31
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:35,315
is not always equal according
to the topography of the field.

32
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:40,594
If this is the case, we must be able
to adjust the level, and it is this procedure

33
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:43,505
that permits us to do this.

34
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:47,328
It is described here in a video
that was shot on location, 

35
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:51,913
and that shows you in detail how 
to proceed to do this control 

36
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:55,650
and to assure proper adjustment of the instrument. 

37
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:02,883
The level control of the construction site
occurs between two points. 

38
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:07,842
The operator place the level in the middle 
of the section, the wedge, and then performs

39
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:12,535
the measurements on the leveling rod: 
first a backsight towards point <i>A</i>

40
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:16,471
rA1=1,126m

41
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,738
Then the operator moves over to 
the 2nd point, point <i>B</i>

42
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:30,105
The operator can then make a 
front sight: VB1 = 1,578m


43
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:35,277
Then, the rod remains in place, during 
which the operator approach the level.

44
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:42,369
He fix again the instrument, before continuing 
with the other measurements. 

45
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:51,407
He proceeds with a new foresight towards
point <i>B</i> : VB2=1,210m

46
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:57,392
From this station, he also performs a
backsight towards point  <i>A</i>

47
00:03:57,406 --> 00:03:59,932
after the operator has moved the rod 

48
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,168
rA2=0,759m

49
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:11,284
The procedure of level control permits
to highlight a defect

50
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,854
horizontally to the line of sight and 
consist of calculating the closing distance <i>w</i>

51
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:19,014
1st situation: the ranges are equal.

52
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:23,445
The horizontal defect is identical
to the front and rear measurements. 

53
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,797
As a result, 
the error can be eliminated

54
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:30,439
by calculating the difference <i>rA1-VB1</i>

55
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:33,332
so we get a height difference without error. 

56
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,354
2nd situation: the level is close
to one of the rods. 

57
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:38,808
For the foresight, 

58
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:42,238
we make the assumption that the 
horizontal defect is negligible

59
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:44,428
because the rod and instrument are close. 

60
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:47,965
In contrast, the long distance separating
the rod and the instrument

61
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:50,904
at the backsight
will affect the measurement error

62
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:52,569
if the level is set incorrectly.  

63
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:55,923
However, we can compute 
a value for <i>rA2</i>

64
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:58,025
as a function of the 3 first measurements

65
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:01,518
where the influence of the 
horizontal defect is negligible. 

66
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:04,726
Finally, the closing distance <i>w</i>

67
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:08,455
is the difference between the
calculated and measured value of rA2. 

68
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:11,224
For leveling a construction site, we consider

69
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:15,214
the setting is good if <i>w</i> does not exceed
the tolerance level of 5 mm.
