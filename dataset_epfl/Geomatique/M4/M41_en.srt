00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:05,711
Hello. 

2
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:09,711
This lesson is devoted to 
geometric leveling. 

3
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:13,466
Geometric leveling is a
topometric method

4
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:20,086
that can be used on the construction site, 
the construction, 

5
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:26,756
that can be used for 
supervision, 

6
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:31,136
structural monitoring, 
and also for all the work

7
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:35,346
of measurement, 
whether it is the parcel measurement

8
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:38,349
or the national measurement. 

9
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:43,959
With geometric leveling, 
we treat the problem of altitudes,..

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,260
which is a fundamental dimension
for topometry. 

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:58,360
You see in this image a altimeter benchmark
with a measurement rod

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,900
that we will discuss later.

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,470
The principle of geometric leveling.

14
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:10,092
You have for example a field, 
which I draw here, 

15
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:14,392
and two points of interest where we want
to determine a height difference between these points.

16
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:18,242
We have here an initial point,
which is the point A, 

17
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:21,252
here we have point B,

18
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:27,502
and on the vertical of these points, 
I can draw here a straight line...

19
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:33,953
materializing this vertical
on A and B. 

20
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,870
Then, I can define a horizon,
somewhere here, 

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:46,040
a horizontal line, 
and if I am able to measure

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,150
the height from point A...

23
00:01:54,105 --> 00:02:00,205
and the height here from point B,
the height difference, 

24
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:09,055
so the Î”HAB will be 
my hB minus hA.

25
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:14,603
To achieve this, I will use
a leveling rod

26
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:17,733
that will be placed here 
on the vertical of point A, 

27
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:24,053
respectively to the vertical of point B, 
and to determine the measurement, 

28
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:28,873
I will use a level
that I place here at the center

29
00:02:28,873 --> 00:02:36,563
with a spotting scope and
a tripod to be able to put it down. 

30
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:42,014
Thus I have the measuring device
that permits me to determine

31
00:02:42,014 --> 00:02:46,014
the height difference between point A and B. 

32
00:02:46,014 --> 00:02:48,764
In this lesson, we first 
look at the definitions, 

33
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,684
what is an altitude?

34
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:55,704
Then, we look at the principle 
of measuring with a level

35
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:59,594
and one part is also devoted to
control of the device. 

36
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:02,514
And finally, we will address
the issues of tracking,

37
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:05,874
how to concretely
on a construction site

38
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:11,294
or between a point of interest and another
are we able to measure the height differences

39
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:13,554
to determine the altitudes. 

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,750
Before addressing these issues in detail, 
let us look at the equipment

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,630
and the device we use 
to make these measurements. 

42
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:26,667
Firstly, we have the level
itself

43
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:31,027
which is a scope with 
an optical axis here, 

44
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:36,817
there is a lens, an eyepiece, 
there is a reticle in the center

45
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:41,137
realizing the 
center of the optical axis, 

46
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:46,797
and the scope is placed here 
on a base that is equipped

47
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:51,657
with leveling screws in order to
horizontalise and adjust the level. 

48
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:57,366
To measure, we will use 
a leveling rod here, 

49
00:03:57,366 --> 00:04:00,376
with a graduation
that will be explained later, 

50
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:04,566
which enables us to measure the heights
relative to the point of interest 

51
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,233
to the millimeter.

52
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:12,113
For geometric leveling, 
we arrange the level and the rod, 

53
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:15,193
and we will describe here 
the different parts of the level. 

54
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:18,169
We have first, in the lower part, 

55
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,419
a base that rests on 
the leveling screws. 

56
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,089
On this base, 
we have a spherical bubble

57
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:28,379
and by the help of the screws 
we are able to adjust the base, 

58
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:34,949
that means creating a horizontal plane 
that the level rests on. 

59
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:42,289
The level is composed of a scope
with a lense here, an eyepiece

60
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,480
and a reticle that create 
the line of sight.  

61
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,170
On the level, or within
depending on the model,

62
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:57,000
we have a bull's eye level that enable us
to make a precise wedge of the axis of sight

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,810
so that it is horizontal 
and allows reading on the rod here

64
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,390
on the vertical rod.

65
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:08,348
The level. 
Presentation of the instrument. 

66
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:14,788
Here is the base, the leveling screws
that there are three off.

67
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:19,783
The horizontal circle for
fast measurements of direction. 

68
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:24,825
The scope that pivots around
the principle axis. 

69
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:30,861
The Bull's eye level 
for rough levelling. 

70
00:05:32,196 --> 00:05:34,006
The line of sight. 

71
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:38,888
The adjustment screws
for sharpness of the reticle. 

72
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,971
The screw for focus. 

73
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:52,764
And the screw for a lateral displacement
at the end of the line of sight.

74
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:58,644
You will now see a small video
of an outdoor workshop

75
00:05:58,644 --> 00:06:02,894
that presents a practical 
stationing of the level. 

76
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:06,894
Leveling. Setting up the level 
and reading of the measurement rod.

77
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,818
Firstly, the operator place the level 
on its tripod

78
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:15,428
then brings it halfway
between the two points to be leveled. 

79
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,831
Here, they are are the two first points 
of a traverse,

80
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:22,831
a bolt and an intermediate point
materialized by a armchair. 

81
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,070
In parallel, the operator place the measuring 
rod on the first point to be measured. 

82
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,916
Then, the operator proceeds to calibrate 
the equipment. 

83
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,516
The rough calibration is done using 
the foot-screws 

84
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:42,276
that allow to place the spherical bubble into his markers.

85
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:48,988
On this level, the fine calibration is assured
by a compensator.

86
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:52,201
The level is now ready for use. 

87
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:55,701
The operator also stabilize the rod 
vertically if possible 

88
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:58,071
through a spherical bubble.

89
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:03,177
The operator aim the rod, 
do the focusing

90
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:05,537
and sets the sharpness of the reticle. 

91
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,606
He then proceeds to the measurement.
