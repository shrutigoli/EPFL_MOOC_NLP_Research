00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,930
Hello and welcome to the course n°4 dedicated
to hydrostatics. During this chapter,

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:16,240
we will start by recalling the notion
pressure within a fluid then we

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,700
will see subsequently the law of
hydrostatics or Pascal's law which is used

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,630
to calculate the pressure distribution
within a fluid. We will also see

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:32,369
Archimedes' principle used to calculate
the total force of pressure, it is a result 

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,739
that is in general used to obtain much
faster than Pascal's law the desired

7
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,039
result but it is a result that doesn't
apply to all cases. We will finish

8
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,579
this chapter with a application example which
is an extremely interesting example and

9
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,399
extremely important as it concerns the
computation of the pressure forces exerted by

10
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,809
a volume of water on a vertical wall, for example
what occurs for a dam. As

11
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:05,170
usual, we start by a little
warm up quiz. Let's consider

12
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,360
an aquarium and we have at our disposal 
3 coins, these three coins are

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,670
located at a depth h, the first 
one is place horizontally, the second

14
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,860
coin is placed vertically,
the third one is placed

15
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,680
at 45°. The question is to know, for which
of these coins the pressure force is maximum

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,990
? Second question,a little more difficult
and that will require a little more reflection,

17
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,490
let's consider a table, so a
solid substrate, impermeable and that we put

18
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:45,750
on this table an object, say a brick,
and that we are looking to compute the force that

19
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,330
we need to apply to put into motion this
brick, a horizontal traction force.

20
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,460
In the first case, we are working in open
air, in the second case, we will immerse

21
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,479
the system in water. In one case where
there is no pressure force apart from the

22
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,260
atmospheric pressure force, in a
second case there is a pressure force which

23
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:13,260
is the pressure force of water, of a 
depth h, that will in addition be applied on 

24
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,870
the brick. The question is to know for
which of these configurations the pressure

25
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,769
force, the traction force, that must be
applied on the brick is maximum. Before

26
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:31,769
starting, we have to go back on some
basic notions of what a pressure is.

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,400
In the case of a gas, we have seen in chapter
1 kinetic theory and we have explained

28
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:44,849
that a gas is composed of molecules that are
permanently agitating and these molecules

29
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:51,549
will collide. If we place a wall,
we will have collisions of molecules

30
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:58,549
on this wall. These collisions will generate
a flux of momentum which is 

31
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,579
responsible of a force that we name pressure.
Kinetic theory tells us that pressure

32
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:10,430
is linked to the agitation velocity of
molecules squared, it is linked to

33
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:17,010
the molecules' mass and to molecules' number
per unit volume thus to the number of densities.

34
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:24,010
We get pressure=1/3*number of densities*mass
of molecules*agitation velocity^2. Let's look

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,709
now at the macroscopic scale to 
what corresponds this force? Let's consider

36
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:38,709
an infinitesimal surface area, so a small
surface area S and this surface is orientated by

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,450
a normal. The convention that I will use
during this course, is that the normal n will

38
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,989
always be orientated inwards, from
where the facet is situated, outwards

39
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:55,269
here where the fluid is. This fluid exerts
a pressure force which is going in this direction

40
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:01,739
here. The pressure force will be proportional
to the surface area. The pressure force if I

41
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,309
resume the course I just give
you, the total force of pressure, will

42
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:13,309
be the pressure multiplied by the surface area
and as we here have a vector, I must

43
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,030
orientate my force with respect to this vector,
the force being in this direction here,

44
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,570
the normal, by convention being in this 
direction here, I add a sign minus. We

45
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,530
have here the definition of the total force of
pressure, a pressure force is a

46
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:35,290
pressure multiplied by a surface area and it is
orientated by a normal. Let's recall the units,

47
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:41,990
the pressure p is measured in pascal, I recall
that the pascal doesn't take a capital letter. A

48
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,120
force, like all forces is measured in
newtons. A particular difficulty of

49
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,600
the word pressure is that it will have different
definitions according to the considered domain.

50
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,250
In mechanics or in physics, in general
pressure means stress, i.e.

51
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,870
force per units of area. In general,
in fluid mechanics, we will have a

52
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:10,250
definition a little more precise. For example,
in the case of a gas or a compressible flow,

53
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:17,250
we will define pressure thermodynamically
from the internal energy, here U. The internal

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,750
energy is linked to the variation of entropy
and to the variation of volume. If I take

55
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,660
this definition here of the internal energy,
the pressure is thus the differential

56
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,350
of the internal energy with respect to the volume
at constant entropy. In the case where

57
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,100
we are working with a medium that is incompressible,
so, in this case the volume is constant,

58
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,720
we see that this relation here is not defined.
In the case of an incompressible medium, the

59
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,130
pressure is not defined thermodynamically,
the pressure is thus undefined and to

60
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,470
determine it we must solve the equations
of motion. In this case here, the pressure

61
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,220
is essentially used as an additional constraint
in order to ensure that the fluid is incompressible.

62
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,620
A forth definition extremely common
in mechanics of continuous media, is

63
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:12,120
to define the pressure as being the average
stress exerted on an object. If we take

64
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,690
for example a floor, we will have, if we take
for example a little cube which is at a certain

65
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,960
depth, we will have on each side
of this cube stress values that

66
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,540
are different, if I do the average of the
normal stresses that are exerted on this

67
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:33,080
cube, I will thus define a pressure.
We see that the word pressure will have meanings,

68
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,800
exceptions relatively different depending
on the context and so we will have to bring

69
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,890
particular care to this context in order
to know exactly what to do. Of course,

70
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,410
as it is an introductory course we will
situate ourselves often in the case where

71
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:54,170
we will be dealing with an incompressible medium,
and, in this case, the pressure will be a

72
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,890
flow variable that must be determined¨
by solving the equations of motion.

73
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:05,890
First of all let's go back to the case of a compressible fluid,
for example a gas such as air. We will introduce

74
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,180
two measures of the compressibility of gas.
The first one is called isothermal compressibility.

75
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:21,180
The second one is called adiabatic compressibility
or sometimes isentropic. In both cases

76
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:27,210
we define a relative variation of volume
with respect to the pressure, when we speak

77
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,560
of isothermal compressibility we are working
at constant temperature, when we speak

78
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,770
of adiabatic compressibility, we are working
at constant entropy. In the case of an

79
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,370
ideal gas, by using the ideal gas
law, we can calculate quite simply

80
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:50,370
these coefficients βT and βS, we obtain 
the following relation. In the case of a

81
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:57,030
compressible medium, we can show that for
example a sound wave corresponds to a

82
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:04,030
pressure variation, to a local variation
of volume or density of the fluid.

83
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,639
We can compute or we can define the speed
of sound or the velocity of sound, here the square

84
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,420
of the velocity, as being the variation
of pressure as a function of the density

85
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,630
at constant entropy. By using
the definition of βS given previously,

86
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:29,350
this definition of the velocity can also
be written as: c^2 = 1/

87
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:36,350
density of the fluid * adiabatic
compressibility. If we look for a couple of numerical

88
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,700
values of this compressibility, we
will find that it is weak for a gas

89
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,640
as we have seen that for an ideal gas we
will be roughly speaking proportional to 1/P, so

90
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,550
if we take the atmospheric pressure: 10^5
pascals, we will find ourselves with an adiabatic

91
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,110
coefficient equal to 10^-5 1/pascals. In
the case of a liquid such as water, we will have

92
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,750
values that will be much weaker,
which are generally of the order of 10^-10,

93
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,750
10^-11, for example, in the case of water,
we will have a compressibility adiabatic

94
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:22,750
coefficient equal to 4,58*10^-10 1/pascals.
In practice, we will be able to assume that water

95
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,840
(the liquid) is a medium so little compressible
that it is incompressible, so that its density

96
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,770
does not vary. It is something
simple to understand. In the case

97
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,620
of a gas, in a certain number of cases, we
can do an assumption quite similar,

98
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,020
and to justify it we will use a non-dimensional
number called the Mach number


99
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,560
and that is the ratio between the velocity of
motion of the fluid, that I call u, or

100
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,770
the velocity of motion of an object in
a gas at rest u over the velocity

101
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:02,190
of sound propagation in this gas. When
we are working at very low Mach number,

102
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,270
the Mach number is very small compared to 1,
the displacement of the object will not cause

103
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,110
significant variations of the density
of the gas. In this case here, we will say that the flow

104
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:19,430
is isochore, from the Greek iso: the same and chore:
the volume. The flow will keep the same

105
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,410
volume, the medium, even though it is compressible
will behave as an incompressible medium.

106
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:30,050
When however the Mach number tends
to 1, it will be greater than 1, which

107
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,350
is the case for example of supersonic airplanes.
In this case here we will have the motion

108
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,540
of the object, the motion of air that will
be done with significant variations of

109
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,339
the density of the gas and in that case,
we will not be able to neglect the compressibility

110
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:53,339
of the gas. We have seen during this first
module some reminders on the notion of pressure

111
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,770
and we have also defined the notion
of compressible media and isochoric flows.

112
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:05,720
During the second module we will introduce
the notion of pascal which is the cornerstone of

113
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:05,970
fluid mechanics.
