00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,350
Here we are at the third and final
module where we will see Archimedes principle

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,340
and an application example of the calculation of
forces that will be the calculation of pressure forces

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,020
exerted by a volume of water on a straight wall,
this is the typical case of a dam. We

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,380
will start by Archimedes principle,
everyone knows Archimedes and his famous

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,939
"Eureka" in his bath. Archimedes was 
a scientist, undoubtedly one of the most

6
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:37,939
important scientist of the Antiquity who lived
during the 3rd century BC in the city of Syracuse in

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Sicily. From his numerous discoveries,
we owe to Archimedes the first result

8
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:51,890
concerning fluid mechanics. This
principle of Archimedes is used to calculate the

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,609
pressure forces exerted on an immersed
volume, this principle is stated as 

10
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:03,920
following: "All bodies immersed in a fluid
at rest is buoyed up by the fluid

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,500
 by a vertical thrust, opposed to the gravity
force,  equal to the weight of the volume of 

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,119
fluid displaced by the object and acting at the center of
mass of this fluid." Let's look a

13
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:21,380
little more concretely what does this statement mean,
let's take the example of a boat of which we would

14
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:28,060
have here the hull sinking in a certain
volume of water, the water surrounding the hull

15
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,180
will thus exert pressure forces on
the hull of the ship. What interests us

16
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,930
is to calculate the total force of pressure
exerted by the water on the hull. If I apply

17
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,729
Archimedes principle that we will prove
right after, this principle states that the total

18
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:52,130
force is equal to the weight of the volume of water
displaced, thus the weight here that corresponds

19
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,890
to the initial volume of water, thus at the intersection
between the boat and the water and that the second

20
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,460
point is the application point of the force
is equal to the center of gravity of this volume.

21
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,679
This center is called "center of
buoyancy" when speaking of a boat. Archimedes

22
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,679
principle is extremely useful because unlike
Pascal's law which is only used to calculate

23
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,730
first of all the pressure distribution,
then by integration of the total force of

24
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,910
pressure. Archimedes principle can
directly lead to the result, it seems

25
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,470
to be a principle much more interesting,
that being said, for it to be applied,

26
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,830
the conditions that are stated
in the principle must be applicable. Archimedes

27
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,280
principle can be proven in a 
relatively simple way from the equation 

28
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,730
of Pascal written in tensor form,
we have seen previously that the gradient

29
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:58,120
of pressure had to balance the specific weight,
I integrate here over a control volume.

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,120
If I use a theorem of tensor analysis
called Green-Ostrogradski, when we

31
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,730
have here a volume integral where the integral
is a gradient, I can transform this

32
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,880
integral, here, in a surface integral
and the gradient here is transformed in pn.

33
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,880
If I interpret the following result, here,
I thus have the resultant of the pressure forces,

34
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,100
here, I have the specific weight of the volume occupied
by my control volume, i.e.

35
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,440
the displaced specific weight. We here have a proof
very fast, very brief of Archimedes

36
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:43,020
principle. Now, let's try to get
a pragmatic method to compute the pressure

37
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,650
forces. For that, I will firstly use
the definition of a pressure force,

38
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,650
we have seen that the infinitesimal force of 
pressure could be written as the pressure

39
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:00,490
multiplied by the infinitesimal surface area,
that, as it was a force, we needed

40
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,050
a vector which orientates the force, we have
a sign - by sign convention, this is 

41
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:13,050
the infinitesimal force. The total force
F will be obtained by integrating over the surface area.

42
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:20,070
To do a calculation of total force, we can
apply a relatively simple method

43
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:26,789
that can be listed here in 5 points. Firstly,
because the pressure intervenes, we must calculate

44
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:31,439
the pressure, we will see that as we are in
hydrostatics, most of the time the pressure

45
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,759
will be linear, we will speak of hydrostatic pressure.
Then, to calculate the infinitesimal surface are

46
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,580
or to define it, we must beware
to define surface areas for which the

47
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:49,300
pressure is homogeneous over this small surface
element. Once we have defined the dS,

48
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,939
we will be able by integration to calculate the
total force, we will also take care of

49
00:04:54,939 --> 00:05:00,689
defining the normal of the surface element,
in the easiest cases, the normal

50
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:05,629
will be a constant, this is what we will see in
the next exercise, if we have objects relatively

51
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:10,860
complex, the normal may vary as a function
of the position, we will then have something

52
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,300
more complicated to calculate. Then, by
integration, we obtain the total force of

53
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,479
pressure. We will see in a practical example
how to proceed. For that, we will consider

54
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:28,479
a non-permeable floor, a wall of height h,
here filled with water over a height h.

55
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,560
I assume that in the direction here which
normal to the transparency, I have a width that

56
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:44,689
is equal to l. What interests me here, is to
calculate the total force exerted by the volume

57
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:51,689
of water on the wall as well as the moment of these
forces. I proceed in the same way I said previously,

58
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:56,139
first of all, by calculating the pressure
distribution. For that, I use Pascal's

59
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:02,300
law, we have seen that it was the gradient
or the derivative of the pressure with respect  

60
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,749
to the height z that is equal to the specific weight
of the fluid. As the fluid here is incompressible,

61
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:13,499
ρ will be constant. We can integrate very
simply this linear equation of the first

62
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:19,360
order, we obtain here a linear distribution,
to simply the calculation, I will assume

63
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,300
here that the atmospheric pressure -z = h
is equal to 0, it is just to simply

64
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,199
the calculation, it does change anything in my final
result. The second point is to define

65
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,430
the infinitesimal surface are and for that I
had to choose a surface area for

66
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,439
which the pressure is homogeneous. If I
place myself at a height z and that I take

67
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,259
a small element dz and that I take a
strip that will be defined as dz multiplied

68
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:55,169
by the width of the channel, on this horizontal strip
the pressure will be homogeneous and equal to ρg(h-z),

69
00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:02,169
I define dS as l multiplied by 
dz, the height of the small strip. As previously,

70
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:09,419
I need a normal vector to this surface area
n which is equal here to (1,0), always oreintated

71
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:13,499
from the inside towards the outside, the outside
being there where the fluid is. The pressure

72
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:20,059
force will thus be defined as
the integral of the infinitesimal force of

73
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:25,099
pressure, in this relatively simple case
where n is constant I will be able to

74
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:32,099
take it out and the surface element, we will have
ldz, so I can take out here the l from the integral

75
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,539
and so I just have to integrate ρg(h-z)dz,
ρg is also taken out from the integral so when

76
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:42,889
I integrate this, I obtain the result that
the pressure force depends on the height

77
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:49,449
at the power 2, multiplied by the specific
weight ρg, multiplied by the width and

78
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:55,199
divided by 2. This force is orientated by
the normal vector n. Let's now compute

79
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,719
the moment of forces with respect to a point
and I will take here as a point the point O

80
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:06,719
here which is at the angle. By definition, the
elementary moment, the infinitesimal moment,

81
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:13,719
it will be the distance, here r, multiplied
by the elementary force here, as we have

82
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,870
something that will be orthogonal, it will
be relatively simple to do the cross

83
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:24,490
product, so the distance r which here is
in fact equal to z therefore the cross product that  

84
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:31,490
is here written relatively simple
ρg(h-z)dz. When I integrate this result,

85
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:38,100
I get that the force moment of pressure
in O is equal to the specific weight ρg, multiplied

86
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,870
by the width of the channel, multiplied by the
height of water to the power 3, divided by

87
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:49,870
6, and so this vector is carried by the vector
ey which is normal to the transparency. If now

88
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,410
I sum up these two results, I have shown
that my pressure distribution was linear,

89
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:02,610
we speak of hydrostatic distribution of
pressure and that as I have the moment of

90
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,620
force in O that is equal to the force multiplied
by a lever arm equal to h/3, meaning

91
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:15,010
that the application point of the force
is situated at 1/3 of the height so it is situated

92
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:22,010
here. To conclude our chapter 4 on hydrostatics,
we will give the solutions of the small quiz.

93
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,820
The first question was relatively
simple, we had to calculate the pressure force

94
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,120
exerted by water at a depth z on
coins that could be

95
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,710
orientated differently according to the horizontal,
according to the vertical or at 45°, what we

96
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:46,130
have shown during this chapter is that
the pressure, if we are working with an incompressible

97
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,820
flow, depends only on the depth
and does not depend on the orientation

98
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:57,820
of the facet. The pressure, for these 3 facets
of different orientation is strictly

99
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,850
identical, the good answer is in fact the
3 answers at the same time: a, b and c. The second

100
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:11,640
question of the quiz is a little more difficult,
I asked to calculate in which case the

101
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,200
the traction force that had to be applied on
a brick to put it into motion was

102
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,120
maximum, we had 2 possible configurations
either the brick was immersed in water,

103
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,520
or it was in open air. This brick
was set on a substrate assumed impermeable

104
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,540
and horizontal. To answer this question,
we have to do a little bit of mechanics

105
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:39,540
and recall the notion of the law of friction in
a liquid medium. The friction force

106
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,000
in a liquid is proportional to
what we call the apparent weight, i.e.

107
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
the specific weight - the pressure force.
We must be extremely cautious. Let's take

108
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:58,050
the case where we have a body, here it will be a
particle for example spherical which is entirely

109
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:03,910
immersed therefore it means that it is entirely
surrounded by water thus water exerts pressure

110
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:09,180
forces all over and so I will have
a resultant of pressure forces that

111
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,840
will tend to make the particle go up,
there is also an exerting force that is the

112
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,450
specific weight of the particle that is exerting
in this direction here, depending on whether the density

113
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:25,220
of the fluid is greater or not to the one
of the solid, we will have a solid that goes back up

114
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:31,400
or else that sinks. Let's examine now the 
case where we have two particles which are immersed

115
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,410
so that are surrounded by a fluid, the pressure
forces will be applied all over

116
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,030
these fluids except perhaps at the
contact point, these two particles are

117
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,970
in contact, I will assume that they are
moving so there will be a friction

118
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,290
force, in this case here, the friction
force, following the Coulomb law will be

119
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:56,290
proportional to the apparent weight so to
this difference between the weight of the particle

120
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,670
and the pressure force. Let's now consider
a case which is the case of the brick that seems

121
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:10,090
identical but which is in fact not at all.
Indeed, let's look how the fluid behaves

122
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:15,970
against this brick. We see
here that the fluid surrounding the spherical

123
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,170
particle and so the forces are being exerted all
over and therefore we have a resultant that is

124
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,670
upwards, we see here that there is no water
so we have pressure forces here on the

125
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,710
vertical sides that will counterbalance
and we have here a pressure that is

126
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,330
a force that is applied only from the top towards
the bottom so the resultant of pressure forces

127
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,430
will be a pressure force orientated
in this case here from the top to the bottom and that

128
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:45,290
will be added to the specific weight of the disk, in
this case here, unlike what is happening

129
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,040
for a body that is completely immersed,
as we here have a contact surface that

130
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,130
is not water, we will have an apparent weight
that will be the specific weight and it is here where

131
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,180
there is a subtlety, that will be + the pressure
force. The force needed to

132
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,940
put into motion this brick will be proportional
to the specific weight of the brick, but, as we

133
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:12,940
are pressing it with a column of water that is
here, we must add the pressure

134
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,600
force resultant. The traction force
needed to put into motion

135
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,910
this brick will greater in water
than in air. We have thus finished with

136
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:28,140
this chapter number 4 dedicated to hydrostatics,
we have seen an extremely important result

137
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,890
which that the law of hydrostatics, we will see
that this law of hydrostatics will be in some

138
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:39,050
ways the embryo, will be the cornerstone on which
we will build the dynamics of fluids.

139
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,950
We have also seen a principle extremely
important which is Archimedes principle

140
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,350
but we have seen through the second question
of the quiz that this principle is much more

141
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,380
subtle to use than it seems at
first.
