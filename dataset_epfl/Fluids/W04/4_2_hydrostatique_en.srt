1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,520
Here we are at module number 2 where
we will approach the law of hydrostatics

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:16,520
or Pascal's law. This result will be fundamental
as it is the cornerstone of fluid

3
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:24,029
mechanics. Pascal's law is due to the french
philosopher Pascal back in 1648, it is

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,410
one of the first results, it is prior
to Bernoulli's principle that we will see

5
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,809
afterwards, it is prior to the notion
of viscosity due to Newton that we have

6
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:39,730
seen in chapter number 1. Here, I will give
a definition of the pressure, the computation

7
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:46,540
of the pressure force, an introduction that
will be a modern version of Pascal's law.

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,540
To prove this result, I will consider
a fluid at rest in a Cartesian coordinate system

9
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:01,890
x,z. I will consider an elementary volume,
here to simplify things, I will consider

10
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,649
that I am working in 2 dimensions so in
this case here my volume is a square. The

11
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:13,999
sides of the square here, so length dx will be
also equal to the length dz, this square

12
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:20,999
is composed of 4 sides, 1, 2, 3 and 4. As
previously I will orientate each of

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:29,130
my sides with a normal orientated from
the inside towards the outside, each normal

14
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,880
of the sides will be denoted by the letter n.
I will now do the force balance

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,099
exerted on this infinitesimal volume
of control. We will have two types of forces,

16
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:48,099
we will have volume forces within
this elementary volume, these forces will be

17
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:55,099
here only the weight that I call here
dP. This weight is simply the density

18
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,749
multiplied by the gravity, multiplied
by the volume. We will then have surface

19
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:04,939
forces exerted on this volume of
control and these surface forces will be

20
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,649
the pressure forces. We will consider
first of all what is happening for the side

21
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:16,649
number 1, we have this computed the pressure
force applied here here in x + dx. For

22
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:25,580
my side number 1, I am placing myself in x + dx,
the average height here is equal to z and if you

23
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,620
recall the definition of the pressure
force, the infinitesimal force of pressure,

24
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,300
it is thus equal to a pressure multiplied
by a surface area, as I am here in dimension

25
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,450
2 my surface element it will here be a
dz, as I was cautious to orientate my normal

26
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,740
form the inside towards the outside I here have
a sign -. The projection of n on the x axis

27
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:54,740
gives me here 1. The pressure force dF1 which
is being applied like this is thus equal to -p(x+dx,z)dz,

28
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,480
I will renew this calculation here for each
of the sides 2, 3 and 4. There are no difficulties

29
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,750
to this. For example,  for the side number
2, the normal is always orientated in

30
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,050
this case here from the inside towards the outside,
which means here that in the direction of increasing z,

31
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,990
so I will always have a projection here which
is equal to 1,  following my convention of sign here,

32
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,990
I have a -, the pressure is computed in z
+ dz at an average abscissa equal to x. The

33
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:35,210
elementary pressure force applied
here dF2 is equal to -p(x, z+dz)dx. If now

34
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,830
I do my force balance and that I project
this force balance on the x axis and on the z

35
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:53,830
axis, for the x axis I will have a force like
this applied along 1, a force like

36
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:00,900
that applied on 3 and no other
volume forces applied in the direction

37
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:07,750
x, the force which is here of pressure must counterbalance
exactly the force which is here, when we

38
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,740
look mathematically what is going on,
it simply means that the pressure

39
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:18,740
is independent of the position x. However,
if I now work along the z axis, I

40
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,669
will find my two pressure forces
that are applied here in this direction,

41
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:30,289
here in this direction, that we will find also
here. I also have the own weight of the fluid

42
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:36,379
here which is exerting a force here in the decreasing z.
I have this relation here. If now

43
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:43,379
I rearrange my terms by dividing here by
dxdz, I obtain the following relation. If I

44
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:50,270
do a Taylor expansion at the order
1, so by taking the limit of dz that tends

45
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,069
to 0, I see here that I have a definition
of the differential of p with respect to

46
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:01,349
z as p does not depend on x, I can replace
directly this differential by a

47
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:08,349
right derivative and so here I have dp/dz which
is equal the specific weight of the fluid: - ρg.

48
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:15,889
This result here is extremely important,
it is called "Pascal's Law" or the law of

49
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:19,949
hydrostatics. The most simple case, is
the case of a liquid for which we will have

50
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,669
a constant density, in this case
here we will have a result extremely

51
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:30,559
interesting, a liquid will have here a
free surface and if I integrate the density,

52
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:35,029
ρ will be constant, and if I integrate Pascal's
law, what I will obtain is that

53
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:40,659
the pressure variation depends only on
the height difference between two points

54
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:46,409
of measure, here I will have a free surface that
will always be plane and if I place myself

55
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:52,050
along this line situated at a distance
h and parallel to the free surface, the pressure

56
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,949
here will be identical and equal to ρgh. Whatever
the shape of the pot, the container, the shape

57
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:04,400
of what is beneath, the pressure here
is identical and equal to ρgh. The other result

58
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,949
which is true for fluids either compressible or 
incompressible, is the generalization

59
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:13,949
of Pascal's law, tensor generalization,
we will replace the right derivative by a

60
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,589
gradient term, we will replace the density
here by ρg, g being written as

61
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:26,589
a vector. Here, we have the law of hydrostatics
in vector form or tensor form.

62
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:33,479
In the case where the fluid is a compressible gas,
for example air and we apply the approximation

63
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,930
of ideal gases, we have in this case here the
ideal gas law that applies and so

64
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,759
that states that the pressure and the density
of the fluid are linked, among other things, if I

65
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,689
am working at constant temperature, all
that I will have is that the density

66
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:55,339
of the fluid is proportional to the pressure
divided by RT. If I take Pascal's law

67
00:06:55,339 --> 00:07:02,339
that I substitute the density for p/RT
and that I integrate this differential equation

68
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,430
of first order by taking as a boundary
condition that the pressure at the height

69
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,210
z=0 is equal to the atmospheric pressure,
I obtain the following exponential law that

70
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,289
is called the barometric formula
and that simply states that the pressure

71
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:24,499
will vary exponentially with the height
as long as the temperature is assumed to be

72
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:29,259
constant, which remains an approximation of
what happens in reality. During 

73
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:35,619
this second module, we have seen Pascal's
law which is the most important element

74
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:39,949
and which will be the cornerstone, the key
element that will allow us to build the

75
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,749
remaining of the course of fluid mechanics.
During the next module, we will see

76
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:48,559
Archimedes principle that can often allow
much faster to the calculation

77
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:52,809
of the pressure force but that unfortunately
does not apply to all cases. 

78
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:57,289
We will see an application example particularly
important which is the calculation of pressure

79
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:57,809
forces on a dam.
