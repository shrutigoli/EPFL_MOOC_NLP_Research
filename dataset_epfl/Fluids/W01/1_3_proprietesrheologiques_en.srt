1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,930
We now turn to the second module
of this chapter dedicated to

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,319
physical properties of the fluids.

3
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:13,899
During this first module, 
we have seen the states of matter,

4
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:16,789
this applies mainly to 
simple bodies. We will see that

5
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:20,689
in many cases, the matter is
found in forms somewhat

6
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:23,710
more complex. 
We often speak of divided matter,

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,519
we will also see an essential 
property of fluids

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,599
which is the notion of viscosity.

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,410
This will allow me to address more
broadly the notion of rheological

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,970
property of a fluid.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,080
So far I have spoken of
simple bodies, so bodies

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,350
such as gas, that we will 
find quite commonly,

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,679
oxygen, nitrogen ...

14
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,409
There are a lot of 
materials that are simple bodies

15
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,520
but there are also fluids 
that are much more complicated.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,000
We often speak of divided matter.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,240
There are a lot of fluids that
are precisely

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,660
mixtures of particles in a 
fluid.

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,060
Depending on the type of particle and the
type of fluid, we will have

20
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,840
different categories.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,200
The general concept

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,400
of dispersion

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,430
is reserved when there are fine 
colloidal particles,

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,080
for example, clays,

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,130
which are

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,970
in a liquid,

27
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,640
for example water.

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,979
The notion of suspension will correspond
to particles that are

29
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:28,859
bigger, so their sizes,

30
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,349
generally greater than a few
tens of microns, also in a

31
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:34,549
liquid.

32
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,900
This is for example a granular medium 
which would be saturated.

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,880
We talk about

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,440
emulsion when we have drops

35
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,609
or droplets in a liquid.

36
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:47,210
A common example is the 
vinaigrette, a mixture of oil

37
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,880
and vinegar. So we will see in the next 
chapter, with emulsions,

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,310
that we have here several interfaces that
are controlled by surface

39
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,830
tension. Last case of mixture, 
is the notion of foam,

40
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,840
for example, when we pore 
our morning coffee in a

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,890
coffee

42
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,979
machine. There is a lightweight foam that appears.

43
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,370
Here we have

44
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,870
air bubbles in a liquid,

45
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,669
shaving foam

46
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:15,079
is a common example

47
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,759
of foam.

48
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,849
We have seen

49
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,510
that the kinetic theory was a 
description at the molecular scale

50
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,310
of what was happening in 
a gas, it will not be the tool that will be

51
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,420
used in this course, firstly because
the mathematical tool

52
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,470
behind, in detail, is 
relatively complicated

53
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,009
and we would be interested

54
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,939
at a number of details that is
far too important for the

55
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,549
practical applications.

56
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:40,789
So let's just

57
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:44,639
have a macroscopic description
of fluids, we will consider

58
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,789
that the fluids at a macroscopic
scale, that is to say at our

59
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:49,089
observation scale,

60
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:52,759
behave as continuous media. 
What is a continuous

61
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,620
medium?

62
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,360
It's a mathematical idealization.

63
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,180
To have a relatively intuitive idea

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,279
this is what happens when, for 
example, you visit a museum

65
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:06,069
with here for instance,

66
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,219
a painting of Serra

67
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:10,730
of the impressionist school

68
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,329
called pointillist.

69
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,790
If you are relatively close to the painting, 
all you see

70
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,409
are spots of color. But
if you move away from the painting,

71
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,979
from a certain distance, 
what you will see appear is

72
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,349
a relatively thin image.

73
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,590
By losing information,

74
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,219
we will have a clear picture
of what is going on.

75
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:37,279
The fluids are a bit like
the painting of Serra,

76
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,189
at the molecular level

77
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,229
they are

78
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,129
points,

79
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,650
if we idealize it as material 
points or small

80
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,399
particles that occupy an infinitesimal
volume,

81
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,019
and at a macroscopic

82
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,299
scale, so at a much 
larger scale than the molecular level,

83
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,340
we will be able to treat it
as a continuous medium.

84
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,079
The big advantage of continuous media

85
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,629
which, represented here,

86
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,809
for example in the flow,

87
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:07,090
I have here a wall and a fluid

88
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,980
flow

89
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,769
along this wall there.

90
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,559
We will be able to introduce concepts
such as

91
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:16,180
streamlines, velocity
field that we will see a little further

92
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,219
in the chapter dedicated to 
kinematics. If we had to

93
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:24,120
look at the detail at the molecular
scale, it would be necessary to describe

94
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,060
the arrangement of the particles over 
time, the collisions, and so on.

95
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,090
We would have here information that
would be far too rich to be treated

96
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,590
for practical applications. That is
why we will mainly

97
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,270
be interested

98
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,650
in the mechanics of continuous media

99
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,009
in order to address the problems of

100
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:42,499
fluid mechanics.

101
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,830
I have so far discussed
essentially

102
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,749
of the physical properties
of liquids,

103
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:48,849
gases,

104
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:50,460
and fluids.

105
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,319
And we have given an example
through the kinetic theory

106
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,460
where we have explained the notion of pressure
and the notion of temperature. There is

107
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,319
another way to also describe the
mechanical behavior of the fluids,

108
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,120
it is a description

109
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,319
called rheological. 
The term of rheology

110
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,970
designating the science of matter

111
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,740
flowing. This matter may be
either solid, it will be an

112
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,289
extremely slow flow or a 
deformation

113
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:20,879
extremely slow

114
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,460
at the scale of observation.

115
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,479
It may well also be a 
conventional fluid which will flow in

116
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,370
much faster way.

117
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,150
A typical example,

118
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,770
is for instance a glacier, if I 
look at what is happening

119
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,400
in an observation scale of 
a few minutes, we have here a solid.

120
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,680
And if I look at what is happening

121
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,970
on a much larger time scale,
almost geological,

122
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,999
we would see

123
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:47,509
a liquid flowing.

124
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,080
Rheology

125
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,479
is the science that will help 
understand how the material,

126
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,529
that is either

127
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,770
solid, liquid or gaseous,

128
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,089
how this material

129
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,400
flows when stressing it.

130
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,889
Rheology is the science of 
flows, in Greek "rheos" means

131
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,259
mean flow and we notice "logos", 
the science.

132
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:13,240
The sentence of Heraclitus was "panta rei", 
"everything flows"

133
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,919
For a rheologist, all material 
flows, one simply

134
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,089
has to wait long enough.

135
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,700
There are a lot of concrete examples, 
we have seen the glaciers,

136
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,300
here we have the example of the rock glacier

137
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,419
of Lona

138
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,589
in the Valais.

139
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,710
This rock glacier, seen here, 
enters

140
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,539
gradually in the lake

141
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,650
called Lake Lona.

142
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,319
At the scale of observation which
would be here the minute,

143
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,979
if you walk on the rock glacier, 
you will have the impression of

144
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:48,469
walking on a pile of stones.

145
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:51,510
However, if we look at what happens 
over several years

146
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,980
we would gradually see

147
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,129
this mass

148
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,689
which is a mixture of ice and 
pebbles, entering the lake

149
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,979
like a highly 
viscous fluid.

150
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:03,309
We see through this example

151
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:07,289
that the same material can
have a fluid behavior

152
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,729
or a solid behavior depending on the scale

153
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,050
of observation. What can be

154
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,650
done to have

155
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,540
a more quantitative criterion, is to 
introduce the number of

156
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,419
Deborah.

157
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,569
Deborah was not a scientist,
it is a character taken

158
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,149
from the Bible.

159
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,430
I will not go here

160
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,580
into details. This number of 
Deborah

161
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,439
is

162
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,549
the relationship between a relaxation
 time, which is

163
00:07:34,549 --> 00:07:38,139
the time it takes

164
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,530
for a material to answer 
when stressed

165
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,689
from a mechanical point of view.

166
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,900
t index e is the time of

167
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,360
observation,

168
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,030
the experimental time, 
if we do a laboratory experiment,

169
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,200
we do this for an observation time
of a few seconds or

170
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,849
a few minutes

171
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,369
sometimes several hours.

172
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:02,069
When working on a geological
scale, it could

173
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:03,439
be in the hundreds of years

174
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,240
or millions of years, so we have
time scales

175
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,669
extremely variable.

176
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,069
This number of Deborah will
be able to take values extremely

177
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,310
different.

178
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,030
If I come back to the glacier for example, 
when we will stress mechanically

179
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,320
the ice, we will have a certain relaxation 
time that is

180
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,900
characteristic of the 
elasto-plastic behavior of ice.

181
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:31,319
This parameter here does not change, it is 
an intrinsic characteristic of the material.

182
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,650
However,

183
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,870
what will change is the time
of observation, it can be

184
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,480
short,

185
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,460
for example, when I walk and
I look at the glaciers,

186
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,700
it is an observation of a few seconds,
a few minutes.

187
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,930
If I'm more of a glaciologist and I l
ook at it throughout the century, it will be

188
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,170
several years,

189
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,980
decades or hundreds of years.

190
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,480
Depending on the value we will have here,
we will have either a small

191
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,500
Deborah number,

192
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,610
in this case, it means that the 
relaxation time is short compared to

193
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,960
the experimental

194
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,540
time, the observation time. 
At that point, we will see that the

195
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,390
material

196
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,420
flows like

197
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,700
a fluid.

198
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,940
In contrast, if we have a relaxation
time

199
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,000
extremely large compared to the time

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,529
of experience,

201
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,800
that means that you will be watching, but 
the material is going to take so much time

202
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,390
to react when you 
stress it

203
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,780
that it will behave

204
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,770
like a solid. We can illustrate this 
also, the glacier is an interesting

205
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,760
example,

206
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,140
but that may seem 
distant. We can observe that

207
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,320
with materials much more
common that may have a

208
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,090
behavior either solid

209
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,930
or liquid

210
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,949
depending on the experimental period

211
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:47,319
with times t_e which are 
much shorter.

212
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:50,809
An extremely common example
is the one of

213
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:51,810
cornstarch.

214
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,620
What this film shows,

215
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,640
is an experience made a few 
years ago at the EPFL with

216
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,120
cornstarch, a mixture
of starch and water, here, a

217
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,870
relatively large volume. We will have 
in this case a behavior either

218
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,670
elastic or a fluid 
behavior, extremely pasty,

219
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,130
depending on the type of stress.

220
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,650
Let's look at this film.

221
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,430
We see that if I

222
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,380
move

223
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:29,380
slowly, it is an extremely 
pasty fluid, it's hard to get out.

224
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,420
If the person moves his foot, we have
something

225
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,290
which is liquid.

226
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:46,290
It is more or less sticky, 
a bit like quicksand.

227
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,830
In contrast,

228
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,730
if the stress rate is 
extremely fast,

229
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,910
we have a behavior

230
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,550
which is similar to that 
of an elastic membrane.

231
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,300
We see that we can support very 
easily the weight

232
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,590
of two persons.

233
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,949
What is happening?

234
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:07,270
It is simply, depending 
on the duration

235
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,500
of the experimentation, which will be here

236
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,130
a few seconds, we have an
elastic behavior.

237
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,600
If instead,

238
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,050
which was the case at the beginning, 
the person remains still,

239
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,060
the time of experience will be 
much larger.

240
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,150
We will have in this case a fluid-like
behavior.

241
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:30,340
Another example is the Silly Putty 
which is an elastomer,

242
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,110
this material,

243
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,329
if I stress it relatively

244
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:38,679
quick, it behaves a 
bit like modeling clay:

245
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,280
I can stretch it.

246
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,120
If now

247
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,910
I exercise a brutal situation,

248
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:52,630
it can break, so we have a brittle
solid material.

249
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,560
We can also see that this 
material, if

250
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,760
we stress it extremely 
briefly, can also behave

251
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,029
like an elastic material,

252
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,770
so if I make a ball,

253
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,270
I can easily have
something that bounces

254
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,250
elastically.

255
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,390
Now if I leave this material 
at rest,

256
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,630
this is an experience in quick motion,  it would
otherwise take several

257
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,650
minutes to observe this phenomenon.

258
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,879
We see that we have something 
that spreads

259
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,820
like a highly viscous fluid.

260
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,000
We see here that we have a behavior 
that is both the behavior

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,890
of a ductile solid material,

262
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,459
of an elastic solid material

263
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:36,100
or a material that we shall say 
is a viscous fluid, according

264
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,990
to the observation period.

265
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,470
We will now introduce the concept

266
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,140
of viscosity,

267
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,520
to do so, we will use an
experiment that is the first

268
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,510
historical experiment

269
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,350
due to the famous Isaac Newton who,

270
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,290
in 1687,

271
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,520
highlighted

272
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,840
the notion of viscosity. At that time, 
he realized it with a

273
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,420
highly concentrated mixture
called molasses

274
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,490
that he sheared between two plates.

275
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,410
We will not reproduce the experiement 
but if we numerically

276
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,510
represented what happens

277
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,439
we would see that if I place
the fluid here

278
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:18,670
between two solid walls

279
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,790
and that I put

280
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,410
into motion

281
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,189
the

282
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:28,200
upper wall, I will observe 
shear.

283
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,339
Shear

284
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,910
in fluid mechanics describes
both the motion,

285
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,020
it can also sometimes designate the 
velocity. We shall talk about shear

286
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,670
velocity, a velocity

287
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,310
which will be a relative velocity.

288
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,759
And also the stress field, 
we will refer to as

289
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:45,620
shear stress.

290
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,740
We see that if I change the

291
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,200
speed of the plates,

292
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,210
I will have a velocity field that 
will be linear, if I apply now

293
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,790
a pressure gradient, we will see that

294
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,300
as an application

295
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,709
at the end of the course,

296
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,620
the velocity profile takes a 
non-linear form that will be

297
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,410
something rather close to a parabola.

298
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,710
We will now explain a little
more this notion of

299
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,910
viscosity

300
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,390
by interpreting this linear velocity profile.

301
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,519
If I

302
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,119
recall Newton's experience, I have
a space between two plates

303
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:26,970
I put

304
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,970
into motion the upper plate at a velocity u

305
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,740
and what

306
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,179
Newton observed is that in order to put

307
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,160
into motion this plate here

308
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,799
we will have to

309
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,810
apply a force that counteracts 
the forces of friction

310
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,200
due to

311
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,120
the viscosity of the fluid.

312
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,330
He observed two things, the first one 
is the notion of

313
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,360
fluid resistance, we will 
introduce the notion of

314
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,960
shear stress to represent

315
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,580
this friction.

316
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,970
The second point observed by Newton 
is that

317
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,580
this frictional force,

318
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,620
if I bring it per unit area, 
that will make a

319
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,740
shear stress,

320
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,980
this shear stress

321
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,210
will be proportional

322
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,500
and will be linear to the velocity

323
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,920
of displacement of the plate,

324
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,589
will be inversely proportional to

325
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:19,170
the air gap, i.e. the distance 
between the two plates.

326
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,160
We have here a linear relationship with the velocity,
inversely linear

327
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,559
with the height,

328
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,420
and has a coefficient 
of proportionality

329
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,120
which is an intrinsic constant
of the material,

330
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,300
we will call it the dynamic

331
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,970
viscosity. We will see that there
is a second viscosity that

332
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,070
is called the kinematic viscosity.

333
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,230
So the ratio u / h,

334
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,110
it is also the velocity 
gradient, we are talking here about

335
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,670
shear rate

336
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,200
or relative velocity of shear. 
In this course the variable will be γ dot.

337
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,520
What is relatively important to 
remember is that we will be able to link

338
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,720
linearly the shear 
stress

339
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,140
to the shear rate

340
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,390
i.e. the speed of deformation,

341
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,890
and that this linear relationship is linked

342
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,510
via a coefficient

343
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,080
of proportionality, that we call the
dynamic viscosity.

344
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,570
This law is called the law 
of Newtonian fluids

345
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,959
it defines a class

346
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,809
of mechanical behavior that we name
Newtonian fluids or linear

347
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,440
fluids.

348
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,350
Let’s give some classical 
values of dynamic viscosity,

349
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,710
the unit will be the Pascal-second, 
one may find in the literature

350
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,320
many other units, I am not even talking
about Anglo-Saxon literature.

351
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,130
For example, we see the notion of Poiseuille, 
one Poiseuille is

352
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,580
one Pascal-second

353
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,550
or poise, or centipoise.

354
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,840
We often introduce the kinematic 
viscosity which is nothing else but

355
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,290
the ratio between the dynamic 
viscosity and the density of the

356
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,220
material.

357
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,450
For instance, we have relatively
interesting things, if

358
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,630
I take the example of water and 
air

359
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,480
which have a dynamic viscosity which is
extremely different, it is about

360
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,170
the order of 10 ^ -3

361
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,239
for water,

362
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,410
it is of the order of

363
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,820
10 ^ -5 for air.

364
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,630
The density ratio is 
such that

365
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,019
when I divide

366
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:18,089
the dynamic viscosity 
by the density

367
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:21,850
I get a kinematic viscosity

368
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,240
for water which will be

369
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,790
lower or about the same order of
magnitude than the one of air.

370
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,160
We thus see something that is 
relatively interesting, which is

371
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,930
if we think in terms of

372
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,399
dynamic viscosity, we have two
materials with two fluidities

373
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:37,880
extremely different, 
we almost have

374
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,200
a ratio of 50 or 100 between the two

375
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,070
whereas for kinematic viscosity, 
we here have a ratio of 5.

376
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,620
If I take other common materials 
that have a Newtonian

377
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,370
behavior,

378
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,070
or behavior that may 
reasonably be assumed to be

379
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,679
Newtonian.

380
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,600
So we have the following values of 
dynamic viscosity expressed in

381
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,279
Pascal-seconds, so for air we have
2.10 ^ -5, for water we have

382
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,179
seen the order of magnitude is

383
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,059
the milli-Pascal second, 
for olive oil, we have a

384
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:14,389
fluid that will be much less liquid, 
much more viscous at room

385
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:19,080
temperature, it will be of the order of 0.1 
Pascal second,

386
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,549
honey will strongly depend on
the sugar content and of the

387
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:23,520
temperature.

388
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,260
We have viscosities which are
roughly

389
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,370
between 1 and 10 
Pascal second.

390
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,480
If we take much more 
viscous materials, caramel or

391
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,450
maple syrup,

392
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,630
we can easily reach 100 
Pascal seconds. Bitumen

393
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,440
which is not actually a Newtonian
fluid, but which may, by first

394
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,030
approximation be considered 
as Newtonian,

395
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,210
reaches colossal viscosities 
since it will be of

396
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,110
10 ^ 8

397
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,990
Pascal-second.

398
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,780
An experience that can be done 
relatively simply in the kitchen

399
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,090
is to take 3 glasses of the same
volume and pour water, olive

400
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,330
oil or honey

401
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,800
and we see

402
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,560
extremely easily

403
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,840
that the time required to empty the
same volume

404
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,610
will be very different 
whether the material

405
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,200
is not very viscous such as water,
or very viscous such as honey.

406
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,590
At the end of

407
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,670
this module we have seen

408
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,640
a class of fluids, the Newtonian 
fluids, which are characterized

409
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,360
by a linear relationship between the
shear stress and the velocity

410
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,409
or rate

411
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,059
of shear and we have highlighted this
coefficient of proportionality

412
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,570
called viscosity.

413
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,750
Most fluids that 
surround us are

414
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,400
Newtonian fluids, i.e. with a
linear behavior but there exists

415
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,830
also many fluids that are

416
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,050
called non-Newtonian and 
do not verify this linearity law

417
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,810
and we will give in the following
module a few examples.
