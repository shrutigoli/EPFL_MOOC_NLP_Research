1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,890
During previous modules,
we have introduced the notion of 

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,020
pressure, we have seen the notion

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,879
of agitation velocity and have introduced a
remarkable property of fluids

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,490
namely the viscosity.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,279
We have seen the existence of a class
of fluids for which there was

6
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,130
a linear relation between

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,800
the shear stress and
the shear velocity

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,670
and that there was a coefficient of
proportionality

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,070
that we called viscosity. Fluids
for which we have this linearity

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,800
between the velocity

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,300
of deformation and the shear

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,199
stress

13
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,980
are called Newtonian fluids.

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,410
Many of the fluids that
surround us are Newtonian fluids

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,580
but not all fluids are
Newtonian fluids,

16
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,630
we will now see a few
examples.

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,410
The rest of the course will be only dedicated
to Newtonian fluids.

18
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,410
Another interesting notion to know,
is the notion

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,630
of rheogram.

20
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,920
A rheogram is

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,410
the law

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,710
that links

23
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,399
the shear stress

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,249
to the gradient or more precisely

25
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:04,759
to the shear rate.

26
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:07,280
The ratio between shear

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,500
stress and shear rate
will be the viscosity.

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,680
If we have a linear fluid, we have seen
previously that we have the

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,750
stress that is equal to the shear rate
multiplied by the viscosity.

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,370
The ratio between stress and shear
rate,

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,930
this stress is the viscosity
and it is

32
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:26,870
constant

33
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,150
for a Newtonian fluid so we
have regardless of the shear

34
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,660
rate, a value of
viscosity that remains constant.

35
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,150
We have materials

36
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,329
that have a viscosity that will
change

37
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:42,649
according the velocity at which we
stress them. If for example we take

38
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:43,720
cornstarch

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,780
which we have seen previously, we will have
what we call a fluid that is a 

40
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,380
shear thickening fluid.

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,770
The more we stress it

42
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,950
quickly, we will have shear
rates relatively important

43
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,619
and the more its viscosity will increase,
we see that we can have

44
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,190
viscosity variations that will be of
1, 2 or 3 orders of magnitude

45
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,500
when we will increase the shear
rate.

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,340
Conversely, we will have fluids that we
call shear thinning fluid,

47
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,340
these are fluids where we will observe
a collapse so a decrease

48
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,979
extremely important of many
orders of magnitude

49
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:22,109
of the viscosity as we will increase
the shear rate of the fluid.

50
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,790
It is for example, for people
who do tinkering, 

51
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,250
what happens with the
paints that we find in 

52
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,730
stores, when we open the bucket we have a
material which is in the

53
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,320
form of a material extremely
pasty and when we will

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,429
apply the paint on a wall with
a paint roller, 

55
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:40,179
we will increase

56
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:43,750
the strain rate and we have
a material that will spread

57
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,900
relatively easier. The material
will liquefy itself, well it doesn't

58
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,870
liquefy, it was already a
liquid but it will be

59
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,059
shear thinning, its viscosity
will decrease

60
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:59,430
during the stress. What we can
keep in mind is

61
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,799
that a Newtonian fluid,

62
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:03,919
is a material that behaves
linearly

63
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,339
so the propotionality coefficient
remains constant:

64
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:11,179
we have a dynamic viscosity μ
which is constant.

65
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:12,240
However,

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,449
all fluids that do not respect
this law of linearity

67
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:18,629
are fluids that we will call
by definition "non-newtonian".

68
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,319
They will have a viscosity
that isn't constant

69
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,069
when we stress them,
it will not be constant over time

70
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,549
or will not be constant 
according to the strain rate.

71
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,930
There are many experiments
extremely interesting to show

72
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,329
the properties of non-Newtonian
fluids, one of them is for

73
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,219
example

74
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,959
to suck liquid with a syringe,

75
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,489
we have the real-time experiment, I will enlarge afterwards what

76
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:45,819
is happening.

77
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,400
What we will notice is that,

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,029
I pause the picture,

79
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:55,249
we have here the formation of a jet

80
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:56,669
and that

81
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,379
if it were a Newtonian fluid,

82
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:03,090
and that there were no surface
tension,

83
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,329
the moment the syringe is above the free surface,

84
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,869
it would cease this jet.

85
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:11,509
On the other hand, here, we observe that

86
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:13,889
if I keep sucking

87
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,870
with my syringe,

88
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,659
I keep on observing this jet.

89
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:24,050
We have a characteristic

90
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,219
extremely

91
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:27,680
interesting of non-Newtonian fluids.

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,629
To understand what is happening

93
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,029
I will use here

94
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:37,359
a culinary analogy that is a bit
far-fetched

95
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:40,809
but for understanding
a little better what is going on.

96
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:44,619
Simple bodies are composed
essentially of atoms or of

97
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:45,500
molecules

98
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,610
so

99
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,029
objects that at the microscopic scale
are more or less spherical.

100
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:55,210
We have a lot of materials, such as
polymers

101
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,069
which are materials that will take
shapes extremely elongated, we will speak 

102
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:00,100
for example of polymer

103
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,460
chains.

104
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,169
This is the representation here with a spaghetti

105
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:09,610
of molecular chains that will
have a certain length

106
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,490
or else that will wrap in the
form of a ball.

107
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,580
The fact of having objects that will

108
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,349
occupy in space and that will have
in space properties

109
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,759
relatively different

110
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,949
of a stack or of an arrangement of 
spheres, will contribute to the

111
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,050
Newtonian

112
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,080
properties of the material.

113
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,569
Here for example I will replace
my syringe

114
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,310
by a vacuum cleaner

115
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,039
and if I try

116
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,509
to suck a spaghetti,

117
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,539
the spaghetti stick together

118
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:44,659
or are entangled, so I
will be taking not one but

119
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:47,490
several, I will be able to carry
in that way

120
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,259
my

121
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,100
spaghettic liquid.

122
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:55,119
Of course this is an extremely
dared image but can

123
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:55,630
still

124
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,650
give a good representation of 
what is going on

125
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,699
at the molecular scale.

126
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,440
Another experiment extremely

127
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,380
common

128
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,480
to characterize or highlight
the non-Newtonian nature

129
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,250
of materials, it is the Weissenberg effect.

130
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,629
In a beaker, we introduce the 
liquid,

131
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:24,080
we then introduce a cylinder that we 
will rotate.

132
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,389
If we have a material that is a Newtonian
material for example,

133
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:35,419
when we will rotate this inner 
cylinder we will have

134
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,830
acceleration forces

135
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,699
and centrifugal forces

136
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,909
that are going to dig

137
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:45,680
the free surface of the material, we
will see appear

138
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,810
a movement, a widening at
the cylinder

139
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,039
due these centrifugal forces.

140
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,629
However, for non-Newtonian
fluids, since we have

141
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:55,419
still

142
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:00,029
this problem of length of the polymer
chain,  we can have a

143
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:04,069
behavior that is completely
different which is illustrated here

144
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,610
through this little movie.

145
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,819
On the left, we have a Newtonian

146
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:11,699
fluid, it is glycerol.

147
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,919
On the right, we have a non-Newtonian fluid,
viscoplatic which is Carbopol.

148
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,979
We see on the left that there is
a widening

149
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,789
quite visible

150
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:22,300
due to the centrifugal forces,

151
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,180
on the right it is a little less obvious but we
see that we don't have this widening and

152
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,879
that we have

153
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,430
on the contrary a slight camber therefore
a part of the material which tends

154
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,240
to climb

155
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,240
in direction of the cylinder.

156
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,999
Again, if I am trying
to get an explanation at the

157
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,210
molecular scale

158
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,610
of this behavior, of this 
Weissenberg effect, I can

159
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,979
always use my

160
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,860
culinary analogy a little

161
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,840
far-fetched

162
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,189
by replacing the polymer
chains by spaghettis.

163
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:04,669
If now, I do not rotate
my material, for example with a

164
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,710
fork

165
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,889
we see that we have

166
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,819
a small rise

167
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,089
of the material which is going to wrap
around the object,


168
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:17,449
which is represented here
by a fork.

169
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:19,760
Another experiment to

170
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,990
highlight the difference of
behavior between a Newtonian liquid

171
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,560
and a non-Newtonian

172
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,639
liquid,

173
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,479
it is an experiment relatively
simple to do, using a syringe.

174
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,029
We will observe the shape

175
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,340
of the jet

176
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,360
at the outlet of the syringe.

177
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
On the right

178
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,620
I have a non-Newtonian fluid,
it is polymeric liquid.

179
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,430
On the left I have a Newtonian fluid,

180
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,600
it is still the glycerol liquid.
In the syringe, in both cases I have a

181
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,690
fluid

182
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,180
I will push the tip of
the syringe to

183
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,190
form a jet and I will look
the shape of the jet.

184
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,110
We will see

185
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,889
that on the right we have

186
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:07,950
a jet

187
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,330
that tends to

188
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,680
increase its diameter,
we have a swelling

189
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,450
which is quite characteristic

190
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,050
of a polymeric liquid

191
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,410
whereas for a Newtonian fluid
we have

192
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,020
a light contraction

193
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,400
and we have a

194
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,850
jet that takes a shape relatively straight
characteristic of liquid or a

195
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,240
Newtonian

196
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,620
behavior.

197
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,030
If we want to give an explanation
of this behavior

198
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,170
we must

199
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,840
recall that polymeric liquids

200
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,110
consist of chains. They are
objects that are in the

201
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,630
form of chains that can be


202
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,400
more or less 
formed into balls.

203
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
When we will, in the syringe,

204
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,600
push the material

205
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,619
in the syringe.

206
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:03,680
We will

207
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,900
force the molecules

208
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,879
that occupy a certain volume,

209
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,959
we will force them to

210
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,480
stretch out.

211
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,510
They will have a shape rather

212
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,170
of vermicelli, of elongated spaghettis.

213
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,090
However, once we will leave 
the syringe, we don't

214
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,580
have

215
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,840
lateral walls,

216
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,790
the particles will be able to take
their preferential shape,

217
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,910
in general more or less as
balls.

218
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,960
At this point they will occupy
the whole space

219
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,590
that is given to them, we will have a
swelling

220
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,450
of the jet.

221
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,819
We approach the end of this course

222
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:51,039
and I will give the answer to the introductory
quiz of the course.

223
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,689
Afterwards, there will also be
the validation test of this chapter to be done.

224
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,490
The first question of the quiz was to
know what we called

225
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,340
a viscous fluid.

226
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,650
Two possibilities:

227
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,830
Either a viscous fluid is a fluid that
sticks to utensils,

228
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,490
this is the case with your spoon in the morning
when you dip it in honey.

229
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,450
Or with the notion

230
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,750
of viscosity, we mean the

231
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:24,050
ease with which we can spread,
or pour a liquid.

232
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,810
The right answer is the second
answer.

233
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,530
The notion of viscosity represents the

234
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:37,030
ease with which we can make
a liquid flow

235
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,960
or a gas

236
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,760
and so is not at

237
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,649
all linked to the notion of adhesion
of a liquid to walls.

238
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:48,699
The second question was the notion of
temperature, and so

239
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,400
what the temperature represents at the molecular
scale.

240
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,570
Two possibilities: it represents the
heat conduction or else it is a

241
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,710
representation of the thermal agitation of
molecules.

242
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,840
It is this last answer that is
the right one,

243
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,450
the temperature is a macroscopic
quantity that represents at the microscopic

244
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,189
scale (the molecular 
scale)

245
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,289
the thermal agitation of molecules,
i.e. the unceasing

246
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:17,850
fluctuations of velocity

247
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,340
of the molecules due to

248
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,000
the unceasing collisions

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,300
that these molecules have

250
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,310
between them or against a wall.

251
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,450
We have arrived at the end of this
first chapter dedicated to the

252
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,280
physical properties of fluids,

253
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,500
we have seen the notions of gases,

254
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,340
of liquids,

255
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,500
of solids, of divided matter,
we have introduced the notion pressure and the notion

256
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,959
of temperature. We also have

257
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,220
introduced the concept of Newtonian fluids
which are fluids for

258
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,520
which there is a linear relation

259
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,530
between

260
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,170
the shear stress, the
velocity gradient, and the coefficient of

261
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:52,800
proportionality

262
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,379
called the dynamic viscosity.

263
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,160
This viscosity, at constant temperature,
stays constant.

264
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,770
These linear fluids are called
Newtonian fluids, most of the

265
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,890
fluids that will interest us in 
this course

266
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,500
will be Newtonian fluids.

267
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,080
There are also fluids that
do not verify

268
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,629
this law of linearity between
the stress and the strain rate,

269
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,069
that are called non-Newtonian

270
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:16,040
fluids.

271
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,749
In the next chapter we will
tackle another

272
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:21,580
property extremely important which is
the property of

273
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,090
surface tension.
