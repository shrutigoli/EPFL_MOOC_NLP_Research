00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to this new chapter of 
the Fluid Mechanics course

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,400
where we will approach 
the physical properties

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,900
and the rheology properties
of fluids.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,349
In fact, it is a chapter
a bit special,

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,949
a chapter which will be 
essentially cultural,

6
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:21,320
as we will essentially see 
the physical principles, we won’t

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,800
be going into the mathematical
details.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,000
These details, 
these mathematical developments,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,400
will be seen in later 
chapters.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,100
During this chapter, we will 
address three crucial points.

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,040
First of all, we will discuss 
the notion of fluid,

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,000
we will define what 
a fluid is, what a liquid is,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,500
what a gas is.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,900
So we will address here the physical
properties of fluids.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,900
The second point will concern
the rheological behavior, and more

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,700
generally the rheology. It is 
probably a new term for you,

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,800
I’ll come back on this definition
of what a rheological 

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,500
behavior is. The third point will
concern some of 

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,900
the essential physical properties,

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,100
namely the notion of viscosity and the
notion of surface tension.

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,600
Surface tension will be the subject
of the next chapter, as is it

22
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:14,930
a much broader subject.

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,180
We will begin

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,600
each of the chapters of this fluid 
mechanics course

25
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:21,640
by a small quiz, not only 
to test your knowledge,

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,570
but also to arouse 
your curiosity.

27
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,400
So, as the first chapter is a
cultural chapter, I will

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,500
ask you a few questions relatively 
simple,

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,800
taken from your everyday experience

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,300
The first question is to know 
what a viscous fluid is.

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,900
Do you we talk about a viscous fluid 

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,950
when

33
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,130
like honey, 
the fluid sticks to utensils?

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,220
Or,

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,500
Do we talk about a viscous fluid to
describe the ease with which 

36
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,800
one can spread a fluid, for example this
same honey, spreading it over bread?

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,979
The second question concerns 
the notion of temperature.

38
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,039
Imagine we have a thermometer,

39
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,280
and that we measure

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,610
a temperature.

41
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,009
Then this temperature measurement at
the macroscopic scale

42
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,800
surely corresponds to something
at the molecular scale.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,000
But what exactly? 
First possibility:

44
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,739
We are measuring the heat conduction 
at the molecular scale.

45
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,669
Second possibility:

46
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:24,539
We are measuring the molecular agitation,

47
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:27,789
thus the agitation velocity of
molecules in a certain volume.

48
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:30,319
I will let you think

49
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,800
about these two questions, and will give you the 
answer at the end of this chapter.
