1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,480
We now tackle the first
module of chapter 1, devoted to the

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,679
states of matter. 

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,719
We will see during this module
essentially the three states of

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,789
matter: gas, solid, and liquid.

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,039
For a simple body, it is common to
consider three states of matter.

6
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,400
The first state of matter
is the solid state,

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,300
which corresponds to a material at 
low temperature

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,589
at the molecular scale, there will be
a regular

9
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,559
arrangement of atoms or molecules.
The liquid state will correspond

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,160
to a material at low temperature and 
at high pressure.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,580
We will begin to have 
a local disorder,

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,400
an agitation of the molecules 
or atoms.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,070
The gaseous state, the third state,

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,180
corresponds to a material at
high temperature and

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,420
at low pressure.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,880
At the molecular scale, 
we will notice

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,600
a large agitation of the molecules 
or the atoms.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,320
Thanks to the following short film,

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,880
we will be able to picture what 
happens at the molecular scale,

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,719
for that

21
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,030
I have a vibrating table, I have placed

22
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,290
a couple of table tennis balls which 
represent my atoms

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,450
or my molecules.

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,980
When the vibration is 
relatively low, I have

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,060
a relatively low thermal agitation:
We can see a crystal lattice

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,770
of particles and if I try
to move one,

27
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,430
it stays in the same spot:
We here have a solid response.

28
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,100
If I now increase

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,640
the agitation velocity of the
 particles, so if I increase

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,770
the vibrations,

31
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,060
We will have an agitation here

32
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,930
more pronounced and 
when I will try 

33
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,730
to put into motion a particle,

34
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,720
we will see that it is 
much more easier.

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,720
We here have something which is 
representative of the liquid state.

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,660
The third state will be observed 
when we increase

37
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,179
the vibration of the table.

38
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,259
In this case,

39
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,109
we will

40
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:15,249
increase the thermal agitation 
and we will have more and more

41
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:17,689
collisions between particles.

42
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:22,049
The particles will also 
tend to occupy the entire space

43
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:23,430
that is available. So here,

44
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,780
to leave

45
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,719
the space of the vibrating table.

46
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,859
We are typically dealing here with 
something that represents, that conceptualizes,

47
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,489
the gas state.

48
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,819
To understand what is going on,
we will look at a small numerical

49
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,460
simulation. In a small

50
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,159
volume, I have molecules 
interacting

51
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,489
by collision. I will look at 
what is happening when for example

52
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,099
I increase the temperature.
In this case, I increase

53
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:52,779
the number of collisions between
particles and between the particles and

54
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:53,699
the wall.

55
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,909
If I now decrease the temperature 
and approach the absolute

56
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:01,969
zero, that is to say a temperature 
equal to minus 273 degrees Celsius

57
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,809
or 0 Kelvin.

58
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,500
At this point, I have
less and less

59
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,229
collisions between particles.

60
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:12,049
The small animation that we’ve just
seen will enable us now to

61
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:15,649
define what we call the agitation
velocity of particles.

62
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:16,860
To do so,

63
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,109
we will decompose
the velocity of the particle

64
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:22,349
into a mean velocity,

65
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,870
and a fluctuating velocity. 
So we introduce here the mean,

66
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,229
or the mean operator: here between
brackets or here with a bar,

67
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:36,739
which is a mean, for example the
velocity mean over time.

68
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:42,039
By definition, the mean, here, of 
the fluctuating velocity is equal to

69
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,029
zero.

70
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:45,940
What will interest me, it is to compute

71
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,099
the square

72
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,819
of the instantaneous velocity

73
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,689
also called the quadratic velocity. 
To do so, I simply need to take the

74
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,800
scalar product of u
times itself,

75
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,850
that I develop.

76
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,349
I obtain the following 
relation.

77
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:04,219
By using this property,

78
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:07,699
I will be able to simplify this 
development

79
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,859
as here the product of u

80
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,930
scalar the mean of the
fluctuating velocity is equal

81
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,559
to zero.

82
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:18,609
I end up with 
the following results:

83
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:23,930
The mean of the square of the instantaneous
velocity is equal to the square

84
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,940
of the mean velocity

85
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,110
plus

86
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,529
the mean of the fluctuation squared.

87
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:33,510
Here, the mean 

88
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,010
of the fluctuating velocity is equal to 
zero. But here, as we squared,

89
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,460
the mean fluctuating velocity will be nonzero. 
It will play an important role and

90
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,580
for this reason, we give it a name,
we will call it agitation

91
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,199
velocity, or, typically 
when the mean velocity

92
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,469
is zero therefore when the gas is at rest, 
we will be speaking directly of mean

93
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,110
quadratic velocity.

94
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,969
The second important concept is
the notion of pressure,

95
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:03,479
the kinetic theory 
shows that we can define the

96
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,580
pressure as a force per units 
of area,

97
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,500
and we can link it to the agitation velocity 
of particles, here,

98
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,499
raised to the power 2,

99
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:14,300
to the mass of the particles

100
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,920
and to the number of molecules.
Here we have a 1/3 coefficient.

101
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,189
What we can show is,

102
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,190
that when we have, for example, a
wall,

103
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,690
we will have particle agitation and so 
collisions between particles.

104
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,740
These particles will also 
collide with the wall.

105
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,370
This exchange of momentum,

106
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,039
which is unceasing,

107
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,129
will create a force per units of 
area which takes this shape.

108
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:43,810
I am now going to use a small 
numerical simulation to illustrate

109
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,529
this notion of pressure.

110
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:47,050
I will consider

111
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,219
certain volumes

112
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:52,159
in which I have a certain 
number of atoms.

113
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:56,279
I will be able to modify their
velocity and their number. For instance,

114
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,040
if I increase

115
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,119
the number of atoms in this volume,

116
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:03,029
I increase therefore n, and I will
increase the pressure.

117
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,740
Now, the agitation velocity, 
so the temperature,

118
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,999
I will also increase the pressure.

119
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,719
If now I decrease the volume,

120
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:17,999
I will increase the number 
of molecule per units of volume.

121
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:18,689
There again,

122
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:21,770
I am increasing the pressure.

123
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,400
This relatively simple simulation

124
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,889
highlights how

125
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,900
the pressure, which will also
be a macroscopic measure,

126
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:34,400
is linked to the molecular scale
from the particles’ agitation.

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,619
So far, we have done

128
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:40,349
a little bit of kinetic theory to
get a conceptual

129
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,610
idea,

130
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,410
a theoretical idea,

131
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,069
of what a gas is at the molecular scale.

132
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:48,679
Now we will try to 
establish more factual elements

133
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,169
taken from experimental observations.

134
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,710
The first experimental results
are due to an Englishman

135
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,499
called Robert Boyle

136
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,360
in 1662.

137
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,129
What Boyle noticed is that the
product between the pressure

138
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,379
and the volume is constant.

139
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:06,550
This result

140
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,229
will be obtained independently a few
years later by

141
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,430
Edme Mariotte,

142
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,550
in 1676.

143
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,650
A couple of years

144
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,360
after, Guillaume Amontons
redoing

145
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,840
the same type of experiments showed that
this law pV = constant

146
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,639
is only valid if the temperature remains 
constant. Right before the French

147
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,180
revolution, Jacques Charles came by
what we call the law of volumes,

148
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,259
This law states that the ratio between
pressure and temperature is

149
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,749
a unique function

150
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,469
of volume.

151
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:44,619
Joseph Gay-Lussac, during the
First Empire, obtained the law of

152
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:47,630
pressures, which is a variant
of the law of volumes

153
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,599
and that simply states that the ratio 
between volume over temperature

154
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,309
is a function of pressure.

155
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:58,479
Finally, we owe to Avogadro the
following results, that is

156
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,490
the volume of a gas is proportional
to the number of particles

157
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,330
per unit of volume (i.e. n) and this, 
for a given temperature and pressure.

158
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,509
If I now try to 
sum up all these

159
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:13,479
results here.

160
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,260
I obtain the following relation:

161
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,610
pV / nT

162
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,909
is equal to a constant.

163
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,449
We will see that this constant

164
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:25,879
is the ideal gas constant.
Let’s now resume all these

165
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,759
results.
We first pointed out

166
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,849
thanks to kinetic theory
that at the molecular scale, we could

167
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:34,580
define pressure

168
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,980
as

169
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,810
the product of the number of molecules or
the number of particles per volume,

170
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,480
their mass, multiplied by the
agitation velocity

171
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,290
squared.

172
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,399
A the macroscopic scale, 
we used the results

173
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,670
of experimental observations and 
obtained that the product between

174
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,850
the pressure and the velocity is linked

175
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:55,980
to the temperature,

176
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,820
the number of moles, i.e. the number
of molecules divided by the

177
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,000
Avogadro constant.

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,200
A constant appeared called
the ideal gas constant.

179
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,720
We also introduce Boltzmann
constant, and we can link the

180
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,310
ideal gas constant to Boltzmann’s
constant and the Avogadro constant.

181
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,840
We are now able to
link the pressure defined

182
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,420
at a microscopic scale

183
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,410
to the pressure defined at the 
macroscopic scale.

184
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,160
At the microscopic scale, or molecular
scale, kinetic theory has

185
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,510
showed that the pressure 
is linked to the mass of molecules,

186
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,160
to their number per unit volume, and
to the square of the agitation velocity.

187
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,500
The experimental observations have
led to the ideal gas law,

188
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,730
that states that the product

189
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,410
pressure times volume

190
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,710
is equal

191
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,000
to the temperature times the 
ideal gas constant

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,700
times the number of moles.
If I now equalize both expressions

193
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,500
for the pressure,

194
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,290
at the macroscopic scale and at 
the microscopic scale, I obtain

195
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,430
the following relation:

196
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,720
which after simplification, allows me to 
compute the agitation velocity

197
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,960
as a function of temperature.

198
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,189
This relation

199
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:11,009
marks a link between what is 
happening at the macroscopic scale and

200
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:13,729
at the microscopic scale. The
temperature is a macroscopic

201
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:15,040
quantity,

202
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,440
and we see that as we increase the 
temperature,

203
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,160
the agitation velocity at 
the molecular scale increases.

204
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,279
Inversely, if the temperature decreases,

205
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,710
the agitation velocity of the particles
decreases at the molecular scale.

206
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,010
To get an idea of the orders of magnitude,
we will consider the numerical

207
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,689
application,

208
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:35,430
We are going to take a gas, 
say nitrogen,

209
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,800
whose molar mass is 14 g/mol. 
Normally, this is a so-called

210
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,649
atomic gas,

211
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,130
I will here try to treat it as a 
simple gas.

212
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,710
We are also working at atmospheric
pressure and at ambient

213
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,730
room temperature,

214
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,550
i.e. a temperature of 
20 degree Celsius or

215
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,270
293 Kelvins. The number of atoms

216
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,360
per unit of volume in this case
is given by

217
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,200
the ideal gas law. In this way.
We thus find that n

218
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,370
is of the order of magnitude of 10^25

219
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,500
atoms/m^3.

220
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,700
If we now use the previous 
relation

221
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,720
which linked agitation velocity to
the temperature,

222
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,100
we find that even 
if the gas is at rest,

223
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,800
the agitation velocity of the molecules
 is of the order of 720m/s,

224
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,560
a velocity that is extremely
big.

225
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,820
We will now approach the last
point concerning the physical

226
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,740
properties of simple bodies, 
that is the notion of change of state.

227
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,000
For that, I will work in a 3 dimensional 
space with pressure,

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,470
volume and temperature.

229
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,509
In this space, liquids will 
occupy a certain part,

230
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:49,720
gases will occupy another, 
and solids

231
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,920
will also occupy

232
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,649
a certain space. We have transition
spaces where we can have

233
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,820
both solids and liquids,

234
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,910
or else here, solids and gas.

235
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,850
So to

236
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,300
understand a little better what is happening, 
we will work at constant

237
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
temperature

238
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,220
and we will see what happens when we 
change either the pressure or the volume.

239
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,300
This actually amounts to doing a slice,

240
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,030
here, by taking a constant 
temperature.

241
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,139
To give an example of what is 
happening, I will use once again

242
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,949
a numerical simulation. 
So I am working at constant temperature

243
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:26,760
in a space where I have

244
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,070
pressure and volume

245
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,730
that can vary.

246
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,079
This is typically what can be done
for example when I work in a confined

247
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,189
space

248
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,720
with a piston which allows us 
to vary

249
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,000
the volume and the pressure.

250
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,259
If I am in a volume which is 
relatively large,

251
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:48,839
I will be at a relatively low 
pressure and the space

252
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,040
will be occupied

253
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,590
by a gas. If I now cross

254
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,720
a certain critical phase, I will obtain 
liquid.

255
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,630
We see that liquid will occupy only 
a part,

256
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,600
the bottom

257
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
of the piston.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,880
If I increase and I stay in

259
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,830
the gaseous

260
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,880
part, I have only gas.

261
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,189
I approach the

262
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:10,250
critical part,

263
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:17,250
once I have crossed the critical part, 
I have liquid that appears.

264
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,610
Here, we have a two phase system: gas and liquids.
And if,

265
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,250
I move above my critical curve
again,

266
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,540
I only have one system composed of gas.

267
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,100
Here we are at the end of this first 
module,

268
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,380
where we have seen

269
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,269
the essential physical properties 
of gases,

270
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:40,429
we saw on one hand, the kinetic
theory of gases that

271
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:44,290
describes at a molecular scale the agitation
of particles and

272
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,620
linked the pressure

273
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,810
to the agitation.

274
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,140
We have also seen at the macroscopic
scale the ideal gas law,

275
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,590
and when we do the link between the
theoretical description of the microscopic

276
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,130
scale and the

277
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,949
experimental observation at the macroscopic 
scale, we can link

278
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:59,850
temperature

279
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,700
and agitation velocity.

280
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,440
We also revisited,

281
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,240
for cultural purposes, the notion of phase
change.

282
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,679
During the next module,

283
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,649
we will other properties, such as 
the notion of viscosity.
