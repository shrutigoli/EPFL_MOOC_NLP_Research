Hello and welcome to this third module
of the second chapter of the course on fluid

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,330
mechanics, this second chapter deals
with phenomena of surface tension and

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,789
capillarity and in this third module
we will more precisely deal

4
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:20,930
with wetting phenomena when we
bring together a liquid and a solid 

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,030
substrate and we will in particular demonstrate
a very important law that is Young's

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,369
relation.
In order to develop a certain intuition 

7
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:31,619
of what can happen, it is natural to
compare the surface energy of a dry

8
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,440
solid, so in presence of a vapor or of a
gas and a wet solid in which we 

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,789
have brought together : the liquid, the gas and
the solid. We see in this situation that there

10
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:47,179
are three states in play : the solid, the liquid
and the vapor, this is what is going to make the problem

11
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,019
delicate. It is natural to be convinced
that, depending on the affinity of the solid

12
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,969
with the vapor or with the liquid, we can
be either in the left situation, 

13
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:00,339
i.e. that the liquid is not wetting the solid,
or in the right situation, i.e.

14
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:06,909
the liquid completely wets the solid. The everyday 
experiment shows us that the solution the

15
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:11,149
most commonly observed is neither the one on
the left, nor the one on the right, but an intermediate

16
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:14,380
solution in which droplets are 
formed, the question that we will try

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,969
to ask ourselves, is to try to determine
what characterizes the size and the

18
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:23,130
shape of these droplets and how this is linked
to the different properties physical and

19
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,460
chemical of the present phases ? Indeed,
in such circumstances, there are three

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,549
surface tension that can come into
play : on one hand the surface tension between

21
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,609
the solid and the vapor, on another between
the solid and the liquid, and on another between

22
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:40,700
the liquid and the vapor. It is very natural
to introduce a parameter that we call 

23
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,289
spreading parameter that compares the non-wet
situation : the solid is only in

24
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:51,670
the presence of vapor γSV to a solid completely
wet that has two interfaces : an interface 

25
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,280
solid-liquid and an interface liquid-vapor.
Depending on this parameter we will see

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,799
that the geometrical properties of the
droplet deposited on a substrate will depend

27
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:04,450
on this parameter. We take a thin strip
on which we deposit thanks to a

28
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,759
pipette a small droplet, we see that 
the water is spreading and forming a drop relatively

29
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,759
flat. We can say that the glass is
a hydrophilic substrate, that likes water. If

30
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,470
we had deposit an oil droplet, the oil
would have even more spread. Now

31
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,250
we clean the thin strip and we pass it
in the flame of a candle, which allows to

32
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,250
deposit sweat. We see that when 
we deposit the small droplet, this time,

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,140
the liquid refuses to spread and forms
a drop nearly spherical, the phenomenon 

34
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,040
of unpearling occurs. How to quantify 
these observations ? We will introduce

35
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,190
a macroscopic parameter, the wetting angle
that is the angle that is made by a droplet of really

36
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,310
small size on a solid substrate in the presence
of vapor, that we denote θ and this angle

37
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,730
of wetting depends only on the properties
chemical and physical of the three present

38
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,060
phases, i.e. : the solid, the liquid
and the vapor. How to precisely link

39
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,150
this macroscopic and observable parameter 
to the physical quantities that are the three

40
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,820
inter-facial tensions introduced previously
? We will, as often, proceed by

41
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,790
a reasoning in energy. We will make
the following thought experiment : let's imagine

42
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,520
firstly that the liquid wets with an
angle θ a solid in presence of a vapor.

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,810
Then, let's suppose that the triple line carries out
a movement dx, we will count which

44
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,570
are the interfaces created and the interfaces
deleted by such an operation. First

45
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:46,570
of all, we see that an interface of length
dx has been created between the liquid and the solid

46
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,320
although it was previously occupied
by an interface between the solid and the vapor.

47
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,320
We have thus suppressed the surface energy
- γSV dx, but moreover, we have also 

48
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:11,710
created a small interface here between the vapor
and the liquid. This interface has the size

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,940
cosine θ dx. Hence, we have thus the variation of
energy as a function of the distance traveled

50
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,380
by the contact line, when the droplet
is at equilibrium, the surface

51
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,590
energy must be minimum. Which means
that whatever the small movement it 

52
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:34,380
can travel, the derivative at equilibrium
of the energy with respect of this small movement

53
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:41,380
must be equal to 0, which imposes an
expression for cosine θ which is simply

54
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:48,850
cosine θ is equal to γSV - γSL, I have
passed the two terms on the other side,

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,600
divided by γLV. This is Young's relation.
Now, how to link this expression

56
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,810
of cosine θ to the spreading parameter S?
We will simply superimpose on this next

57
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,120
slide, Young's relation and the definition 
of the spreading parameter. By small algebraic

58
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,990
calculations extremely simple, we see
that cosine θ, by making S appear, is

59
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:18,990
equal to S + γLV/γLV. In other words, cosine
θ = 1+S / γLV. Armed with this expression,

60
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,320
we will now, and remembering most of all
that cosine θ, by definition is always

61
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,320
ranged between -1 and 1, we will be able to,
in the plane, make the parameter S vary

62
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:44,450
from a positive value to a negative
value and deduce the values of θ

63
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:50,970
that correspond. We see that naturally
in the region where S is positive, cosine

64
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,690
θ cannot be defined because cosine θ
cannot be greater than 1 and so

65
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,000
we are in presence of a total wetting.
This is quite normal given

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,300
the definition of the spreading parameter
S of which we understand that if it is positive,

67
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,200
it is favorable for the solid to decorate itself
of liquid. However, once S becomes

68
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,400
negative, it is possible to form a small
droplet and θ will progressively take

69
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,070
values close to 0 until values 
close to Pi. We are in a situation

70
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:26,130
of partial wetting, with a spreading very
favorable when S is close to 0 and a

71
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,870
wetting which is very partial with a solid
that does not like the liquid in the situation

72
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,820
where S is much more negative. Whenever
S becomes really negative, we have a

73
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,060
phenomenon that we can qualify as non-wetting
or of wetting null, where, the droplet finally

74
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,900
cannot wet the interface. We
thus see that the situations of total

75
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,160
wetting, of wetting null or of partial wetting
are easily resulted in terms of

76
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,980
spreading parameter or wetting angle.
In order to complete this third module, we

77
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,770
will try to re-derivate Young's relation
by a small calculation of force. To do so, we

78
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,730
will consider the triple line, here,
and we will look at the forces that are applied

79
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,480
on this triple line. We have on one hand
the surface tension, I recall that we can

80
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,650
associate to the surface energy a surface
tension. We thus have the surface

81
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:22,650
tension between the liquid and the vapor (liquid-vapor)
that is pulling in the direction of the interface

82
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,880
of the droplet, then we have the surface
tension between the solid and the liquid that

83
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,690
is always pulling in the direction of the interface
between the solid and the liquid and the surface 

84
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:37,570
tension γS between the solid and the vapor
that is pulling in the direction of the interface

85
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,400
between the solid and the vapor. We will
project these three forces in the horinzontal

86
00:07:42,490 --> 00:08:05,400
direction Ox, we thus find -γSV +
γSL + γLV * cos θ, hence, with the fundamental law

87
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:12,470
of dynamics, when the droplet is at
equilibrium, cos θ is simply equal

88
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:19,930
to (γSV - γSL) / γLV, we find again 
Young's relation.
