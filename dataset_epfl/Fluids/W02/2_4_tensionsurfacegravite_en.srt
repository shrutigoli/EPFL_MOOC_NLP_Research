00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,680
Hello and welcome to this 4th module
of the second chapter of the course on fluid

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,879
mechanics. This 4th module deals with the
competition between the phenomena of surface

3
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,460
tension and the phenomena of gravity.
We will, in particular introduce a

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,430
length very important which dictates many
phenomena of the everyday life, 

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,320
namely the capillarity length. In order to
understand this competition, we will

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,279
introduce a first small experiment
which is extremely simple, we

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,949
deposit a small drop on a solid 
substrate, as we see on this photograph,

8
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:42,679
the droplet adopts the shape of a spherical cap
and the reason for it is that it must simultaneously

9
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,579
minimize its surface energy, in which
case the best possible shape is a shape

10
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,489
of a complete sphere, but it must also
satisfy the wetting condition that

11
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:57,399
we saw in the third module, i.e.
that the contact angle between the solid

12
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:04,339
surface and the droplet must be fixed by its
value given by Young's relation. It is

13
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:08,439
thus that this problem of minimization has for
solution a spherical cap, i.e.

14
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,270
a spherical portion. As we see
here, on this inlay, we see that

15
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:19,409
if we try to fit the shape of the droplet
by projection a piece of circle, the agreement

16
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,229
is excellent. However, if we deposit
a big droplet on a glass slide, we

17
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:28,130
see that this one absolutely does not take
the shape of a spherical cap, it

18
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,280
does not minimize in any case the surface energy,
but it minimizes on the contrary its potential

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,140
energy by adopting a shape of a puddle
extremely flat. The question that wew

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,880
will ask ourselves now, is to know
what conditions on the size of a

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,119
droplet, this droplet will prefer to take
shape of spherical cap or a shape

22
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,499
of a puddle. Let's consider in a general way,
a droplet of size h, of shape completely

23
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:54,899
arbitrary, for the moment we can imagine it
cubic, and let's try to estimate with a dimensional 

24
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,390
analysis what we sometimes call in
English terms "a scaling", what are the

25
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,369
orders of magnitude of the surface energies
and potential energies in play ? The order

26
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,899
of magnitude of the surface energy is given
by the product of the coefficient of surface

27
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:16,100
tension γ multiplied by h^2, it is indeed
h the only length that we have in 

28
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,250
this system. We will thus build the product
of a coefficient of surface energy by

29
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,120
a surface, which gives me an energy.
If I must determine the potential energy,

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,910
I must think that the potential energy
is nothing more than the work of weight,

31
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,590
it is therefore the weight ρgh^3 multiplied
by a length, and the only characteristic length

32
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:43,170
that I have is again h, this
gives me ρgh^4, it must be clear that here

33
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,420
I have put proportional signs so there
is in these relations, if we want to

34
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,420
clarify precisely, numerical
coefficients that can be products

35
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,870
of rational numbers, of Pi, of any kind
of numbers that would come from the geomtrical analysis

36
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,260
but that depend strongly on the geometry
that we consider whereas the interest

37
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:08,490
of dimensional analysis, or "scaling analysis"
is to estimate these contributions 

38
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,800
of surface energy and potential energy
independently of the detail of the droplet, and

39
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,120
that is why that in manner a little provocative
I have chosen a cubic droplet to begin

40
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,660
this argument. Now, we will meet
two situations : either the term of surface

41
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,400
energy will be bigger than the term
of potential energy or conversely. The

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,810
condition at which the surface energy
is bigger than the potential energy

43
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:38,810
is the following : γ*h^2 must be
greater than  ρ*g*h^4, which means that

44
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:51,210
h^2 must be smaller, those are all
positive numbers, than γ / (ρ*g), in other

45
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,840
words, h must be smaller than sqrt[γ / (ρ*g)].
In this first situation, h is greater

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,460
than the potential energy and the droplet will
adopt a spherical cap shape. When

47
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:20,049
h is smaller to sqrt[γ / (ρ*g)], the surface
energy dominates compared to the potential

48
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,710
energy and we are expecting to encounter
a shape of droplet that is a shape of spherical

49
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,820
cap as we have seen in the case
of the small droplet, indeed, this gives

50
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,360
a length of transition between the
small droplets that adopt a shape of

51
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,620
spherical cap and the big droplets.
Indeed, when h is this time greater

52
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,540
than sqrt[γ / (ρ*g)], the surface energy
is smaller than the potential energy,

53
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,940
the droplet prefers to minimize its potential
energy than minimize its surface

54
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,970
energy, it abandons the idea of taking
a spherical shape but prefers to take

55
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,160
the shape of a puddle and so, it appears
very natural in this reasoning a 

56
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,270
characteristic length  sqrt[γ / (ρ*g)]
that is named capillary length and

57
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,750
is often noted λC and when we
put the right values of surface tension,

58
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,030
of density, of gravity acceleration,
we discover that this length is roughly

59
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:21,030
equal, at 20°C, 2,7 mm for water and air.
In fact, this quantity (2,7 mm) is at the origin 

60
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,670
of huge numbers of phenomena that surround us
in the daily life. In particular, if

61
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,610
we pour water in a glass we see
that the meniscus is deforming near 

62
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,760
the lateral surface of the glass and is deforming
over a characteristic height that is of

63
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,780
a few millimeters and over a characteristic
distance that is also of the order

64
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,139
of a few millimeters. These few millimeters
are precisely the capillary length.

65
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,710
Similarly, when we leave the faucet
leak, we see that the droplets that are

66
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,330
detaching from it are droplets that simply have
a few millimeters of diameter, here again, 

67
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:03,060
their size is fixed by the capillary length.
Other example, I deposit paint on

68
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,360
a ceiling, droplets are formed, if the
droplets that are initially formed have

69
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,110
characteristic sizes that are smaller
than the capillary length, they will not detach

70
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,530
and they will not pearl from the ceiling,
hence the paint will remain hanged to the ceiling.

71
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:24,669
Similarly, in all sorts of capillary
phenomena in waterfalls and other phenomena

72
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,889
of percolation of water in the underground
cavities, we have phenomena 

73
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:35,550
of runoff with an attachment of capillary
film or of the capillary droplet to

74
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,669
horizontal surfaces when these droplets
or these thicknesses of film are smaller

75
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,740
than the capillary length. Last case, that
will allows me to come back on the quiz I

76
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,950
gave you at the very first module, the size
of a raindrop is also fixed by

77
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:56,310
the capillary length and this actually comes
from the fact that when a bigger droplet

78
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:03,180
is produced, let's imagine, it will fragment
until that exactly the effects of

79
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,810
gravity that are making the raindrop fall
and the capillary effects are more or less

80
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,350
in equilibrium, i.e. the droplet
is roughly equal to the capillary length. Naturally,

81
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,710
I say roughly, there is a certain
dispersion in the size of the droplets. It is

82
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,960
for me the way to explain why these
droplets are not profiled forwards,

83
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,430
nor profiled backwards but they are
spherical. The reason is very simple, as

84
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,120
at this scale here, i.e. the scale
of a few millimeters that is indeed

85
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,550
the size of a majority of raindrops
falling from the sky, the surface tension

86
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,830
is a dominant effect in comparison with
the gravity and that the gravity is in equilibrium

87
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,650
with the aerodynamic drag force that
is slowing down the droplet and allowing it to reach

88
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:47,449
its limit velocity. The phenomenon that dominates
is indeed the phenomenon of energy

89
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:52,780
of surface tension. The surface tension
dictates a spherical shape, hence, this droplet

90
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,720
takes a spherical shape. Another phenomenon
in which there is a competition extremely

91
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,430
interesting between surface tension and
gravity, is the phenomenon called capillary 

92
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:07,250
rise. You simply have to take
a straw and to put in contact this straw

93
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,130
(or capillary tube) in a liquid bath.
We see, you already all did it 

94
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,820
at least once in your life, that the liquid
climbs in the tube, it is a bit the principle 

95
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,330
of the pipette. It actually climbs of a length
that is widely greater than the capillary

96
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,150
length. It can climb several centimeters
whereas in the case of air as I 

97
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,690
was saying, the capillary length is typically
a few millimeters, so, why

98
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,760
? In order to answer this question,
we must anticipate a little on the next

99
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,189
course by introducing the basis of hydrostatics.
The basis of hydrostatics are such that

100
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:41,839
for a fluid at rest, it is Pascal's law,
the pressure gradient is equal to - ρg

101
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,119
where g is the gravity acceleration,
which results in the case of a recipient

102
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:52,019
with vertical walls in the following manner
: The pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure

103
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,769
at the liquid's surface minus ρgz with z
directed upwards hence you observe,

104
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,040
and this is natural, that the pressure is
stronger at the bottom of the recipient. This is the first

105
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,329
ingredient that we need, the second
ingredient that we need, is to

106
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:09,350
remember that the interface is curved, we
have a meniscus on top of this liquid

107
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,980
column that has climbed and this meniscus adopts
a curvature that will have to be determined,

108
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,589
that we will call R. Given the
shape of the meniscus, you can already guess

109
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:26,509
that the pressure inside the liquid
(so in this meniscus) is smaller than

110
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,660
the atmospheric pressure. It is that, this
depression, this sort of suction, this

111
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,180
sucking force that is making the fluid climb.
Let's zoom in a little closer to the triple

112
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,920
line that was the subject of module 3 of
this course, the region where the gas, the liquid

113
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,059
and the solid are in contact and we have
learned in the previous module that in this

114
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:54,059
configuration, the contact angle θ is given
by Young's relation as a function of three physico-chemical 

115
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:59,129
properties that are : the surface tension
liquid-gas, the surface tension solid-gas

116
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:03,040
and the surface tension solid-liquid. For 
us, what is important to remember is

117
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,309
that cos θ is fixed by the physic-chemistry
of the interface and fluids in presence. 

118
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:14,670
Now, if we look at a slice of
this spherical cap interface, we

119
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,999
see r the capillary radius, we also
see θ the contact angle and the question

120
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:24,089
that we ask ourselves is : "What is the
length of the curvature radius ?" I.e.

121
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,179
what is the radius of the spherical cap
? To do so, we must remember that by

122
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:34,910
definition of a circle, the angle must be
right between the tangent of the circle and the radius

123
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,079
and as the vertical is perpendicular
to the horizontal, we see that the red

124
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,569
angle also has θ for value, so it becomes
extremely easy to determine the radius

125
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:50,569
of curvature R which is simply equal to
r/ cos θ. Let's go back to our phenomenon of capillary

126
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,720
rise, we see that there are two ways
to determine the pressure in A. The first one

127
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,829
is to determine it by a capillary argument,
like we just have done. The pressure

128
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:11,339
A is thus equal to p0, the atmospheric pressure,
minus 2γ*cos θ / r.  Cosine θ/r,  is

129
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,790
the curvature radius and the 2 comes from the fact
that it concerns a spherical cap and not

130
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,619
a piece of circle. A second way
to determine the pressure in A, we simply

131
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:24,939
make a hydrostatic calculation, the pressure
in B, given the small deformation

132
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:29,529
of an interface outside the capillary tube
is equal to the atmospheric pressure, the

133
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:35,160
small drive of the tube. So the pressure
in A is equal to p, atmospheric pressure 

134
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,079
which is also equal to pB- ρ*g*z0, z0 being
the height. Equalization of these two pressures

135
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:48,079
: it results that z0, the height of capillary
rise is equal to 2γ*cos θ / ρ*g*r,

136
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,420
it is what we call Jurin's law. 
Hence, the height of capillary rise is

137
00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:00,149
inversely proportional to the capillary radius,
as we have seen on this picture. Another

138
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:04,679
conclusion, if cos θ is negative, i.e. 
the contact angle is greater

139
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:10,670
than pi/2 then we can expect a
capillary fall, it is a phenomenon

140
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,589
indeed encountered with mercury that
is very little wetting.
