00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,379
Hello and welcome to this fifth module
of the second chapter of the course on fluid

2
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:13,320
mechanics. Second chapter that deals 
with the effect of surface tension or interfacial 

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,660
tension. In this fifth module we
will especially be interested 

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,989
in the phenomena that occur when
the value of the tension of the constant of

5
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:29,360
surface tension is inhomogeneous in space
: Meaning that it is not the same

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,480
in different points of the interface between
two immiscible fluids, in this case, we

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,160
will see that flows are created
that we call Marangoni flows.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,340
We speak in a more general way of the Marangoni
effect. These inhomogeneities of the surface

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,150
tension can have two origins. On one
hand an origin linked to the value of the

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:56,329
temperature. On the other an origin linked
to the presence of small molecules that

11
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:01,980
we call surfactants and that are
snuggled at the interface between the two fluids

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,909
immiscible and that change the
physic-chemical properties of the interface

13
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,960
and thus the value of the inter-facial tension.
Today we will describe several

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,119
experiments. We will begin right
now with a first experiment that is 

15
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:22,509
the following : let's consider a beaker filled
with water to the surface of which we deposit

16
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:29,280
little dusts that float at the
surface. We then approach a burning soldering 

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,280
iron and we observe what happens.
We see that the small dusts tend

18
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:44,579
to diverge,
this divergent motion being centered on
the hot point. If we look a little

19
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,560
closer by moving the soldering iron,
we see the phenomenon from a little closer 

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,560
with here, a radial motion, divergent from
the warmest point. How to explain

21
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:13,950
this phenomenon ? What is at the origin of this
divergent radial motion ? In order to analyze it,

22
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,430
we need to know the dependency 
of the constant of surface tension as a function

23
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,840
of temperature, and for the majority of
the fluid pairs, I recall that in fact,

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,760
the surface tension is always defined
for fluid pairs, here it is

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,189
for water and air, most of the time, the
surface tension is a decreasing function

26
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,090
of the temperature. Here, we have measurements
in the laboratory, these are measurements

27
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,750
quite delicate to realize technically,
of the surface tension between water and oil,

28
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,959
as a function of temperature. We see
that, if we increase the temperature of about twenty

29
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,790
degrees to a hundred degrees, the 
surface tension is more or less divided

30
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,730
by 2, these are thus very significant effects.
Now we know that, in a general

31
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,200
manner, for a big majority of
fluid pairs the surface tension decreases

32
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,840
with temperature. We can understance
the experiment. The soldering iron is here represented 

33
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,340
schematically in blue, locally the temperature
is greater, and I just told you

34
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,019
that when the temperature is greater,
the surface tension meanwhile is smaller.

35
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:24,019
Naturally, this hot point diffuses slowly
in the beaker but far from the hot point,

36
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,189
the temperature remains at the ambient temperature 
that I note T0 and so the surface tension

37
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:35,230
remains at its ambient value γ0. γ0, as
I have indicated is greater than γ-,

38
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:40,749
thus, along the interface, we will
have a traction force of the surface

39
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:45,049
tensions that are the weakest towards the strongest
surface tensions and so from the hot

40
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:52,049
point towards the cold points, towards the cold
edges of this beaker. This will create 

41
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,260
recirculation zones, the fluid will be put
into motion along the interface and

42
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,939
will be put into motion inside
the beaker like it has been represented

43
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:10,030
here, by these streamlines. Here is the explanation
of the phenomenon that we have seen. We can

44
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,129
also consider that what is happening when we 
cool down locally the interface. It is

45
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:20,810
still a Marangoni effect. Here we add 
a metallic ball that has been widely

46
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,050
cooled down and we visualize simultaneously the flow
and in the same time the temperature field

47
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,380
thanks to a thermal camera, an infrared
camera that deduces the temperature. What do

48
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,890
we see? We see that when we 
add, it is not really an ice cube 

49
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:39,780
but a frozen ball, locally the surface
tension increases and it induces a converging

50
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,330
motion. Even though the visualization is
not spectacular, it is quite possible

51
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,530
to see the converging motion towards the cold
point. Unlike what is happening when

52
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,280
we had heated with the soldering iron, we 
had a diverging motion from the hot

53
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,370
point. Another way to make the
surface tension vary, as I had said in

54
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:05,370
the introduction, is to add what we 
call tension-active molecules or sometimes, 

55
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,120
by an Anglicism, surfactants. In this
cases here, these surfactants, that have a hydrophilic 

56
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,830
head, i.e. that like water, but
however a lyophilic tail , i.e.

57
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,930
that like lipids, these surfactants will
snuggle at the interface and will leave this

58
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:27,250
interface less deformable, less mobile
and will in particular, also, reduce the

59
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,490
inter-facial tension and it is actually the
reason why we add soap

60
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,800
or dish-washing liquid when we want
to form bubbles. Indeed, as the surface

61
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,410
tension is lower, the pressure
difference at the edges of the bubble of which we

62
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,400
have seen is proportional, on one
hand, to the total curvature but also to

63
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,190
the surface tension. The overpressure required
to form the bubble is smaller in presence 

64
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,120
of soap than in absence of soap. Hence, if
we want to form soap bubbles, we

65
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,270
need to add surfactants to
decrease the surface tension. This decrease

66
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,840
of the surface tension can be extremely 
drastic when we use soaps 

67
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,080
of good quality, which allows to create
huge bubbles. Now that we have

68
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,240
understood that locally the surface tension
decreases thanks to the presence of tension-active

69
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,020
molecules, we can redo the previous 
experiment that consists in taking a beaker,

70
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,580
to seed it with small dusts
but this time we will not approach

71
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,630
a soldering iron but we will simply
bring through a pipette a small drop

72
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:37,630
of dish-washing liquid. And look at an extremely spectacular
effect of diverging flow from

73
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,530
the point where we have added the surfactants.
The sketch is thus exactly identical, 

74
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,960
the surfactants, here represented by a
small drop of dish-washing liquid locally

75
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,650
decreases, and this in a way extremely sensible,
the surface tension. A flow is created

76
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,690
which is a radial diverging flow and
which creates in consequence here in a cross-sectional view,

77
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:07,600
a movement of recirculation also inside
the beaker. Now, we can use

78
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,760
this Marangoni effect that we call solution-capillary
as it comes from the presence of molecules

79
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,910
in a solution, we can indeed use
this Marangoni effect to create a system

80
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:24,910
of Marangoni propulsion. Let's imagine a small
raft that is floating here, at the surface of the beaker,

81
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,940
this one is in equilibrium between the left
and the right, let's not forget that it is a

82
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,080
section so this one is in radial equilibrium,
i.e. the forces of surface

83
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,150
tension that are pulling on this raft are balanced out
one by one in all radial directions

84
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,430
of this raft, or here, between the left and the
right. We will add, in an asymmetric way,

85
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:51,070
a little bit of soap. What is happening ? Locally
the surface tension is reduced, and you

86
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:58,070
already see that the capillary traction on 
the right of the raft is greater than the

87
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,650
capillary traction on the left, so that
the raft will move towards the right.

88
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:08,680
It is indeed what we can observe
on the following film. The raft is here, initially

89
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,570
at equilibrium, it is stabilized. We add
the droplet of surfactant, the droplet of dish-washing

90
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,480
liquid in this case. See how
fast this propulsion phenomenon is efficient.

91
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,350
It is now time for me to resume
what we have seen in this second chapter

92
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,120
of fluid mechanics, second chapter
that dealt with phenomena of surface

93
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,209
tension, i.e. phenomena that
occur when we put in contact

94
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:39,209
two immiscible fluids. We have successively
during the first module, introduced the notion

95
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,210
of surface tension, we have interpreted it
either as an energy per unit area,

96
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,190
it is the formula that is here represented
on the slide, but we have also 

97
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,490
interpreted it as a force of tension.
Maybe if you want to remember

98
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,520
an experiment very representative of
this notion of tension, think simply 

99
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,400
of the experiment of the bar where a small bar
free to roll on a frame and held in

100
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,080
equilibrium by two strings of soap that hold it
symmetrically and when we break 

101
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,520
one of the two strings, the equilibrium is broken
and the bar starts rolling in the direction

102
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,790
of the string that is pulling on it so there is a 
phenomenon of surface tension. In the second

103
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:27,130
module we have defined, demonstrated and used
Laplace's law, Laplace's law is

104
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:34,130
the law that determines the pressure difference
at the boundaries of a curved interface and when

105
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,260
the interface is curved, the pressure
difference is simply equal to γ (coefficient

106
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,380
of surface tension), multiplied by the
total curvature. Here again, if you want

107
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,580
to remember a striking experiment,
simply think of this experiment where 

108
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,270
two bubbles are connected, a small one and
a big one, and where we observe that the small one

109
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,100
is emptied in the big one simply because
the over-pressure inside the small

110
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,270
bubble is greater than the over-pressure
inside the big bubble. Then,

111
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,770
we have in the third module, talked about
wetting. Wetting are the phenomena 

112
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:12,770
that occur when we put into contact
a liquid on a solid substrate in the presence

113
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,300
of a gaseous phase. In this case, a droplet
is generally formed and this droplet

114
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,980
has a contact angle θ that is defined by
Young's relation here represented. You

115
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,460
do not need to know this formula
by heart, however it is quite useful to

116
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,490
simply remember that this angle is a
property associated to the chemical properties

117
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,310
of these 3 phases, i.e. the surface 
tension between the solid and the vapor, the

118
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,790
surface tension between the solid and the liquid
and the surface tension between the liquid 

119
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,420
and the vapor. We have then approached the
competition between the surface tension that

120
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:55,420
is trying to keep the interfaces the more
spherical as possible and the gravity that is trying

121
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,040
to minimize the potential energy of gravity
and we have in particular introduced a

122
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,560
characteristic length very important
which is the capillary length and showed

123
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,750
the role of this capillary length in 
Jurin's law which is the rise of a 

124
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,700
small column of liquid in a capillary tube.
Today, in this fifth module, we

125
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,900
have discussed of the Marangoni effect, these are
the flows that occur when

126
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,800
the surface tension is not a constant
but when it depends on space. The reason

127
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,000
for which this surface tension will
depend on space can be linked to

128
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
inhomogeneities in temperature or to
the presence of non-homogeneous matter of

129
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,300
soap type molecules that we call
surfactants. Hence is concluded the second

130
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:51,009
chapter of the course on fluid mechanics.
