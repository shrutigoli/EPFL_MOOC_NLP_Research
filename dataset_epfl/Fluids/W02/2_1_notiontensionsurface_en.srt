00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,150
Hello, and welcome to this second
chapter

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,090
of the fluid mechanics course.
This chapter will deal with the notion of

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,410
surface tension

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,329
and capillarity phenomena.

5
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:14,820
It will be organized

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,170
in 5 submodules.  

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,630
Firstly, the first module in which we will

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,630
define the notion of surface tension
as both as

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,849
an energy per unit of area but
also

10
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:30,000
as a force per unit of length.
Then, in a second sub-module in which

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,109
we will introduce Laplace's law which
links the pressure differential

12
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,790
to the bounds of a curved interface.
Next, we will introduce

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,950
the notion of wetting which is the
spreading phenomenon of a liquid

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,150
on a solid support.

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,989
Will then come a fourth module

16
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,560
in which we will introduce a length,
very important, which is the capillarity length which is

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,320
derived from the competition between the effect of
surface tension and the effect

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,019
of gravity. Finally will come the Marangoni
effects

19
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:05,530
in the fifth module, which are
the effects related

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,570
to the 

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,409
variation of surface tension in space,
thus to gradients of surface tension

22
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,100
causing movements

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,100
in the fluid. Before getting to the heart of the subject
and beginning the first module,

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,640
here's a little quiz to warm up.
In this quiz, we will seek to determine

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,060
what is the shape of a rain drop
falling from the sky.

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,150
A rain drop is characterized
by its

27
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,979
velocity that I will let you estimate,
but also by its size which

28
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,570
can be millimeters or maybe at the
maximum centimeters.

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,500
When this rain drop falls, the
question we ask ourselves is what shape does it take.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,400
In a classical representation where
the gravity is pointed downwards, vertically,

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,580
I give you three proposals: the 
first one is that the drop takes

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,530
a shape profiled backwards, it is
thus aerodynamically profiled 

33
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,100
by deforming itself with a pointed tail.

34
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:08,100
Second proposal, the drop stays isotropic with a 
symmetric shape (i.e. spherical).

35
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,150
Third proposal, it develops a 
point forward,

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,289
so as to penetrate better in the air.

37
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:16,620
It will only be in module 4

38
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,260
that we will introduce the concepts
necessary

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,200
to answer this question, but I think
it is important that you develop

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,900
your intuition to try
to answer at this first quiz.

41
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Let's get to the heart of 
the heart of the subject

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,919
and let's consider two immiscible fluids,
a light grey fluid

43
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,809
and a dark grey fluid, or more 
mundanely maybe water and

44
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:37,279
oil

45
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,199
in contact along a curved interface.

46
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,449
So let's considers here two liquids,
I recall that liquids are condensed

47
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:48,709
phases in which the molecules,
although disorganized,  are very dense,

48
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,239
the density is very high,

49
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,599
which means that the reason
why we left the gas

50
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,929
state towards a liquid state
comes from the fact that the

51
00:02:56,929 --> 00:03:01,470
molecules have attractive forces. Therefore,
the phase is condensed.

52
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,609
Due to cohesive forces
in the fluid

53
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:07,649
it is clear that the molecules which
stay immersed in their own

54
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:14,489
fluid, which is the case represented, here, to
the left, these molecules have interactions

55
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,600
all attractive around them and
thus feel relatively happy. Conversely,

56
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,639
the molecule that is located at the interface

57
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,200
will simply have half of the attractive interactions
with the surrounding molecules

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,600
and another half of unknown 
interactions with the dark grey

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,400
fluid surrounding it. If two fluids
are not miscible

60
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:34,839
it is clear

61
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,400
that these two fluids

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,400
"do not like each other".

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,569
Each fluid prefers not to be in contact
with the surrounding fluid

64
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:46,819
which means in other words that the
attractive interactions between both

65
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:47,280
fluids,

66
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,110
of a molecule of fluid 1 with a
molecule of a fluid 2

67
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,059
are weaker than the attractive

68
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:57,000
interactions within each fluid. In 
thermodynamic terms, this means that the free energy

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,800
of both fluids in contact is greater than
the free energy of the fluids taken separately.

70
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,879
For that we have to do a thought experiment and isolate

71
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,409
the part of the light grey fluid
in an environment

72
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:14,500
of the same fluid and the dark grey part
in an environment

73
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,120
of dark grey fluid. If we do this experiment,
it is clear that the molecules located at the interface

74
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,829
are now surrounded

75
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:27,829
of molecules of the same type so of molecules
with which they have attractive and cohesive forces.

76
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:32,330
Thus, the freed energy is lower than
the free energy of the fluids in contact.

77
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,349
It follows that the creation of interfaces
between two immiscible fluids

78
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:39,189
has an energetic cost.
This energetic cost

79
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,490
is proportional to the surface

80
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,289
of the interface between the two fluids.
The constant of proportionality

81
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:48,050
is what we call interfacial
tension,

82
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,809
also sometimes called surface
tension,

83
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:53,829
often denoted gamma,
sometimes sigma, but what is the 

84
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:58,660
most important, is what it measures, as
it is an energy per unit area,

85
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,509
in joule per m^2.
Here is the definition of surface tension. 

86
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,930
From then on it is clear that when the bubbles 
or the spherical droplets

87
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,509
are formed

88
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,050
these will try to adopt a
spherical shape because

89
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,069
they want to get a minimal

90
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:20,500
free energy and so a minimal
interface for a given volume.

91
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,460
When I say here: "It is clear", 

92
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,400
it is likely that this notion is
intuitive and that we are all considering that

93
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,250
amongst all possible shape,
the shape

94
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,080
which has the minimum area for a given volume
is of course

95
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,200
the sphere.

96
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:37,110
This is more delicate to
prove

97
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,349
and to prove it, we will
use

98
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:40,400
the isoperimetric 

99
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,319
inequality

100
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,880
stated in 3 dimensions

101
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,220
stipulates that 36*pi*V^2, for any
object is smaller than its surface area^3. 

102
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,719
Let's try to apply
this theorem to the case of a sphere.

103
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:57,379
The volume

104
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,400
is equal to

105
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,580
(4/3)*pi*R^3,

106
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,889
whereas the surface

107
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:10,889
is equal to 4*pi*R^2.
if I replace the 36*pi*V^2

108
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,199
by its expression, we obtain
36 that I decompose by

109
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,800
9*4*pi*16/9

110
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,969
they are the squares of 4/3

111
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:30,150
pi^2 gives in total pi^3 and R^6.

112
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:37,150
On the other hand if I take S^3, I obtain
the surface^3 expressed

113
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:45,600
16*4*pi^3*r^6

114
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:50,889
You see that the 9 are gone and that
we have here a strict identity

115
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:53,819
between the two terms of the isoperimetric
inequality.

116
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,580
It appears that the sphere is a shape
that saturates this inequality,

117
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,139
indeed, the sphere is,

118
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,649
we can prove it, the minimum
surface for a given volume.

119
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:05,580
We will in fact encounter

120
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,960
quite often the notion of minimum
surface when we will

121
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,240
consider soap films.
Thus,

122
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,319
the

123
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:22,100
soap film, when it is forced to press against
rigid contours, for example on two metallic circles

124
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:24,639
adopt a shape that minimizes

125
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,249
its surface

126
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:28,710
while pressing against the
prescribed countours.

127
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,840
This shape is called a catenoid,
it is in fact a sort of small chain with

128
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,970
a revolution symmetry.

129
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,630
We quickly see that

130
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,389
this catenoid

131
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,100
has the minimum surface. We already see
that it has an exposed surface between

132
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,440
the soap film and the air which is lower
than the one of a flat cylinder

133
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,009
but to demonstrate that it is minimum,
it is not obvious.

134
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:47,900
In fact,

135
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,800
it is interesting to note that the soap films

136
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,800
realize these minimum shape there where the mathematicians 

137
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,400
suffer greatly to write the equations
that describe these shapes.

138
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,700
Depending on the
contours on which will be pressed

139
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,200
the soap films, we will obtain all kinds
of minimum surfaces, catenoids

140
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,200
helicoids but also a huge diversity of shape.

141
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,400
We will come back on this catenoid
a little later in the course.

142
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,000
To understand the link between this notion of
surface tension as surface

143
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,889
energy and the fact that we
call it a tension,

144
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:18,990
the word tension points to a force.

145
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,990
We will realize the experiment of the
bar.

146
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,110
A bar is situated in equilibrium held to the left and to the right by two

147
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,719
plane soap films. The bar is free of
rolling along

148
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:33,980
the frame on which it is laying. We will
then burst 

149
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:39,650
one of the two sides of the soap film.

150
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,169
If the left part is burst

151
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,289
we see that

152
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,100
the equilibrium is broken

153
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,170
the surface tension is now exerted 
only on the right of the bar

154
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,100
which starting to move, pulled
by the soap film.

155
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
How to model this experiment?

156
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,100
We will try to determine the
force that must be applied

157
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:03,999
to keep a bar in equilibrium when 
this later is subjected

158
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,950
on the other side to a soap

159
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,110
film. To do so, we will do an energetic reasoning.
The first step is very natural,

160
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,980
we must

161
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,130
calculate the work of the force

162
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,840
when the bar reaches a new
position at distance x.

163
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,840
This work is expressed very naturally,
it is simply the product of

164
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,930
the force multiplied by the distance on
which this force has worked

165
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,300
i.e. x.

166
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,600
Now we will try to
determine the variation of surface

167
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,389
energy.

168
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:39,950
This surface energy has decreased

169
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,040
because

170
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,810
the interface has decreased

171
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,230
of a quantity

172
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,200
that is x*L

173
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,660
It is the part that I have here
hatched

174
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,610
which was suppressed

175
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,660
of the interface. This the gain of surface
energy is

176
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,400
x*L*2

177
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,180
because the film has an upper part and a
lower part,

178
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,980
multiplied by γ

179
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,180
now I am asking this work force
to be equal 

180
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,780
to the surface energy gain

181
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,340
by energy conservation.
It appears that the force

182
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,910
is equal to 2*L*γ (γ: surface tension)

183
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,960
and here,

184
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,190
it appears very clearly that the
surface tension is a

185
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,480
force per unit length.

186
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,139
i.e. Newtons per meter.
You are going to tell me :

187
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,679
"How can surface tension
be simultaneously

188
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,139
an energy per area unit and
a force per length unit ?" Well,

189
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,110
no problem,

190
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,300
in fact these two units are
totally equivalent

191
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,360
In order to finish this chapter, we will 
consider one last experiment

192
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,910
where surface tension

193
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,340
appears in the same time as a tension
force and also as an

194
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,270
energy in area units.
Here is this experiment,

195
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,580
we are

196
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,480
forming a small closed

197
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,999
loop in a soap film.

198
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,700
This loop

199
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,210
of string is initially closed

200
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,730
then we are going to burst the film in
the inside of the very delicate loop.

201
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,370
What is going to happen?

202
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,510
The external soap film will pull on

203
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,450
the string, in a way to minimize

204
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,660
the surface exposed by the soap film
and thus

205
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,390
form a very open loop until 
the film breaks off because this film

206
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,650
is draining because of the cavity, the
soap is flowing along the film. This in this

207
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,010
experiment of the burst of a soap film,

208
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,570
we have seen that the soap film
is looking to minimize its surface, which

209
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,600
is possible thanks to the force of surface
tension and that the loop is

210
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,980
stretched at its maximum and adopts a shape
approximatively circular.
