00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:08,289
Hello and welcome to this second module
of the second chapter of fluid mechanics.

2
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:13,169
Second chapter that is dedicated to the phenomena
of surface tension and capillarity.

3
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:20,169
In this second module, we will introduce
a fundamental law, phenomena of

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:27,210
capillarity that we call Laplace's law.
Before making a formal derivation,

5
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:33,140
we will firstly use a method
extremely powerful that will be detailed 

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,640
widely during the chapter 3, a method
extremely powerful that is called the method

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,409
of dimensional analysis. The question to
which we want to answer is to know

8
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:48,829
how is linked the pressure difference
(P2-P1) at the boundaries of a droplet or of a

9
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:56,400
bubble. I am calling "droplet" liquid drops
in a liquid and I am probably saying with

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:05,700
a slight abuse of notation "bubble" a drop
of gas in a liquid. Let's call, for the

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,810
moment this drop and this drop of fluid
2 in a fluid 1 at a pressure difference

12
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,560
at its borders P2 - P1 and I would like to know
how it depends on the parameters of the problem,

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,960
namely the radius of the bubble or the drop,
but also the coefficient of surface tension

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,219
of which I suspect that this has a certain
importance. I know that it is much more

15
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:31,200
difficult to do very big droplets
in certain fluids than in others. I

16
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,320
will thus simply proceed in the following
manner, I will express the pressure

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,409
difference: P2 - P1 in its fundamentals units,
i.e. Newtons per meter^2. I express

18
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,359
the surface tension in these fundamental units
: Newtons per meter. I express the radius,

19
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:52,000
in its fundamental unit, the meter. Now,
I am looking for exponents for each of these

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,950
important parameters, the surface tension
at the power α, the radius at the power

21
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,780
β such to obtain that γ power α
multiplied by the radius to the power β 

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,490
gives me the units of pressure i.e.
N/m^2. It is not complicated to

23
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:12,340
be convinced that by choosing to divide
the surface tension which is in N/m by the

24
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:20,200
radius which is in m, I obtain N/m^2. Hence,
α = 1, β = -1  and I obtain a link of proportionality

25
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,080
between the pressure difference P2 - P1 which
is proportional to γ/R. Now, the

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,090
main question, is the value and above all
the sign of the proportionality constant.

27
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,620
Indeed, it is natural to think that this
sign is positive. Why ? Because

28
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,620
due to the inflated shape of the bubble, it
is natural to think that P2 > P1, this is

29
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,220
not certain yet. It is fundamental to
know if the pre-factor is equal to 1, 2 10 or

30
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,489
10 000. Hence, in order to answer these two
very important questions : what is the

31
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,170
sign of the proportionality coefficient
but also what is it value, we will

32
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:03,590
make the following reasoning in energy.
In order to determine this proportionality coefficient,

33
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,290
i.e. both its sign and its numerical
value, we will make a reasoning

34
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:13,900
in energy. This is a thought
experiment by making an infinitesimal

35
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,189
perturbation, it is a method extremely
common in physics and in fluid mechanics.

36
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:24,830
We will consider that our droplet of
fluid 2 in a fluid 1 of pressure

37
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:31,110
difference P2 - P1 goes from a radius R to a
radius R + dR with dR infinitesimally small

38
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,579
(i.e. it is very small). We will express
firstly the surface energy

39
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:43,799
as a function of the surface. We know that
it is simply the product of γ (surface

40
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,349
tension) by S, then, we will look
at what is equal the surface of a sphere, we

41
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:57,349
already know that it is 4*pi*R^2, no difficulty.
Now, I take the derivative of S with

42
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:05,370
R and I obtain simply 8*pi*R by
derivative of R^2. Hence, this means that

43
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:16,900
the variation of surface for an increment
of radius dR is equal to 8*pi*R dR, it

44
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:29,100
follows that the variation of surface energy
is equal to γ*8*pi*R dR, result that

45
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,100
I carry over to my following sheet. Henceforth
I must determine what is the work of

46
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,740
the pressure forces. These pressure forces
P2 - P1 have worked on a surface

47
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,590
4*pi*R^2 and according to an excursion dR. Hence,
the work of the pressure, is simply

48
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:56,100
(P2 - P1)*4*pi*R^2 dR, if I equalize these two
quantities, I obtain that P2 - P1 = 2*γ/R.

49
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:02,800
Hence, I find the factor 2 which is both
the numerical value of the proportionality

50
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,590
coefficient that I was looking for (of the
Laplace's law) but also and above all a positive

51
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,720
number. Which means that our intuitive idea
that P2 had to be greater

52
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,900
to P1 is indeed verified. Now,
we will try to make a similar

53
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,819
reasoning in the case of a circular droplet,
we will not consider a circular droplet

54
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:26,310
because it does not really exist, fluid
mechanics are not bi-dimensional, but

55
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,970
we will instead consider a cylindric
droplet and we will reason by units

56
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:41,700
of length L. If I reason as previously,
I can easily determine that as

57
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:50,500
S is simply the surface of the cylinder
2*pi*R*L, it follows that dS, the variation

58
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,229
of surface is 2*pi*dR*L. We have here a
proportionality relation, i.e.

59
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:03,349
a linear relation that links R to S, hence,
the derivative is expressed extremely easily.

60
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:10,259
Here, I must to be accurate, multiply
by my quantity L per unit length

61
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,930
perpendicular to the screen, then I obtain 
the work of the pressure forces as previously

62
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,520
so these pressure forces work on
a cylinder 2*pi*R of surface 2*pi*R*L and

63
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,440
on an excursion dR. Hence, if I equalize
the two, the Ls fall and I obtain 

64
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,720
simply P2 - P1 = γ/R and so I find
this time a factor 1 and not a factor 2,

65
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,220
again the sign seems intuitive
but why this change in numerical value

66
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,539
? The strength of Laplace's law is to propose
a totally general form for the pressure

67
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:46,900
difference at the boundaries of a curved interface.
This expression is the following, we must

68
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,509
firstly introduce the total curvature
which is the product of the two radii of principal

69
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:57,569
curvature, in each point of a surface,
I define two osculating circles, the osculating

70
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:04,569
circle of minimum radius, and the osculating circle
of maximum radius. If I take the sum of the

71
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:12,000
inverse of these radii, it defines me the
total curvature. Hence, Laplace's law,

72
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:20,800
in its expression the most general, is written
simply P2 - P1 = γ(1/Rmin+1/Rmax),

73
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,800
i.e, pressure difference = surface
tension * total curvature. I will 

74
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,569
illustrate on a few example what is the value
of this total curvature. First of all

75
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:36,199
we can consider the most simple case,
of the sphere. Of course the sphere, the two

76
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:43,199
osculating circles in a given point have
an equal radius, i.e. Rmin = Rmax

77
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:51,270
= R. It is really, the sphere, a surface
extremely particular that has a uniform

78
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:55,860
curvature in any point, equal in any point,
equal to the radius of the sphere, so the total

79
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,860
curvature, that we often write C is equal
to 1/R+1/R = 2/R. Now, if I take

80
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,970
the example of a cylinder, in a direction,
the osculating circle that I manage to inscribe

81
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:14,319
to a radius R, radius of the cylinder and in the other
direction, however, the radius of curvature

82
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,759
is infinite. We see that a line is
absolutely not curved which means that

83
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:24,370
its radius of curvature is infinite. Hence, the
curvature of a cylinder, is simply

84
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:31,370
1/R and not 2/R. We hence see why
the two formulas that we obtained for the circular

85
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,880
droplet and the spherical droplet are
not exactly the same, all of this is included

86
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,260
in the most general formula of Laplace's
law. If now, I take a form

87
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,750
of a saddle, or a mountain pass,
I obtain two curvature radii of different

88
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,660
sign, one is pointing outwards
of the surface, the other is pointing inwards

89
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,470
of the surface. These two radii can be
equal in absolute value, I can come to

90
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:59,500
an interesting situation where the curvature
is 0. A situation of fluid mechanics

91
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,300
where we will often encounter surfaces
with zero curvature are in fact the situations

92
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,610
in which the surface is open. If we
take back the experiment of the catenoid that

93
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,110
we have dealt with earlier on, we see
that the pressure inside the catenoid

94
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,890
is equal to the pressure outside
the catenoid. Indeed, in both cases

95
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,210
we have the atmospheric pressure. Hence,
the sum of the two curvature radii must

96
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:33,210
be equal to 0 in order to satisfy a
pressure gap null. This shape that has

97
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:40,330
both curvature radii equal is called
catenoid. When we progressively moved apart

98
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:47,170
the two cylinders, we force the shape to
curve itself more and more until the

99
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,510
film is broken. So according to you, why
does the film break? Does the film break

100
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,100
because locally the soap film becomes
too thin ? Does the film break because

101
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,760
the catenoid solution stops existing
or does the film break because the surface

102
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,760
energy that is composed by the two full
discs is inferior to the one of the catenoid

103
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,390
? It is a question quite interesting,
we will come back to it in the exercises. I will still

104
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,280
now, just for the fun of it, 
propose a little reasoning in terms of force in

105
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,090
the case of the circle. As we have done in
previous chapter, we can always

106
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,600
interpret the surface tension either as
an energy per unit area, or as

107
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,200
a force per unit length... And it is
what I am trying to do here, so if I call

108
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,200
F the force that is exerted by the tension
along the interface, this tension force.

109
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,880
I see that the tension force, named gamma,
is exerted once projected along the vertical

110
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:51,840
in the form of 2 (because there is twice the
force, to the left and to the right), 2*γ*θ/2,

111
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,440
in the same way, the pressure force
is applied on a surface more or less flat,

112
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:16,050
the cosine of θ is roughly equal to
1 and of length θ*R, it is the length of

113
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:22,110
the circular arc, hence, I have this identity.
If I equalize these two quantities, I obtain

114
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:28,520
P2- P1 = γ/R, we find again previous result. 
Hence, we have demonstrated in two

115
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,030
particular cases, the sphere and the circle,
and by two different method : Laplace's

116
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,260
law, the demonstration of the general
formula of Laplace's law requires

117
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,960
methods of vectorial analysis that
are beyond the scope of this course. Another

118
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,390
small experiment that will continue
developing an intuition on the important

119
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,770
consequences of Laplace's law : Let's imagine
that we have connected a small bubble

120
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:54,740
to a bigger bubble with a tube and that we
have managed to close this tube with a valve

121
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,180
and that suddenly, we open this valve.
What is going to happen ? Will the big

122
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,029
bubble empty itself in the small one ? Or on the contrary,
will the small one empty in the big one ?

123
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:09,200
Or will nothing move ? It is a question
that challenges a little the intuition but in order to

124
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,200
answer it, I will show you an answer
with an experiment firstly.

125
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:33,100
Now that we have discovered the answer with
an experiment, namely that the small bubble

126
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,370
empties itself in the big one, we will try 
to understand why. We know, under

127
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,660
Laplace's law, that the overpressure
inside the bubble is inversely proportional

128
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,980
to the radius of the bubble. Hence, the overpressure
inside the small bubble is greater

129
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,930
than the overpressure inside the big
bubble. Yet, when we connect two tanks

130
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,480
of pressure by a tube, the flow is
always created from the high towards the low

131
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,850
pressure, it is what we call, when 
the fluid is sufficiently viscous or sufficiently 

132
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,610
slow, in any case when Reynolds number
is sufficiently small : Poiseuille's law. 

133
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,230
It is a principle very general that we
can easily understand when we do a

134
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:16,670
force balance on the entire tube.
The friction forces of the fluid that are rubbing 

135
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:22,480
the wall are compensated exactly by
the pressure gradient at the boundaries of this tube

136
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,570
and by virtue of the sign of the flow and so
of the sign of the shear, so of the friction

137
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:34,070
to the wall. It is clear that the flow
is always created from the high towards the small

138
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,020
pressure. In our case, where we have connected
our two bubbles, the flow is created

139
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,810
from the small towards the big and so empties the
small bubble in the big one.
