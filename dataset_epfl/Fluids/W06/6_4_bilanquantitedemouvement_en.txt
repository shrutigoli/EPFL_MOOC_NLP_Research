Hello and welcome to this forth module of the sixth chapter of the course of fluid mechanics. In this sixth chapter, we are dealing with balances, we have already dealt with mass balances by introduction the continuity equation and by giving a physical meaning of the divergence operator. We have then discussed of momentum balance, in particular by introducing in parallel flow regimes, the Poiseuille flow which is the flow in a circular pipe. Then, we have introduced in the third module an important simplification of the equations which is the equation of lubrication and we now arrive in this forth module to the momentum balance when the regime is said to be "inertial".
The inertial regime is the regime where the effects of acceleration are much more important than the forces in play.  In this regime here, we will be neglecting the contribution of the viscous forces and we will keep exclusively the pressure forces that will accelerate and deccelarate the fluid particles. As I have said, in flows dominated by friction forces, in particular near solid walls, the pressure forces are used for counterbalancing the viscous friction forces. It is what we have seen in 6.2 by treating the Poiseuille flow but also in 6.3 in the lubrication equation where the horizontal pressure gradient was used to put into motion the fluid in the horizontal direction. In flows confined between walls, the fluid always flows from the high to the low pressures, it is the case particularly for the Poiseuille flow.
In the Poiseuille flow the velocity is directed from the high to the low pressures.
As soon as the Reynolds number is big enough,
I recall that the Reynolds number is the ratio between inertia forces and viscous forces. When the inertia forces overcome the viscous forces the pressure can also be used to accelerate a fluid particle and non only to counterbalance the viscous friction forces.
Let's see, as a example, and to better understand the role of the pressure forces in flows at high Reynolds number, the flow with stagnation point, we have studied it, more particularly, when we had made the distinction between streamlines, streaklines and pathlines, so in 5.3. Here is the situation, we have a fluid particle, here a rectangle, of height dy and width dl. This fluid particle is in motion of stagnation point, of a stopping point, i.e. a jet that is directed towards a wall, here vertical, of which the streamlines are deflected sideways when the jet encounters the vertical wall.
This particle of height dy and width dl is subjected to forces, and as I have said, we will neglect here the viscous forces. If we neglect the viscous forces in the x direction, the only forces that are received are p(x) dy on the left facet and p(x +dl) dy on the right facet. Now, these pressure forces will be used to accelerate the particle, to accelerate the particle we are forced to put ourselves in a Lagrangian formalism, i.e. we have to follow the particle in its motion. I have represented here, after a time dt, the position of the particle that was subjected to a displacement dx. It had at the beginning a velocity u(x, t) and now it has a velocity u(x
+ dx, t + dt), it is important here to remember that we have been varying both the time, meaning that we are at an instant greater, later, but we are also at a different position. This particle has changed shape, here it is stretching in the direction y while conserving its area, this is because we have chosen an incompressible fluid. In a general way, I can develop the u(x+dx, t + dt) as u(x,t) + âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x dx (gradient in the direction dx) + âˆ‚u/âˆ‚t dt (gradient in the direction that is time). If I assume the flow stationary, then  âˆ‚u/âˆ‚t = 0. In this case, u(x + dx, t +dt) is simply u(x, t) + du/dx u dt that become a right derivative as u depends only on x, then dx is precisely the route that was carried out by the particle during a time dt and it is thus udt that is equal to dx. Therefore, the velocity of the particle an instant later, at a different position is now given by this expression.
If I look the acceleration, the acceleration is the derivative of the velocity field and so is the limit when dt is small of the particle's velocity at a time t + dt, as it is a Lagrangian particle it reaches the position x + dx. minus its position at time t and at position x, the whole divided by dt. This, we had fund u(x,t) + (du/dx)udt. When I subtract the whole, I simply obtain that it is (du/dx)u which is also (1/2)(du^2/dx). Now when
I do my momentum balance, the acceleration * the element volume
* the density (the mass of this fluid element) = exerting forces. I obtain the extremely simple relation which is that
(1/2) Ï�(du^2/dx dldy)  which is the volume element is equal to -(dp/dx) dldy. Thus,
I can integrate in x and I obtain u^2/2
+ p/Ï� = Constant. In this reasoning you see that the reasoning is partly biased,
I was here completely forced to reason as if the flow was unidirectional, so as if the flow happened exclusively in the x direction, however you see that in these regions here, of course the flow is deflected. If we want to work very properly, we can position ourselves, for stationary flows, along a streamline and if we position ourselves along a streamline by replacing x by the curvilinear abscissa, we can reason in total analogue way and demonstrate that the sum of u^2/2 + p/Ï� is constant along the streamline if the flow is stationary, incompressible and that it is irrotational, i.e. it does not have vorticity. It is what we call
Bernoulli's principle and will be the subject of course number 7. It is what we call
Bernoulli's law, so, in a stationary and incompressible flow u^2/2 + p/Ï� is equal to a constant along a streamline. I have represented here the streamlines of a flow of stagnation point and I have also represented the isobars, what I see is that when my particle gets to a certain velocity and it is here on the isobars of relatively low pressure, this particle slows down and as the square velocity and the pressure vary in opposite ways, i.e. if the velocity increases the pressure must decrease, here when the velocity decreases, the pressure is increasing, this is a isobar of high pressure.
Here the particle will first of all decelerate before finally re-accelerate and, when it decelerates, it enters in regions of high pressure. When it is re-accelerating it goes back to low pressure regions.
Hence, the particle is absolutely not going from high to low pressures or from low to high pressure, it is going there wherever it wants to and simply the pressure depends on whether it is accelerating or decelerating. In particular, we really must not believe that in such flows, the flow is created from the low to the high pressures.
The flow would be radial in this case, it is absolutely not the case, you see that the flow is along streamlines that are essentially hyperbolic and absolutely do not follow a path that goes from the high to the low pressures. The flow does not go down the pressure gradients when we are in a regime where the viscous forces can be neglected. The objective for you of chapter 7 will be to learn to use
Bernoulli's relation, or to understand to what extent this later can be demonstrated and applied and to apply it more particularly to river hydrodynamics.
