00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:07,339
Hello and welcome to this second module
of the sixth chapter of the course of fluid

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:11,080
mechanics. In the sixth chapter, we are
dealing with balances. We have dealt in

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,600
6.1 of mass balances and we will now
deal in this second module, of momentum

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,960
balance when the flow
is dominated by viscous effects. We

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,480
will in particular deal with a flow
very well-known, a canonical flow, a

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,429
true archetype which is the Poiseuille
flow, meaning a flow

7
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:35,000
in a pipe of circular cross-section. It is
a flow that was described by Poiseuille

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,590
who was in fact a doctor and who was interested
in the nineteenth century, so around 1840, at

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,510
the flow in arteries and 
veins. To get to the heart of the matter,

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,940
I am giving you a quiz of which we
will find the answer and of which we will be able

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,539
to justify the answer at the end of this module,
but that I am asking you to try to solve

12
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,190
in order to develop your intuition on
Poiseuille flows. Let's consider

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,629
then a tube of section R and we would like
to replace it by a collection of tube all

14
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,670
small compared to R, a. The question that
raises is the following: " Is the pressure

15
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,860
gradient to be applied to make the fluid
flow through this capillary network

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:18,360
is bigger, smaller or much
bigger?" The first suggestion assumes

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,330
that the pressure gradient to apply is
(R/a)^4, the second is that pressure

18
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,890
gradient is smaller and the third that 
is simply (R/a), i.e. the ratio

19
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,330
of the capillary radius to the power
2. We will see the answer at the end 

20
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,200
of this module. Here are the hypothesis that we
will do to solve this problem : we 

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,640
will consider the flow in
a circular pipe, we will assume

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,460
that the flow is independent of time,
it is what we call a stationary flow.

23
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,220
We will also assume that it is independent
of the direction of the flow x, the longitudinal 

24
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,770
direction, axial, it is what we call
a hypothesis of parallel flow, i.e.

25
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,110
the flow is the same at
different upstream and downstream position that we

26
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,660
call fully developed. We will 
also assume that it is independent of θ,

27
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,640
this is a hypothesis, we assume that
the flow does not depend on the azimuth, 

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,580
so it is axisymmetric. Under these conditions,
the velocity field u which is, I remind it,

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,410
a vector of 3 dimensions in space, is written
in this orthoradial coordinate system

30
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:27,410
x and r in the following way, there is a function
that will depend only on r : u(r) orientated

31
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,890
in the direction ex, i.e. the flow
is unidirectional, it flows only in

32
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:39,600
the axial direction and the velocity profile
depends exclusively on the variable r as it

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,350
can not depend on x, on θ, neither on t.
Here are the simplifying hypothesis in

34
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:50,230
which we will place ourselves in order to obtain
a solution and it is a subject that remains relevant

35
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,569
to know if the solution that we will determine
is indeed the one that is observed

36
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,210
experimentally, in particular when
the effects of inertia become important.

37
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,459
At least, we would have had the merit of discovering
a solution of equations of fluid

38
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:10,459
mechanics. I recall that the circular pipe
has a radius R and we will try to

39
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,920
do a small momentum balance
in the small cylinder that I have represented

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,540
here situated between a radius r and a radius
r + dr and between a position x and a position

41
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,319
x + dx. Here is a slice view of the annular cylinder
that we are considering as our control

42
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,599
volume and we will look what
force(s) is(are) exerted on this annular cylinder

43
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,180
of control. We have on one hand the pressure
forces. On the left is exerted the pressure

44
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:44,180
p(x) and r * 2Pi.r dr, 2Pi.r dr being the surface area
of this small circle. And on the right is exerted

45
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:52,280
-p(x+dx) as here the pressure is in (x+dx,
r) still times 2.Pi.r dr which is still

46
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:59,280
the cross-section. So if I do a Taylor
expansion of p(x+dx, r) dr, I obtain that this

47
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:06,319
is equal to -(p(x)), we already have done
this in the previous course, + ∂p/∂x, partial

48
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:14,569
derivative with respect to x. The whole still
in r, 2.Pi.r dr. Simplying this term with

49
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:28,389
this one, I only have left -∂p/∂x.2.Pi.r dr
dx. Other forces that are exerted, are the

50
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:35,389
shear forces. These shear forces
are written σxr, the second index

51
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,919
refers to the orientation of the surface
on which we are measuring the force, so here

52
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:47,919
the upper surface of this annular cylinder.
The x indicates in what direction is exerted

53
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:54,279
the force, it is thus an element of the stress
tensor σxr. The stress σxr in

54
00:04:54,279 --> 00:05:01,279
r + dr with an outgoing normal orientated
in the direction r positive it is σxr(r+dr).2.Pi.(r+dr)

55
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,969
dx which is the surface of the outer cylinder
and to which I must subtract -σxr(r).2.Pi.r

56
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:14,969
dx. 2.Pi.r dx being the surface of the lower
cylinder and the sign - simply coming

57
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,629
from the orientation of the normal which is negative
for the lower cylinder. When I am looking,

58
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,460
still with a Taylor expansion, I
discover that the difference of these 2 forces

59
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:32,460
is more or less 2.Pi.∂(r.σxr)/∂r drdx.
Now we will consider that we

60
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,650
are in a Newtonian fluid and we will
try to determine to what σxr is equal to as

61
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,449
a function of the velocity profile. Indeed,
this will allow you to close the equation

62
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:48,279
and to know the link between the pressure
and the velocity field. For a Newtonian fluid

63
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:54,699
unidirectional in a Cartesian plane x1,
x2, of velocity profile u1(x2), we know

64
00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:01,699
that the shear stress σ12 is
equal to η, where η is the dynamic viscosity

65
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,960
times the velocity gradient in the direction
1 with respect to the direction 2, so du1/dx2.

66
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:26,189
When we are in axisymmetric coordinates,
orthoradial coordinates, it happens

67
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,240
that the formula is more or less the same but
we must be careful, this is a special case,

68
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,960
we cannot draw any generalities
when we are in coordinate

69
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:42,589
systems a little complex, we need
a form before convincing ourselves

70
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:48,909
of such a form. σxr, the stress in
the direction x along a facet orientated

71
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:55,300
by the normal along r is equal to η, the
dynamic viscosity, multiplied by dux/dr,

72
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,289
axial velocity gradient with respect to
the radial direction. I can therefore

73
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:05,860
replace here thanks to my law of viscous
stress σxr by η.∂ux/∂r,  what allows me

74
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,860
to get to the following equation: ∂p/∂x
= η/r.∂/∂r.(r.∂ux/∂r), I have taken out

75
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:18,430
η because I assume the viscosity constant,
so I have taken it out of the differential equation.

76
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,460
Here is the first equation that we also
call Stokes equation. Now, I

77
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,809
will try to determine an equation
to know what is the evolution of the pressure

78
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:32,899
gradient in the radial direction, so
I will do a radial balance. Here is the element

79
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:38,599
that I am considering, a small element of my
previous annular cylinder between

80
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:45,460
the angle θ and θ + dθ and between the
radius r and r + dr. What are the forces

81
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,699
that are exerting? On one hand the pressure
forces on the cylinder's wall, so

82
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:56,699
on top I have - (r+dr), the - because of the orientation
of the normal, p(r+dr) dθ, (r+dr) dθ being

83
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,199
the length of the circular arc considered,
on the bottom surface I have a force which is

84
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:10,199
p(r) which is applied on a surface r dθ, 
so slightly smaller. If now

85
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,580
I do an expansion, you see that I
have to do an expansion of this

86
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,830
product, and so I can do it in different
ways, but it is quite natural at this

87
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,830
point to write that this is -r.p(r) dθ that
will counterbalance with the other -dr.p(r) dθ 

88
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:44,069
and also, - r.∂p/∂r(r) drdθ + smaller
terms + r.p(r) dθ, this is counterbalanced

89
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,810
with this, here is what remains. Now,
I have other forces exerting on the

90
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:09,810
side walls, on these side walls
I simply have 2*p(r) (the pressure), that

91
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:17,769
plays on a surface dr and which is projected
along the vertical by multiplying by dθ/2,

92
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:26,860
this of course comes from this angle here which
is θ/2 and of which I assume that the sinus ≈ to

93
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,380
the value as dθ is very small. Here is
how I obtain the contribution which is

94
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,620
a positive contribution in the radial
direction of the pressure force. If now

95
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,790
I add all these forces, I recall
that we had fund here a force that was

96
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:47,790
-dr p(r) dθ - r∂p/∂r(r) drdθ and that
I add here, this is perfectly counterbalanced.

97
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,879
All that remains is the following law, ∂p/∂r
= 0. This means that in the Poiseuille

98
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,350
flow, the pressure does not depend
on the radial coordinate. The pressure will

99
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,889
depend on the axial coordinate, it
depends in x, it will not depend of course

100
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:19,519
on θ, it is a hypothesis, but it
does not depend either on the radial

101
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,240
coordinate r. From this hypothesis, we
can now integrate this equation,

102
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,690
we have on the left a right derivative
now, I have put here a d, the d means

103
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,569
that depends only on x, it is not a 
partial derivative, is a usual derivative,

104
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:38,769
so dp/dx, and on the right we have the expression
η/r and a derivative still usual too,

105
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:43,949
as ux depends only on r, of product
r.dux/dr. As the function of the left depends

106
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:47,740
on x and that the function of the right depends
exclusively on r, for a function of

107
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,250
x and a function of r to be equal although
x and r are independent, the only possibility

108
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,029
is that these two functions are equal
to a constant that I note G. This G, which

109
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:03,160
is in fact a pressure gradient, at the scale
of a pressure differential, divided by

110
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,490
a length. It is a pressure gradient. 
Now I can integrate the equation,

111
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,750
I integrate once, I am writing simply,
it is a calculation a little technical,

112
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:18,750
I write that d/dr (r.dux/dr) is simply
equal to Gr/η. By integrating once,

113
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,240
I obtain that r.dux/dr is equal to
an antiderivative of Gr/η, i.e. Gr^2/2η

114
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:41,889
+ a constant. I divide by r and I obtain
that dux/dr is simply equal to Gr/2η

115
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:49,949
+ A/r. We have arrived to this  first
result. Then, I use the boundary

116
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:56,009
conditions which are that ux in r is
equal to r = 0 on hand and on the other

117
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:01,180
a condition of symmetry on the axis. As ux 
is a naturally an even function, as it

118
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,449
is formulated in orthoradial coordinates,
so r is by definition positive. As 

119
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:10,160
this function is even, it means that
its derivative is odd, so that  dux/dr,

120
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,100
in r = 0 is equal to 0. Thus, naturally,
if I apply this formula in 0, I obtain

121
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:22,100
that dux/dr in r = 0 is equal to 0 + A/"0",
which diverges, if I want this here to be equal

122
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,120
to 0, this implies that A = 0. From
there, I just have to finally integrate this

123
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:40,069
equation here, which is not very difficult,
I find that ux is equal to a antiderivative,

124
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:47,069
i.e. (Gr^2)/4η + a new constant
that I call B. I choose this

125
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,980
new constant B such that the
velocity is zero on the boundary, adhesion

126
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,110
condition on the wall. I thus obtain
the parabolic profile which is ux = G/η, G

127
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:06,110
being the pressure gradient and (r^2-R^2)/4,
I observe that ux(R) = 0, but I also observe

128
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,850
that ux(0), i.e. at the center of my
circular pipe, along the axis, I have

129
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:19,850
the following value : - GR^2/4η. Therefore,
to get a positive flow, to get

130
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:30,379
ux(0) positive, I must have that G<0, which
means that the pressure gradient dp/dx

131
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:43,559
< 0, so that the pressure decreases when
x increases, and that is the familiar experiment 

132
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,519
of the water tower, we all know that to
make water flow through a tube,

133
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,910
we must have in upstream an overpressure and
in downstream a low pressure, or else it does not

134
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,649
flow. Let's now proceed to the dimensional 
check of this expression. We will

135
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,449
verify that the units of the left term
and of the right term are coherent. What

136
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:09,980
are the units of the pressure gradient G
? They are simply pressures, so

137
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,980
Newtons/m^2, the whole divided by m to
make a gradient, so N/m^3. What

138
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:25,620
are the units of the viscosity η ? It is
a dynamic viscosity, this is then

139
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:32,620
N.s/m^2, i.e. pa.s. Thus, the dimension
of the expression G(r^2 - R^2)/4η, is

140
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:50,829
N.m^3.m^2/(m^3.N.s), thus we only have left
m/s, which is a velocity. Therefore,

141
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:05,790
this formula is dimensionally correct.
Now the dimension of the formula

142
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,860
verified, i can verify the signs,
as I said, if G is negative the pressure

143
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,100
at the outlet of the pipe is smaller than the
pressure at the inlet of the pipe, and it

144
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,709
is natural that x is positive. The profile 
is parabolic, and this allows me to answer

145
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:23,139
to the quiz in module n°1, namely amongst
the 3 profiles, the first profile is invalid

146
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:26,339
because there would be a slip at the wall,
which is not possible as there is an adhesion

147
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,889
to the wall, the pipe is not moving
so the wall of the pipe has a velocity zero

148
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:33,399
so the flow must be at velocity zero
at the wall. The second solution is not

149
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,379
physical because this is not a parabola but
a circular arc, in particular here the slope 

150
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:43,600
is zero, the derivative here of the function
is zero. Here is a parabolic profile

151
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,220
with a finite slope, this finite slope is
important because it is this finite slope that

152
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,230
exerts a non zero shear on the wall.
Now that we have the profile, we

153
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,040
can integrate it to determine the flow rate,
this is not very hard, we will

154
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:03,040
simply write that Q is the integral
between 0 and R of uxrdr and I multiply by

155
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,879
2Pi because of the symmetric axis. If I
do this integral, I obtain that it is

156
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:14,879
2. Pi.G/4η * the integral between 0 and R of
(r^3 - R^2r) dr. Let's start with the r^3, an

157
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:41,709
antiderivative is r^4/4 - R^2.r^2/2, still
to be taken between 0 and R. These quantities here

158
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:55,939
are equal to 0 in 0 and in R they are equal to -2.Pi.G/4η.R^4/4,
the
2 simplifies with the 2, my final formula

159
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:17,010
is -G.Pi.R^4/8η. So the flow rate is equal
to the pressure gradient, multiplied by Pi.R^4,

160
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,720
divided by 8η. You observe here a relation
very important, at a fixed pressure gradient,

161
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,570
the flow rate that can flow through
a tube is proportional to the radius of this

162
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,280
tube at the power 4. It is very high
power, which means that the flow rate

163
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,950
is very weak when r the radius is small
and conversely, if the radius is big,

164
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,440
the flow rate can be very very strong. Regarding
the average velocity, it can be simply

165
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,440
defined by u bar which is such that the product
of the surface Pi.r^2 which is the section of

166
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,550
the cylinder multiplied by u bar is equal
to Q and I find that u bar is equal

167
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:13,550
to umax/2. In average, if this is umax,
everything happens as if I had u bar that

168
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:23,570
is equal to umax / 2, i.e. u(r=0)
/2. We can set a global balance

169
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,830
of the forces on the entire tube between
0 and L, so the first forces are

170
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,450
the friction forces at the wall. My
system, my fluid volume is subjected to

171
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,400
forces that are created by the wall and the
walls create a force that is equal to

172
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,650
the circumference 2.Pi.r that is multiplied
by L to get the total circumference

173
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,890
of the cylinder, that I multiply by the viscosity
then that I multiply by the shear

174
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,930
at the wall, i.e. r = R. So,
the other forces that are exerting are the

175
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,660
pressure forces, which are simply equal
to the pressure differential  G.L.Pi.R^2. As

176
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:12,660
I have ux that is equal to G/η(r^2-R^2)/4,
I get of course dux /dr = 2Gr/4η, and so

177
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:34,970
dux over dr in r = R is equal to
2Gr/4η. Thus, I can replace, I find

178
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:47,330
here 2Pi.ηRL2Δp.R/(L.4η), the 2, the 2 and
the 4 are gone, the Ls are gone, η is gone,

179
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,400
and I only have Δp.Pi.r^2 left that is also equal 
to Δp.Pi.r^2. I observe that my fluid

180
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:21,870
system is in equilibrium with the pressure
forces that counterbalance exactly the friction

181
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,680
force at the wall. Now, we 
can go back to our initial quiz and

182
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,900
know what happens when I replace
a pipe of section R by a collection of

183
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,660
pipe of radius smaller than a, much
smaller than R. Something happens very

184
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:40,130
simple, I have a flow rate through
my big tube which is Pi.R^4.ΔP/8η.L and

185
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,250
I have a flow rate through every small tubes
so q is the flow rate through every

186
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:50,160
small tues of size a which is Pi.a^4.ΔP/8η.L,
to equalize these flow rates, I must

187
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,790
simply have that each flow rate is equal 
to the ratio between the surfaces, i.e. a^2/r^2,

188
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:03,730
in fact a^2/r^2 is simply the number
of tubes, so I I have in fact na^2 that must

189
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:10,730
be equal to R^2 so I have n*the small flow rate
that has to be equal to the big flow rate. As

190
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:21,140
n is equal to R^2/a^2, I get q = Q/n, which
is also equal to a^2.Q/R^2. I replace

191
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:41,280
and obtain that Δp, the pressure gradient 
is equal to, I replace q, a^2/R^2.Q.8η/Pi.a^4

192
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:53,280
and, by simplifying the a, I find that it is
R^2/a^2.Δp/L. Hence the pressure gradient

193
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,040
is much bigger, and it is normal because
the friction forces are much

194
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,220
stronger because the gradients are much
stronger, as the gradients are exerted on

195
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,790
distances much smaller, a 
instead of R, and so the gradient is much

196
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,480
stronger. Therefore, the pressure gradient
to exert is R^2/a^2 bigger.
