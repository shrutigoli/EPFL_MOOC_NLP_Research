Hello and welcome to this second module of the sixth chapter of the course of fluid mechanics. In the sixth chapter, we are dealing with balances. We have dealt in
6.1 of mass balances and we will now deal in this second module, of momentum balance when the flow is dominated by viscous effects. We will in particular deal with a flow very well-known, a canonical flow, a true archetype which is the Poiseuille flow, meaning a flow in a pipe of circular cross-section. It is a flow that was described by Poiseuille who was in fact a doctor and who was interested in the nineteenth century, so around 1840, at the flow in arteries and veins. To get to the heart of the matter,
I am giving you a quiz of which we will find the answer and of which we will be able to justify the answer at the end of this module, but that I am asking you to try to solve in order to develop your intuition on
Poiseuille flows. Let's consider then a tube of section R and we would like to replace it by a collection of tube all small compared to R, a. The question that raises is the following: " Is the pressure gradient to be applied to make the fluid flow through this capillary network is bigger, smaller or much bigger?" The first suggestion assumes that the pressure gradient to apply is
(R/a)^4, the second is that pressure gradient is smaller and the third that is simply (R/a), i.e. the ratio of the capillary radius to the power
2. We will see the answer at the end of this module. Here are the hypothesis that we will do to solve this problem : we will consider the flow in a circular pipe, we will assume that the flow is independent of time, it is what we call a stationary flow.
We will also assume that it is independent of the direction of the flow x, the longitudinal direction, axial, it is what we call a hypothesis of parallel flow, i.e. the flow is the same at different upstream and downstream position that we call fully developed. We will also assume that it is independent of Î¸, this is a hypothesis, we assume that the flow does not depend on the azimuth, so it is axisymmetric. Under these conditions, the velocity field u which is, I remind it, a vector of 3 dimensions in space, is written in this orthoradial coordinate system x and r in the following way, there is a function that will depend only on r : u(r) orientated in the direction ex, i.e. the flow is unidirectional, it flows only in the axial direction and the velocity profile depends exclusively on the variable r as it can not depend on x, on Î¸, neither on t.
Here are the simplifying hypothesis in which we will place ourselves in order to obtain a solution and it is a subject that remains relevant to know if the solution that we will determine is indeed the one that is observed experimentally, in particular when the effects of inertia become important.
At least, we would have had the merit of discovering a solution of equations of fluid mechanics. I recall that the circular pipe has a radius R and we will try to do a small momentum balance in the small cylinder that I have represented here situated between a radius r and a radius r + dr and between a position x and a position x + dx. Here is a slice view of the annular cylinder that we are considering as our control volume and we will look what force(s) is(are) exerted on this annular cylinder of control. We have on one hand the pressure forces. On the left is exerted the pressure p(x) and r * 2Pi.r dr, 2Pi.r dr being the surface area of this small circle. And on the right is exerted
-p(x+dx) as here the pressure is in (x+dx, r) still times 2.Pi.r dr which is still the cross-section. So if I do a Taylor expansion of p(x+dx, r) dr, I obtain that this is equal to -(p(x)), we already have done this in the previous course, + âˆ‚p/âˆ‚x, partial derivative with respect to x. The whole still in r, 2.Pi.r dr. Simplying this term with this one, I only have left -âˆ‚p/âˆ‚x.2.Pi.r dr dx. Other forces that are exerted, are the shear forces. These shear forces are written Ïƒxr, the second index refers to the orientation of the surface on which we are measuring the force, so here the upper surface of this annular cylinder.
The x indicates in what direction is exerted the force, it is thus an element of the stress tensor Ïƒxr. The stress Ïƒxr in r + dr with an outgoing normal orientated in the direction r positive it is Ïƒxr(r+dr).2.Pi.(r+dr) dx which is the surface of the outer cylinder and to which I must subtract -Ïƒxr(r).2.Pi.r dx. 2.Pi.r dx being the surface of the lower cylinder and the sign - simply coming from the orientation of the normal which is negative for the lower cylinder. When I am looking, still with a Taylor expansion, I discover that the difference of these 2 forces is more or less 2.Pi.âˆ‚(r.Ïƒxr)/âˆ‚r drdx.
Now we will consider that we are in a Newtonian fluid and we will try to determine to what Ïƒxr is equal to as a function of the velocity profile. Indeed, this will allow you to close the equation and to know the link between the pressure and the velocity field. For a Newtonian fluid unidirectional in a Cartesian plane x1, x2, of velocity profile u1(x2), we know that the shear stress Ïƒ12 is equal to Î·, where Î· is the dynamic viscosity times the velocity gradient in the direction
1 with respect to the direction 2, so du1/dx2.
When we are in axisymmetric coordinates, orthoradial coordinates, it happens that the formula is more or less the same but we must be careful, this is a special case, we cannot draw any generalities when we are in coordinate systems a little complex, we need a form before convincing ourselves of such a form. Ïƒxr, the stress in the direction x along a facet orientated by the normal along r is equal to Î·, the dynamic viscosity, multiplied by dux/dr, axial velocity gradient with respect to the radial direction. I can therefore replace here thanks to my law of viscous stress Ïƒxr by Î·.âˆ‚ux/âˆ‚r,  what allows me to get to the following equation: âˆ‚p/âˆ‚x
= Î·/r.âˆ‚/âˆ‚r.(r.âˆ‚ux/âˆ‚r), I have taken out
Î· because I assume the viscosity constant, so I have taken it out of the differential equation.
Here is the first equation that we also call Stokes equation. Now, I will try to determine an equation to know what is the evolution of the pressure gradient in the radial direction, so
I will do a radial balance. Here is the element that I am considering, a small element of my previous annular cylinder between the angle Î¸ and Î¸ + dÎ¸ and between the radius r and r + dr. What are the forces that are exerting? On one hand the pressure forces on the cylinder's wall, so on top I have - (r+dr), the - because of the orientation of the normal, p(r+dr) dÎ¸, (r+dr) dÎ¸ being the length of the circular arc considered, on the bottom surface I have a force which is p(r) which is applied on a surface r dÎ¸, so slightly smaller. If now
I do an expansion, you see that I have to do an expansion of this product, and so I can do it in different ways, but it is quite natural at this point to write that this is -r.p(r) dÎ¸ that will counterbalance with the other -dr.p(r) dÎ¸ and also, - r.âˆ‚p/âˆ‚r(r) drdÎ¸ + smaller terms + r.p(r) dÎ¸, this is counterbalanced with this, here is what remains. Now,
I have other forces exerting on the side walls, on these side walls
I simply have 2*p(r) (the pressure), that plays on a surface dr and which is projected along the vertical by multiplying by dÎ¸/2, this of course comes from this angle here which is Î¸/2 and of which I assume that the sinus â‰ˆ to the value as dÎ¸ is very small. Here is how I obtain the contribution which is a positive contribution in the radial direction of the pressure force. If now
I add all these forces, I recall that we had fund here a force that was
-dr p(r) dÎ¸ - râˆ‚p/âˆ‚r(r) drdÎ¸ and that
I add here, this is perfectly counterbalanced.
All that remains is the following law, âˆ‚p/âˆ‚r
= 0. This means that in the Poiseuille flow, the pressure does not depend on the radial coordinate. The pressure will depend on the axial coordinate, it depends in x, it will not depend of course on Î¸, it is a hypothesis, but it does not depend either on the radial coordinate r. From this hypothesis, we can now integrate this equation, we have on the left a right derivative now, I have put here a d, the d means that depends only on x, it is not a partial derivative, is a usual derivative, so dp/dx, and on the right we have the expression
Î·/r and a derivative still usual too, as ux depends only on r, of product r.dux/dr. As the function of the left depends on x and that the function of the right depends exclusively on r, for a function of x and a function of r to be equal although x and r are independent, the only possibility is that these two functions are equal to a constant that I note G. This G, which is in fact a pressure gradient, at the scale of a pressure differential, divided by a length. It is a pressure gradient. 
Now I can integrate the equation,
I integrate once, I am writing simply, it is a calculation a little technical,
I write that d/dr (r.dux/dr) is simply equal to Gr/Î·. By integrating once,
I obtain that r.dux/dr is equal to an antiderivative of Gr/Î·, i.e. Gr^2/2Î·
+ a constant. I divide by r and I obtain that dux/dr is simply equal to Gr/2Î·
+ A/r. We have arrived to this  first result. Then, I use the boundary conditions which are that ux in r is equal to r = 0 on hand and on the other a condition of symmetry on the axis. As ux is a naturally an even function, as it is formulated in orthoradial coordinates, so r is by definition positive. As this function is even, it means that its derivative is odd, so that  dux/dr, in r = 0 is equal to 0. Thus, naturally, if I apply this formula in 0, I obtain that dux/dr in r = 0 is equal to 0 + A/"0", which diverges, if I want this here to be equal to 0, this implies that A = 0. From there, I just have to finally integrate this equation here, which is not very difficult,
I find that ux is equal to a antiderivative, i.e. (Gr^2)/4Î· + a new constant that I call B. I choose this new constant B such that the velocity is zero on the boundary, adhesion condition on the wall. I thus obtain the parabolic profile which is ux = G/Î·, G being the pressure gradient and (r^2-R^2)/4,
I observe that ux(R) = 0, but I also observe that ux(0), i.e. at the center of my circular pipe, along the axis, I have the following value : - GR^2/4Î·. Therefore, to get a positive flow, to get ux(0) positive, I must have that G<0, which means that the pressure gradient dp/dx
< 0, so that the pressure decreases when x increases, and that is the familiar experiment of the water tower, we all know that to make water flow through a tube, we must have in upstream an overpressure and in downstream a low pressure, or else it does not flow. Let's now proceed to the dimensional check of this expression. We will verify that the units of the left term and of the right term are coherent. What are the units of the pressure gradient G
? They are simply pressures, so
Newtons/m^2, the whole divided by m to make a gradient, so N/m^3. What are the units of the viscosity Î· ? It is a dynamic viscosity, this is then
N.s/m^2, i.e. pa.s. Thus, the dimension of the expression G(r^2 - R^2)/4Î·, is
N.m^3.m^2/(m^3.N.s), thus we only have left m/s, which is a velocity. Therefore, this formula is dimensionally correct.
Now the dimension of the formula verified, i can verify the signs, as I said, if G is negative the pressure at the outlet of the pipe is smaller than the pressure at the inlet of the pipe, and it is natural that x is positive. The profile is parabolic, and this allows me to answer to the quiz in module nÂ°1, namely amongst the 3 profiles, the first profile is invalid because there would be a slip at the wall, which is not possible as there is an adhesion to the wall, the pipe is not moving so the wall of the pipe has a velocity zero so the flow must be at velocity zero at the wall. The second solution is not physical because this is not a parabola but a circular arc, in particular here the slope is zero, the derivative here of the function is zero. Here is a parabolic profile with a finite slope, this finite slope is important because it is this finite slope that exerts a non zero shear on the wall.
Now that we have the profile, we can integrate it to determine the flow rate, this is not very hard, we will simply write that Q is the integral between 0 and R of uxrdr and I multiply by
2Pi because of the symmetric axis. If I do this integral, I obtain that it is
2. Pi.G/4Î· * the integral between 0 and R of
(r^3 - R^2r) dr. Let's start with the r^3, an antiderivative is r^4/4 - R^2.r^2/2, still to be taken between 0 and R. These quantities here are equal to 0 in 0 and in R they are equal to -2.Pi.G/4Î·.R^4/4, the
2 simplifies with the 2, my final formula is -G.Pi.R^4/8Î·. So the flow rate is equal to the pressure gradient, multiplied by Pi.R^4, divided by 8Î·. You observe here a relation very important, at a fixed pressure gradient, the flow rate that can flow through a tube is proportional to the radius of this tube at the power 4. It is very high power, which means that the flow rate is very weak when r the radius is small and conversely, if the radius is big, the flow rate can be very very strong. Regarding the average velocity, it can be simply defined by u bar which is such that the product of the surface Pi.r^2 which is the section of the cylinder multiplied by u bar is equal to Q and I find that u bar is equal to umax/2. In average, if this is umax, everything happens as if I had u bar that is equal to umax / 2, i.e. u(r=0)
/2. We can set a global balance of the forces on the entire tube between
0 and L, so the first forces are the friction forces at the wall. My system, my fluid volume is subjected to forces that are created by the wall and the walls create a force that is equal to the circumference 2.Pi.r that is multiplied by L to get the total circumference of the cylinder, that I multiply by the viscosity then that I multiply by the shear at the wall, i.e. r = R. So, the other forces that are exerting are the pressure forces, which are simply equal to the pressure differential  G.L.Pi.R^2. As
I have ux that is equal to G/Î·(r^2-R^2)/4,
I get of course dux /dr = 2Gr/4Î·, and so dux over dr in r = R is equal to
2Gr/4Î·. Thus, I can replace, I find here 2Pi.Î·RL2Î”p.R/(L.4Î·), the 2, the 2 and the 4 are gone, the Ls are gone, Î· is gone, and I only have Î”p.Pi.r^2 left that is also equal to Î”p.Pi.r^2. I observe that my fluid system is in equilibrium with the pressure forces that counterbalance exactly the friction force at the wall. Now, we can go back to our initial quiz and know what happens when I replace a pipe of section R by a collection of pipe of radius smaller than a, much smaller than R. Something happens very simple, I have a flow rate through my big tube which is Pi.R^4.Î”P/8Î·.L and
I have a flow rate through every small tubes so q is the flow rate through every small tues of size a which is Pi.a^4.Î”P/8Î·.L, to equalize these flow rates, I must simply have that each flow rate is equal to the ratio between the surfaces, i.e. a^2/r^2, in fact a^2/r^2 is simply the number of tubes, so I I have in fact na^2 that must be equal to R^2 so I have n*the small flow rate that has to be equal to the big flow rate. As n is equal to R^2/a^2, I get q = Q/n, which is also equal to a^2.Q/R^2. I replace and obtain that Î”p, the pressure gradient is equal to, I replace q, a^2/R^2.Q.8Î·/Pi.a^4 and, by simplifying the a, I find that it is
R^2/a^2.Î”p/L. Hence the pressure gradient is much bigger, and it is normal because the friction forces are much stronger because the gradients are much stronger, as the gradients are exerted on distances much smaller, a instead of R, and so the gradient is much stronger. Therefore, the pressure gradient to exert is R^2/a^2 bigger.
