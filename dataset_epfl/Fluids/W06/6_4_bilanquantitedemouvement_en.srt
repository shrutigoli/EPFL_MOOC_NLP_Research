Hello and welcome to this forth module
of the sixth chapter of the course of fluid

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,230
mechanics. In this sixth chapter, we
are dealing with balances, we have already dealt

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,950
with mass balances by introduction the continuity
equation and by giving a physical

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,359
meaning of the divergence operator. We 
have then discussed of momentum balance,

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,199
in particular by introducing
in parallel flow regimes,

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,860
the Poiseuille flow which is the flow
in a circular pipe. Then, we have

7
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:40,860
introduced in the third module an important
simplification of the equations which is the equation

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:48,280
of lubrication and we now arrive
in this forth module to the momentum balance

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,590
when the regime is said to be "inertial".
The inertial regime is the regime where

10
00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:00,590
the effects of acceleration are much
more important than the forces in play.  In

11
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,420
this regime here, we will be neglecting the contribution
of the viscous forces and we will keep

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,330
exclusively the pressure forces that will
accelerate and deccelarate 

13
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,580
the fluid particles. As I have said,
in flows dominated by friction

14
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,750
forces, in particular near
solid walls, the pressure forces

15
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,050
are used for counterbalancing the viscous friction
forces. It is what we have seen in 6.2

16
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,470
by treating the Poiseuille flow but
also in 6.3 in the lubrication equation

17
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:34,330
where the horizontal pressure gradient was used 
to put into motion the fluid in the horizontal

18
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,500
direction. In flows confined
between walls, the fluid always flows from

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,830
the high to the low pressures, it is the
case particularly for the Poiseuille flow.

20
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,380
In the Poiseuille flow the velocity
is directed from the high to the low pressures.

21
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,340
As soon as the Reynolds number is big enough,
I recall that the Reynolds number is

22
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:58,110
the ratio between inertia forces and
viscous forces. When the inertia forces

23
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,330
overcome the viscous forces
the pressure can also be used to accelerate

24
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,789
a fluid particle and non only to
counterbalance the viscous friction forces.

25
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:11,430
Let's see, as a example, and to better understand
the role of the pressure forces in flows

26
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,150
at high Reynolds number, the flow
with stagnation point, we have studied it,

27
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,060
more particularly, when we had
made the distinction between streamlines,

28
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:24,110
streaklines and pathlines,
so in 5.3. Here is the situation, we have

29
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:30,060
a fluid particle, here a rectangle, of
height dy and width dl. This fluid

30
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,020
particle is in motion of stagnation point,
of a stopping point, i.e. a jet that

31
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,110
is directed towards a wall, here vertical, of which
the streamlines are deflected sideways

32
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,860
when the jet encounters the vertical wall.
This particle of height dy and width

33
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,840
dl is subjected to forces, and as I
have said, we will neglect here the viscous

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,550
forces. If we neglect the viscous forces 
in the x direction, the only forces that

35
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:02,550
are received are p(x) dy on the left facet
and p(x +dl) dy on the right facet. Now,

36
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,800
these pressure forces will be used to accelerate
the particle, to accelerate the particle

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,650
we are forced to put ourselves in a Lagrangian
formalism, i.e. we have to

38
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,350
follow the particle in its motion. I have
represented here, after a time dt, the position

39
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,240
of the particle that was subjected to a displacement
dx. It had at the beginning a velocity

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,090
u(x, t) and now it has a velocity u(x
+ dx, t + dt), it is important here to

41
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,230
remember that we have been varying both
the time, meaning that we are at an instant

42
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,510
greater, later, but we are also at
a different position. This particle

43
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,630
has changed shape, here it is stretching
in the direction y while conserving its

44
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,090
area, this is because we have chosen an incompressible
fluid. In a general way, I

45
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,800
can develop the u(x+dx, t + dt) as
u(x,t) + ∂u/∂x dx (gradient in the direction

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:00,000
dx) + ∂u/∂t dt (gradient in the direction
that is time). If I assume the flow

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,240
stationary, then  ∂u/∂t = 0. In this
case, u(x + dx, t +dt) is simply u(x,

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,770
t) + du/dx u dt that become a right
derivative as u depends only on x,

49
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,630
then dx is precisely the route that
was carried out by the particle during

50
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:23,630
a time dt and it is thus udt that is equal
to dx. Therefore, the velocity of the particle

51
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,669
an instant later, at a different position
is now given by this expression.

52
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:36,200
If I look the acceleration, the acceleration
is the derivative of the velocity field and

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,650
so is the limit when dt is small
of the particle's velocity at a time t +

54
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,600
dt, as it is a Lagrangian particle
it reaches the position x + dx. minus its

55
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,680
position at time t and at position x, the
whole divided by dt. This, we had fund

56
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,680
u(x,t) + (du/dx)udt. When I subtract
the whole, I simply obtain that it is (du/dx)u

57
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:13,060
which is also (1/2)(du^2/dx). Now when
I do my momentum balance,

58
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:20,060
the acceleration * the element volume
* the density (the mass of this fluid

59
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,040
element) = exerting forces. I obtain
the extremely simple relation which is that

60
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,910
(1/2) ρ(du^2/dx dldy)  which is the volume
element is equal to -(dp/dx) dldy. Thus,

61
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:39,419
I can integrate in x and I obtain u^2/2
+ p/ρ = Constant. In this reasoning you

62
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:45,020
see that the reasoning is partly biased,
I was here completely forced to reason

63
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,210
as if the flow was unidirectional,
so as if the flow happened

64
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,449
exclusively in the x direction, however you
see that in these regions here, of course

65
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,880
the flow is deflected. If we want to work
very properly, we can position ourselves,

66
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,440
for stationary flows, along 
a streamline and if we position ourselves

67
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,070
along a streamline by replacing
x by the curvilinear abscissa, we can reason

68
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,830
in total analogue way and demonstrate
that the sum of u^2/2 + p/ρ is constant

69
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,320
along the streamline if the flow
is stationary, incompressible and that it

70
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,010
is irrotational, i.e. it does not have
vorticity. It is what we call

71
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,620
Bernoulli's principle and will be the subject
of course number 7. It is what we call

72
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:30,050
Bernoulli's law, so, in a stationary and
incompressible flow u^2/2 + p/ρ

73
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,810
is equal to a constant along a 
streamline. I have represented here the

74
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,699
streamlines of a flow of stagnation
point and I have also represented the isobars,

75
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,169
what I see is that when my particle
gets to a certain velocity and it is

76
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:50,770
here on the isobars of relatively low
pressure, this particle slows down and as

77
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,440
the square velocity and the pressure vary
in opposite ways, i.e. if

78
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,780
the velocity increases the pressure must decrease,
here when the velocity decreases, the pressure

79
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,780
is increasing, this is a isobar of high pressure.
Here the particle will first of all decelerate

80
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,250
before finally re-accelerate and, when it
decelerates, it enters in regions

81
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,759
of high pressure. When it is re-accelerating
it goes back to low pressure regions.

82
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,820
Hence, the particle is absolutely not going 
from high to low pressures or

83
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,530
from low to high pressure, it is
going there wherever it wants to and simply

84
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,639
the pressure depends on whether it is accelerating
or decelerating. In particular, we really must 

85
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,880
not believe that in such flows, the flow
is created from the low to the high pressures.

86
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,660
The flow would be radial in this case,
it is absolutely not the case, you see that

87
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,290
the flow is along streamlines
that are essentially hyperbolic and

88
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,360
absolutely do not follow a path that goes from
the high to the low pressures. The flow

89
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,610
does not go down the pressure gradients when we
are in a regime where the viscous forces

90
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,789
can be neglected. The objective for
you of chapter 7 will be to learn to use

91
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:57,020
Bernoulli's relation, or to understand
to what extent this later can be demonstrated

92
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,510
and applied and to apply it more particularly
to river hydrodynamics.
