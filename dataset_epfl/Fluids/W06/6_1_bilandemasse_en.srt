00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,430
Hello and welcome to this sixth chapter
of the course of fluid mechanics. The sixth

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,719
chapter deals with the notion of balance. We
will learn in this chapter to make

3
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,539
balances either on macroscopic volumes,
or more often on infinitesimal volumes.

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,499
We will at first introduce
the notion of mass balance, the matter balance

5
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:29,519
and discover the particular importance of
the notion of divergence, particularly

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,519
the divergence of the velocity field. We will
then see the notion of balance of

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,500
momentum and apply it in a viscous
regime in which the effects of inertia

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,940
can be neglected, in particular we will
see the fundamental law of Poiseuille

9
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,710
that governs the pressure gradient needed
to make a fluid flow in a circular

10
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:01,710
pipe. Then we will see the notion of
lubrication which is an approximation of

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,830
the momentum balance and the mass
balance when the geometry of the flow

12
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,909
allows it, i.e. when we are dealing with
what we call a thin layer. Finally,

13
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,820
we will approach the momentum balance
when this time the effect of inertia 

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,820
are dominant regarding the viscous effects so
when the Reynolds number is big. This

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,960
will be for us a first overview of Bernoulli's
principle that will be detailed more

16
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:42,870
broadly during chapter 7. Today,
the subject is the mass balance and the interpretation 

17
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:48,070
of the divergence operator. But before that,
a little quiz to begin with that reflects

18
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,340
very well what we will see in this
chapter 6, it is for you, again here,

19
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,040
before even having the answer elements,
to try to develop the intuition and to

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,790
see if you can guess in a certain
way, what is the answer of this quiz.

21
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,909
Let's consider a fluid flowing
in a pipe of circular cross-section and

22
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,459
we are asking you to determine the shape
of the velocity profile. Are we dealing with like

23
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:15,660
in 1 at what we call a bottle cap profile
? Or like in 2 at a profile very rounded

24
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,370
? Or like suggested in 3, a profile
more sharp of a parabolic type ? We will see

25
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,860
the detailed answer to this question
during the second module. Let's go back to

26
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,780
the subject of today namely the mass
balance. Let's consider firstly

27
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,750
a volume element that we often call
a control volume, i.e. a fluid

28
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,390
element, here of a rectangular shape, 
between x and x + dx, y and y + dy, it is always

29
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:45,390
implied by these notations dx and dy that
these lengths are small. This element

30
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,510
is infinitesimal, it is very small. We will
apply a very simple principle,

31
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,290
in the case here of a fluid i.e.
a fluid of which the density is independent

32
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,810
and constant, it is independent of space,
it is independent of temperature, 

33
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,150
independent of time, it is simply 
constant. In this case here, the principle of

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,590
conservation of matter, as there
are no chemical reactions, therefore

35
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,920
it is a principle of conservation of mass
that results by constant density 

36
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,930
in a principle of conservation of volume.
This fluid element must conserve its volume.

37
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,569
To guaranty that it will conserve its volume,
we will simply write a relation very

38
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:26,180
simple that is of course valid only in stationary,
the flow must be stationary, all

39
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,599
that comes in must go out. Let's look what
is going in and what is going out in the x direction.

40
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:39,599
Given the orientation of x and of y, it goes in
by the left u(x,y) dy and it goes out by the

41
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:48,989
right -u(x+dx, y) dy, the - means that it is
a fluid going out when u is positive,

42
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,050
so on the left with a positive u we are entering
in the element, on the right with a positive u,

43
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:04,050
we are leaving the element. You are going to say,
how is it possible that to obtain the

44
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,150
flow rate, as actually the product of a velocity
and a length is a linear flow rate,

45
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,060
how is it that we can simply do
the product of the velocity and of the section,

46
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,470
here linear, of the surface area, namely dy.
The reason is very simple, we are looking

47
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,130
at infinitesimal elements and that in 
a certain way if I write here, the true

48
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:31,130
expression would be the integral between y and
y +dy of u(x,y') dy', this time x is

49
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:43,350
fixed and this I will simply approximate it
by (dy being very small), the product of

50
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:50,350
the velocity of u(x,y)*dy. Now, what
happens in the y direction?

51
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,270
I simply have a vertical velocity v
upwards entering by the lower side

52
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:07,270
of length dx that is v(x,y) dx and what
goes out on top, is -v(x, y + dy) dx,

53
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:14,240
if I apply the principle of everything that
goes in must go out, I obtain that the

54
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,710
sum of all these contributions, of these
4 contributions, what enters on the left,

55
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,070
what leaves on the right, what enters the bottom
and what leaves the top, must simply be

56
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,790
equal to 0. Now I will apply
a very classical method consisting

57
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,250
on remembering that dx is very small. For 
example I can estimate by what we call

58
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,900
in French a "limited development" or
Taylor expansion, I will be able to

59
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:40,900
estimate u(x+ dx, y), it is a function with
two variables, a field depending on x

60
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,190
and y, but here I will do the Taylor
expansion only in the x direction, according to

61
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,889
the x variable, I will write that it is nothing
else than u(x,y) at the reference point

62
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:02,889
+ the partial derivative because u depends on
two variables x, y so I am partially deriving 

63
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,960
only with respect to x and this increment
I have to multiply it by dx. Of course,

64
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,960
there are smaller terms. The subtraction
of  u(x, y)dy - u(x + dx, y)dy simply gives me

65
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:26,650
-∂u/∂x(x, y) dxd y. I reason in a 
perfectly similar way about v and I obtain

66
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:44,750
-∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y dxdy = 0. These elements
can be simplified as they are 

67
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,780
positive quantities and so I obtain the
continuity relation that tells me tha  ∂u/∂x

68
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,319
+  ∂v/∂y is equal to 0. Some of
you might have recognized here an operator

69
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,600
well known called the divergence operator.
The most general expression of conservation

70
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,680
of mass for an incompressible fluid
corresponding to the conservation of volume,

71
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,319
is that divergence of u (div(u)) is equal
to 0. div(u) is often written ∇.u = 0, 

72
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,520
i.e. the scalar product between ∇ and
u is equal to 0. The ∇ operator you

73
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,520
all know it, it is simply ∂/∂x,
∂/∂y and ∂/∂z that I apply with a

74
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:40,370
scalar product to, in classical notation,
u over x, v over y and x over z, this scalar product

75
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:50,850
gives me simply that div(u) = ∂u/∂x
+ ∂v/∂y +∂w/∂z, which must be

76
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,240
equal to 0. You recognize the equation
that I have derived previously by considering

77
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,520
a small fluid element in the case where
there is no velocity w, there is no

78
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,460
z direction, I was in the plane of the board.
Here is the most general expression of

79
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,699
the continuity relation or conservation
of volume, or if you prefer, in an

80
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:28,319
incompressible case, conservation of
mass. If now, I am considering more

81
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,889
generally a fluid of which the density
can depend on space and time, therefore

82
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:39,839
the conservation of mass for a stationary
flow will be simply written div(ρu)

83
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:46,839
= 0. Even more generally, for a non-stationary
flow, I would simply have the relation

84
00:08:53,009 --> 00:09:00,009
very natural which is ∂ρ/∂t + u∇ρ,
I recall you that this is the partial

85
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:08,079
derivative with respect to time, the convective
derivative and the whole is the total

86
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:15,079
derivative, will be simply equal to div(ρu),
and that is the conservation of mass.

87
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:36,809
Let's try to give an interpretation to
the notion of divergence, we are going to demonstrate

88
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:47,920
that the divergence expresses the expansion of a
fluid particle, so div(u) is 1/v.dv/dt.

89
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,139
So consider at the instant t a fluid
particle of volume V and at the instant t+dt, its

90
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:58,439
volume has changed, it has become V+dV and the
question that you ask yourself is simply

91
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:05,439
"What is 1/V.dV/dt equal to ?", what is the relative
variation of volume per time unit equal to? It is

92
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,160
actually the divergence of the velocity field.
You see that dimensionally this is

93
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,439
very correct, velocity are m.s^-1,
when I take the divergence, I am taking a

94
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:20,269
derivative with respect to space so I
am dividing by m, so these are s^-1

95
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:26,559
and when I take a volume they are m^3/s
for the d/dt that I divide by m^3, it

96
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:33,559
thus cancels out we have s^-1. How to demonstrate
this relation ? In the absence of demonstrating it

97
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,019
in a systematic way, I will demonstrate it
in two dimensions. Let's start by

98
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,230
understanding what is happening to a linear
fluid element. I consider at the instant

99
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,569
t a fluid element AB, we will make
later on the distance AB tend to 0, we

100
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:50,110
will take a small distance AB, an infinitesimal
distance, for the moment let's consider 

101
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,119
simply a line segment AB, in a unidirectional 
motion, this means simply

102
00:10:55,119 --> 00:11:01,269
that the line segment AB is orientated in the x
direction and the flow occurs also in the

103
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:06,139
x direction, so the vectors are tangential
to the fluid segment. Here  I have represented it

104
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:11,689
displaced but you must imagine that A is
here and that, for the sake of representation,

105
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:17,149
I have done it like this. I have decided to
shift it at the instant dt, but in fact

106
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:21,299
they of course, given the velocity
field, remained on the same line. What

107
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,839
we see, is that, if I assume that these
velocities are positive, I am specifying right

108
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,779
now here that it is positive, then if the
velocity of A is smaller than the velocity

109
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:38,779
of B, the line segment AB, when it deforms
for an instant dt to become A'B', then

110
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,369
A'B' is stretched compared to AB, so
we have had a stretching. Conversely, if these

111
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:49,809
velocities are always positive but if this
time uxA is greater than uxB, which

112
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,929
is not the case represented here on the screen,
then the line segment AB is compressed to become

113
00:11:54,929 --> 00:12:00,170
A'B', we see that we are dealing with the linear
stretching, linear or with the linear

114
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:06,350
compression. The question that arises, is
"What is the increment ?", so what is

115
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,119
the variation in length of the line segment AB ? It is
very easy, it is simply A'B' - AB which

116
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:19,119
is very naturally written uxB dt which is
the displacement of the point B - uxA dt which is

117
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,639
the displacement of the point A. The difference
between these two displacements is simply the

118
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,189
variation of the length of the line segment AB. If
now I put myself in the situation that

119
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:36,299
I have indicated earlier on i.e.
that the distance AB that I note dx tends towards

120
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:41,759
0, then I can do like earlier on
a Taylor expansion and I find

121
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:48,759
very naturally that uxB is equal to uxA
+ ∂ux/∂x dx +... hence the relation above.

122
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:06,679
We see here ∂ux / ∂x is
in fact the stretching coefficient of the line segment

123
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:13,480
AB. Now, let's consider that two-dimensional case,
this time I will deform a quadrilateral

124
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:20,480
ABCD into a quadrilateral A'B'C'D', for example,
if we look how evolves the line segment

125
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:24,859
AB, this time the velocity is not unidirectional,
we have a velocity in the x direction and a

126
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:30,350
velocity in the y direction, we see that the
velocity in the x direction of the point B is

127
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,339
greater than the one of point A and they are
both positive, so the segment AB

128
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,920
is stretching in the x direction and on the other hand
the point B having a vertical velocity lower

129
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,569
than point A, the point B' is moving of a
lesser quantity in the y direction and 

130
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:50,089
finds itself a little lower in the
y direction than the point A'. Similarly, C'

131
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,350
finds itself slightly to the left of point
A' simply because its velocity in the

132
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,859
x direction uxC is smaller to the one of
point A. In the same way, the line segment

133
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:03,939
AC transforms in a line segment A'C' that has
been compressed this time in the y direction.

134
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:10,939
Now, I would like to evaluate the area
A'B'C'D' and compare it to the area ABCD. Evaluating

135
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:16,100
a quadrilateral area that has no more
parallel sides, is not particularly

136
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,419
easy so what I will do is first of
all neglect the areas that I will hatch

137
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:26,419
here. Why can I do
this? I can do it for a reason very

138
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:41,100
simple, that is I am considering a motion
over a time dt which is very short and

139
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:49,109
as this time dt is very short the angles
are necessarily very small. The approximation

140
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:56,109
is small, the one of neglecting the hatched zone.
If I neglect this hatched zone, the point

141
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:03,579
A'' I position it in A', I will simply
write the area of the quadrilateral A'B'C'D'

142
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:10,579
is just about the one of A"B"C"D", now
it is extremely easy to measure the area

143
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,040
of a rectangle, I will simply use
2 times the argument that I have done previously

144
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:23,040
about stretching, so I will state that the area
of the quadrilateral A"B"C"D" is just about

145
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:33,299
the area, I can write it if you want, it is
simply (AB + ∂ux / ∂x dt)(AC+∂uv/∂y),

146
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:55,279
I am sometimes using the notation ux in the
direction x and uy in the direction y and

147
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,399
sometimes ux is simply equal to u or uy is
simply equal to v. You should slowly get used

148
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,229
to changes of notation,
anyway here is this area, and, when I

149
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:12,229
expand this product, I find that it is
of course (AB)(AC)+ (AC)(AB). ∂v/∂y

150
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:21,790
dt + (AB)(AC).∂u/∂x dt. I have remaining
terms that are products between small quantities

151
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:52,619
as there will be ∂u/∂x, ∂v/∂y
and especially, more important, ∂t^2. As

152
00:16:55,119 --> 00:17:01,299
dt is small, it is negligible. I then find
dominant, once I have subtracted 

153
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:06,160
the starting area (AB)(AC),  I find this
expression here, and I recognize the operator

154
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,350
of divergence. Finally, the increment of
volume, so here an area increment, we

155
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:18,350
will call it δA which is this quantity here
divided by A, which is this quandtity here,

156
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:27,309
it is simply equal to div(u) dt. In 3D,
we generalize it to δ Ω/Ω = div(u) dt.

157
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:43,940
In other words div(u) = 1/Ω or 1/V dV dt.
