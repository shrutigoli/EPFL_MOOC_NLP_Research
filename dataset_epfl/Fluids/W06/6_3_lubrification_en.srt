00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,350
Hello and welcome to this third module
of the sixth chapter. In this sixth chapter

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,510
we are learning to make balances, balances
of momentum, we have also

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,869
learnt to make mass balances and today
we will address a particular case where

4
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:21,839
the geometry of the flow will allows us
to simplify the momentum balances.

5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:28,220
We will develop a theory called
lubrication theory. As I was saying,

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,520
we have seen quite in detail mass
balances, by doing first of all a complete

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,250
balance then by doing an interpretation
very precise of the divergence operator.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,850
Then, we have defined the momentum
balances in viscous regime

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,740
and introduced in particular the Poiseuille
flow. Today, the third module,

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,630
which will be a very long module, we will
develop the lubrication theory.

11
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,270
What is lubrication? Lubricated
flows are flows in

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,400
thin layers of fluid, what does it
mean ? It means that in these flows,

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,850
if we are considering plane flows, the
two directions of the plane do not have the same

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,850
characteristic length. For example, when
you have a water puddle which is much more

15
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,869
stretched than it is high, you are
in a situation of lubrication. In the

16
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:20,869
same way, when you have a rotor
turning within a stator, in a hydraulic

17
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,920
bearing, you have an oil film that
separates the rotor and the stator that is extremely

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,990
thin, of which the thickness is small compared
to the length of this film, i.e. the

19
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,710
circumference of the stator or the rotor. Here are
two situations where the two directions

20
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,770
of the plane do not have the same characteristic length.
There are many others, the example

21
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,810
of the air track or any other situation
where we could apply the theory

22
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,780
of lubrication. The point of having this
ratio of scale in the lengths is

23
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,719
that it induces directly a scale ratio
in the velocities, hence the flow is

24
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,130
quasi-unidirectional, we will see that it
is not unidirectional but that the velocity

25
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,649
in the longitudinal direction, in the direction
where the length is big, is much

26
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,969
bigger than the velocity in the direction where
the characteristic length, the thickness

27
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:11,950
is thin. Instead of developing in a general
way the theory of this equation,

28
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,439
I will illustrate this equation in a 
very particular case which is the case of a

29
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,830
lubrication problem where we are looking
to determine what is the force to exert

30
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,290
on a plate of length 2l, so really
a two-dimensional problem, to lift it

31
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,290
at a velocity v knowing that it is "stuck"
to a substrate by a film of viscous fluid

32
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:47,030
of thickness h. The question that raises 
is "What is the necessary force to

33
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,790
pull this plate at a given velocity
?" In a certain way, we can speak

34
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,159
here of a principle of sellotape.  Anyway,
we can speak of lubrication forces

35
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,610
that will be opposed to the pulling of this
plate, for that, we will assume the flow to be

36
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,280
stationary and plane, it is a hypothesis
quasi-static as the velocity is non

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,209
zero, h depends on time. We consider that
the variation of h with respect to time is

38
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,400
slow and so we can make this quasi-static
hypothesis. In these conditions, the first

39
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,069
balance to write is the one we have
written in module 6.1, i.e. the mass

40
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,709
balance for an incompressible fluid. As
it is indicated here, everything that goes in must

41
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,939
come out, on the left we have u(x, y) dy, on the
right -u(x + dx, y)dy, and, by doing the

42
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,620
difference of both, we naturally get
the gradient ∂u/∂x and the gradient

43
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,099
∂v/∂y that we sum and that must be equal 
to 0. The divergence of the velocity field uv must

44
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,709
be null, it is reminder, I send you
to module 6.1 for those who want more

45
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,969
details. Now, we will consider
that the fluid is Newtonian, which means

46
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:55,969
that the general expression of the stress
tensor is σ tensor = -pI + 2μD. So

47
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,799
-pI +2μD, μ dynamic viscosity and D symmetric
part of the velocity gradient so

48
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,540
of the velocity gradient tensor ∇u. For
the origin of lubrication, we will neglect

49
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,650
the origin of the fluid's acceleration and
suppose that the force applying

50
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,739
on a fluid volume is zero. What I
will write is the force balance,

51
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:22,880
the balance of stress for a fluid
element. Here is this fluid element,

52
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,880
it  undergoes in the x direction, on the left, (-p+2μ(∂u/∂x)dy,
the element surface on which is applied

53
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:41,310
the normal stress. On the right, a force
absolutely equivalent with here the pressure

54
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:48,310
pushing in the opposite direction of the positive
orientation of Ox. - (-p+2μ(∂u/∂x)dy measured

55
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,090
in x+dx, the whole multiplied by dy, the thickness
of the facet. We also have forces

56
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,490
in the x direction, stresses in
the x direction that are applied on the upper

57
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,630
and lower facets. These are
essentially shear stresses.

58
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:17,630
The viscosity (μ(∂u/∂y) which is the vertical
gradient of the horizontal velocity + the symmetric

59
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,800
part, the horizontal gradient of
the vertical velocity ∂v/∂x in y + dy multiplied

60
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,430
by dx which is the length of the element,
in way to transform the stress in a force.

61
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:38,430
On the lower facet we have -μ
in the direction Ox, (∂u/∂y)(y) + (∂v/∂x)(y)

62
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,660
dx. We do the total sum of all
these forces and we obtain the following equation,

63
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:52,630
with a little Taylor expansion, we
obtain  (∂p/∂x) - 2μ(∂^2u/∂x^2)

64
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:59,630
- μ(∂^2u/∂y^2 + ∂^2v/∂x∂y), however,
reminder that ∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y = 0,

65
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:08,160
therefore,  (∂^2u/∂x^2) + (∂^2v/∂x∂y)
= 0 so this term is simplified with one of

66
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:27,009
these elements here. Thus, I obtain finally 
the following equation which is that (∂p/∂x)

67
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,919
- μ(∂^2u/∂x^2 + ∂^2u/∂y^2) =0, I could 
have reasoned in a totally similar way

68
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,710
in y and I would have obtained an equation totally
similar. Here are the 3 equations that we call

69
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,150
Stokes equations, they are valid
because we have neglected the inertia and

70
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,509
they thus express the mass
balance, the momentum balance

71
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:49,449
along x and the momentum 
balance along y. We are going

72
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:53,009
to make a dimensional analysis of these
equations. We will use the reference

73
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:56,789
scales to build dimensionless
variables. The variables are u horizontal

74
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:01,500
velocity, v vertical velocity, x, y and
p. The dimensional variables, we will

75
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,289
note them with ~, the difference is that
u is measured in m/s where u~ is measured

76
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:10,930
in nothing, it does not have units. Then
we will determines gauges, i.e.

77
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,710
characteristic scales. These characteristic
scales, there will be an horizontal

78
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,220
velocity U which is undetermined at this
point, a scale of vertical velocity V

79
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,139
which is well-known as I am puling on this
plate at the velocity v, a characteristic length

80
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:31,159
which is l, which is the extension of the fluid film,
so that is well-known, h which is the thickness

81
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:36,729
of the film and p that is undetermined and that
is a pressure gauge, that is undetermined

82
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:41,349
at this point. Thus, things are written
in the following way, a velocity with dimensions

83
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,259
is equal to a velocity gauge, a characteristic
scale multiplied by a dimensionless

84
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:49,569
velocity and for p there is a small
subtlety that is for p I will also

85
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,849
take a pressure referential, for
example the atmospheric pressure p0, this

86
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:58,970
will allow me to define the level
of pressure because in the previous equations

87
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,970
you observe that the pressure intervenes
only through its gradient and never by

88
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,569
the constant value of pressure, so the
pressure is defined from a reference constant

89
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:12,500
that I set here, P is my pressure gauge
which is in pressure units and p~ is my

90
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,740
dimensionless pressure. I now take
these expression that I inject in the equations.

91
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:23,419
We remember, very important, that my sellotape
is very thin, which means

92
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:30,419
the distance 2l is much bigger than
the distance h. I start from the equations

93
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:42,330
of conservation, that I nondimensionalize. I obtain
the following relation, as u, I recall

94
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:49,180
that it is written Uu~ and that U is a gauge,
it is not a field, although u is a

95
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,339
field that depends on x and y, it comes out of the
derivative, as well as l that comes out of the derivative

96
00:08:54,339 --> 00:09:00,680
in the definition of x, h which comes out from y
and v that comes out from V. Now that I have this

97
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,620
equation, I will apply the principle of
least degeneracy and that makes one think

98
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,570
on a phrase from Einstein saying "Everything
should be made as simple as possible, but

99
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,890
not simpler", we must do things as
simple as possible, but not too simple.

100
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,060
It is the principle that we will apply,
we have an equation with 2 terms, we

101
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,769
have the freedom to choose the velocity gauge
U such that these two terms are

102
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,470
more or less of the same size so that the equation
keeps entirely its meaning, we have

103
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:36,760
also the choice of choosing a velocity gauge
U that is such that the left term or

104
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,649
the right term dominates. In this case here,
the meaning of the equation becomes extremely

105
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:46,850
weak because I simply obtain an
equality  ∂u/∂x = 0 ou ∂v~/∂y~ = 0

106
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,839
and these are too simple equations,
the principle of least degeneracy consists

107
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,050
in conserving the minimum number of term possible
to keep a meaning to our equation.

108
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,470
In this case, I will ask these two
terms to be more or less the same size

109
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,980
and I will thus write V = Uh/l, what do
I observe ? I observe that as h/l is

110
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,839
very small this means that v/U is also
very small, and so the vertical velocity

111
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,190
is much smaller than the horizontal velocity,
meaning that the the main part of the motion

112
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,800
is unidirectional in the x direction. With
these hypothesis, the non-dimensional equation

113
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,060
is exactly equal to the dimensional equation,
except that here the variables with ~ are

114
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,610
variables with no dimensions. If
now I inject my gauges, so my

115
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,850
characteristic scales of pressure, velocity
and distance in the equation of conservation

116
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,740
of motion along x, here is the result
that I obtain. I obtain that the term ∂p/∂x

117
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:46,740
has a size P/l, I obtain that the term
μ(∂^2u/∂x^2) has a size μ(U/l^2) and

118
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:53,510
the term μ(U/h^2) corresponds to ∂^2u/∂y^2.
You see that as h << l, the second 

119
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,500
derivative along y is much bigger than
the second derivative along x. Indeed, I 

120
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,930
divide here by h which is small whereas here
I am dividing by l which is relatively big,

121
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,370
so the ratio between these two terms is simply
l^2/h^2, i.e. a very big number,

122
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,370
so the term of the right is much
bigger. I can neglect this term.

123
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,899
Now I am applying the principle of least
degeneracy that will set my pressure

124
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:22,899
gauge. I thus find as a pressure
gauge: μ(Ul/h^2) and if I do this, 

125
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,839
the principle of least degeneracy allows
me to find a dimensionless equation

126
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,139
very simple which is ∂p/∂x = ∂^2u/∂y^2,
you see how I have simplified things,

127
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:36,920
I kept only half of the Laplacian of 
U. I fund that ∂^2u/∂x^2 was

128
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,740
far too small to be taken into account,
simply because of the scale

129
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,630
separation, as I am in lubrication
i.e. a thin layer. Now

130
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,579
I am working on the equation of Oy and I apply
the same principles, so I find for

131
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:53,279
the gauges of ∂p/∂y, P/h, I find the
two components of the Laplacian of which one is

132
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,519
much smaller than the other and I
simplify it so I can already get rid of

133
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,320
this term and now I compare by replacing
the value of the pressure gauge, the term

134
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,320
on the left which is μUl/h^3, i.e.
P which is μUl/h^2 and so here μUl/h^3 that

135
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,959
I must compare to this term here
which is  μUh/lh^2, this term here, is also
μUl/h^3 and h^2/l^2, this is the same as

136
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:49,220
this and as h is much smaller than
l, this term on the right is much smaller

137
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:58,000
than the pressure. Only possible conclusion,
even if I try to apply the principle

138
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,880
of least degeneracy, I cannot
apply it anymore as I do not have any degrees of

139
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,589
freedom left, I have set my gauge of U, I have set
my gauge of P, all my gauges are set

140
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:11,329
and so with the gauges that I have set, I
find that in this equation, the viscous

141
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:15,940
terms of the Laplacian are far too small
compared to pressure gradient and finally,

142
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:22,070
I obtain a very simple equation which is
that ∂p/∂y = 0. In conclusion, I started

143
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,899
from Stokes equation, I did a dimensional
analysis by separating the scales

144
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:31,829
along x and y and I obtained the lubrication
equations here written dimensionless

145
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:36,610
or here on the right, written with dimensions.
You see the simplification, in particular

146
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,269
the 3rd equation, the conservation of
momentum along y is expressed in

147
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:45,160
an extremely simple way ∂p/∂y = 0.
Here is the problem that I must solve,

148
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,589
I must solve the following problem: The
velocity on the lower wall is equal

149
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:55,060
to 0 both in the x and y directions.
The pressure on the edge of the lubrication film

150
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,089
is equal to p0, atmospheric pressure.
On top, I have a horizontal velocity which

151
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,529
is zero, because it is a plate, and
the vertical velocity is equal to v.

152
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:05,959
Inside, I must solve the 3 following
equations : ∂p/∂y = 0, ∂p/∂x - μ

153
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:12,959
(∂^2p/∂y^2) = 0 and ∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y
= 0. I begin by solving u, you see 

154
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,089
that it is quite easy, I have here an equation
with separated variables : p does not depend

155
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,720
on y so ∂p/∂x only depends on x and
so I can easily integrate u by discovering

156
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,920
that is a profile semi-parabolic or parabolic.
I adjust the constants of this integration,

157
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:33,329
in order to satisfy the boundary conditions,
this I discover that u(x,y) = (1/2μ) (∂p/∂x)(y(y-h)),

158
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:39,170
hence u in 0 is 0 and u in h is 0. Now
I can easily find v from

159
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,509
the continuity equation and in particular
v in h, so I integrate the continuity equation,

160
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:50,509
I recall that it is  ∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y
= 0, that I integrate in y between 0 and h and I

161
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:58,639
find that v(x,h) is equal to this
integral here. If I replace  ∂u/∂x by

162
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:05,779
its expression, I obtain that v(x,h) = (h^3/12μ).(d^2p/dx^2).
From now on, I know the vertical velocity

163
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,800
in h, it is equal to V, which gives me the
second derivative of the pressure with respect

164
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,600
to x. I only have to integrate the pressure
and, as I know that the pressure in + or

165
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,110
- l must be equal to p0, I can easily find
that the pressure profile is parabolic

166
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:28,110
and is expressed as p0 - 6μv/h^3(l^2
- x^2), so if I do x = l, I have indeed p0,

167
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,060
and I do x = 0, i.e. I 
am in the center of my lubrication film,

168
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,889
I observe that there is a low pressure, and so
it is a suction force that will hold back

169
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:44,889
the plate. Hence, I can now deduce
the vertical velocity everywhere, v(y) = V(y/h)^2

170
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:54,120
[3 - 2(y/h)]. From here, I can find that
the normal viscous stress will be 0

171
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:08,329
simply because dv/dy is equal to V((2y/h^2).3-(2.3y^2/h^3)),
and

172
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:35,819
when I apply it in y = h, I have here 6/h
and here I also have 6/h with a - so I obtain

173
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:43,259
0. Next step, now I can calculate
the force, the force will simply be given

174
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,079
by applying the stress along the
plate, this stress is composed

175
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,370
partly by the pressure but also partly
by the term that I just calculated but that

176
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,370
turns out to be 0. Hence, I obtain knowing 
that p(x) = p(0) - 6μv/h^3  that I integrate

177
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:06,850
from -l to l. I must do the integral
from -l to l of - 6μv/h^3(l^2-x^2) dx. I

178
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,680
start by integrating the constant term,
I find that it is -(6μv/h^3)l^2.2l then

179
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:33,100
I integrate the parabolic term where I find
that it is + (6μv/3h^3)l^3 - (-l^3), so

180
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:41,750
2l^3. I find that the whole is equal to
(-12+4).(6μvl^3/h^3), so -12 +4 makes

181
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:23,630
-8 and so my final force is equal to -8.μvl^3/h^3.
I observe that the more h is small, the more the force

182
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,780
to exert is big, which is quite
intuitive, and the sellotape films, the

183
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,100
viscous film of glue which is deposited under
the sellotape is extremely thin such that

184
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,440
the force that must be applied to
pull out this tape is very big. In particular

185
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,270
the weight of the sellotape alone is not sufficient
to reach a detachment velocity

186
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,550
big enough.
