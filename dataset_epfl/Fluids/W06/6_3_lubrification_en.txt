Hello and welcome to this third module of the sixth chapter. In this sixth chapter we are learning to make balances, balances of momentum, we have also learnt to make mass balances and today we will address a particular case where the geometry of the flow will allows us to simplify the momentum balances.
We will develop a theory called lubrication theory. As I was saying, we have seen quite in detail mass balances, by doing first of all a complete balance then by doing an interpretation very precise of the divergence operator.
Then, we have defined the momentum balances in viscous regime and introduced in particular the Poiseuille flow. Today, the third module, which will be a very long module, we will develop the lubrication theory.
What is lubrication? Lubricated flows are flows in thin layers of fluid, what does it mean ? It means that in these flows, if we are considering plane flows, the two directions of the plane do not have the same characteristic length. For example, when you have a water puddle which is much more stretched than it is high, you are in a situation of lubrication. In the same way, when you have a rotor turning within a stator, in a hydraulic bearing, you have an oil film that separates the rotor and the stator that is extremely thin, of which the thickness is small compared to the length of this film, i.e. the circumference of the stator or the rotor. Here are two situations where the two directions of the plane do not have the same characteristic length.
There are many others, the example of the air track or any other situation where we could apply the theory of lubrication. The point of having this ratio of scale in the lengths is that it induces directly a scale ratio in the velocities, hence the flow is quasi-unidirectional, we will see that it is not unidirectional but that the velocity in the longitudinal direction, in the direction where the length is big, is much bigger than the velocity in the direction where the characteristic length, the thickness is thin. Instead of developing in a general way the theory of this equation,
I will illustrate this equation in a very particular case which is the case of a lubrication problem where we are looking to determine what is the force to exert on a plate of length 2l, so really a two-dimensional problem, to lift it at a velocity v knowing that it is "stuck" to a substrate by a film of viscous fluid of thickness h. The question that raises is "What is the necessary force to pull this plate at a given velocity
?" In a certain way, we can speak here of a principle of sellotape.  Anyway, we can speak of lubrication forces that will be opposed to the pulling of this plate, for that, we will assume the flow to be stationary and plane, it is a hypothesis quasi-static as the velocity is non zero, h depends on time. We consider that the variation of h with respect to time is slow and so we can make this quasi-static hypothesis. In these conditions, the first balance to write is the one we have written in module 6.1, i.e. the mass balance for an incompressible fluid. As it is indicated here, everything that goes in must come out, on the left we have u(x, y) dy, on the right -u(x + dx, y)dy, and, by doing the difference of both, we naturally get the gradient âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x and the gradient âˆ‚v/âˆ‚y that we sum and that must be equal to 0. The divergence of the velocity field uv must be null, it is reminder, I send you to module 6.1 for those who want more details. Now, we will consider that the fluid is Newtonian, which means that the general expression of the stress tensor is Ïƒ tensor = -pI + 2Î¼D. So
-pI +2Î¼D, Î¼ dynamic viscosity and D symmetric part of the velocity gradient so of the velocity gradient tensor âˆ‡u. For the origin of lubrication, we will neglect the origin of the fluid's acceleration and suppose that the force applying on a fluid volume is zero. What I will write is the force balance, the balance of stress for a fluid element. Here is this fluid element, it  undergoes in the x direction, on the left, (-p+2Î¼(âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x)dy, the element surface on which is applied the normal stress. On the right, a force absolutely equivalent with here the pressure pushing in the opposite direction of the positive orientation of Ox. - (-p+2Î¼(âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x)dy measured in x+dx, the whole multiplied by dy, the thickness of the facet. We also have forces in the x direction, stresses in the x direction that are applied on the upper and lower facets. These are essentially shear stresses.
The viscosity (Î¼(âˆ‚u/âˆ‚y) which is the vertical gradient of the horizontal velocity + the symmetric part, the horizontal gradient of the vertical velocity âˆ‚v/âˆ‚x in y + dy multiplied by dx which is the length of the element, in way to transform the stress in a force.
On the lower facet we have -Î¼ in the direction Ox, (âˆ‚u/âˆ‚y)(y) + (âˆ‚v/âˆ‚x)(y) dx. We do the total sum of all these forces and we obtain the following equation, with a little Taylor expansion, we obtain  (âˆ‚p/âˆ‚x) - 2Î¼(âˆ‚^2u/âˆ‚x^2)
- Î¼(âˆ‚^2u/âˆ‚y^2 + âˆ‚^2v/âˆ‚xâˆ‚y), however, reminder that âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x + âˆ‚v/âˆ‚y = 0, therefore,  (âˆ‚^2u/âˆ‚x^2) + (âˆ‚^2v/âˆ‚xâˆ‚y)
= 0 so this term is simplified with one of these elements here. Thus, I obtain finally the following equation which is that (âˆ‚p/âˆ‚x)
- Î¼(âˆ‚^2u/âˆ‚x^2 + âˆ‚^2u/âˆ‚y^2) =0, I could have reasoned in a totally similar way in y and I would have obtained an equation totally similar. Here are the 3 equations that we call
Stokes equations, they are valid because we have neglected the inertia and they thus express the mass balance, the momentum balance along x and the momentum balance along y. We are going to make a dimensional analysis of these equations. We will use the reference scales to build dimensionless variables. The variables are u horizontal velocity, v vertical velocity, x, y and p. The dimensional variables, we will note them with ~, the difference is that u is measured in m/s where u~ is measured in nothing, it does not have units. Then we will determines gauges, i.e. characteristic scales. These characteristic scales, there will be an horizontal velocity U which is undetermined at this point, a scale of vertical velocity V which is well-known as I am puling on this plate at the velocity v, a characteristic length which is l, which is the extension of the fluid film, so that is well-known, h which is the thickness of the film and p that is undetermined and that is a pressure gauge, that is undetermined at this point. Thus, things are written in the following way, a velocity with dimensions is equal to a velocity gauge, a characteristic scale multiplied by a dimensionless velocity and for p there is a small subtlety that is for p I will also take a pressure referential, for example the atmospheric pressure p0, this will allow me to define the level of pressure because in the previous equations you observe that the pressure intervenes only through its gradient and never by the constant value of pressure, so the pressure is defined from a reference constant that I set here, P is my pressure gauge which is in pressure units and p~ is my dimensionless pressure. I now take these expression that I inject in the equations.
We remember, very important, that my sellotape is very thin, which means the distance 2l is much bigger than the distance h. I start from the equations of conservation, that I nondimensionalize. I obtain the following relation, as u, I recall that it is written Uu~ and that U is a gauge, it is not a field, although u is a field that depends on x and y, it comes out of the derivative, as well as l that comes out of the derivative in the definition of x, h which comes out from y and v that comes out from V. Now that I have this equation, I will apply the principle of least degeneracy and that makes one think on a phrase from Einstein saying "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler", we must do things as simple as possible, but not too simple.
It is the principle that we will apply, we have an equation with 2 terms, we have the freedom to choose the velocity gauge
U such that these two terms are more or less of the same size so that the equation keeps entirely its meaning, we have also the choice of choosing a velocity gauge
U that is such that the left term or the right term dominates. In this case here, the meaning of the equation becomes extremely weak because I simply obtain an equality  âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x = 0 ou âˆ‚v~/âˆ‚y~ = 0 and these are too simple equations, the principle of least degeneracy consists in conserving the minimum number of term possible to keep a meaning to our equation.
In this case, I will ask these two terms to be more or less the same size and I will thus write V = Uh/l, what do
I observe ? I observe that as h/l is very small this means that v/U is also very small, and so the vertical velocity is much smaller than the horizontal velocity, meaning that the the main part of the motion is unidirectional in the x direction. With these hypothesis, the non-dimensional equation is exactly equal to the dimensional equation, except that here the variables with ~ are variables with no dimensions. If now I inject my gauges, so my characteristic scales of pressure, velocity and distance in the equation of conservation of motion along x, here is the result that I obtain. I obtain that the term âˆ‚p/âˆ‚x has a size P/l, I obtain that the term
Î¼(âˆ‚^2u/âˆ‚x^2) has a size Î¼(U/l^2) and the term Î¼(U/h^2) corresponds to âˆ‚^2u/âˆ‚y^2.
You see that as h << l, the second derivative along y is much bigger than the second derivative along x. Indeed, I divide here by h which is small whereas here
I am dividing by l which is relatively big, so the ratio between these two terms is simply l^2/h^2, i.e. a very big number, so the term of the right is much bigger. I can neglect this term.
Now I am applying the principle of least degeneracy that will set my pressure gauge. I thus find as a pressure gauge: Î¼(Ul/h^2) and if I do this, the principle of least degeneracy allows me to find a dimensionless equation very simple which is âˆ‚p/âˆ‚x = âˆ‚^2u/âˆ‚y^2, you see how I have simplified things,
I kept only half of the Laplacian of 
U. I fund that âˆ‚^2u/âˆ‚x^2 was far too small to be taken into account, simply because of the scale separation, as I am in lubrication i.e. a thin layer. Now
I am working on the equation of Oy and I apply the same principles, so I find for the gauges of âˆ‚p/âˆ‚y, P/h, I find the two components of the Laplacian of which one is much smaller than the other and I simplify it so I can already get rid of this term and now I compare by replacing the value of the pressure gauge, the term on the left which is Î¼Ul/h^3, i.e.
P which is Î¼Ul/h^2 and so here Î¼Ul/h^3 that
I must compare to this term here which is  Î¼Uh/lh^2, this term here, is also
Î¼Ul/h^3 and h^2/l^2, this is the same as this and as h is much smaller than l, this term on the right is much smaller than the pressure. Only possible conclusion, even if I try to apply the principle of least degeneracy, I cannot apply it anymore as I do not have any degrees of freedom left, I have set my gauge of U, I have set my gauge of P, all my gauges are set and so with the gauges that I have set, I find that in this equation, the viscous terms of the Laplacian are far too small compared to pressure gradient and finally,
I obtain a very simple equation which is that âˆ‚p/âˆ‚y = 0. In conclusion, I started from Stokes equation, I did a dimensional analysis by separating the scales along x and y and I obtained the lubrication equations here written dimensionless or here on the right, written with dimensions.
You see the simplification, in particular the 3rd equation, the conservation of momentum along y is expressed in an extremely simple way âˆ‚p/âˆ‚y = 0.
Here is the problem that I must solve,
I must solve the following problem: The velocity on the lower wall is equal to 0 both in the x and y directions.
The pressure on the edge of the lubrication film is equal to p0, atmospheric pressure.
On top, I have a horizontal velocity which is zero, because it is a plate, and the vertical velocity is equal to v.
Inside, I must solve the 3 following equations : âˆ‚p/âˆ‚y = 0, âˆ‚p/âˆ‚x - Î¼
(âˆ‚^2p/âˆ‚y^2) = 0 and âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x + âˆ‚v/âˆ‚y
= 0. I begin by solving u, you see that it is quite easy, I have here an equation with separated variables : p does not depend on y so âˆ‚p/âˆ‚x only depends on x and so I can easily integrate u by discovering that is a profile semi-parabolic or parabolic.
I adjust the constants of this integration, in order to satisfy the boundary conditions, this I discover that u(x,y) = (1/2Î¼) (âˆ‚p/âˆ‚x)(y(y-h)), hence u in 0 is 0 and u in h is 0. Now
I can easily find v from the continuity equation and in particular v in h, so I integrate the continuity equation,
I recall that it is  âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x + âˆ‚v/âˆ‚y
= 0, that I integrate in y between 0 and h and I find that v(x,h) is equal to this integral here. If I replace  âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x by its expression, I obtain that v(x,h) = (h^3/12Î¼).(d^2p/dx^2).
From now on, I know the vertical velocity in h, it is equal to V, which gives me the second derivative of the pressure with respect to x. I only have to integrate the pressure and, as I know that the pressure in + or
- l must be equal to p0, I can easily find that the pressure profile is parabolic and is expressed as p0 - 6Î¼v/h^3(l^2
- x^2), so if I do x = l, I have indeed p0, and I do x = 0, i.e. I am in the center of my lubrication film,
I observe that there is a low pressure, and so it is a suction force that will hold back the plate. Hence, I can now deduce the vertical velocity everywhere, v(y) = V(y/h)^2
[3 - 2(y/h)]. From here, I can find that the normal viscous stress will be 0 simply because dv/dy is equal to V((2y/h^2).3-(2.3y^2/h^3)), and when I apply it in y = h, I have here 6/h and here I also have 6/h with a - so I obtain
0. Next step, now I can calculate the force, the force will simply be given by applying the stress along the plate, this stress is composed partly by the pressure but also partly by the term that I just calculated but that turns out to be 0. Hence, I obtain knowing that p(x) = p(0) - 6Î¼v/h^3  that I integrate from -l to l. I must do the integral from -l to l of - 6Î¼v/h^3(l^2-x^2) dx. I start by integrating the constant term,
I find that it is -(6Î¼v/h^3)l^2.2l then
I integrate the parabolic term where I find that it is + (6Î¼v/3h^3)l^3 - (-l^3), so
2l^3. I find that the whole is equal to
(-12+4).(6Î¼vl^3/h^3), so -12 +4 makes
-8 and so my final force is equal to -8.Î¼vl^3/h^3.
I observe that the more h is small, the more the force to exert is big, which is quite intuitive, and the sellotape films, the viscous film of glue which is deposited under the sellotape is extremely thin such that the force that must be applied to pull out this tape is very big. In particular the weight of the sellotape alone is not sufficient to reach a detachment velocity big enough.
