1
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:07,274
We now approach 
the fourth and last module 

2
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:10,258
dedicated to applications 
of Bernoulli's principle. 

3
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:13,571
We will see an extremely
important application

4
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:17,466
hydraulics with free surface,
it is the notion of backwater curves.

5
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:20,798
We will see an equation called
« equation of backwater curves »

6
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:24,257
that allows to calculate the variation
of water height in a channel.

7
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:28,438
To do so, we will consider
a channel with a certain slope,

8
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:31,701
we will assume that we are working
at constant flow rate and that

9
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,845
the variation of water height
is continuous along my channel.

10
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:37,954
We will see that we can, with
this equation of the backwater curve,

11
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,172
calculate exactly the variation
of height as a function of the distance.

12
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:46,523
Unfortunately, this hypothesis
of continuous variation is not true

13
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,086
in certain cases.

14
00:00:48,742 --> 00:00:52,549
It is for example what happens 
with a waterfall with which


15
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:57,280
we will have a brutal variation
of the water height and we will have

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,470
the transition of a subcritical regime
to a supercritical regime.

17
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:04,553
The inverse case, transition
of a supercritical regime

18
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:06,864
with a weak water height
to a subcritical

19
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:11,449
with a strong water height,
this transition is called

20
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:15,186
a hydraulic jump and here again
it results in a brutal variation

21
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:18,120
of water height
over a distance relatively short.

22
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:21,354
We will not be able to do 
the hypothesis of continuous variation.

23
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:26,071
Let's see now the notion of backwater
curve, i.e. the variation

24
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:29,901
of water height compared
to the bottom of a channel

25
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,409
as a function of the distance.

26
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:38,017
I consider a small elementary volume
of length dx between two points A and B.

27
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:45,190
We assume that the height varies
in a continuous way between A and B.

28
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:49,779
I will use Bernoulli's principle
that allows me to write the conservation

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,506
of head between the points A and B.

30
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,739
In fact, we will take into account 
a slight head loss

31
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,544
that will be proportional
to the distance dx.

32
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,826
I will add 2 hypotheses.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,131
The first one is the one
of a steady state.

34
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:12,249
The flow rate is equal to the product uh, the
flow rate per unit of width is constant.

35
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:15,758
The second hypothesis is continuity.

36
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:22,417
We are working in a regime gradually
varying, i.e. the water height

37
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:25,977
varies continuously between points A and B

38
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:31,811
and the energy dissipation dh
is proportional to the distance

39
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:33,239
between these two points.

40
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:36,595
We can write that the energy
dissipation, the head loss,

41
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:42,078
is proportional to the length
multiplied by a coefficient,

42
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,746
we have seen that the coefficient was called
the energy slope.

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,639
I have a sign minus because
it is an energy dissipation.

44
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:52,192
The equation of the backwater curve
can be obtained in a way

45
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:55,876
relatively simple by differentiating
this equation of Bernoulli

46
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:57,287
with respect to x.

47
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:03,244
If we differentiate Bernoulli's equation,
we obtain the three following terms :

48
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:09,474
the differential of the elevation allows
to obtain the angle

49
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:11,478
of inclination of the channel.

50
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:16,114
Here, we have the differential
of h with respect to x,

51
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:20,357
h being what we are looking to calculate.
Here we have the differential of

52
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:24,248
the kinetic energy and we will use
the fact that we are in a steady state.

53
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:28,298
u = q over h, so I will substitute here

54
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:35,238
u by u over h. Then I will suppose
that I can calculate the head loss

55
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:40,066
by knowing the friction slope 
and by using an empirical formula,

56
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:42,109
for example, Manning-Strickler's.

57
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:46,674
After a few mathematical
manipulations, this equation here

58
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,282
can be changed under this form here.

59
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:53,644
We see appearing the ratio q squared
over g h cubed and it is easy

60
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:56,771
to be convinced that this ratio
is nothing else than

61
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,629
the Froude number squared.

62
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,727
I can put my equation
of backwater curve

63
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,455
under the following form where
I make appear a ratio

64
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,979
between a numerator and a denominator.

65
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:12,711
The numerator is equal to the difference
between the friction slope jf

66
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:16,115
that reflects the head loss 
and the channel's slope.

67
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,813
The denominator is a function
of the Froude number,

68
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:21,765
equal to the Froude number squared minus 1.

69
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:24,243
This equation that governs
the h variations,

70
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:27,142
is a first-order non-linear 
differential equation.

71
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:31,928
Non linear because here intervenes
the Froude number raised to the square,

72
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:36,409
so we have a non linear variation of h,
first order equation because

73
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:38,134
the differential is of the first order.

74
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:42,034
We will need one and only one condition
at the boundaries to solve

75
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:43,842
this differential equation.

76
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:47,579
We will see right after what boundary
condition we must consider.

77
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:53,600
A few comments : the first one
concerns what is happening when

78
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:56,119
the numerator N is equal to 0.

79
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:59,288
As we are in a steady state,
the flow rate is constant,

80
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:03,055
when N is equal to 0, it means that
the height is constant

81
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:09,736
and so we have a height a flow rate constant
so we are in a uniform steady state.

82
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:17,477
When D(h) tends to 0, so that
the Froude number tend to 1,

83
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:22,678
then D(h) over D(x) tends to infinity,
we will thus have like

84
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:27,811
a vertical tangent, so a variation
extremely brutal of the water height

85
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:29,323
over a very short distance.

86
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,423
We will thus quit the frame 
of our hypotheses.

87
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:36,367
I recall that we were assuming to have
a slow and continuous variation

88
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:38,978
of the water height
as a function of the distance.

89
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,737
When such a case occurs,
that the Froude number tends to 1,

90
00:05:43,938 --> 00:05:47,729
that the denominator here tends to 0,
and that the height tends to infinity,

91
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,500
we are beyond the field of application
of the backwater curve.

92
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:53,935
We will see right after
how to deal this case.

93
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:58,481
Before approaching the question relatively
delicate of the boundary condition

94
00:05:58,802 --> 00:06:01,144
that we must give to our equation
of backwater curve,

95
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:04,966
we must give a few physical notions
on the propagation of information

96
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:07,321
for a water flow.

97
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:13,333
Let's consider firstly the basic case
where we have water at rest

98
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,900
and we have a small water thickness.

99
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:21,178
We are thus in the frame of hypothesis
called « shallow water regime »

100
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,123
and in this case, the waves
at the surface of the water

101
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:29,319
follow an equation called
« equation of linear waves ».

102
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:35,629
The demonstration is beyond the scope
of this course but the usable result

103
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:37,301
is the following,
it is relatively important : 

104
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:40,326
we will have waves
that will propagate 

105
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:45,325
at the same velocity, equal to the square root of gh,
h being the water height.

106
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,416
We have some here plus or minus, so
we will have velocities that propagate

107
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:50,468
in two opposite directions.

108
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:53,899
As we are in a scope
of linear approximation,

109
00:06:54,191 --> 00:07:00,687
if the water, instead of being at rest, is in
motion, with an average velocity u,

110
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:06,772
the velocities will superimpose and so
the propagation velocity of the wave

111
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:13,327
at the water surface will be equal to
the water velocity + the water velocity

112
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:15,441
in shallow water at rest.

113
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,434
The propagation velocity of the wave,
of the intumescence, c, will be equal to

114
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:25,169
the water velocity + this velocity
equal to plus or minus square root of gh.

115
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:31,151
If I put square root of gh as a factor,
I can show that c is equal to

116
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,430
square root of gh multiplied by the Froude
number plus or minus 1.

117
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:38,318
Let's now look at the behavior
of the waves as a function of the Froude number.

118
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:43,864
In the case of a subcritical regime,
when the Froude number

119
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:48,785
is smaller than 1, we have a negative
propagation velocity,

120
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:54,398
a propagation velocity here positive, 
so the waves will propagate

121
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,527
in the opposite directions.

122
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,146
Physically, it means that if
I distrub the flow 

123
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:01,638
at a given place,

124
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:06,061
the perturbations will propagate
in the positive and negative directions,

125
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:10,381
among other things, we will have perturbations
that going back from the downstream to the upstream.

126
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:15,567
In the case of a subcritical regime,
we must fix the boundary condition

127
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:18,313
of the backwater curve equation
at the downstream.

128
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:22,883
Conversely, here we have a supercritical
regime, the Froude number

129
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,793
is greater than 1.

130
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:31,089
In this case, we see that the velocity
in the 2 cases,  of the waves is positive,

131
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:35,806
they are propagating in the same direction
but have different velocities.

132
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:41,274
If I disturb at a given place
the flow, we will have perturbations

133
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:44,884
that will systematically move
from the upstream towards the downstream

134
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,211
but that will never
go back up the upstream.

135
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:53,658
In this case, the boundary condition
that must be fixed will be at the upstream.

136
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:56,371
I state for the record the case
of the critical regime

137
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:58,827
when the Froude number
is equal to 1.

138
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:04,917
In this case, the waves' velocity tends
to 0 but we have seen that this corresponded 

139
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,368
also to the case where the height tends
towards the critical height,

140
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,220
where the denominator of the equation
of the backwater curve tends to 0

141
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:15,277
and we have a discontinuous variation
of the water height, so it is a case

142
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:18,418
with no big interest.

143
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:23,044
Let's look a couple of examples
of the backwater curve.

144
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,319
We will mainly try to reason
in a qualitative way.

145
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:31,026
Let's imagine that we have to solve
the backwater curve equation

146
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,813
over a certain range 0 L.

147
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:39,293
To do so, I give myself
a friction law,

148
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,880
here a law of Manning-Strickler
that calculates

149
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:44,483
the friction slope jf.

150
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:51,001
Firstly, knowing the flow rate,
being in a steady state,

151
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:57,046
knowing the Manning-Strickler law,
we can calculate the critical height.

152
00:09:57,371 --> 00:10:01,153
The height that corresponds to
a Froude number equal to 1

153
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:05,284
and the normal height that was defined
as being the asymptotic height

154
00:10:05,284 --> 00:10:09,116
the water height towards which should
tend the uniform steady state.

155
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:15,917
Asymptotically, we must always have
the water height that tends towards the normal.

156
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:26,958
In a subcritical regime, we must place
the boundary condition at the downstream.

157
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,956
Here in point L.

158
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,698
If I put a boundary condition
between the critical height

159
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,241
and the normal height, if I look at
the sign of the numerator and the denominator,

160
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:45,221
I observe that the numerator is positive,
the denominator is negative,

161
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,958
so I must have dh or dx negative,
so a decreasing function.

162
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:54,218
As I fix a boundary condition
at the downstream, I will integrate

163
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,081
the differential equation
from the downstream to the upstream,

164
00:10:57,311 --> 00:10:59,677
so in a decreasing direction.

165
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:03,250
I must tend to my normal height
so the backwater curve

166
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:06,280
in a qualitative way must tend
to this normal height.

167
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:11,920
In a supercritical regime,
instead of having the normal height

168
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,644
above the critical height
I have the inverse case : the critical height

169
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,491
above the normal height.

170
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:22,878
In this case, we show that the numerator
is negative, the denominator is positive

171
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:27,923
and being in supercritical regime,
we must fix the boundary condition

172
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:31,242
at the upstream, here at point 0.

173
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:34,465
In this case, I must observe 
that I must have my height

174
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:38,532
that must tend to the asymptotic
height, so the normal height,

175
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,976
so I must have a curve that
qualitatively must vary like this.

176
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:47,657
Here we have a case relatively simple of 
continuous variation of the backwater curve.

177
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:50,462
Let's place ourselves now in a case
slightly different. 

178
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:55,613
I will still consider a
subcritical and supercritical regime.

179
00:11:56,084 --> 00:12:01,625
I will place a boundary condition
here greater than the normal height,

180
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:06,235
in the subcritical case, and here
at the critical height, in this case here.

181
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:09,971
As previously, I must solve 
my backwater curve equation

182
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:11,651
over the range 0 L.

183
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,636
We see that if I am here,
I must always tend to

184
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,830
the normal height
and everything goes smoothly.

185
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:23,655
However, in the right case,
if I have a j that is initially

186
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:27,116
supercritical, we must have 
a negative numerator,

187
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,375
a positive denominator, so also
the dh over dx is negative,

188
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:33,224
so we must have
a decreasing curve.

189
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:35,779
I must normally tend also
to the normal height.

190
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:39,187
The height must reach
the curve h equal to hc.

191
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:44,220
We have seen that it corresponded
to a zero denominator, so

192
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:46,476
a tangent that would be vertical.

193
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,587
We would have h prime of x
that tends to infinity.

194
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:53,209
We could naively imagine here
after that we would start again with

195
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:56,334
a vertical tangent that we would tend again
to my normal height.

196
00:12:56,787 --> 00:13:03,078
This is not at all the case,
in fact, the hypotheses that are at the bases

197
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:07,326
of the backwater curve equation
are that h must vary in a continuous way,

198
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,120
we have small variations of h.

199
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:11,938
Since we have strong
variations of h,

200
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:14,804
the equation is not valid anymore, among other things
because we will have an energy

201
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:17,827
dissipation much more important
linked to the recirculation of water.

202
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:21,578
We will thus have a continuous solution
here, a discontinuous solution,

203
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:25,754
that we call hydraulic jump
and another continuous part

204
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:28,099
so the solution is
much harder

205
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:30,796
to build as we will have to
calculate separately 

206
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:34,027
the two continuous parts and link them
by a discontinuous part

207
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:35,692
that will be the hydraulic jump.

208
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,670
We will now see 
what is a hydraulic jump.

209
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:43,907
On these two photographs,
we have an image of hydraulic jump.

210
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,603
The first one here is an image taken
on the field, at the transition of a threshold.

211
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:53,455
Here we have a arrangement,
a stair step.

212
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:57,985
We have thus a brutal acceleration of
the water, a decrease of the water height

213
00:13:58,174 --> 00:14:00,895
and here a supercritical regime.

214
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:04,225
Far after, here at the downstream,
we have a subcritical regime

215
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:08,140
and the transition from one to another is done
by a brutal variation

216
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:11,914
that we here see with a lot
of backwater, of turbulence,

217
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:14,139
a brutal variation of the water height.

218
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,207
If we studied such a transition
between a regime supercritical 

219
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:22,923
and subcritical in laboratory, we would have
something that is represented here.

220
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:28,456
It is a flow that is visualized
with a laser slice.

221
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:34,589
The blue lines that you see here
are the trajectories of micro-particles

222
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:38,147
that are illuminated by the laser
and leave a certain trace.

223
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:41,405
They give an idea of the velocity profile.

224
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:46,062
We see here the supercritical flow
that continues at the base,

225
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,319
but we see that we have here a zone
of very strong recirculation

226
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:54,880
that will induce a very strong
energy dissipation.

227
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:59,310
We see here the reason why
the backwater curve equation

228
00:14:59,553 --> 00:15:03,176
ceases to be valid near
a jump, simply,

229
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:08,770
besides the energy dissipation at the bottom,
that resulted in a regular head

230
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,298
loss, will be added a singular
head loss due to

231
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:16,407
this strong dissipation due to
the water recirculation.

232
00:15:16,703 --> 00:15:20,523
To calculate the characteristics
of a jump, we will use

233
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:24,689
again the equation of momentum
conservation but

234
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:27,197
over a volume of control.

235
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:31,765
We will consider a certain volume of water
over a length L,

236
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,023
assumed relatively small.

237
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:39,472
We have here a supercritical regime
with a velocity u1

238
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:41,342
and a height h1.

239
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:47,092
Here, at the exit, I have a height h2
and a velocity u2.

240
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:50,365
More towards the downstream, normally,
we must tend,

241
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,010
if there are no other changes,
towards the normal height.

242
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:59,271
We will deal with this brutal variation that
occurs over a certain distance L.

243
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:03,639
Mathematically, we will deal with it
as being a discontinuity,

244
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:06,943
as if brutally here,
in a given point, we went

245
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:12,583
from a height h1 to h2
and from a velocity u1 to u2.

246
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,933
The question is to know how
to position this discontinuity

247
00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:21,341
and what are the relations
that exist between h2 and h1

248
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,967
and u2 and u1.

249
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:26,693
This equation is called
the hydraulic jump equation.

250
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:32,010
To obtain the result, we must make
a certain number of approximations.

251
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,192
I will suppose that I have a bed
little rough and with a slope negligible.

252
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:43,139
During the momentum
conservation, I will neglect

253
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:50,317
the losses due to friction on the floor
as well as the driving component

254
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:54,713
of gravity, which will allow me
to simplify the equation considerably.

255
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:58,445
I will also suppose again that
the flow is steady,

256
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:02,616
and so that the flow rate per width unit
is equal to q.

257
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:03,566
I suppose that

258
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:08,952
I have the same unidirectional flow
with only one on space bar x.

259
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:13,733
I suppose also that the jump is 
stabilized, that it remains at the same position.

260
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:18,107
It is not always the case, but here
will assume that we have a point here

261
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,372
that remains still over time.

262
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:23,759
I will also suppose that on each
side of my volume of control,

263
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:28,130
I have a regime that is fully-developed and
that the pressure is hydrostatic

264
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:31,962
on each side. I have here a
linear distribution of pressure

265
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:35,937
that is exerted on the walls
on my volume of control.

266
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:40,173
Finally, I suppose that the velocity is
uniform through all sections.

267
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:44,028
To obtain my backwater
curve equation, I will use

268
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:50,797
the equations of mass conservation,
a continuity equation that tells me that

269
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:57,995
the flow rate is conserved, that u1h1 is equal to
u2h2 is equal to the flow rate

270
00:17:58,231 --> 00:17:59,780
per unit of width.

271
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:03,611
The conservation of
momentum in steady steate

272
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:07,410
- I have here removed the term of partial
derivative with respect to time -

273
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,777
is written as following :

274
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:14,366
I will project this equation here
on the x axis, the term here

275
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:19,556
of momentum flux
is simply written, when I use

276
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:22,739
the flow rate, rho q (u2 minus u1).

277
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:28,404
I will this suppose that the slope is
null or small enough to be neglected. 

278
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:31,007
This term here projected on the x axis is 0.

279
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:35,687
The pressure term here - I assume
that I have a hydrostatic pressure -

280
00:18:35,934 --> 00:18:38,764
when I calculate
the hydrostatic pressure,

281
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,496
it gives the term here with
a quadratic variation of the height.

282
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:51,045
When I write the stress term
on the walls of the volume of control,

283
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,007
I have in principle a term here
of floor friction

284
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:58,741
that we will neglect by assuming
that the length is small

285
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:02,870
and that the energy dissipation
over this length is smaller

286
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:05,167
than the one linked to the jump,

287
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:07,269
so this term here, I  will neglect it.

288
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:11,057
I will find myself left with only
the momentum flux term

289
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:16,604
which is equal to the pressure difference
and also the mass conservation.

290
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:23,794
Having 4 variables, u1, h1, u2, h2
and only 2 equations,

291
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:27,908
I cannot solve entirely
my system but I can solve it

292
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,407
by fixing conditions.

293
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:34,808
In general, we fix the conditions
at the upstream boundary, we assume that

294
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:40,633
u1 and h1 are known and we are looking
for the downstream conditions, so h2 and u2.

295
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:44,872
As I have 2 equations, 2 unknowns,
I can solve my system.

296
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:48,852
In this case, we show, for example,
when we can neglect the friction,

297
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:52,274
that the previous equation
allows to calculate h2.

298
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:58,216
Generally, we write the result
as following : we have h2 over h1

299
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:03,260
which is a function of the Froude number,
this later being calculated at the upstream.

300
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:05,724
This relation is extremely
important, it is called

301
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:10,506
conjugated relation, as it
links, it conjugates

302
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:13,584
the arcs of the backwater curve.

303
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:17,548
We can look at what is equal
the conjugated relation ;

304
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:23,716
when we draw the ratio h2 over h1
as a function of the Froude number,

305
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:27,505
we see we have more or less a linear
relation with the Froude number.

306
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:31,976
Another aspect of this calculation
is to justify a posteriori 

307
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:37,888
the hypothesis that we have done to neglect
the friction on the bottom of the channel,

308
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:42,069
a friction of type Manning-Strickler,
we have assumed that the turbulence,

309
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:47,825
the backwaters inside the hydraulic jump
are such that the dissipation

310
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,870
on the wall is negligible.

311
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:54,134
To justify this hypothesis,
we can calculate the head loss

312
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:59,261
by calculating the hydraulic head
at point 2 and we see the difference

313
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:01,658
with the hydraulic head at point 1.

314
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:04,297
When we compute the result, I only put
here the final result,

315
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:05,952
I will let you do the calculation.

316
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:11,137
We show that the singular head
loss is a function

317
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,404
of the height h1 and of the Froude
number at the upstream.

318
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:20,733
When we do numerical applications,
we will note that this singular head

319
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:26,671
loss is, in a significant way,
is much stronger than the regular head

320
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:28,759
loss of Manning-Strickler type.

321
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,213
We still need to know
how to conjugate the curves,

322
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:37,037
how to position
the hydraulic jump.

323
00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:42,897
I recall the problem :
We will have a supercritical regime

324
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:48,238
with a boundary condition given
at the upstream and here we have a subcritical

325
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,543
regime with a boundary
condition given at the downstream.

326
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:57,445
The two curves - here we integrate
in the decreasing x direction,

327
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,462
here we integrate in the increasing
x direction and we know,

328
00:22:01,674 --> 00:22:07,514
as here this arc curve
solution crosses the curve hc,

329
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:11,480
that we must have in this region here
a hydraulic jump that

330
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:14,603
links this curve here to this one,
in a discontinuous way.

331
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:17,496
We must have something like this
and that brutally jumps

332
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:18,891
to this solution here.

333
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,235
The question is to know how
to determine the exact position

334
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:24,183
of the hydraulic jump.

335
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:28,619
The answer is relatively simple.
We need a little time and practice 

336
00:22:28,823 --> 00:22:30,968
to understand it well,
but it is relatively simple.

337
00:22:30,968 --> 00:22:33,362
We have managed to integrate the equation
of the backwater curve, so

338
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:36,527
we have here a numerical solution
for the supercritical regime,

339
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:39,698
a numerical solution here
for the subcritical regime.

340
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:46,228
We will calculate the conjugated curve
of the upstream supercritical part.

341
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:49,328
We simply introduce
a new curve

342
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:53,227
h index 2 c, c for « conjugate ».

343
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,328
There is here the conjugated equation.

344
00:22:56,661 --> 00:23:01,866
By drawing this conjugated curve
of the supercritical part here,

345
00:23:02,128 --> 00:23:04,026
I will have here a discontinuous curve.

346
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:13,849
It will cross the subcritical solution
in a point here and this point will be,

347
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:18,070
by definition, a conjugated height
and will also be solution of the equation

348
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,797
of the backwater curve for the downstream part.

349
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:24,333
This point here is looked for, it 
gives the position

350
00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:26,385
of the hydraulic jump.

351
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:29,714
We have a vertical tangent,
so a vertical variation,

352
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:35,048
the height h1, conjugated height, 
is situated right above,

353
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,684
at the downstream abscisse. 

354
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:41,384
We can reason by calculating either
by taking this curve here,

355
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:44,361
by calculating the conjugated height here -
we could have done the opposite

356
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:48,504
by taking this curve here
and by looking for its conjuate

357
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:52,209
which should have been a curve
situated here and intersect

358
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:55,719
the supercritical curve here at point h1.

359
00:23:56,195 --> 00:24:01,310
We have seen here an example of singularity
where we could not apply

360
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:05,184
the backwater curve equation
by going from a supercritical regime

361
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:07,525
to a subcritical regime.

362
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,157
We have the inverse case with the transition
of a subcritical regime to a supercritical.

363
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:17,573
We observe it every time with
a waterfall or a fall of water.

364
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:21,056
Here, for example, we have
a structure called threshold.

365
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:24,181
Here, water which is flowing
at small velocity, so

366
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,626
a subcritical regime

367
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:29,536
and at the transition of the threshold, we will have
an acceleration of water,

368
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,857
a supercritical regime.

369
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:35,887
All structures with a waterfall
are associated with this transition

370
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,693
of sub to supercritical.

371
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,128
To calculate the characteristics 
of this transition between

372
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:44,362
a subcritical to a supercritical regime,
we will use on one hand

373
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:50,046
the Bernoulli equation, by assuming
that we will have conversation of the head

374
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:54,776
at the upstream of the waterfall, between
a point A and a point B.

375
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:59,626
We have seen in the 2nd module
of this chapter that each time we had

376
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:05,506
the passage of an obstacle, at its top
we had to have an horizontal tangent

377
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:10,028
of the free surface and the water height
had to be equal to the critical height.

378
00:25:10,283 --> 00:25:15,978
Here, at point B, I must have a water
height equal to the critical height.

379
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:18,281
This critical height,
I recall it,

380
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:20,904
is defined as being the height
for which the Froude number

381
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:22,267
is equal to 1.

382
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,176
So with Froude number equal to 1,
I obtain the critical height here.

383
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:30,670
My 3rd equation, as before,
the mass conservation or

384
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,531
continuity equation that states
that I have flow rate conservation here, here

385
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:38,440
and in every sections of my flow.

386
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:43,822
When I take into consideration
these three equations and I report them

387
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:46,117
in the equation of conservation
of the hydraulic head

388
00:25:46,382 --> 00:25:50,048
between points A and B,
I obtain the following equation

389
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:56,884
where P, it is the height difference here,
is called the shovel.

390
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:01,092
If I am looking to calculate the water height
for example, I will have

391
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,912
a polynomial equation
of the 3rd order as I will have to

392
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:09,050
re-multiply all the terms here
by h squared and I thus obtain

393
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,138
a polynomial of degree 3
or I can also solve 

394
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:15,285
as a function of q,  assuming
that I know h.

395
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:17,735
In that case, it will be

396
00:26:17,735 --> 00:26:21,591
a polynomial function of degree for
the variable q at the power two thirds.

397
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:27,065
We can solve this equation of degree 3
or, in general, the hydraulicians 

398
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,120
are used to do it
a little differently

399
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,161
and to write the equation
under a form slightly different.

400
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:37,572
For that, we will calculate the hydraulic
head at the upstream of the structure.

401
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:46,186
At the upstream, the total head will be equal to h
plus the kinetic energy translated

402
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:48,265
into water height.

403
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:51,982
I will thus write that the head
here at point A is conserved with the head

404
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,158
at point B and in this case, by writing
this conservation,

405
00:26:57,369 --> 00:26:58,912
this head identity,

406
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:05,212
we obtain the flow rate as a function
of the head h at point A.

407
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,081
The coefficient CD,
if we do the right calculation,

408
00:27:09,513 --> 00:27:13,008
is equal to 2 thirds at the power 3 halves,
so about 0,5.

409
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,915
In practice, the coefficient CD,
the empirical values,

410
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:20,898
are slightly smaller as we will
have head losses,

411
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,644
energy dissipation linked here
to the water recirculations and

412
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,696
to the friction at the level 
of the threshold peak.

413
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,107
We will have in practice CD values
that will be a little smaller.

414
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,295
We see that this threshold equation
essentially allows to calculate,

415
00:27:34,506 --> 00:27:40,733
if we know the total head at the upstream
of the structure, to calculate the flow rate

416
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,631
or conversely, if I know the flow rate,
for example by measuring

417
00:27:44,894 --> 00:27:51,643
the water height, to calculate the total
head in the immediate upstream of the structure.

418
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:55,117
We will give the solution
to our little quiz. 

419
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:59,579
In the 1st problem, we had to
consider a tank pierced

420
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,739
with 3 holes and the question was to know,
every hole forming a jet, what was 

421
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:05,334
the jet that went the furthest.

422
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:08,378
The answer is given directly
by the Torricelli formula

423
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:14,053
that states that the draining velocity
is equal to square root of 2 gh,

424
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:21,138
the velocity that is here will be stronger
than the velocity here and so the jet here

425
00:28:21,345 --> 00:28:25,211
will go further than the jet here,
which we will see right after on a picture.

426
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:31,583
In the 2nd problem, we must study
the motion of a plate

427
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:37,213
that is free to move vertically 
and so this plate is pierced

428
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:39,292
and we inject air.

429
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:42,293
It could seem a little paradoxical,
we tell ourselves if we inject air, 

430
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:45,034
we must force the walls to move away.

431
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:47,412
It is exactly the opposite that occurs.

432
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:50,576
It is an effect called « Venturi effect ».

433
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,991
Simply, here, we will, if
we recall Bernoulli's equation,

434
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:59,820
at a constant height, we will have
pressure + square of the velocity

435
00:29:00,144 --> 00:29:02,449
multiplied by rho which is constant.

436
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:06,030
The pressure must counterbalance
the velocity.

437
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,556
If I have a velocity relatively strong,
I will have, inversely,

438
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,302
a pressure relatively small.

439
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:14,160
In the inside here, the pressure
will be smaller than in the outside.

440
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:17,999
I will thus have a motion
linked to the pressure difference

441
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:21,995
from the top towards the bottom, and so
we will have a narrowing

442
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,288
of the wall here towards the bottom.

443
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,408
So proof in video : we only need to take
a tank, to pierce it with 3 holes,

444
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:34,253
and what we observe quite easily
is that we will have 3 jets and that

445
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:41,659
the jet coming out of the bottom hole will
form the jet that goes the furthest.

446
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:46,259
Here we are at the end of chapter 7
dedicated to applications

447
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:47,564
of Bernoulli's principle.

448
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:49,765
It is also the end of this course.

449
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:53,144
We have seen through this chapter
a few applications

450
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:56,818
extremely basic but also
extremely powerful

451
00:29:57,165 --> 00:30:01,658
of conservation theorems,
here mainly of the conservation

452
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:05,141
of momentum
written as

453
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,970
Bernoulli's principle.
