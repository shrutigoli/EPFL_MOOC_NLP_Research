1
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,700
During this third module dedicated
to Bernoulli's principle we will begin

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,540
by seeing applications of hydraulics
with free surfaces. We will now see a few

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,380
definitions, among other things the notion of head,
of head loss, of specific head,

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,399
of steady state. And during the final
module we will see applications to

5
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,439
be able to calculate and make hydraulic calculations
with free surface. To better understand this

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,690
notion of head loss, i.e.
the dissipation of energy during the motion,

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:41,690
we can make an analogy with a ball
rolling without slipping  along a

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,440
topography in some way of a rollercoaster.
If we assume that there are no losses

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,230
of energy by friction, if I release a
particle A with no initial velocity along

10
00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:01,230
a random profile, it will reach
here the point C. So here we have the translation

11
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:08,010
relatively simple of the principle of conservation
of mechanical energy. This mechanical energy

12
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,010
or total energy is constant, and is equal
to the potential energy + kinetic energy.

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,560
When the ball will go down, it will reach
its maximum velocity at point B, which will also

14
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:29,890
correspond to the point where the potential energy
is minimum in this motion. So of course

15
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,189
it is an idealization of what is happening.
In reality, the ball, due to friction,

16
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,590
will dissipate a part of its energy. So
in practice if you release a particle

17
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:45,590
on a profile with no initial velocity, it
will roll, slide, and will go a little

18
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,090
less high than the initial position, and so
it will stop here at point C. We will then

19
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:59,090
have a regular decrease of the total
energy. The height difference here between

20
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:07,609
the initial point A, which should have been the
final point, and the point C provides information on the

21
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,290
quantity of energy that has been dissipated.
We will see that in hydraulics we will translate

22
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,420
all the energy dissipations in terms
of water height, we will thus see that this

23
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:27,349
measure of height difference will directly
provide information of the energy dissipation,

24
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:34,349
that we will call head loss. So to
sum up, the height difference translates

25
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,819
the energy loss, so we always have the
variation of total energy that is equal

26
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:44,120
to the variation of kinetic energy + the 
variation of potential energy. In this

27
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,159
case here the total energy is not conserved
and will be here slightly negative. We

28
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:57,019
will have a relation that will be identical for
the hydraulics except that the total head

29
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:04,019
that we will consider will be at the time the gravity
potential, ѱ, the pressure and the kinetic

30
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:12,349
energy. Hydraulicians are used
to always reason in equivalent energy

31
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:18,230
of water height, so if I divide this
energy by ϱg I have something that is

32
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,629
homogeneous to a height. ΔH here that will be
negative will be the head loss. Now,

33
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:30,829
if I write this head loss translated
in equivalent of water height, I will 

34
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:37,829
have the gravity potential that will correspond
to the height or the position of the riverbed

35
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:44,209
, the pressure term will correspond
here to the height of my water column, or

36
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,209
the depth of water. We have here a water
motion animated by an average velocity u, I have

37
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:55,209
here the kinetic energy translated in equivalent
height. As so often we will be interested

38
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,989
in rivers, so in water
flows on distances relatively long,

39
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,799
we will have in general variations of
the bottom elevation that will be relatively

40
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,030
modest compared to the variations of height
or of velocity, so in many applications

41
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,940
this term here will be nearly constant,
what will be varying are h and u. For

42
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,320
this reason we introduce another head
called the specific head, which is

43
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,630
equal to the water height, to the pressure term
and the kinetic energy term converted

44
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,470
into equivalent water height. The sum
of both is called the specific head.

45
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,250
The first application of the notion of specific
head concerns the calculation of the relation

46
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:48,310
that exists between flow rate and height for a
specific energy or specific head

47
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:55,310
constant. For that we will use the hypothesis
of steady state : the flow rate per unit

48
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:01,419
width is constant, and is equal to u/h, so
I will be able to substitute in the definition

49
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:08,310
of the specific head the velocity by the
ratio q/h. When I do this, I have the following

50
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:15,310
relation that, for the specific head,
will be equal to h + the term q²/(2gh²). If

51
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:23,539
I assume that the specific head is constant,
I can easily deduce what q is equal to

52
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,750
as a function of H𝗌, and I obtain the following
relation that I can write in dimensionless form

53
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:39,610
by introducing a dimensionless flow rate,
that will be equal to my flow rate divided by g

54
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,520
the flow rate, by the specific head raised
to the power 3, and I introduce the parameter

55
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,360
xi that will be equal to the water height divided
by the specific head. What we see

56
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,360
is that the dimensionless flow rate is written
as the square root of the following equation. Let's look

57
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:04,410
at the shape of this function : we have a curve
bell-shaped, but an asymmetric bell,

58
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,229
with here an increasing part that will correspond
if we calculate Froude numbers. to the

59
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:16,550
Froude numbers greater than
1. We will call this regime the supercritical 

60
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:23,550
regime. The point here ξ = 2/3 corresponds
to the maximum flow rate, and also to the Froude

61
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:31,050
number = 1, and here the decreasing part
will correspond to Froude number that

62
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:38,050
are smaller than 1. We will speak of subcritical
regime. What is important to note

63
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:45,130
here is that for a specific energy or
head constant, there exists a flow rate

64
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,240
maximum, so here we cannot exceed
this zone and this maximum flow rate is in fact

65
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,520
linked to the specific head. The second
interesting element to note is that if

66
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:07,550
we look at what is happening at a given flow rate,
for example here the flow rate = 0.3, I will have

67
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,080
two possible heights, one in the supercritical
regime that will correspond to a small 

68
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:19,030
water height, and another here, in the subcritical
regime, that will correspond to a water

69
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:24,160
height that will be bigger. The height that
will correspond to the Froude number = 1 will be

70
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,160
called the critical height. What must be 
noted is that for any flow rate with a specific

71
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:36,379
head constant, there exists two possible
heights, one in the supercritical regime

72
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:41,750
also called torrential regime), and
that this height will end up here, it

73
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,419
will thus be smaller than the critical height. There
exists a second height in the subcritical

74
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:53,289
regime, also called fluvial 
regime, and this height will be greater

75
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:59,560
than the critical height. The second application
consists in now looking how varies

76
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,659
the specific energy as a function of the height
when we assume that the flow rate is constant.

77
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:12,659
We fix a flow rate, Q, per unit width,
and we look at how the specific head varies.

78
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:20,979
For that, as previously, we will introduce 
the ratio ξ which is the ratio between

79
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:28,759
the water height and the critical height, and
we also introduce a specific head

80
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,700
dimensionless by dividing the specific head
by the critical height. When we do this

81
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:39,250
we obtain the relation here which is extremely
simple. We see that when ξ is very big

82
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,360
compared to 1, this term that is here becomes very 
small. so becomes negligible, so the

83
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,840
specific head behaves as the water
height. Conversely, when ξ is very small

84
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,610
compared to 1, this term here is close to zero
and this term here very very big.

85
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:01,980
Here it means that the specific head
will behave like a function that will be

86
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,450
inversely proportional to the water
height. If I translate this in graphical form, 

87
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,260
I find here that a very large number of
ξ, the specific head, must tend

88
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,260
to the first asymptote, so that corresponds
to H equal to ξ, and that conversely when

89
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,200
I am at a very small number ξ, I
must have something that looks like

90
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,280
a parabolic branch, so that must tend
very quickly to infinity. Like previously

91
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,280
what we will be able to do is to distinguish
two regimes. A regime here that corresponds

92
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:40,670
to the subcritical regime, and here a regime
that will be the supercritical regime, the minimum

93
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,230
here will correspond the transition of the critical
regime, so to the Froude number equal to

94
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:52,090
1.  This diagram solves problems
extremely simple, for example how

95
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:58,340
does a water line varies, we will call this a
backwater curve, so how varies the position

96
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:05,070
of the free surface when we have, at the bottom
of the river, an obstacle.  For example here

97
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:10,220
a step or a stair tread.
To simplify I will assume that we 

98
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,140
are at the upstream at a certain velocity, a certain 
height, and that we are in a subcritical regime,

99
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,930
this the Froude number is smaller than
1. I will also suppose that we have a

100
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:28,930
frame of reference situated here, we thus have a certain
elevation z𝖺, than the step's height, of

101
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,660
the step, is equal to p. We also call this
in hydraulics the shovel, it is a term of

102
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:41,660
old french that designates this height
difference.  As we are in a subcritical regime, 

103
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:50,060
or sub-fluvial, we are situated in this part
here of the curve that links the specific

104
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,960
head as a function of the height. I
will now apply Bernoulli's

105
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,450
principle between point A and the point B. According
to Bernoulli's principle the water height 

106
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,620
+ the gravity potential, i.e.
the elevation + the kinetic energy, i.e.

107
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:10,620
the term here  u²/2g must be constant between
the point A and the point B. We have seen that these

108
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:18,020
two terms here, the specific charge and 
z will vary between the point A and the point B

109
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,640
of a value that will be the value p. If now
I reason in a qualitative way on the diagram

110
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:33,830
h as a function of ξ, I am at point A, I am increasing
the height of a value p, so in dimensionless

111
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:44,050
form this will (p/Hc), so it means
that I must have a decrease of the

112
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:51,150
specific head here that will be equal to
p/Hc, or in dimensionless form, we will 

113
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,880
see that the specific head at point B
it will be the specific head at point A minus

114
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,140
this height difference, i.e.
p. Hence we see qualitatively that in the

115
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:09,140
subcritical regime, the transition here of a 
step by a displacement of point A to point

116
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,580
B will results in a decrease of the
height as we have going from a height

117
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:20,280
that is here to a height that is here. If
now I reasoned in a torrential regime,

118
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,850
the displacement will be done in this direction here
and it will result in a slight

119
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:30,080
increase of the height. So typically
if I had a torrential regime I would have

120
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,370
something that takes the shape of the bottom
and that must slightly increase passing

121
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,100
step. We will now address
an important point concerning the equilibrium

122
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,850
conditions of water flows in a
river. To do so we will consider

123
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:50,110
a volume of water. As we are still reasoning
by unit width, this volume is simply

124
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:57,020
a rectangle represented here with a certain
length L and a certain height h. This control

125
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,250
volume is subjected to many forces,
so pressure forces, on each side

126
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,980
here, these pressure forces as the height
is constant will counterbalance themselves, we

127
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:12,150
will thus not take them into account. The volume
is also subjected to is own weight

128
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:19,150
with a driving component that will simply be
the projection of the weight on the x axis. As we

129
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:25,950
will have friction during the motion we 
assume that we have here a friction force

130
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:31,040
that is exerted, and this force per units of
area, so the stress at the bottom that we 

131
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,040
call wall stress : τ𝘱. is exerted
here. So if I simply write the equilibrium

132
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:46,220
between the driving force of gravity and
the friction force, I will have Psinθ

133
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,980
that will be equal to ϱghLsinθ, p simply being
the density multiplied by the volume,

134
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,840
and I project here by sinθ. This driving
force must be counterbalanced by the friction

135
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,840
forces so here the friction stress
multiplied by the length on which this

136
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,880
friction stress is applied. So
if you simplify here by L you obtain

137
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,880
the following relation : τ𝘱 = ϱghsinθ
that constitutes the equilibrium condition. 

138
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,390
Each time that we will have a river at
equilibrium, the bottom stress will be strictly

139
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:34,190
equal to ϱghsinθ. Now, let's examine
what this equilibrium condition implies

140
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:40,820
if we examine the conservation Bernoulli's 
principle. For that we will consider an

141
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:47,820
infinitesimal volume of length L =dx and
I will writhe Bernoulli's principle

142
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,950
on a small slice, here between a point
A and a point B. Again, what I must

143
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,240
have is that the gravity potential, i.e.
the bottom elevation + the pressure, i.e.

144
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,290
the water height + the kinetic energy
resulting in water height, i.e. u²/(2g),

145
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:11,290
this sum must be conserved, if it isn't
that we now suppose an energy dissipation,

146
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:19,110
so here a head loss ΔH, that
must be negative. So we must have a

147
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,690
decrease of the head between the point A and
the point B, due to friction. If we suppose

148
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,950
that the height here is constant between these
points and that the velocity is constant, all

149
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,920
that we must have is that the elevation of point
A must equal to the elevation of point B

150
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,920
+ this head loss ΔH. As I have an
infinitesimal volume, I will be able to link

151
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:50,820
by introducing here the slope angle, so
i will be the slope, tangent θ. So what

152
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:57,230
I will have is that the elevation of point A
minus the elevation of point B is equal to idx,

153
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,920
and by using the previous relation
and introducing a friction slope,

154
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,920
so I assume that the head loss dH/dx
is equal to j𝘧, the equilibrium condition

155
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,930
if we use Bernoulli's principle is
that the slope must be equal to the friction

156
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,250
slope. It is a result that we will
use afterwards in the equation of

157
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,740
the backwater curves. We ask the question
now of knowing what is worth this head

158
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,030
loss, for that we will introduce the notion
of friction law, that describes

159
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:37,030
how the energy is dissipated, in other
words how  does the head loss varies as a function

160
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:43,250
of the flow variables u and h. So
there exists many formulations, many

161
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,630
empirical forms, in general taken from
experimental data obtained in laboratories.

162
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:54,800
The best known of these formulations is the
Manning-Strickler formula. This Manning-Strickler formula

163
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,000
for example links the wall
stress, or side stresses, as

164
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
function the average velocity u² and as a function
of the water height raised to the power

165
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,360
1/3. There appears thus a friction coefficient
called Manning-Strickler coefficient,

166
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,690
if we refer to what we had
seen in the chapter dedicated to similarities,

167
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:24,930
what we can show experimentally 
and that we can justify theoretically

168
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:30,430
is that this Manning-Strickler coefficient
is linked to the roughness scale of 

169
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:36,810
the bed, so here a d₉₀, it means that
90% of the grains have a size smaller

170
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:43,810
than this d₉₀, and so the Manning-
Strickler coefficient is equal to 26/(d₉₀)^(1/6),

171
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,020
with units here that we will specify
afterwards. Now if I use 

172
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,250
the equilibrium condition expressed in terms
of stress, we had seen that when the

173
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,790
river, the water flow was in a uniform
steady state, the stress at the bottom

174
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:07,090
was equal to ϱghsinθ. If now
I use Manning-Strickler formula

175
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,810
seen previously, what I must have
when I equalize the two terms, it allows me

176
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:18,720
to calculate what the velocity is equal to as a function
of the height. Here what we show is that

177
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,360
the average velocity must vary as h^(2/3)
multiplied by the friction coefficient and

178
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,340
weighted by √i, i being the channel's slope. When
we solve this equation here we can reason

179
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:37,300
in terms of height instead than in terms of
velocity and we have in this case the height

180
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:43,020
in steady state, what we call the normal
height which will be equal to the flow rate per units

181
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,160
of width divided by the Manning-Strickler coefficient
and divided by √i, the whole raised to the

182
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,150
power 3/5th. During this third
module we have seen a couple of elementary notions

183
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,910
of hydraulics with free surface, mainly
the notion of specific head, the notion

184
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:03,070
of head loss and the notion of equilibrium
condition. We will now go

185
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,680
a little further by examining what is happening
in a river, when we are working at

186
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,290
constant flow rate but that the water height
can vary.
