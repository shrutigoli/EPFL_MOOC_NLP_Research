00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,090
Hello, welcome to this last chapter
of the course of fluid mechanics, which will be

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,170
dedicated to Bernoulli's principle. We 
will first start to see Bernoulli's

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,340
principle and its hypotheses. We will then
see three applications relatively simple

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,910
and direct of this principle : first of all
the Torricelli's law that allows us to calculate

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,599
the draining velocity of a tank, then
we will compute the intrusion velocity of a

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,340
heavy gas in a lighter gas, finally,
we will see the Pitot tube that 

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:43,149
calculates the velocity of a flow. It is
a device, among others, that we find

8
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,559
in aeronautics. The second part of this
chapter will be dedicated to hydraulics

9
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,890
with free surface, and we will see how
Bernoulli's principle allows us to calculate

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,659
a certain number of characteristics of
free surface flows in rivers

11
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:02,100
and in channels. First of all, to warm
up a little, I begin with a small

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,100
quiz : let's imagine that we have two plates,
a lower plate which is motionless, and

13
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,830
an upper plate that is movable. This 
upper plate has a hole and

14
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,050
we will inject air through this
hole. The question that raises is the following

15
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,570
: when we injecting air through
the hole, what is happening ? Is 

16
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,310
the plate going to move downwards, it 
is going to stick itself to the lower plate,

17
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:37,840
or on the contrary the plate is going back up. The
second problem, we will see the answer with

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,670
Torricelli's law is the following: we
have a tank full of water, there are three

19
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,560
holes in this tank, at three
different levels, and the question is to

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,140
know, as each the holes creates a
jet, which one of these three jets will go the furthest. 

21
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:03,140
So we start by firstly finding back
Bernoulli's principle from the equation

22
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,780
of momentum conservation 
that we had seen in the last chapter. So

23
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,930
we have previously seen that the momentum
conservation at the local

24
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:21,930
scale is written in the following way : here
in the terms that are on the left, I have the local

25
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:29,510
acceleration, here the convective acceleration. So
here we have the terms that we call inertial

26
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,689
terms, and so the variation of momentum
is equal to the sum of forces

27
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:38,959
applied locally, i.e. the weight,
the pressure gradient, and the divergence

28
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,290
of the stress field. In the same way it is the case
for point mechanics, if I multiply

29
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,700
the equation of momentum conservation
by the velocity, I will be able

30
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,920
to obtain an equation of kinetic energy
conservation. So I will multiply here each

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,959
of the terms by the velocity u. Every time
I will encounter a derivative, I will

32
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,959
replace, for example, u∂u par ∂|u|²
, so I will be able to introduce in this

33
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,889
way the kinetic energy. I have
wrote it here but I will essentially be intrested

34
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:16,409
in fluids that are incompressible, so 
ϱ will be here a constant. So when I

35
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:23,340
multiply here all the terms by u, and that
I integrate, I obtain the following equation,

36
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,969
and I can thus introduce directly 
the kinetic energy, which will be equal to

37
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:33,129
(1/2)ϱ|u|². After a couple of mathematical
manipulations,  what we can show

38
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:39,120
is that the variation, here the material derivative 
of the kinetic energy is equal to the

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,909
local power of forces, so here the power
of gravity forces, the power of pressure

40
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:51,310
forces, and here the power of viscous
forces. Then this equation of conservation

41
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,480
of the energy can be written in a way
slightly different. We will here essentially

42
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,120
introduce a certain number of definitions,
among others, the dissipation function.

43
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,829
When we were doing point
mechanics, what we were showing was

44
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:13,219
that the dissipated energy was a work
multiplied by a velocity, so here the dissipated

45
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:18,090
energy, or the dissipated power will
be exactly equal to the deformation rate multiplied

46
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:24,669
by a stress, and so we will take the
trace of the product of the two tensors. We introduce

47
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,940
what we call the gravity potential,
so we will be able to subsitute 

48
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,319
here ϱg under a vector form by the gradient
of a gravity field which will be here the letter

49
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,710
Ψ. We also introduce the generalized
pressure that is nothing else than

50
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:47,419
the local pressure, plus here this gravity pressure
term. So the equation that we have written

51
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:54,419
previously can be written in the following
way, where we have here the local derivative

52
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,389
of kinetic energy, here a transport
term, so a convection term, a

53
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,229
quantity equal to k, the kinetic
energy, Ψ, the gravity potential, and

54
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:12,270
the pressure. The sum of the two is equal
to the dissipated power, and here a

55
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,569
term that is a divergence of the work of
the external forces if we took a small

56
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:22,330
elementary control volume. So if
I translated what I just said on

57
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:29,090
a graphical form, we must imagine a small
elementary volume. We have here a transport

58
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,520
of a certain quantity that I call Ψ,
which is equal to the kinetic energy, the

59
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,319
potential gravity, and the pressure. The
temporal variation of the kinetic energy

60
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:46,169
and the term of transport of this sum
here, will be equal to the work of the external

61
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:52,120
forces and to the internal dissipation.
This theorem under this form here is not

62
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,120
particularly interesting. However, 
there exists an application which is relatively

63
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,050
remarkable as we will obtain a conservation
theorem for which there are no

64
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,479
differential terms. This domain of application
is encountered quite frequently when we

65
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,840
will be able to assume that we are working with
permanents flows, so the differential

66
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,550
with respect to time of the kinetic energy
is equal to 0, and that we assume that the viscosity

67
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,080
is relatively weak : it will be the case for
example of air, which has a very weak viscosity.

68
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,400
At
that point here I completely assume that the

69
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,699
viscosity is zero, so the stress tensor 
is equal to 0, and the energy dissipation

70
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:38,970
is equal to 0. In this case here, the equation
we have seen previously is written simply

71
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:45,970
as follows : u. ∇(k + Ψ + p)
so the kinetic energy, the gravity potential,

72
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:56,409
and the pressure, this scalar product here is
equal to 0. This means amongst other things

73
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,479
that the geometrical interpretation is
that the term k + Ψ + p can be constant

74
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,719
along a streamline. I recall
what a streamline is : it is

75
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:13,349
a line, and if I take each of the points
of this line here, the velocity must be

76
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:20,349
tangential. So along a streamline,
we must have conservation of the quantity

77
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:24,919
that thus results of the sum of kinetic energy,
gravity potential, and pressure. There,

78
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:30,460
during this first module, we have
seen Bernoulli's principle, we have

79
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:37,460
seen that in a case of approximation relatively
common, we will be able to assume the flow

80
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:43,199
permanent and the viscosity very weak, so
negligible. We can show that there exists

81
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,879
a quantity called in my course Ψ that 
results of the sum of the kinetic energy,

82
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,349
the gravity potential, and the pressure,
and that this quantity Ψ is conserved along

83
00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:01,610
a streamline. So if I take
a streamline, from a point to another,

84
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,379
its quantity Ψ will have exactly the same
value. It is this principle here that we will

85
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:09,349
apply afterwards, and we will see that there
are numerous applications.
