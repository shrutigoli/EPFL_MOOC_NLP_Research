1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,759
During the second module, we will see
three basic applications of Bernoulli's

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,459
principle. We begin with Torricelli's
law, which calculates the draining

3
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:17,660
velocity of a tank. We will then see
von Kármán's formula which calculates

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,490
the velocity of the motion of a heavy gas
through a lighter gas. We will finish

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,140
with the Pitot tube that calculates for
example the velocity of an airplane in the atmosphere.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,140
So let's consider the following problem: we
have a tank of diameter d, filled with water until

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,730
a certain height h, and with a hole at the bottom,
here or here. This tank has a

8
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,960
hole that has a small diameter d, so d will be
very small compared to the diameter of the tank.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,749
We are essentially interested by calculating
the velocity here, namely draining velocity, of

10
00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:03,489
the water through the small hole. The formula
that we will obtain is called Torricelli's law,

11
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:08,659
as it is Evangelista Torricelli who,
in the middle of the seventeenth century, highligthed

12
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:14,420
it experimentally. We had to wait
nearly a century to get a theoretical

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:21,180
analysis of the phenomenon, and it is due to
the Swiss mathematician and physician, Daniel

14
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,939
Bernoulli. We will for that apply 
Bernoulli's principle, and I recall

15
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:31,939
that Bernoulli's principle is applicable
if the medium is incompressible, in permanent 

16
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:37,049
regime, and if we can find a streamline
for which we can determine

17
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,119
the gravity potential, the kinetic energy
and the pressure. So we will consider a

18
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:49,119
fictitious streamline by taking for example
here, a point A, and we assume that we

19
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,909
have a streamline that connects the point
A to the point B situated at the outlet of

20
00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:00,969
the tank. Right after the hole a jet is
formed, if we look at the equations of momentum

21
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:05,579
conservation, we will have, as we
have an inviscid fluid, we will have a velocity

22
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,630
profile uniform through the jet. We
are in steady state, we will thus have

23
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,860
that the pressure gradient must be zero,
so the pressure is constant through

24
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,610
the jet section, which means 
here that we will have all along here this

25
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,440
segment we will have the pressure that will be the
atmospheric pressure. The velocity too

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,520
will be constant, it will be equal to the velocity
at point B, everywhere we will have the same velocity,

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,170
and it is in fact the quantity that we are looking
to calculate. The velocity here at point A is not

28
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,460
known, however we know the initial
position, equal to h, and we also know

29
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,540
that the atmospheric pressure is applied
at point A. To be able to go a little

30
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,920
further, we will do an approximation. We must
assume, we are in a steady state,

31
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,700
we will assume that the draining velocity is
extremely small such that here

32
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,870
the height will be roughly constant, at
least over a time sufficiently long. For

33
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:12,350
this we can use, to justify this
approximation, we can use the equation

34
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:18,350
of mass conservation, what we will
show here is that the volume flow rate

35
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,810
here must be equal to the volume flow rate here.
So this volume flow rate is written as

36
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,540
a surface area multiplied by a velocity. So
the surface area which is here, multiplied by the

37
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:36,540
velocity at point A and the volume flow here
that will be equal to the section multiplied

38
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,930
by the velocity. All the same, the diameter
of the hole is very small compared to the diameter

39
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:49,300
of the tank, what we obtain is that
the velocity at point A must be very small,

40
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,520
compared to the velocity at point B, velocity
v, that we are trying to determine. So in first

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,740
approximation, what we will assume is
that vA is negligible compared to vB and we

42
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,350
are a steady state. If now I 
look at the three terms that constituted 

43
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:12,160
what I called previously, the quantity 
Ψ. So at point A, I assume that the

44
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,590
velocity is negligible, i.e. zero. The gravity
potential, as I am situated at a

45
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,960
height h with respect to a reference point
that will be here, the gravity potential is equal 

46
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,370
to gh, and the pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure.
At point B, so at the outlet, the velocity, it is

47
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,190
what I am trying to calculate, the gravity
potential is zero if my reference point

48
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,090
is here, and again we have the pressure that
is equal to the atmospheric pressure.

49
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:47,090
So all we know is that the quantity
Ψ, which is equal to the gravity potential

50
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:54,320
+ the kinetic energy + the pressure, at
A, is thus only equal to ϱgh, at point

51
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:01,500
B it will be equal to (1/2)ϱv². The identity
here allows us to calculate directly the

52
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,620
draining velocity which is equal here to √(2gh).
The second application of Bernoulli's principle

53
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,970
will concern what we call gravity
current intrusion, i.e. the

54
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,970
motion of a heavy gas through a lighter
gas. So, there are many

55
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,460
examples of such gravity current : for
example in seabeds we can have

56
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:32,389
like here avalanches of sediments, so
the mixture water sediment will be here equivalent

57
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:38,760
to a heavy fluid that propagates through
a lighter fluid. This photograph,

58
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,760
in laboratory, reminds aerosol
avalanches in mountains. Another example

59
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,610
taken from military applications, when
we use a battle gas, so that will be

60
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,210
a heavy gas, and that will propagate in the atmosphere,
the ambient fluid will be the light fluid. What

61
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,389
will interest us here is to calculate
the propagation velocity of this front. So

62
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:06,500
we will see that we will be able to calculate the intrusion
velocity, the motion velocity of 

63
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,510
the front, as a function of the density
difference between the ambient fluid, the light

64
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:17,160
fluid, and the fluid that is here that will be
a water flow. So to simplify the study

65
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,160
we not place ourselves on a slope, we will
assume we have a ground here that will be horizontal, we

66
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,440
have the ambient fluid of density
ρₐ, and here we have the water flow. We will assume

67
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,020
that the two fluids do not mix,
which is not the case of what is represented 

68
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,490
on this image where we have vortices and a
mixture, so we will assume that we will have an

69
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:51,490
interface well defined between the ambient medium
and the heavy gas. So the heavy gas has a density

70
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:57,830
ρ, we also assume that this
flow is moving at a constant velocity u.

71
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,730
If I now place myself in a frame of reference
that is attached to the gravity current,

72
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,370
so for example a frame of reference centered
at point 0, in this case here, the density

73
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:13,510
current is still, and it is the ambient
fluid that had a motion at the

74
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:20,120
velocity -u. To be able to apply Bernoulli's 
principle I still need to determine

75
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,580
a streamline, so I will take as
a streamline the free surface, or interface.

76
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,030
So the interface associates two particularities
that will have conditions slightly

77
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:36,139
different depending on whether we are situated beside
the ambient medium, here the point B, or thst

78
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,810
we are situated beside the heavy fluid, here
point A. Among other things, through the interface

79
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:48,710
which is extremely thin, we will go here
from a density ϱ to a density

80
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:55,710
ϱₐ  with a really small thickness. The point
O, as we are in a frame that is attached

81
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,570
to the gravity current, so the point O
will be what we call a stagnation point, its

82
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:05,889
velocity will be zero. So if I sum up
now all my hypotheses, I thus have

83
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:12,199
a streamline between O and the point A,
in fact the point A is a double point : we

84
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,639
have a point A situated under the interface,
and a point B situated above the

85
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,630
interface, there is thus between these two points
a jump of density, we go from a

86
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:29,669
density ϱ in A to a density
ϱₐ in point B. However we will assume

87
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:34,560
that there are no velocity variation nor
pressure variation. Therefore what we 

88
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,669
will write is that the velocity at point B
is equal to the velocity at point A, and is

89
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,759
equal thus to the velocity of the ambient fluid
: -u. We also assume that we have a

90
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:50,399
streamline, that is established between the
point O and this double point AB. O is thus

91
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,019
a stagnation point in the moving frame of reference
attached to the gravity current so the velocity

92
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:02,059
at point O is zero. I also assume
that there is a distribution of hydrostatic pressure

93
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:05,920
within my density current as
the height difference between the point O

94
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,619
and the point A is equal to h, the pressure
in O is equal to the pressure in A +ϱgh.

95
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:19,240
Bernoulli's principle hence applied
for the streamline in O between O and B

96
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,319
allows me to write the following identity: so
that the pressure in point O + the gravity

97
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:29,639
potential at point O + the kinetic energy
at point O is equal to the pressure at point

98
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,009
B, its gravity potential, and its kinetic
energy. Taking into account of all our

99
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:41,769
hypotheses, so as the pressure at point
O, we have determined it equal to P𝑨

100
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:48,769
+ ϱgh, I will be able here to remove the atmospheric
pressure that appears. The gravity

101
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:54,509
potential in O as it is the origin point
of the frame is zero, and we have seen that it is a

102
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:59,399
stagnation point so the velocity of point O is
zero. On the other side, after having removed

103
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,569
the atmospheric pressure, all that remains
is the gravity potential, we will be careful

104
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:10,220
that it is applied at point B, of density
ϱₐ, and that the velocity of point

105
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,869
B is also equal to ϱₐ. So when we simplify
this equation here, what we obtain is

106
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:20,439
the following relation, that states that u is
equal to the square root of 2 times the difference

107
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:24,660
of density between the heavy gas and the
light gas divided by the density

108
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,110
of the light gas multiplied by gh. We find
something that looks a little like Torricelli's

109
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,559
law, except that now,
we have the √(2gh), except that

110
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:42,449
now it is weighted here by a factor
of co-action which is (ϱ-ϱₐ)/ϱₐ, the product

111
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:49,449
here g multiplied (ϱ-ϱₐ)/ϱₐ is called 
the reduced gravity. Written differently,

112
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:55,309
this equation here states that the
Froude number at the front level is equal

113
00:10:55,309 --> 00:11:01,279
to a constant, and that this constant is equal to
√2. Hence we must note that this application

114
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,209
of Bernoulli's principle was subjected to
controversy. It is due to to von Kármán 

115
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:12,540
in 1940, at the time it was essentially
to know if the use of battle gases

116
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,689
by the Germans could thus bring 
gases that were moving, finally gas

117
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:23,240
motions that could move at great velocity.
So the calculation estimates the velocity

118
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,559
of displacement of these battle gases. 30 years
later, the calculation has shown

119
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,829
that in fact the conditions that are given
by this interface theorem are inaccurate

120
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:37,720
and we must apply the momentum
conservation on control

121
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,149
volumes, of which the exact calculation is much
more complete, but finally we obtain the

122
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:48,059
the same results, among other things so, what
we had with a surrounding fluid that

123
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:53,179
is infinitely large, the Froude number
at the front level is constant and equal to √2.

124
00:11:53,179 --> 00:12:00,179
The third application concerns the Pitot
tube. So the Pitot tube is a measuring

125
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:05,579
device used relatively
frequently when we want to measure for example

126
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:11,059
the velocity in a water flow. It is 
also used in the airplanes to measure

127
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:18,059
the displacement velocity of a plane. So
the Pitot tube is composed of a tube

128
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:24,199
that we place in parallel of the velocity
field. So here we must imagine that we have

129
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,869
initially velocities that are propagating
in this direction here, so we place the

130
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:36,869
tube, or the tube's axis, parallel to the velocity
field. The tube is provided here with a small

131
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:43,779
hole, which leads to a cylinder, that 
leads to the apparatus that is used to measure

132
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:50,779
the total pressure. We have a second small pipe
that is placed laterally, so here the

133
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:58,170
point C, that measures the static
pressure, as we are assuming that the velocity

134
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,350
goes through like this, and so that there are no
fluids entering, so we do not have velocity

135
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:08,860
components here, through the point C. We consider 
a streamline between A and B. As we

136
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:15,860
are at the same height, we will have a gravity
potential that is identical. Moreover,

137
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,629
as once the fluid has penetrated
here in this space here, we will not be able

138
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:26,160
to have a fluid, the fluid being incompressible,
so the point B will be what we call a

139
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,959
stagnation point. The fluid's velocity will be
zero at point B. So if we apply now

140
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,100
Bernoulli's principle between the point
A and the point B, we will have in A the pressure

141
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,449
+ the kinetic energy + the gravity potential,
that must be equal to the pressure at point

142
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:49,449
B + velocity at point B + gravity potential
which is strictly equal to the gravity potential

143
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:57,540
at point A. So when we equalize the two
terms that are here, what we have is 

144
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:04,540
that the velocity at point A, that we also call 
v∞ is equal to (2/ϱ)*(pʙ-p𝐴). Thus

145
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,189
furthermore if we assume that the diameter
of the Pitot tube is identical, as at point

146
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:22,290
C there are no fluids penetrating, the
velocity staying in this direction here,

147
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,939
if we also place a tube connected to a
pressure measure, what we will measure

148
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:32,129
here will be a static pressure. If the height
difference between C and A is relatively small,

149
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:36,239
so if the tube is relatively slender, 
the pressure that we will measure in C will be strictly

150
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:43,239
equal to the static pressure at point A,
so we have P𝐴 =Pc. So by measuring in parallel

151
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:48,499
here the static pressure, by doing the pressure
difference between the two, we can calculate

152
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:53,749
the displacement velocity of the fluid
with respect to the Pitot tube. We will

153
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:58,779
now see another application that
does transitions between this

154
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:03,949
part of the course, with these three examples relatively
simple, and the part dedicated to hydraulics

155
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:10,869
with free surface. What we will study here
is the water flow, so for example

156
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:16,429
in a river or in a channel, above
an obstacle of small dimension. I place myself

157
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:21,879
as previously in the case of a steady
state. So the water is flowing is this direction

158
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:28,879
here, we have here at the upstream a height h₀, and
we have a certain average velocity that I call

159
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:36,230
u₀. The size of the obstacle is denoted 
z𝗆, and I also provide my sketch  

160
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:43,009
here, I provide this sketch with a frame Oz,
by placing my frame of reference at point

161
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:49,989
O that is here. What is essentially interesting me
is to characterize what is going on here,

162
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:56,989
so the height as a function of position,
knowing what is going on upstream, so

163
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,199
i.e. by knowing the velocity u₀
and the height h₀, so i.e. by

164
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:10,529
knowing the Froude number that is situated
here at the upstream that I call F₀. So we

165
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:15,139
will proceed a little differently this time
, we will write Bernoulli's principle

166
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,649
under a differential form. Along a
streamline we know that we must have

167
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:26,649
conservation of the quantity kinetic energy 
+ pressure + gravity potential. I have here

168
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:33,199
divided all the terms by ϱg, so if I
differentiate this with respect to x, I must

169
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,920
have 0. Moreover I assume that I have
conservation of the flow rate, the flow rate per unit

170
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,929
width is equal to hu, this flow rate also is
constant in steady state, so if I

171
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:49,549
differentiate hu I must have 0, which means
that in every slice here I must have

172
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:55,559
the velocity multiplied by the height tat 
is equal to the flow rate per unit width

173
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:02,079
at the upstream, i.e. u₀h₀. So
by using Bernoulli's principle,

174
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,439
so we can say that at any point we
must have kinetic energy + pressure

175
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,309
+ gravity potential which is equal to
what is happening at the upstream. After a few

176
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:19,459
mathematical manipulations, what we
can show by differentiating the term,

177
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:25,689
is that we thus have this equation here,
that links the depth variation

178
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:30,960
of water or the height of water, as a function
of the variation of the bottom bed z. And

179
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,309
so the term that is here weighted by a
term, and we see appearing here (u²/gh)

180
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:41,399
which nothing else but the Froude number
squared. So this equation I

181
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:46,429
can re-write it and I try to draw
some consequences. First of all what we

182
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:53,080
note is that if I am approaching the ridge
of the obstacle, at the level of the ridge we admit

183
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,510
that we have a horizontal tangent, so this
term here is equal to 0. So in this case

184
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,750
here it means that we either dh/dx that is
equal to 0, so in this case here we must

185
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,539
also have a horizontal tangent 
for the free surface, or else we have this term

186
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:12,289
here which is equal to 0, so i.e.
that the Froude number square must be

187
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:16,889
equal to 1, so the Froude number must
be equal to 1. We also note that every

188
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:23,460
time we will have here the Froude number
equal to 1, even if dh/dx is positive

189
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,889
or negative, we will have dz/dx that is zero, so
every time that the Froude number is equal

190
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:33,519
to 1, we must have a topography that admits
a horizontal tangent. What we can

191
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:39,130
also show though this equation
is that if initially, at the upstram, the flow

192
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,769
is subcritical, so if the Froude number
is lower than 1, it will remain all

193
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:50,600
along subcritical. We cannot have passage
of a flow here, with this case relatively 

194
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,250
simple, passage of a subcritical flow
to a supercritical flow. Conversely

195
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,700
if at the upstream the flow is supercritical,
so with a Froude number greater

196
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,850
than 1, it will remain all along supercritical.
So we see that there is a condition on

197
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:11,429
the height of the obstacle for this later
statement to be true, we show that

198
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:14,850
this maximum height is associated with a
Froude number equal to 1 at the level

199
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,690
of the obstacle, and that gives us in 
this case here the expression of the maximum height

200
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,659
as a function of the Froude number. In the case
where the height of the obstacle is greater

201
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:28,289
than this maximum height, we will have solutions
that are much more complicated, we

202
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,690
will have among other things no continuous solutions,
we will have a continuous variation of the height

203
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:38,570
and a discontinuous solution, we will see during
the final module, that this discontinuous solution

204
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,100
is called a hydraulic jump. There,
at the end of this second module we have seen

205
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,840
some relatively basic applications
of Bernoulli's principle, and we have

206
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,090
seen an example already a little more complex
as a warm-up before tackling the

207
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,380
part dedicated to hydraulics with free
surfaces.
