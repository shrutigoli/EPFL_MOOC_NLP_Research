1
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:19,164
Here is the experiment that defies intuition.

2
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:20,994
The ball seems suspended in the air.

3
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:24,431
We will see in this course that
it is explained by the asymmetry 

4
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:26,177
of the flow around the ball.

5
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:28,039
It is an example amongst others

6
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:30,302
that will be used to introduce
the key-concepts 

7
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:31,975
of fluid mechanics.

8
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:34,863
Hello, my name is Christophe Ancey,

9
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:37,983
I am professor of mechanics
at the EPFL where I also conduct

10
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:40,322
research on the dynamics
of flows.

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,650
I am more precisely interested in
the dynamics of flows

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,296
with free surface on strong slops.

13
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:48,584
I try to understand the physical
processes involved in

14
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:50,691
the flows of particles
in a flux.

15
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:53,693
Hello, my name is FranÃ§ois Gallaire
and I am professor of

16
00:00:53,693 --> 00:00:56,973
fluid mechanics at the EPFL where
I do research on the on the

17
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,337
fundamental mechanism
that govern flows. 

18
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:01,967
I study more precisely
the formation and the dynamics 

19
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,502
of vortex and their influence
on the aerodynamics

20
00:01:04,502 --> 00:01:06,282
of cars and planes.

21
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:09,019
Another important component 
of my research concerns

22
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,640
the deformation of small
micro-metric objects,

23
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:13,395
- droplet, vesicles or cells -

24
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:16,539
during their transport in the channels
natural or artificial. 

25
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,272
Hello, my name is Marco Ramaioli.

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,102
I am lecturer at the EPFL

27
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:23,166
and researcher at the Center
of research NestlÃ©.

28
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,592
My research interest are
flows  dominated

29
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:27,312
by interfaces and divided media. 

30
00:01:27,312 --> 00:01:29,983
I will help you understand
the key-concepts of this course

31
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:33,447
thanks to videos. We will present you
both laboratory experiments

32
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:35,515
and phenomena of the every
day life.

33
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:38,038
During the first chapter,
we will approach

34
00:01:38,038 --> 00:01:39,648
the physical properties of
fluids.

35
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:42,008
What is a liquid ?
What is a gas ? 

36
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,986
How their behavior at the molecular
scale helps to understand

37
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,842
the macroscopic properties
such as viscosity ?

38
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:50,543
The second chapter will deal
with phenomena of surface

39
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,958
tension and capillarity,
which explains, for example,

40
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:56,817
why a soap bubble remains spherical
or a rain drop does not measure

41
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:59,169
1 micron or 1 meter,
but a few millimeters.

42
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:03,232
During chapter 3, we will
approach the notion of similarity.

43
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:06,974
Many flows in laboratory
or in the nature are alike.

44
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:10,456
It is naturally what is used
by the equations of mechanics

45
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:13,055
that are valid to describe
not only flows

46
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:15,878
in ducts of small dimension
such as blood in veins,

47
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:18,525
but also to describe 
flows of very large dimension

48
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,510
such as atmospheric circulation. 

49
00:02:21,027 --> 00:02:23,372
In the chapter 4,
we will approach the problem

50
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:26,041
of fluids at rest, in other words
the static of fluids.

51
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:28,675
We will demonstrate Pascal's law
which is the foundation

52
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:29,993
of fluid mechanics.

53
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:32,903
This simple equations allows
to calculate pressure forces

54
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:34,584
on structures such as dams

55
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:37,342
or buoyancy forces
for boats.

56
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:40,272
In chapter 5, we will introduce
the mathematical tools

57
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:43,342
to follow a particle 
along its trajectory.

58
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:48,094
In the next chapter, we will learn to
make mass and force balances

59
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:50,378
in order to predict the flows.

60
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:54,298
We will see that the pressure can be used
either to accelerate a flow,

61
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,003
or to overcome the friction.

62
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:59,178
In the chapter 7, we will see
a application particularly

63
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:02,291
important of the principle of conservation
of momentum.

64
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,058
It is Bernoulli's principle.

65
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:06,678
The students like it,
because unlike the rest

66
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:10,223
of mechanics, they are simple
equations without diffenretial operators.

67
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:13,363
This theorem allows to solve
practical and various problems

68
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:17,038
such as jets, propulsion
or hydraulics with free surface.

69
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:20,399
Every week, besides the videos of the course
showing precise points,

70
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,955
we will propose some quizzes to test
your intuition and your knowledge.

71
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:27,164
Through these exercises, you can 
confront yourselves to the key-concepts.

72
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:29,470
Whether you are interested
in environment, biology,

73
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:31,494
transports or
industrial processes, 

74
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:33,356
this course will give you
the essential bases

75
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,658
to understand the world around you.
