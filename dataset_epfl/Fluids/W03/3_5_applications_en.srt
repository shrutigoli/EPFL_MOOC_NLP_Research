1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,530
During previous module, we have
seen the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem that

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:15,280
showed us that if we have a physical
problem with n variables that describe it

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,140
we can simply this problem by introducing
dimensionless number that are combinations

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:27,679
of the initial variables, the initial physical 
variables. In general if I have n physical

5
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:34,679
variables, I can simply to n - 3 dimensionless
parameters that describe my system.

6
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,670
We can considerably reduced the degree
of freedom of the system. We will now see

7
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:50,570
practical applications of the Vaschy.
Buckingham theorem through various examples,

8
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,449
the first example will be the study of the water
flow in a river that we will see again later

9
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:02,339
on as an application of Bernoulli's
principle, we will then see a few applications

10
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:09,339
to engineering. I am interested in a river
which flows on a slop θ and what I

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,770
am looking to calculate is the velocity of the water,
the mean velocity of the water knowing 

12
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:23,920
the height of water. As the driving force of
the water flow is gravity,  more

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,649
precisely what we will be able to show later
on is that it will be gravity multiplied

14
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:33,689
by the sinus of the angle. What I am looking 
to calculate is what is the shape, what

15
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,509
is the structure of the equation, how is 
linked u in terms of h, g and θ in this

16
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:45,210
problem of flow in a uniform and steady
state. If I apply my Vaschy-Buckingham

17
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,289
theorem, what I see is that
I have a variable here which is dimensionless,

18
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:55,689
so this one here I will not take it into account and
so three physical dimensional variables,

19
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:00,929
velocity, depth, gravity. There are two
physical units, meters and seconds

20
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:07,929
that appear in these problem variables.
In practice I have 3 dimensional physical variables,

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,360
I have 2 fundamental units, I can thus
altogether form one dimensionless group. We

22
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,110
could apply in details the Vaschy-
Buckingham theorem, here it is clear

23
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:25,110
that the dimensionless number is the Froude
number, so, as I have said in the introduction,

24
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,790
as the driving force of the water will be
g.sinus(θ), I am writing a little differently 

25
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,230
the Froude number by introducing here sinus(θ)
in the denominator. My problem is a

26
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,180
problem that will be characterized by only one
dimensionless group which is the Froude

27
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,180
number so for a given experiment the
Froude number is equal to a constant.

28
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,930
If the Froude number is equal to a constant
it means that I must have the velocity

29
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,670
that has to vary as sqaure root(g.h.sin(θ)),
this results here in fact is known experimentally,

30
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,780
it is what we call the Chézy law, so
it is a result known since the 18th

31
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,550
century. Now we can study the problem
in a more complete way by looking at

32
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,980
or by asking ourselves the question of the effect of
the grain size of the bed. Indeed, a river

33
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:21,180
can be composed of gravel, it can be
composed of sand or pebbles, elements

34
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,890
with extremely different sizes. How
must we do to take into account the roughness of

35
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:34,420
the river bed? The idea is to introduce a scale
of roughness ks which is the mean size

36
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,620
of the grains that compose the bed. If I had to
redo my dimensional analysis, I now have

37
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:45,390
4 variables that define my problem
but I still have only 2 physical units,

38
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,280
the meter and the second. The Vaschy-
Buckingham theorem states that I will have

39
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,520
two dimensionless numbers that characterize 
my problem and these two dimensionless numbers

40
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,390
are always the Froude number and, if I introduce
this parameter here, the easiest way

41
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,810
to get a dimensionless number is to
divide it by another quantity of the problem

42
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,350
which is the water height. The second dimensionless
number, is what we will call

43
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,110
the relative submersion, so the ratio between
the roughness and the water height. There exists

44
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,180
an explicit relation between these two
functions, the similarity theory

45
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,499
states that there exists simply a relation
between Pi1 and Pi2, however I do not know

46
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:30,310
the exact value of the parameter f. If 
reason asymptotically  as I have

47
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:36,729
done it with the drag coefficient and if
I write this equation in a dimensionless form,

48
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,159
if I re-write it in a dimensional form,
I am expecting, when the water height

49
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:47,870
will become extremely important to have
the ratio ks / h to tend to 0. An idea,

50
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,830
would be to say that if it tends 
to 0, f of something that tends to 0 tends

51
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,379
a constant, but I hold this reasoning
here, I see that I have a constant and

52
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:02,189
that I end up with a 
relation that is exactly the Chézy law

53
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:07,919
that we have seen previously. If I do
this, unfortunately, I am not able to take

54
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,830
into account the effect of the grain size. This
reasoning is what we call a

55
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:19,449
complete similarity and here it does enable
to end up with a result that is very eloquent

56
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,120
from a physical point of view. Another
way to do will be to introduce

57
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,379
what we call an incomplete similarity.
This means that we will suppose that when

58
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:33,409
the ratio ks / h that I now call
ζ, that when h becomes big, this ratio

59
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:40,409
ζ tends to 0, that the function f of ζ when
ζ tends to 0 does not tend to a constant

60
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,770
but tends towards something that is written
here under a asymptotic form, as being

61
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,770
ζ to the power n with here a coefficient
of proportionality. If I do this and that

62
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:59,419
I inject this result here in my law of
similarity found previously, I obtain 

63
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,529
this result here. The theory of similarity
does not allow to determine the coefficient

64
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,300
n, it is the reason why we speak of
incomplete similarity as in fact here

65
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,550
now in the structure of my law the
coefficient n is not determined entirely

66
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,569
by the similarity theory, n must be
determine with other considerations,

67
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:22,150
they can be theoretical or experimental.
Experimentally, if we do experiments,

68
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:29,150
we find that n is more or less equal to -1/6, if
we do this, we will thus obtain a law which

69
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:35,379
is what we call here the experimental law
of Manning-Strickler that we will see again as an application

70
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:42,039
of Bernoulli's principle at the end of this course.
The coefficient that appears here will be the coefficient

71
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,139
of Strickler or Manning-Strickler which will be
in this case here defined as a function of

72
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:53,400
the roughness at the power -1/6. Now
we will approach to conclude this chapter

73
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,979
on some application examples in engineering,
we have seen at the beginning an example that

74
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:04,449
helped in understanding the problems that
were encountered in engineering when we had to

75
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:10,749
do a model that represented what
was happening for example here in the case of a

76
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:15,509
river that is overflowing and when we try
to calculate the zones that are reached by 

77
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,870
the overflows, the house or also
the impact forces on the buildings. To

78
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,099
go from a reduced model to the natural scale
or from the natural scale to know how

79
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:29,249
we do to define the reduced model,
we need dimensionless numbers or more

80
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:34,169
precisely what we call similarity
criteria. We will say that what is happening

81
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,150
at the natural scale, at the scale 1 and
what is happening at the reduced scale, these

82
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:45,229
two phenomena are in complete similarity
if the parameters of similarity are exactly

83
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:51,279
equal between the two experiments. For example
if the Froude number here describes what

84
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,849
is happening, the Froude number must take
the same value at the scale 1 and in the

85
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:02,800
channel. Unfortunately in practice, when we
do a reduced model, it is rarely possible

86
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,289
to respect all the similarity criteria
that define the problem and in general

87
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:14,240
in mechanics we will have many dimensionless
numbers that will characterize a problem.

88
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,879
One of the difficulties is that we will have to
make choices and that these choices depend

89
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,219
on the nature of the considered problem,
very often, the Reynolds number is a

90
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:30,599
parameter extremely important in fluid
mechanics. In certain cases it will play

91
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,110
an very big role in the similarity and
in certain cases it will be a parameter that

92
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:40,169
will be negligible, or in any case of a minor
importance. For example, we have seen with the

93
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,800
calculation of the drag coefficient, we have
seen that the drag coefficient, when

94
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,290
the Reynolds number became very very
big tended towards a constant that was

95
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:54,290
between 0,4 and 0,5, and so here, if
I take a Reynolds number of 10^4 or

96
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:59,880
10^6 it is not very important. What
makes that in this type of experiment, if

97
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,699
I want to work in aerodynamics, if at
the natural scale I was at 10^8 and that at

98
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:10,899
the experimental scale I was at 10^5.
from the similarity point of view, even though

99
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,120
the exact value of the Reynolds number is 
not identified, the drag coefficient 

100
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,110
will be asymptotically the same and so we
will still have a similarity that will be correct.

101
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,529
In this case, the exact value of the Reynolds
number has a minor importance. However,

102
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:31,170
still taking the example that we have seen
previously of the drag force, we

103
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,029
have seen that when the Reynolds number
was very small, for example when we

104
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,290
are studying the sedimentation of a particle
in a liquid, we have seen that this drag

105
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,220
coefficient was inversely proportional
to the Reynolds number. Here, if you change

106
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,690
slightly the Reynolds number, you will have
velocities totally different. In sedimentology,  

107
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,540
it is important to have a Reynolds number
exactly identical between the natural model

108
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:03,380
and the reduced model. Once we have noticed
these difficulties, we must find solutions

109
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:10,380
to address them. Sometimes we succeed and sometimes
we don't. Amongst the solutions that work

110
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,649
more or less, we have what we call the geometrical
distortion, which means that we will have

111
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,690
geometrical scales, for example
for the study of a river we will have 

112
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:27,019
height scales or scales of length
or width which will be different such

113
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:31,970
that we can verify the similarity
on the Froude number and on the Reynolds

114
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:38,060
number, in this case we will speak of geometrical
distortion. Sometimes also we can

115
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,779
verify only a part of the similarity criteria,
so we will talk of incomplete similarity,

116
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:49,779
it is the most often case in the rivers
where we can hardly verify the similarity 

117
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:58,019
on the Reynolds number and we will in general
focus on the Froude number. The problem

118
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,279
is in this case here, it is when we
will work at the scale relatively reduced

119
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,699
we can also introduce a certain number
of phenomena, so if for example we study

120
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:11,699
a river at the scale 1 / 100 so on
a really small channel, we will have effects

121
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:16,319
of surface tension that can appear
on the reduced model and that do not exist

122
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:23,000
on, or that have very little effect on the natural
scale. This is an additional difficulty 

123
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,290
of studies done at the reduced scale
in laboratory. In hydraulics, the classical

124
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:34,829
example is hydraulics with free surface
where we will simulate in laboratory the flow

125
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:39,490
of a river. This similarity in general
is based essentially on the Froude

126
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,430
number and we will say that the reduced model is
in partial or incomplete similarity with

127
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,690
the real model if the Froude number between
two scales is strictly identical.

128
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,000
We will write that the Froude number (here
raised to the square) between the scale 1 and the scale

129
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,269
2 is strictly identical. It will also require
that the Reynolds number is identical between

130
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:04,940
the two scales. In general when we
will solve these equations here and knowing

131
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,459
the geometrical scale of reduction between
the model and the natural phenomenon, we will

132
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:15,600
be able to determine the fluid or the
quantities that make the model.

133
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,600
To conclude on this chapter relatively
important, also relatively dense even

134
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,709
though it uses notions extremely
basic on physical units, you must

135
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:33,490
remember many things, the first thing
is that the similarity theory is

136
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,519
essentially based on notions of homogeneity 
of the equations and it is an exercice always

137
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:45,519
healthy to check that the equations 
that we manipulate are homogeneous.  The other result

138
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:51,050
extremely important of this similarity
theory is that it helps to turn

139
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:57,449
into a dimensionless form the equations
and to simplify them by introducing dimensionless

140
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:01,829
numbers such as the Reynolds number
or the Froude number. The simplification

141
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:07,730
of the equations will be thus dealt through
different examples in the other parts

142
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:13,339
of the course but it remains a point extremely
important in fluid mechanics

143
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,339
as most of the time the equations
are so complicated that we can

144
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,350
solve only a part of the equations so
the dimensional analysis is really the key

145
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:28,690
tool to do this simplification. Finally,
we have seen it through the example of the pendulum,

146
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,850
we have it through the example of the river
flow, we can find

147
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:39,850
the structure of the equation without solving
any base equation, simply by looking

148
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,589
at the dimensions of the variables defining
the problem we can often find

149
