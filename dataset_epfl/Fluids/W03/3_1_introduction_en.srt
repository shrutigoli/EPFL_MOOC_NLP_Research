00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,990
Welcome to chapter nÂ°3 dedicated to the
theory of similarity. During last

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,110
weeks we have approached the physical
properties of fluids, essentially the

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,520
notion of viscosity and surface tension.
During this chapter, we will approach

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,520
a new aspect known as the theory
of similarity. The notion of similarity 

5
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,769
covers a certain number of aspects that are
both relative to physical units

6
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:37,430
of the flow variables but also
to notions that will be undoubtedly new 

7
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,080
to you, the notion of dimensionless number
to characterize a flow.

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,640
We will see these notion here, through two
methods, the first one called Rayleigh's

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,350
method, and a second method, much
more mathematical called the theorem

10
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,589
of Vaschy-Buckingham or also called
Pi theorem. We will then see what is

11
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:05,449
the use of these results or more exactly
we will see how we use these numbers

12
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,460
dimensionless or similarity criteria in
engineering application then I will give

13
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,719
an example essentially linked to hydraulics.
Before starting, it will be important 

14
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:22,439
to clarify to what use is the theory of
similarity, by specifying the problematic

15
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,659
that is behind. First of all, as
usual, we begin with a small

16
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:34,500
warm-up quiz. First question,
we suppose that we do a model of a natural

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:43,000
flow and that on this model, we measure
the velocity of the flow and the question that

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,380
arises, is to know what is the velocity equal to
at the scale 1 knowing that we are capable

19
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,859
of measuring the velocity on the reduced model
and that the scale ratio between the reduced

20
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:57,850
model and the reality is the factor 1:10.
First possibility is, I suppose, 

21
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,210
as the geometrical ratio is equal to 10,
that I have a factor 10 between the velocity at

22
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,939
the scale 1 and the velocity measured on the
reduced model. Second possible answer,

23
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:11,440
I cannot answer this answer
as I would need to know much 

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,440
more on the dynamics of the flow. Second
question, much easier, and which is

25
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:26,069
relative relative to the notion of fundamental units.
To measure the pressure, we use Pascal,

26
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:33,420
basic question, if I must express the Pascal
in the international system of measure, 

27
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:40,420
so kg, meters, seconds. What is a Pascal equal to?
First possibility, a Pascal is

28
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:53,000
1 kg/(m.s). Second possibility, a Pascal
is 1 kg.m/s, I let you think

29
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,590
at these two questions and we will see at the end
of this chapter the answer to these two question.
