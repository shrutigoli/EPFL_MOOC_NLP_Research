1
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,719
After this small warm-up quiz, we
will enter in the heart of the subject and we

2
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:14,090
will see more precisely what it
is when talking about similarity.

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:21,090
To try to explain this notion of similarity,
I have chosen to illustrate this notion through

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,090
a few examples relatively simple. First
of all, we must describe what is

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,320
the theory of similarity. It is a theory
that is extremely useful to propose

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,710
dimensionless numbers, we will see a couple
of them : the Reynolds number, the Froude

7
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:42,059
number, these are numbers with no dimensions
that are used to characterize a flow,

8
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,800
the theory of similarity is also used 
to simplify the equations, unfortunately,

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,370
fluid mechanics are known to
be particularly rotor and give

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,449
equations to solve that are relatively
complex.  The theory of similarity 

11
00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:01,260
will simplify these equations.
This same theory is also used to reduce

12
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,820
the complexity of a problem, for example
when experimentally we are looking to study

13
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,810
a phenomenon, we have a large number of parameters
that reflect, or that are useful to describe

14
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,230
the phenomenon, we will see, with the theory
of similarity, that we can reduce by

15
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:23,240
an adequate combination, the number of useful
parameters. Finally, the theory of similarity

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,830
establishes criteria of similarity
between different scales, for example

17
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,490
the experimental scale, on a reduced
model and the life-size scale,

18
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,990
the scale 1. It is something that is
extremely useful, also in engineering. 

19
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,060
To understand what is going on, two examples,
the first one, I will detail it again

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,840
afterwards. We have here a impulsion wave that
is created by the entering of a granular

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,100
flow, here a rock flow, the
wave is here a couple of meters

22
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,840
high. We easily understand that it is
extremely difficult to create such 

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,130
waves in the natural environment, however,
at the scale of the laboratory it is relatively 

24
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,019
simple to do, we will see an example afterwards,
by creating a granular avalanche on a

25
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:17,359
inclined plane. This avalanche penetrates in
a small lake, and will create a wave. The

26
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:22,879
question that arises will be to know how 
we do to go from this experiment idealized 

27
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,019
in laboratory to the real case ? In engineering,
we have similar problems, we have for example

28
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:33,859
here what we call a torrential lava,
a torrential flood mobilizing important

29
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:39,469
volumes of mud, at Fully near Martigny
in the Valais. We see here the torrent, we

30
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:46,109
see here the mud effusions, and to
study the protections against these torrential

31
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:51,379
floods, a way to do is to
proceed in laboratory on models,

32
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:56,599
on reduced models. Here, the houses 
are simplified by bricks and we

33
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:02,859
will use as a substitute of mud, a
laboratory mud. We will then study in

34
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:09,439
laboratory, at the reduced scale, the way
in which the flow is produced, where the mud

35
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:16,200
will overflow ? Which houses will be impacted
? I go back to my example of the impulsion wave.

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Here, we have a granular avalanche where the
grains are animated at a certain velocity

37
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:29,459
u. These grains have a certain momentum
at the entrance in the lake. We suppose

38
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,319
initially that the water is at rest. We will
have a transfer of momentum 

39
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:42,319
between the grains and the water at rest. This transfer
of momentum, as well as the flux

40
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,200
of mass will create a wave that will be animated
at a certain velocity v and which will have a certain

41
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,239
height that I have called here η. We can see
here through the film what is happening, it is

42
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,590
a filmed experiment with a camera at
very high speed, here we are in slow-motion 

43
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:06,590
and we see the particles entering the lake,
and starting to create a wave. The problem

44
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,919
that arises is to know if experimentally,
in laboratory I am capable of measuring

45
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:21,390
this velocity, this height, how 
do I do to go from this representation 

46
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,530
in laboratory to the quantities that characterize
the phenomenon at the natural scale so

47
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:32,440
velocity of the impulsion wave and height.
To understand this notion of similarity,

48
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,380
we will begin with things relatively
simple that we see in geometry. The first

49
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:44,040
notion is the notion of isomorphic transformation,
for example, here I have a big triangle and

50
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:51,040
this big triangle is similar to the small triangle,
we will say that the big triangle, here, is similar

51
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:59,890
geometrically if we have conservation of
lengths, so if the ratio between a' and

52
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:07,390
a, the ratio between b' and b, c' and c, all
these ratios are equal and identical and 

53
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:14,390
are equal to λ, λ will be what we call the
ratio of similarity or scaling factor

54
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,760
or also simply scale. In this
case here, when we have a transformation where

55
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,400
the lengths are transformed, where we have
a ratio of length that will be identical 

56
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,370
whatever the axis, the x axis or the y axis, we
will speak of isomorphic transformation. We

57
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,660
can generalize this isomorphic transformation
by introducing an linear transformation. 

58
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,660
For example, if I initially go from a
circle that will have a radius a, that will be equal

59
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,840
here to b and I stretch my circle differently 
along the x axis or along the y axis, I will obtain

60
00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:00,150
at the end an ellipse. The ratio of length
between the semi major-axis a' over the radius will be equal

61
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:08,310
to λx and the ratio between the semi minor-axis
here b' over the initial radius b will be 

62
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,560
noted λy, in general for a linear
transformation λx and λy will take different values.

63
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,000
This notion of linear transformation is
extremely interesting as it allows us 

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to introduce the notion of invariant. For example,
if I consider the area of my circle

65
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:35,720
and that I look at the area of the ellipse,
I see that if I introduce the ratio s which

66
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,720
is the ratio between the area and the product
of the semi major axis and of the semi minor axis, in

67
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,240
the case of the circle it will simply be
the radius square. This ratio between the area

68
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:55,840
and the product of semi-axis, this ratio is 
conserved and equal to Pi, in this case here, we will say

69
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,840
that this scalar quantity s is an invariant
by linear transformation. However, if

70
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,580
now I am interested to the perimeter
of the ellipse and if I try to link the perimeter 

71
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,710
of the ellipse compared to the perimeter of
the circle, I cannot show that there exists

72
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,340
for example a ratio that will be constant,
simply, if we look at the definition

73
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,780
of the perimeter of the ellipse, we see that there
exists two parameters and that these two parameters

74
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,100
will be stretched with different values,
so we will have something that will be much

75
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,280
more complicated at the end. The under-lying question
is to know why certain quantities 

76
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,050
are conserved and others are not ? And how
do we do to know which quantities

77
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,990
are conserved and which quantities are
not conserved ? To answer this question,

78
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,600
we introduce what we call a scaling law,
which is a relation of proportionality

79
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,970
between an object or variable which describes
the object and the scale, here it would be a

80
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,600
geometrical scale as we are in geometry.
In fluid mechanics after, we will introduce

81
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,620
the scales of velocity, the scale of
time... For example I take an object of

82
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,740
an arbitrary shape and I introduce a characteristic
scale, here it will be l, it could

83
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,440
very well be an arbitrary dimension,
l is only to give the order of magnitude

84
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,120
of the object's dimension. The perimeter,
for example. will be proportional to this characteristic

85
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,010
length, also, dimensionally, 
the area will be something that will be proportional

86
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,980
to this characteristic quantity raised 
to the power 2. If the object was an object

87
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:38,980
that occupies a volume, the volume of this object
here will be l^3. We see that in the case of

88
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:49,250
the ellipse, the transformation of a circle to
an ellipse is done along two directions,

89
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:57,380
the x axis and the y axis, whereby the definition
of the perimeter p' will inevitably involve

90
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:07,340
these two length ratios. The quantity
p' which is the perimeter of the ellipse linked

91
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,450
to the perimeter of the circle is a quantity
relatively complex that will be a function

92
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,080
of these two aspect ratios, the aspect
ratio along x and the aspect ratio along

93
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,460
y. The theory of similarity will be
a theory that will be extremely useful to

94
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,130
specify the number of parameters needed
to describe what is happening when we do

95
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:36,130
a transformation but sometimes also
give the structure, what is f equal to as a function

96
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:42,490
of different parameters. Before entering
more in the theory of similarity, 

97
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:49,490
we must come back on a few fundamental notions
and especially on the notion of measure. All

98
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,900
measures can be expressed as a function of 7 fundamental
units, here I am in the metric

99
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,610
system that is employed in most
countries except the United States and the United Kingdom.

100
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:08,610
In mechanics essentially, we will use
3 fundamental units so relative

101
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,130
to length, mass and time. These
fundamental units are the meter, the

102
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,440
kilogram and the second. In physics we will
also need, for the electrical intensity

103
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,600
the ampere, the kelvin for temperature,
the candela  for the luminous intensity and

104
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,430
the mole for the matter quantity.
Every measure is associated to a symbol

105
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:37,430
of which the typography is fixed, for example,
the Newton, that is written here without capital letter

106
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:47,010
but its symbol has a capital letter and we can
define the Newton with the fundamental

107
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:55,110
units expressed here in kg/m/s so
1 newton is equal to 1 kg.m/s^2, the pressure

108
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:06,230
will be expressed in pascal, still without capital letter,
the symbol will be Pa and in the international system

109
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:17,660
1 pascal is equal to 1 kg.m^-1.s^-2, we can reproduce
this for different measures that we will use

110
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,690
during the course of fluid mechanics, for
the velocity, the density, the acceleration,

111
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:32,150
the area, the energy flux or the
power. The question that often arises

112
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,600
for tor student is to know how do
I do when I am working for example

113
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,600
with watts or joules to find 
the fundamental units ? A small mnemotechnic 

114
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:50,460
device relatively simple is to
remember the definition of the unit

115
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:57,460
to be able to find the fundamental units.
For example, the work will be expressed

116
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:05,300
in joules and so the work will be a force
multiplied by a length. A force is

117
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,540
in Newtons, multiplied here by a length,
by meters.We have seen it previously

118
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:17,540
but we could find it, a Newton is
kg.m/s^2 so when I do the product

119
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,120
of the fundamental units, I find that a
joule is equal to 1 kg.m^2/s^2. So, we will introduce

120
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,330
now the notion of dimensionless number,
a dimensionless number is a number without

121
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:40,610
dimension. We will see three particularly 
important, the first one is the Reynolds

122
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:47,610
number that is defined as the ratio
between the density ρ, a characteristic velocity

123
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,380
of the flow, a characteristic length
and divided by the dynamic viscosity of

124
00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:00,130
the fluid. This Reynolds number is relatively
important, especially because it is used to characterize 

125
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,290
the flow, especially to know if the flow
is laminar, we will be at that point at

126
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,510
small Reynolds number or if the flow 
is turbulent, at that point we will be at

127
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,980
very high Reynolds number. These will
be notion that we will see in chapter 6.

128
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:21,160
Note that we also introduce the kinematic
viscosity that is defined as being

129
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,750
the ratio between the dynamic viscosity μ
and the density ρf of the fluid. In

130
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:34,750
this case here, the definition of the Reynolds number
is the following, it is equal to the scale

131
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:41,839
of velocity multiplied by the characteristic scale
of length, divided by the kinematic viscosity.

132
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,839
The Stokes number is defined as the ratio
between the relaxation time of a particle

133
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,610
in a fluid, for example a particle
that would be in sedimentation and the 

134
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:00,360
characteristic time of the fluid, so it is
the time that will characterize the way which

135
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:07,350
the fluid will adjust to the displacement of
the particle. To compute these characteristic times,

136
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:13,520
relaxation times, we will need to solve
more into detail the equations, which we

137
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,399
will not do here. Similarly, if we did it,
we would manage to find the expressions and

138
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,660
to find that  if we work at small Stokes
number, the solid phase will be entirely

139
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,850
governed by the fluid phase. We will say that
the solid phase is slave to the fluid

140
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,260
phase. However, when we are at very
large Stokes number, the two phases are

141
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,620
entirely uncoupled. The Stokes number
intervenes in a very large number of problems

142
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:45,620
of sedimentation or fluid/particles mixtures.
The Froude number is used a lot in hydraulics,

143
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:52,940
we define it as being the ration between
a velocity and the square root of g, g being the

144
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,370
acceleration constant and h being a 
characteristic height of the flow.

145
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:05,370
In hydraulics, the Froude number is essentially
interpreted as a ratio of a characteristic velocity

146
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,339
of the flow compared to a characteristic
velocity of waves, or also

147
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:16,459
as a kinetic energy over a potential
energy. It will allow us to define two

148
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:21,380
types of flow, flows when we 
are at Froude number > 1 that we will call

149
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,270
super-critical. The case where Froude = 1 will be
the critical flow. The flows super

150
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,630
critical are also called torrential
flows. When we are smaller than 1, 

151
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,930
the flow will be sub-critical, we will speak of
fluvial flows. Finally, to

152
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,080
do the link with the previous chapter,
the capillarity number that is defined

153
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:48,080
as following : μ is the dynamic
viscosity, u the velocity and γ the surface

154
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,310
tension. When the capillarity number
is very small compared to 1, the effects of surface

155
00:15:54,310 --> 00:16:00,450
tension are very important compared to the
viscous stresses and we cannot at

156
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,940
all neglect these effects of surface tension.
However, when this capillarity number

157
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,269
is very large compared to 1, we can neglect
the effects of surface tension. There exists

158
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:16,570
many other dimensionless number, the 
Bond, Weber or Kapitza number that

159
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,250
are also used and that are in fact
numbers relatively similar with

160
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,269
expressions slightly different from the capillarity
number. All dimensionless number

161
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:30,529
has a physical interpretation, in general 
we can interpret it as the ratio of

162
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:35,080
a length or a ratio of forces or
a ratio of time. For example if I take

163
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,760
the example of the Reynolds number, we have defined
as following, if I multiply on

164
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,120
top and on the bottom by u and that I put
the l at the denominator, I see that here I 

165
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,120
appear a ρu^2 which is the inertia and here
I see appearing μ(u/l), what we have

166
00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:00,430
seen in chapter 1 is thus here a velocity
gradient, so μ* velocity gradient will

167
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,860
be a shear stress. The Reynolds
number can be interpreted as

168
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:10,390
a ratio between the inertia and the viscous
stress or shear stress. We 

169
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,250
could also interpret it differently
by interpreting it as a ratio of characteristic

170
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,520
time between a characteristic time 
of turbulence compared to a characteristic time

171
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,799
of the flow. The characteristic time of
the flow will be here the characteristic length

172
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:30,870
of the flow divided by its characteristic velocity.
However, the characteristic time of

173
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:37,120
the turbulence will be the characteristic length
of the flow squared, divided by the

174
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,160
kinematic viscosity. This characteristic time
is a time that is used to characteristic the

175
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,640
diffusion, we will see that in chapter 6, the
diffusion of turbulence. We could also

176
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,640
continue by showing that the Reynolds
number can be interpret as a ratio

177
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:02,000
of characteristic length. What we've just
did for the Reynolds number can be 

178
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,340
re-iterated for all dimensionless quantities.
For the Stocks number, the Froude number,

179
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:15,020
there exists different possible interpretation.
We will see them progressively. Note that

180
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:21,280
in general a Reynolds number or any
other dimensionless number is defined with

181
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,790
characteristics quantities of the flow
so at macroscopic scales. Sometimes,

182
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,429
we need to introduce what is going on at a
scale much thinner, at a scale

183
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:37,429
microscopic. For example when we study
a sedimentation of particles, we will introduce

184
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:43,240
a local Reynolds number and in this case
here, the characteristic quantities will not be

185
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,240
the characteristic quantities of the flow
but of the size of the particles, and 

186
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,590
the characteristic velocity will be a characteristic
velocity of sedimentation of the particle

187
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:58,500
and not the velocity of the fluid. We will define
in this case a local Reynolds number

188
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:05,200
that will characterize the problem of sedimentation
at the scale of the particle. We are now

189
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,200
armed with these reminders on the physical notions,
we will now approach a little more precisely

190
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,110
the notion of similarity in physics through
a concrete example which will be the example of the pendulum.
