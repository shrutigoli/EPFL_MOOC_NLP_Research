1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:11,150
During previous module, we have seen the
theory of similarity through the example

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:19,110
of the pendulum and the question that arose was
to know how to do when we have a problem

3
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,800
and that we do not know how to solve the equations,
how to determine the dimensionless

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,390
number that characterizes the problem and
if possible to find the shape of these dimensionless

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,390
number. I will bring here a part
of the answer which is, via the theorem of

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,020
Vaschy-Buckingham also called Pi
theorem, it is a part of the answer very formal,

7
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,570
the statement of the theorem is useful, the practical
application is detailed in every

8
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,390
fluid mechanics book but you
must know that in a concrete way we

9
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:58,210
never use it under this form here, however,
the result of the theorem is very useful.

10
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:05,210
We are going to see right now what is the form
of this statement. The Vaschy-Buckingham theorem

11
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,780
states that when we are studying a problem
that has n variables that I call here a1 to

12
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,760
an, I am translating the fact that there is a
relation between these parameters here, either as

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,760
what we call implicit, where I am expressing
here through a function Φ that all the parameters

14
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,930
are connected, or as an explicit form
by taking only one parameter that I am trying

15
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,050
to express as a function of all the others.
For example a1 as a function of the parameters

16
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:47,050
a2 to an. These variables are defined
in a system where I have m measures that

17
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,610
use p fundamental units, in general,
in mechanics we work all the time

18
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,700
with kg, the meter and the second so we
will have in general 3 fundamental units.

19
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,390
The question that arises is to know how many
numbers without dimensions or dimensionless

20
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,220
do I need to represent the solution
of the problem, so if I have the formula like

21
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,730
this, I have n physical variables, so if I write
the equations under dimensionless form,

22
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,709
how many of dimensionless number do I 
need to simplify this equation ? The

23
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:26,379
answer given by the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem
is extremely simple, the Vaschy-Buckingham

24
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:33,379
theorem states that we can form a 
number k = n - r independent dimensionless numbers.

25
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:41,989
r here is what we will call the rank of the
dimensional matrix associated to the problem.

26
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,459
Here, of course, you are getting
scared, I recall, what we call the rank

27
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,209
of a matrix in linear algebra, the rank
of a matrix is the maximal number of vectors

28
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,629
of lines or columns that are independent,
it is also the dimension of the vector

29
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:02,840
subspace that is generated by these vectors
or these columns. If we have for example a matrix

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,359
3*3 and that the lines of the equations are
independent from each other, the rank

31
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:15,359
will be equal to the dimension. In this case here,
we will have r = p = 3. In a couple of cases for example,

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,249
we can have lines or columns that
will be proportional or a column

33
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:25,230
that will be a linear combination of the two other
columns, in this case the rank will be inferior

34
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,480
to p, it is a case a little more unusual. Very
often, in the problems that we must study

35
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,779
we will have the rank of the matrix that will be equal
to the number of fundamental units so very

36
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:41,120
often r = 3 in the problems of fluid
mechanics, but not always. In this case

37
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,059
here, the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem states
that, if I write here under an explicit form,

38
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,730
rather than studying a problem where I have
n variables, I will seek to calculate the variable

39
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,489
a1 as a function of the 1-other variables, I
can obtain a problem that is 

40
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:02,779
simpler so I can decrease the degree
of freedom of the system by looking for a relation

41
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:08,689
where I have k, dimensionless numbers, typically,
I will be able to write here, for example,

42
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:15,449
a dimensionless number that I call Pi1
as a function of k - 1 other dimensionless numbers.

43
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:21,239
This Vaschy-Buckingham theorem
simplifies, reduces the number of variables

44
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:28,000
of the problem. The proof is relatively
simple, I will not go into details, 

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,970
but if you remember a little what we 
have seen with the Rayleigh method, you must keep

46
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:40,000
in mind that all variables can be written
as a product of monomial of fundamental units.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In general in mechanics we will have 3 fundamental
units that will be : the length, the

48
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,909
mass expressed in kg and the time expressed
in seconds. All the variables that I will

49
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:58,919
introduce will be what we call monomials, 
so will be a product of its fundamental units

50
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,120
raised to a power α, β and γ. For
each of my variables, I will be able

51
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,150
to write one of these relations. After, if I
am looking to form dimensionless numbers

52
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,780
from the problem variables, i.e.
that I am looking to write a dimensionless

53
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,509
number, if Pi index i as a function
of my problem variables, so I am looking

54
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:26,439
to calculate the coefficients k1 to kn
such that the physical units here are

55
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,349
equal to 0, that the number is dimensionless.
We are brought to solve a system of

56
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:38,300
p equations, so if I write it as a
matrix, I have a system to solve

57
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:45,300
where I will have p equations for n unknowns,
if the determinant of this system is different

58
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,240
of 0, that the matrix is r, then there exists
n-r solutions linearly independent, 

59
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,430
it is the idea of the proof of the Vaschy-
Buckingham theorem. If we had to

60
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:06,469
put into practice this theorem, what
we should do, is firstly

61
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:11,310
to isolate the physical quantities, the physical
variables of the problem and so to count them,

62
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,560
which would give us the number n of physical
variables. Then, we would write the

63
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,280
dimensions of each of these variables in the
fundamental system (kg.m/s) which is in general

64
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,250
the one of mechanics. Then, we would
determine the rank of the dimensional matrix

65
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,750
associated. In general, this result, most
of the time we have r = 3 and sometimes r =2.

66
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,449
From there, the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem
states that there are n - r dimensionless numbers

67
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:45,969
that can be created. We will see it through
an example, if I apply this mathematical method

68
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:50,500
here, we will end up with dimensionless numbers
but that do not necessarily have a meaning

69
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,759
in physics. What it is important to do,
when we proceed this way, is to manage

70
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,509
to obtain combinations that have a physical 
meaning in order not to have a problem

71
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:05,550
purely mathematical. It is the drawback of
the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem, if we had

72
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,990
to apply it in such a linear way, it is
such that we have a formulation very mathematical

73
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,439
and we forget the physics that is behind
so that in practice we never use it

74
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:22,960
under this form. To see how
we use this Vaschy-Buckingham theorem,

75
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,259
we take a classical example that is what we 
call the calculation of the drag force.

76
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:35,259
The drag force, is my force that is 
for example exerted by a fluid over a

77
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:42,740
particle that I will assume here spherical
and of radius r, this fluid Newtonian, incompressible,

78
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:50,169
that has a viscosity μ and a density
ρF will exert, if the velocity of fluid

79
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:55,960
motion of the particles, relative velocity, is
different, will exert a force F. This

80
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,860
force F is called the drag force. If we
look at the problem, we have 5 variables that

81
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,009
define the problem, so the force F,
it is what we are looking to calculate, the dynamic

82
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:12,479
viscosity of the fluid, its density, the
radius of the particle, so the radius or the

83
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,449
diameter, regardless, and the relative velocity
of displacement of the particle compared

84
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:22,639
to the fluid, so the relative velocity that I call
u. We could ask ourselves . "Why

85
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,219
aren't we taking into account the density
of the particle ?" or other

86
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:31,819
parameters ? So here we must do a bit 
of physics, we should reason a bit

87
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:37,640
physically but typically, if for example
the density is not a parameter

88
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,260
that is here pertinent as the force exerted
is necessarily independent of what is

89
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,400
happening inside, of what constitutes
the inside of the particle so it is

90
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:53,460
independent of the density of the
particle. We will not retain the density

91
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,480
of the particle as a variable. However
this force will depend on the geometric dimension

92
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,620
of the object and so we will retain the radius
of the particle as a problem variable.

93
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,900
we see that this search of variables
that characterizes the problem is not

94
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,760
something as easy as that, we must
already start to think about the physics

95
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,610
of the phenomenon. Once we have done this
exercise of counting the physical quantities,

96
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,590
we must move on to something a lot
easier which is to transcribe these variables

97
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:32,470
in the system of fundamental units,
meters, seconds, kilograms. I have here identified

98
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,580
my 5 variables, the force, the relative velocity,
the density of the fluid, its dynamic

99
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:43,950
viscosity and the radius of the particle in 
the international system. I will then

100
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:49,640
apply the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem
by searching the dimensionless numbers,

101
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,310
by considering that these are monomials,
of the variables F, u, ϱ, μ, r with an exponent

102
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:02,310
that will be a, b, c, d, e affected to each
of these variables. I am looking for an implicit

103
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:09,710
formulation between these 5 variables here, in fact
I am looking at how I must write when

104
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,680
I write this as physical units,
how must I write my combination, 

105
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,100
so what values must I give to a,
b, c, d and e ? It is obvious, when we look

106
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,760
at the problem that we have three equations, as we
have three fundamental physical units, kg, 

107
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:33,760
m, s and that we have 5 unknowns, so we find
easily, by simple mathematical reasoning 

108
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,820
the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem, we will
be able in fact to have two degrees of freedom

109
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,150
as we will be able to determine thanks
to these three equations 3 of the 5 unknowns

110
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:50,630
but that there remains two others that will remain
free or adjustable. The initial relation,

111
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,480
expressed in the physical variables F,
u, ϱ, μ, r, if I express it under a dimensionless form

112
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,890
can be found under a form with only
two variables Pi1 and Pi2 that are dimensionless

113
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,620
quantities and we see that we go from a
problem of dimension 5 to a problem of

114
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,610
dimension 2 so we have considerably simplified
the theoretical study or the experimental study

115
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:17,600
of the problem. I will assume here, you can
do it differently at home and see what

116
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,080
it gives but I will assume here that
I take a and d as free variables and

117
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,790
I will determine the others knowing that
a and d, I assume that I know these values

118
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,510
here. If I proceeded differently, I would obtain
other results but as I know

119
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,160
here the result from a physical point of view,
and to gain time, I assume that a

120
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:46,160
and d are known and have a certain value.
If I solve the system that we have seen previously,

121
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:52,700
I will be able to obtain b, c and e and I obtain
thus the following relations. As a and d

122
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,790
are adjustable, there exists an infinity of
possible values for b, c and e as a function

123
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:05,790
of a and d. As I have said in notice,
we must be careful to find numbers

124
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,050
that are dimensionless numbers with
a physical meaning, and we must find

125
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:16,330
numbers that are independent numbers.
To find independent numbers, I

126
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:23,330
simply have to take a = 1 and d = 0, which
will give me b = -2, c = -1 and e = -2. I could

127
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:30,000
have done another combination a = 2, d = 1
for example, the numbers also were

128
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,280
independent. If I do this, I obtain this
first dimensionless number which is the ratio

129
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,280
of the force divided by ϱ.r^2.u^2, we will see
that this number here has a physical significance 

130
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:49,370
relatively important. If I continue, to 
find the second dimensionless number, I

131
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:55,950
take a = 0, d = 1, I could have taken d
= 2 or 3, a = 1, what we notice is in

132
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:01,440
any case the previous combination would make
a = 1, d = 0, the actual combination is

133
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,440
a = 0, d = 1, these two combinations are well 
independent. If I take these values here

134
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,440
for a and d, I obtain for b, c and e the
values -1, -1, -1 and so I obtain a second

135
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,500
dimensionless number that in fact looks like
the Reynolds number. As every combination

136
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,660
of dimensionless numbers is a dimensionless number
and that I better work in a dimensionless

137
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:31,660
form of numbers and that have a known
physical interpretation, simple, I better 

138
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,160
take as a dimensionless number, not
this ratio here but directly here the Reynolds

139
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,920
number. What is now relatively
important, what we have shown, is that the

140
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,480
calculation problem of the drag force
could be simplified to a relation between this

141
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,460
parameter Pi1 and this parameter Pi2 which will be
here the Reynolds number. This parameter here,

142
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,970
has a name, it is what we will call the
drag coefficient. Now if I

143
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,990
synthesize my result, the initial problem,
a problem with 5 variables, I can simply it

144
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,160
to a problem in an implicit form,
a problem with two variables, or also

145
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,600
in an explicit form, still with two variables
and this dimensionless number here, is what

146
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,580
I will call here the drag number,
so drag coefficient, which is a number

147
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,080
with no dimension and which is here function of a
dimensionless number which is the Reynolds

148
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,030
number. What is useful is that
the similarity theorem gives us the 

149
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,730
number of dimensionless numbers that characterize
the problem and also gives us the definition

150
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,950
of these numbers here. Of course it cannot
determine here the structure of φ

151
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,190
To manage to get this value of φ,
we must either solve the equations of the

152
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:50,190
mechanics, or do experiments to
be able to experimentally determine φ.

153
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,930
Theoretically, when the Reynolds number
is small, the calculations can be done by

154
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:59,280
hand, they are relatively complicated
so I simply give the result but what we

155
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,470
show is that at very small Reynolds
number, the drag coefficient will be

156
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:12,470
equal to 24/Re, it is a law called
the Stokes law. What we also show

157
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,440
from an experimental point view is that
when we are at very large Reynolds number,

158
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,440
in general, the drag coefficient tends
to a constant, here φ as a function of

159
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,510
Re will tend to a value that is between
0,4 and 0,5, it is an experimental value.

160
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:37,510
If now I draw this or I synthesize 
what I obtain from an experimental point of view,

161
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:43,600
what we will have is here the drag
coefficient as a function of Reynolds number,

162
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,180
at small Reynolds number, I have here the Stokes
law that states that the drag

163
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,860
coefficient is inversely proportional to
the Reynolds number and we see that when

164
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,400
the Reynolds number increases, it tends to
a plateau. At very very large Reynolds

165
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,960
number, there are things relatively complexed
that occur and it tends here to a value

166
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:08,960
which is between 0,4 and 0,5. Through
this example of calculation of the drag force,

167
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:14,510
we have illustrated the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem
which is really extremely important

168
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:20,200
to remember is above all the statement of the theorem
thus to know that we can reduce the number

169
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:27,200
of variables of the problem and so in general
when we have 3 physical variables kg.m/s, we

170
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:35,700
can reduce by 3 the number of parameters
that describe the phenomenon, so we will

171
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:43,130
be able to introduce k = m - 3 dimensionless
numbers, in general it depends on the problems.

172
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:50,350
The second point to remember is that the
implementation of the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem

173
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:56,930
is relatively complicated, it has its interest
from an heuristic point of view, for the learning,

174
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:03,370
in practice, in engineering or in research,
we generally proceed in a different way,

175
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:09,930
by non-dimensionalizing directly the equations
to avoid this step a little fastidious

176
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:16,650
of dimensional equations solving
and above all of searching the right combinations 

177
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:22,750
of dimensionless numbers. We will see in
the next module to what use it is in practice.
