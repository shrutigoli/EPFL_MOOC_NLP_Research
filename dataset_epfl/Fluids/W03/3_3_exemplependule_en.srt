1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,080
In the previous module, we had introduced
the notion of dimensionless number, the notion

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,520
of invariant and what the purpose of the theory
of similarity was. We will now see all

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,130
these notions through a concrete example
which is the motion of a pendulum, more precisely

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:29,130
the motion of a point mass m which 
is connected to a rod of length l. We

5
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,920
will see how the theory of similarity
will clear the study of this classical

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,920
problem of mechanics. We will study a
problem where we have a point mass m

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:49,200
connected to a rod of length l. The velocity
of this point mass will be the length 

8
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,680
l multiplied by the point angular 
velocity θ. I can do a small simulation

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,680
to show what is going on. We can see that
if I change the length l, I will modify

10
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,860
the energy of my system, the potential energy,
the kinetic energy, the total energy.

11
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,860
If I change the mass, I will also
vary these energies and I will also

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,080
vary the frequency or the period of oscillations 
of the pendulum. The question that arises is

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,890
to know how are connected all these parameters
between them and can I have an idea

14
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:42,890
of the solution without doing a detailed study
of the mechanics. We will reason here in a way

15
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,950
a bit reversed by starting from the equations of 
mechanics that we will solve and we will

16
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,240
see how we could reason differently 
to obtain the same result. I start

17
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,950
by a small reminder, we have seen that when we
had a pendulum that is assumed without friction

18
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,860
of the air, without mechanical friction, we 
have conservation the mechanical energy, so

19
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,929
the kinetic energy and the potential
energy. If I differentiate this equation

20
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:17,129
with respect to time and that I simplify,
I obtain a differential equation non

21
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:22,650
linear of second order in θ. What interests me
is to manage to characterize the motion

22
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,939
for example the oscillation period. What 
are the variables of the problem ? I have three

23
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:35,579
variables : θ which is the position of the pendulum,
the length of the pendulum which is fixed for

24
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:41,239
a given experiment and the inclination angle
of the pendulum depends on time. The scales

25
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,879
of the problem are the following : I need
a scale for the inclination of the pendulum,

26
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,879
this scale will be for example the initial angle
from which I will throw my pendulum. The length,

27
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:59,060
naturally as it remains constant
will be the length of the pendulum and the characteristic

28
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,639
scale of time will be the period.
We have another variable that is constant

29
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:11,049
here, which will be g, but we can also assume
that if we are working on the moon or on Mars,

30
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:16,469
the value of g could be changed. The
question that arises is, under which conditions

31
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,889
the equation of motion that we have seen previously
is invariant if I do a change of units

32
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:28,209
so if for example I go from a length 
l to a length l' and if I go from a time

33
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:34,309
t to a time t'. Here I should have introduced
a second variable name but to simplify

34
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:39,730
I assume that the ratio of time, this ratio
here is λ at a certain power so

35
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:45,279
in general the power a will be different
than 1. If now I do the substitution

36
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:50,760
of variable in my equation of motion
so that I replace time by this expression

37
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,079
here, and that I replace the length that appears
here by the values that is here, I obtain this

38
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:03,079
expression here. Wee see that if I take care
in defining a as being 1/2, I will be able

39
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:10,969
in the resulting equation here to make
 λ disappear as here we have a  λ^2a =  λ,

40
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:19,370
in this case here, if  λ = 1/2, the transformation
of the initial equation will be strictly identical

41
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:26,060
to the original equation and we will say that the equation
is invariant by a the following variable

42
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:32,250
change by taking a = 1/2 so it is a
linear transformation but with axis that

43
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:39,250
are not lengths but lengths
and times. As a = 1/2, we can define

44
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:48,250
the ratio of length  λ, it is also
the square root of the ration t / t'. If I translate

45
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,860
this in terms of my initial quantity scale
so the oscillation period,  λ will be defined

46
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:03,610
as being the square root of the oscillation period
at a certain scale to another scale.

47
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:10,159
We see here that if I manage to measure what
is happening for a given experiment

48
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:15,729
which corresponds to a length and a given
period, I can, without doing experiments,

49
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,090
determine the oscillation period for
another experiment which would correspond to

50
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:26,090
another length l' as the equations
are invariant and that this oscillation period

51
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:33,129
will have to verify, by using this relation
here, the following equation. The first contribution

52
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,669
of the theory of similarity, will be to
go from a scale to another

53
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:44,669
without re-doing the experiment. Second contribution,
it will be the non-dimensionalization of the equations

54
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:51,629
and so the introduction of dimensionless numbers.
If for example here I introduce a dimensionless time

55
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:55,979
as being my physical time divided by
my time scale (the period), I can

56
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:02,770
transform my equation, here in physical units
in an equation that doesn't have physical

57
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,159
dimensions, the angle is expressed in radian so
does not have units and here I show

58
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:14,490
a number, a ratio that call here Pi 
and if you look close enough, if you do the

59
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,490
calculation of the physical units, g*T^2 / l, this
ratio is dimensionless. Pi translates here

60
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,729
a dimensionless number that will characterize
the problem. The non-dimensionalization of the equation

61
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:35,430
of motion allows to go from an equation
that is expressed in physical variables,

62
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:42,090
in physical units to an equation without
dimensions of which the important parameter will be

63
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:48,939
this dimensionless number, called here Pi and
we always have an initial condition that will be

64
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:55,939
θ0. All the physics of the problem in fact
will be resumed through this dimensionless number

65
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:02,080
and this initial condition, which makes in particular that
Pi can only depend for a given

66
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,080
experiment on θ0. If Pi depends only on 
θ0, I assume that there exists a relation

67
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:15,939
here explicit where I express that Pi is a
function of θ0, so I have here squared

68
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:21,069
to be able to simplify afterwards.
If I use the definition seen previously

69
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:28,069
of Pi, then, if I equalize these two expressions,
it shows that the form of the oscillation period

70
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:36,050
must be written under the form of square root of l /g 
multiplied by this initial function f(θ0)

71
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,919
that we do not know. The important result here
is that simply by manipulation of physical

72
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,050
units we have managed to find the
structure of the solution where we show that

73
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,719
the oscillation period is written under this
form here, multiplied by something that

74
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:57,240
depends on the initial condition. In an
extreme case, we can solve quite simply

75
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:04,240
the equation of motion. When we work
in small oscillations, we can do

76
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:11,080
the approximation sinus of the angle is equal more
or less to the angle. In this case here, the equation

77
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,590
that we have seen previously is transformed
in a linear equation of second order with

78
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,999
two initial conditions, I assume that
I let go my pendulum at a certain angle

79
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:27,499
θ0 with no initial velocity and so it is an
equation that we can solve quite simply,

80
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:34,499
we obtain the following expression for the value
of the angle. In this case here, what you manage

81
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:40,900
to show is that the period that I call
here θ0 that corresponds to what is happening

82
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:47,800
when we are working at small oscillations,
the period here will be equal 2*Pi*sqrt(l

83
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,800
/ g) we could do the calculation when we
are working with arbitrary initial angles,

84
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,390
so the calculation is done, it is a bit more
complicated, remember only  that the solution,

85
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:06,950
if we do the complete calculation, is written under
this form here with the period corresponding

86
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:13,950
to a given angle θ0 and we find the fact
that was given by the theory of similarity

87
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:21,140
that the oscillation period is written
as sqrt( l/g) multiplied by a

88
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,480
function of the initial angle, here it turns out
that this function is a known function

89
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,080
somewhat complex that is called a complete
elliptical integral of the first kind.

90
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Through this example a little fast but 
taken from classical mechanics, we have a

91
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,780
certain number of lessons to pull out, the first
lesson is that there are invariants that 

92
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,400
are dimensionless quantities and that
are defined as combinations of

93
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,540
variables that define the problem. We
can simplify the study of a problem by

94
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:00,430
proceeding in the non-dimensionalization of the equations,
we have seen it with the equation of the pendulum, we

95
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,480
can transform an equation expressed
in physical units in an expression with no

96
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,430
physical dimensions, which in general
simplifies the problem. We can also

97
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,430
define the conditions that can
consider the phenomenon at different

98
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,040
scales and from that point, to know how
do we do to go from one scale

99
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,030
to another. This transition from a scale to another
is what we often call a criterion

100
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:29,520
of similarity. We have seen for example in the
case of the pendulum, the criterion of similarity

101
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,200
is given by a dimensionless number which
is Pi = constant. So for each experiment

102
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,160
Pi will be equal to a certain value and to go from
one experiment to another it will suffice that

103
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:47,160
I use the constance of the parameter 
λ or the number Pi. The question that arises,

104
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,220
here we saw that we  proceeded a little in reverse
as we have started from the equations, we have fund

105
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,450
mathematically the solutions and we have seen
by reasoning what was conserved and what

106
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,420
was not conserved, what could be
simplified and what could not be simplified.

107
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,700
The question is how do we do
to determine without solving equations,

108
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,080
how do we do to determine the
right criteria of similarity and their numbers

109
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,370
? We will start with the simplest, with
the method of Rayleigh which is a method

110
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:22,890
of verification of the homogeneity of a
mathematical formula or a physical equation.

111
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:29,020
We assume that we have a quantity, a variable
x that we are looking to express as a function of a

112
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,670
number n of parameters that I call here
yi. When I will introduce the brackets, 

113
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,300
like here, it means that I am working 
in physical units, for example if

114
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:44,670
x is a velocity, here, what is between brackets
are meters per second. Each

115
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,890
variables that define my problem
y1, y2, we will be able to express them in the

116
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:57,890
fundamental physical units kg.m/s, what
I am trying to do is to know how

117
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:05,940
must I multiply my variables
of the problem from y1 to yn such that

118
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:15,810
the product of the dimensions here correspond
to the dimensions of x. In general it is

119
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,970
a simple system of equations to solve
that will lead to the result. We see

120
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:27,130
it through an example very simple which
is still the example of the pendulum. Let's admit

121
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,810
that I am trying to calculate the oscillation period
of the pendulum of length l and of mass m in

122
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:39,480
a gravity field g. I have my three variables
g, m, l and what I am trying to calculate is

123
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,350
T. By using the relation which is here,
I set that the oscillation period must

124
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,780
be proportional to the length at a 
power a, the the mass at a power

125
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:54,640
b and to the gravity at a power c. If
now I write it under a dimensional form,

126
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,390
so if I write here the units of the period,
it will be seconds, the unit of length

127
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:06,050
will be meters and the unit of mass,
we will have kilos and the unit of gravity

128
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:12,650
or the gravity acceleration, we will have
m/s^2 and each of these variables are

129
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:18,880
raised at the power a, b and c. What 
I stress is that here I must have in my

130
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,670
system, if I now do a balance of
the fundamental units, here, I must have

131
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:30,440
seconds, so here I have 1, however
the mass so the kg or the length will be

132
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,120
two units that are missing so we
will have 0 and 0, if I now do the balance

133
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,560
of what is happening on the right, so the kg appear
here at the power b and if I look at

134
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,690
the length, so meters, the meters
appear here and here, so the power

135
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,160
at the power a and the power c. When 
I gather my different exponents, I

136
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,160
must have that b = 0, a + c = 0 and 1 = -2c,
when I easily solve this system,

137
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:05,450
I obtain that c must be equal to -1/2,
a = 1/2 and b = 0, this shows that in this

138
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:12,450
case here we must have the period that has to
be proportional to sqrt(l/g). We have seen

139
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,840
that it was this result here given previously
when we solved entirely the equations

140
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,510
of motion. We have seen an example relatively
simple to verify the homogeneity of an

141
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,840
equation and to find the structure of a
solution. We will now see what is

142
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:36,000
happening in a more formal way with
the Vaschy-Buckingham theory called 

143
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,180
also Pi theorem.
