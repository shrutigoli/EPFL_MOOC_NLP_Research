00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,700
Hello, and welcome to this fifth chapter
of the course of fluid mechanics. This fifth

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:16,379
chapter will deal with the kinematics of fluids,
in this course of kinematics we will

3
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,270
first of all approach today in this first
module the difference between the Eulerian approach

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,550
and the Lagrangian approach, then in a second
module we will introduce the definitions

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,960
of pathlines, of streamlines and of
streaklines, in the following module

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,910
we will see examples and applications
before describing more precisely in

7
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,150
the forth module the velocity fields
and to classify them according to the

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:48,890
topology of the flows. Let's address today
this fundamental difference between the Eulerian  

9
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,320
approach and the Lagrangian approach. First of
all, what is the notion of kinematics,

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,670
kinematics is the study of flows
and their description without worrying about the forces

11
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,489
that are behind the motion. Two fundamental
approaches to study kinematics

12
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:08,360
of fluids, an approach so called Lagrangian
that is close to what we can do

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,229
when we are studying physics of solids,
material, the physics of material points,

14
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,530
the physics of non-deforming solids then
an Eulerian approach which is quite

15
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,610
adapted to the fluid mechanics. In order 
to understand the difference we will first 

16
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,729
of all give a couple of definitions, then
secondly I will illustrate the

17
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:31,930
differences between the concepts Eulerian
and Lagrangian using an example. Let's start

18
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:37,310
then by the definitions, the Eulerian approach
consists in focusing on the velocity, I

19
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:44,310
remind that the bold notation here of small
u describes just the notion of velocity,

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,229
meaning that it is a vector that has three
components, a component directed in

21
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,530
the x direction, a component directed 
in the y direction and a component

22
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,580
directed in the z direction and this vector is
a field therefore it depends on space, i.e.

23
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,210
coordinates of a point in space
x, y, z and of the instant in time t. It

24
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:09,210
thus the matter of the velocity u(x, y, z, t) in
a fixed point in the space M(x, y, z) so

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,360
I am fixing a point in space, here M(x, y,
z) and I am looking at the value of the velocity vector

26
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,670
at this point. It must be clear that in this
point will flow different fluid

27
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,250
particles. We are looking in fact at the same
point in space at different instants

28
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,550
but we are looking at different particles.
Let's see what it means. Let's imagine at

29
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,250
an instant t0 a particle that I have colored here
in green goes through an observation point,

30
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,860
it has a velocity vector, here represented
in bold, we are here in 2 dimensions as

31
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,940
we are working on the plane of the computer,
on the plane of the board, but in a generic

32
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,870
way it can happen in the 3 dimensional
space. So I am looking at this green

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,520
particle, it has a velocity vector here represented
by a bold arrow, slightly towards

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,349
the top and towards the right. A moment
later, at the time t1, the particle that will occupy

35
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,610
the same position in space is not the 
same as the other has gone away with its 

36
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,480
velocity vector and it is now the orange
particle that is occupying the space. This orange

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,090
particle has a different velocity vector, this
time directed towards the bottom and that is  

38
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,220
also mainly orientated to the right. A little
later, at t2, I have this time a new

39
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,260
particle, a claret particle that is occupying
the place. This claret particle has this

40
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,010
time a vector directed upwards
and that has a smaller norm therefore that is

41
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,390
slower. I have thus observed the velocity
field varying in time in a

42
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,709
fixed point of space and I have thus seen
different particles go by. This is the Eulerian

43
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,519
approach. Let's now see the Lagrangian
approach, this time we are interested

44
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,890
at the velocity which is still a vector
of x, y, z and time, but a particle

45
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,700
in its motion, so we are following the particle
in its motion. This particle is defined

46
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,959
by its initial position at the time 0, it
was at that moment in x0, y0, z0, then, as

47
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,140
time progresses, it will change position.
The Eulerian velocity field is not a 

48
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,870
fixed field in space, we are not looking
at a fixed point in space and watching

49
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,230
what happens in time, we are
following a particle in its motion

50
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,920
and thus we are watching at different points of
space, this is what is really really imporant

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,150
to understand as a difference, here we are following
the particle in its motion. What is

52
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:20,150
the result? Let's look at a particle at the instant
t0, it is the orange particle, it has this

53
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:26,129
position, it is the same flow as in
the Eulerian version, here we are in the

54
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:28,439
Lagrangian version. The orange particle
has a velocity vector slightly directed

55
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,919
downwards and it will be joining a new
position which is the position of the orange

56
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,439
particle which actually matches the position
of the particle that we had seen earlier

57
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:43,879
on in Eulerian and it the only time
where there is an exact intersection/equivalence 

58
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,309
between the two formalisms, at this instant
t1 the Eulerian velocity field and the Lagrangian

59
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:51,050
velocity field are the same because 
the Lagrangian particle that I am following,

60
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,520
the orange particle, is occupying the Eulerian point
of space that I am looking at to measure the

61
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,050
velocity field and, a little later on in 
time, at the time t2, this particle

62
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,899
has gone downwards in the corner, it has a velocity
vector very small directed dwonwards

63
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:08,710
towards the right, you now really see
the clear difference between the Eulerian

64
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,119
version and the Lagrangian version. In
the Eulerian approach, we have fixed a point

65
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:16,189
in space and we have looked at what was happening
in time,  in the Lagrangian

66
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:19,629
approach we are following the particle in
time, fundamental difference. This is

67
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,229
a good first step, these are definition but we might
attempt to take an example a little more

68
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:26,839
concrete to try to better understand the
difference between the Eulerian approach and

69
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:31,629
the Lagrangian approach. I am trying here to
give you an example of the everyday life, i.e.

70
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:36,990
an example that you could try
to imagine yourselves. Imagine that you

71
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,649
are a swimmer in a swimming pool with varying depth.
Why a swimming pool with varying depth? I have

72
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:45,129
chosen this example to justify the fact
that temperature in this pool is

73
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:47,129
inhomogeneous, meaning that it does not
take the same value at different points

74
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:52,610
of space. It is clearly what
happens if I take a swimming pool, that I let it 

75
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,909
heat slowly in the sun since the
morning, in the shallow places, the entire

76
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,379
thickness of the fluid has been heated
whereas the places that are much

77
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,379
deeper, the increase of temperature
is much slower as the lower fluid 

78
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,569
does not see the sun and heats up more
slowly. There is a lot of matter

79
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:14,969
to heat. Let's imagine that it is for this
reason or for a another, that we are

80
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:21,020
thus in this swimming pool which has a cold left
side and a warm right side. I have taken here

81
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,249
the example of a linear temperature
variation, it is the easiest case, what

82
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:31,749
we call a unidirectional constant gradient, 
the direction it is x that is the horinzontal

83
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:37,189
direction and so I will represent the
temperature distribution with a map,

84
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:43,169
it is a map of iso-level or iso-value or
iso-contour or iso-surface  the temperature,

85
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:49,259
dark blue indicates cold and light blue indicates
warm. It is an example,it has no general

86
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,879
values, the reasoning that we will do
could be applied in other temperature

87
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,699
distributions. Let's consider first of all
the first very simple case, it is a case

88
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:00,849
where I am floating but not swimming, so I
am stationary and so I feel

89
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:07,379
a temperature that is not changing, the temperature
is here of 25° or 24,5°, it does not change.

90
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:12,449
I have a variation of my temperature, so
of the temperature felt by the particle,

91
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:19,449
I am the particle. This total variation
is simply zero. Next case, this

92
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,959
time, I am swimming at velocity u. As I
am heading in direction, with this velocity

93
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:31,240
u chosen towards the right, my felt temperature
so the temperature of the particle is increasing.

94
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Its variation with time: DT/dt is positive,
yet, in the Eulerian vision, if

95
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,669
I choose a point in space whatever it
is, the temperature is changing in

96
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:48,309
time. You see that for me as a particle
my temperature is changing although in the Eulerian

97
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:52,889
vision the temperature is not changing.
I can easily determine how my

98
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,539
temperature changes, it changes all the
more that I swim faster so that the velocity

99
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:01,149
u is big, and it also changes all
the more that I swim in the direction where the

100
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:05,529
temperature gradient is the strongest.
Hence, I obtain the relation represented here

101
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:10,080
in red, that tells me that the variation in
time is simply the product between the velocity

102
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,830
and the temperature gradient, here that is
a gradient that I choose constant in the

103
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,209
x direction. Now, next case, this
time I am not swimming but the sun

104
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:23,409
is still shinning. If the sun keeps
on shinning, the temperature of the pool

105
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:27,569
will keep on increasing. We will assume that it
is increasing everywhere in a uniform way but

106
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:30,499
it could also increase in a non-uniform
way, so we could go from one

107
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:36,620
inhomogeneous distribution of temperature at
the instant 0 to another distribution of

108
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:43,620
temperature at an instant later. Let's imagine
that I am not swimming this time, even so,

109
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,519
as the sun keeps on heating, the
temperature of the pool increases and so

110
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:55,440
in a given point, my temperature variation
is increasing. This, DT/dt is positive,

111
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,769
but this time it is not positive because
I am swimming in direction of the warm region,

112
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:02,970
I it simply positive because locally,
at the place where I am, the temperature

113
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,300
increases. Indeed, for a stationary particle,
the Lagrangian vision and the Eulerian vision

114
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,930
merge and I thus have the identity that
the Lagrangian derivative of T with respect

115
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,699
to t is equal to the Eulerian derivative
of the temperature with respect to t. We write

116
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:22,569
here the partial derivatives with ∂ and
the total derivative, which is the Lagrangian

117
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:27,810
derivative by D or a small d but I prefer
D, the contrast is clearer between

118
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,720
the D and ∂. Now, let's consider the most
complete situation, i.e. I am swimming

119
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,550
on one hand with a velocity U and besides the
sun is shinning, so, the temperature variation

120
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:43,310
that I will feel, me, the particle, 
is DT/Dt that will be equal to the sum of

121
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,819
the variation due to the fact that the
temperature is evolving because the sun is heating

122
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:52,149
the pool and the fact that I am swimming at a velocity
u. This derivative, here, total, we call it

123
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:55,610
total derivative, convective derivative or
Lagrangian derivative. The part that is

124
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,290
simple linked to the variation in one point
of the temperature field, we call it the

125
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,610
Eulerian derivative or partial derivative.
Then, the last term is a term of advection

126
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,160
or transport. I have written here an equation
quite general that tells me that I can go

127
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,339
from a Lagrangian variation of properties
to an Eulerian variation of properties

128
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:17,470
by doing this transformation that we call
the Lagrangian derivative transformation.

129
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,800
This is a writing rather limited to
a unidirectional case, if I am in a 

130
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,089
three-dimensional temperature field and that
I am myself going through the space with a vector

131
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:34,050
with three components, then here is the most
general expression. We recognize here the velocity

132
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,259
field, it is in bold because it is
a field, it has three components. I recognize

133
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:43,129
here the operator called the gradient,
so the temperature gradient is nothing

134
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:50,129
else but the vector composed of ∂t/∂x,
∂t/∂y, and ∂t/∂z. If I take the dot

135
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,980
product of u and the gradient of T, I find
the following relation where ux, uy and uz are

136
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,959
quite natural notations for
the three components of the velocity. Look

137
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:11,720
here at the complex relation quite difficult
finally, of the temperature variation

138
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,980
of the particle in its motion, so of
this Lagrangian concept, as a function of Eulerian

139
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,050
information, i.e. the variation in
one point and the gradient of the space of my

140
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:25,910
choice as well as the velocity field u.
I hope this concrete example clarifies

141
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,250
a little the data for you. In the next
module, we will see how to represent

142
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,579
a certain number of Lagrangian quantities,
particularly the pathlines of particles,

143
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,230
but today, to end this module, I
would like to show you how we

144
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,660
draw of velocity field. There is no big
surprises, to draw a velocity field,

145
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,240
as it is a field of vectors, we will simply
represent this velocity field as a

146
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,350
vector field. This means that in each
point of space, we cannot do it

147
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,959
in each points of space, so we will
have to do it in a certain number of points of

148
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,959
space, perhaps on a equidistant grid
or maybe not on a equidistant grid,

149
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,100
it is your freedom. We will represent at
a certain number of points of space the

150
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,050
velocity vectors and we will take as a rule
to represent each velocity vector by 

151
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,850
a small arrow and this arrow will have
an orientation that is the one of the local velocity

152
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:14,069
vector and a length that is proportional
to the norm of the velocity. Observe that in

153
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:17,839
this case here, we have the wind above a
two-dimensional mountain, it is a case slightly

154
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,279
idealized, the wind is blowing from the left to
the right, it has a zero velocity here on

155
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,019
the floor before reaching the mountain, so
you see that here the velocity vectors are

156
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,449
invisible as they are in fact points
that we cannot see the, little by

157
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:38,029
little, it accelerates when going up on the
uphill part of the mountain and in the downhill

158
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:41,779
part, you see that the velocities here are
extremely low. This is interesting,

159
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,999
it is maybe something you have
already experienced, if one day you go

160
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:50,339
to the mountain and that there is a North-wind storm,
so a wind from the north, you will have to hide

161
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,810
on the side that we call "under the wind",
meaning the south side and there, the

162
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,850
wind will be much lesser. Why? Because
we have a phenomenon here that is this phenomenon

163
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:05,850
of detachment or something what we call
a phenomenon of separation. You see

164
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,180
that the problem of visualization by vector
fields is that in the regions where

165
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,120
the velocities are low, we will see absolutely
nothing. We have to zoom in to get to see

166
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,509
something. When I zoom in here in this
region, I see that indeed in this

167
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,480
recirculation zone, the flow is recirculating,
meaning that it goes towards the right over

168
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,149
here but it goes towards the left in the lower
direction and hence there is a returning

169
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:37,860
flow in the bottom region. The most important
point is that, in comparison

170
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,439
with the arrows that are on the outside,
the arrows that are in the inside are

171
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:43,790
here extremely small which means that
the velocities are extremely low, which is

172
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,939
exactly the experiment we can have
by ourselves when we will be hiding from

173
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:51,470
the wind behind a small mountain.
