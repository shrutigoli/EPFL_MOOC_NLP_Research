00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,549
Hello and welcome to this fifth chapter
of the course of fluid mechanics. In this

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,100
fifth chapter that deals with the kinematics
i.e. the motion of fluids without

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,900
worrying about the forces behind it.
We will continue what we have done

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,310
in module 2, i.e. discussing the differences
between pathlines, streamlines,

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,039
and streaklines. These are 3 very important
concepts that will help us describe

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,060
the movements in the fluids. This time,
instead of giving the definitions, we will

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,660
try to illustrate the differences between
these three concepts with two examples, first

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,329
of all a stationary example, in which
the three lines will merge, then a non-stationary

9
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:47,329
example. I recall that these three
concepts are often very useful as the

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,129
pathlines truly describes in a Lagrangian
logic the evolution of a particle

11
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:55,030
in its motion, whereas the streakline
is a quantity that is quite easily

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,850
obtained experimentally and finally the 
streamline is a concept profoundly Eulerian,

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,699
it is a line that is tangential to the velocity
field in a different instant. I also remind

14
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,890
that the pathline concerns only one
particle where the streakline gathers

15
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,209
different particles issued at different
instants in a given point. This is a

16
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:15,759
little abstract so let's try to just see
it in a very concrete case. This concrete case

17
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,759
is here, it is a downward vertical jet 
that impacts a horizontal flat plane.

18
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:29,910
The non-permeability condition, imposes that
the vertical velocity v is zero in 0 and

19
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,399
y here ensures this non-permeability condition.
It is also interesting to observe that this

20
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:43,399
jet is centered on a value x0, and to 
see that the horizontal velocity that is

21
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:50,810
given here is not equal to 0 in y = 0,
this is a violation of the rule of adhesion,

22
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:57,340
that imposes that if the plate has a zero
velocity, then the fluid must also have a

23
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,140
zero velocity, the two components, or more
generally the 3 components of the zero

24
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,759
velocity or beyond the plate. Here it is not
verified and that is what we call a

25
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,970
boundary layer effect, i.e. that
the solution we are suggesting here which is

26
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,780
a solution of fluid equations, does not satisfy
the boundary layer near the wall

27
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,580
and will give rise to the forming 
of a boundary layer. It is not a concept

28
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,550
that we can introduce in this introductory
course to fluid mechanics. 

29
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,100
This flow, far from the wall, far enough 
from the wall, will seems as an excellent

30
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,590
approximation of the real flow. Let's look
here at the velocity field represented by

31
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,960
arrows directed in the direction of
the velocities and of which the length is proportional

32
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,060
to the module of the velocity vector. Here, in the
case where the jet is stationary, i.e.

33
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,370
it is centered in a position x0 here
equal to 0 that does not depend on time. It

34
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,050
is possible to compute the equation for
streamlines that is the following

35
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,790
: a streamline is defined as
being everywhere tangential to the velocity field,

36
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,900
which means that the slope of the
streamline, or the inverse of the slope dx/dy must

37
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,990
be equal to u/v. Recalling the definitions

38
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:15,540
of u and v, and simplifying the hyperbolic tangent
that is nothing else but sinh/conh, this

39
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,850
expression becomes the following equation, which
is a differential equation that must be

40
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,540
integrated such as to obtain a family
of lines that join the value of y with respect

41
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,130
to the value of x. To integrate it, I am
seeing very naturally to the right

42
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:39,130
the logarithm of y and to the left, in fact,
-ln(tan(h)), once we integrate first of

43
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,470
all the logarithms and that we take from it
the exponential, an absolute value appears,

44
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,770
which gives in fact a family of streamlines
everywhere tangential to the velocity field

45
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:56,770
defined as following, with k 
being a real number. I have represented here

46
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,510
one of these streamlines that goes through
a particular point, here, which is the point

47
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,520
from which I will be putting later on my
streaklines and also the point of which

48
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,930
I will be considering the pathline when
at the instant t0, a particle goes by this

49
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,090
point. Well, talking about it, what about the
pathlines? Let's imagine that at the instant t

50
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,720
= 0 I emit a particle from this,
what is going to happen? I am thus representing

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,720
here the pathline with the positions every
10 time step in small filled circles

52
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,500
and the intermediate positions every
time step represented by the emptied

53
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,280
circles. I thus observe that the particle
is first pretty well centered in the heart

54
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,820
of the jet, which grants it a negative vertical
velocity quite important, then it deviates

55
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,960
progressively while slowing down. It seems
that in each point this pathline

56
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,710
is tangential to the velocity field, this is
normal because the flow is stationary.

57
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,560
Now, let's look what is with a
streakline, what I will do in

58
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,210
this film here, is that at each instant, I
will emit a particle from the point

59
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:10,210
considered and observe the evolution of the
streakline. You see here that

60
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,370
this particle, with particles that are
emitted every dt and particles every

61
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,910
10 dt that are the particles in filled
circles, we see that this streakline

62
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,620
coincides here again with a line that is
tangential in all points to the velocity field,

63
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,370
and so, to sum up, if I superimpose the
three quantities of interest that are the

64
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,669
streakline in blue, the pathline in red
and the streamline in black, I observe

65
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,660
that they all coincide, which is
perfectly normal as the flow

66
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,380
is stationary. Now, I will get in
a more interesting case which is the case

67
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,020
of a non-stationary flow. The way
I will make my flow non-stationary

68
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,590
is the following:I will simply imagine
that my impact point x0 oscillates from left

69
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,340
to right according to a sinusoidal movement of
period 1/Pi, in other words of pulsation

70
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,520
2. Let's represent now what
is the evolution of the velocity field and a

71
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,360
particular streamline that does through
a particular point which is the that

72
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,820
I mentioned earlier on, situated
around here. We will play now

73
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:19,820
the film and see how this jet brushes from left
to right the flat plate. Here it gas gone

74
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:29,330
to the right, it comes back to the left, in
a perfectly sinusoidal way. The 

75
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:36,080
streamline going through the considered point,
changes at each instant. If I look at

76
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,300
this streamline at the instant here for
instance t=1, I observe that it passes through the

77
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,919
considered point and then it goes towards
the right although at other instants the

78
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,110
streamline will be inflected rather
to the left. It is important to note

79
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,570
here that the fact that the point x0 depends on
time does not change the equation of the

80
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:59,570
streamlines as the streamline equations
are computed at a given instant

81
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,960
(Eulerian concept) and so time appears
as a parameter in this differential equation

82
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,460
and this differential equation is not
a differential equation dependent on

83
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,509
time, the time is simply a parameter
that fixes the value of x0. If now I

84
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:18,370
am interested on what happens for a pathline
that is emitted from the point considered here

85
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:24,910
at t=0 in a flow that this time
is non-stationary. The particle is now

86
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:31,910
released, and let's make a stop in this video,
what can I observe here? I observe that the

87
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:39,340
particle which has occupied different positions
that are its trace in the past occupies

88
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:46,340
at the time here t=2 for example this position
here, at that moment there, the pathline is

89
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:53,030
indeed tangential to the velocity field.
However, at the starting point, the velocity

90
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,789
field has now changed and the trace
of the pathline that corresponded to the velocity

91
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:04,789
field at the time t=0 is not anymore
tangential to the starting point. I resume

92
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,400
the film and I observe, the pathline
is inflected according to the oscillating

93
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,400
motion of the jet. What about the
streakline now? In the case of the

94
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:30,320
streakline, I emit different
particles at different instants,

95
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,759
but from a same point. This time, it is 
interesting to observe that the streakline

96
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:41,759
is tangential to the streamline at the emission
point. This is normal as this

97
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,009
particle that just started off in this point
is subjected to the velocity field which is the instantaneous

98
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:52,740
field. However, the particle that
has arrived here, although it is subjected to the velocity

99
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,420
field that is represented in an instantaneous
way, is connected along its

100
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,800
streakline a neighboring particle that
I represent here that was absolutely

101
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,839
not subjected to the same history. There is no
reason why the tangent created by the streakline

102
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,610
will here be tangential in one way
or another to the instantaneous flow.

103
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,660
Indeed, these are two different particles
and this is not a velocity vector, these are

104
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:24,660
simply lines that join points
for different particles. I resume

105
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,709
the film and I will observe something
quite characteristic of the streakline,

106
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,660
scrolls extremely important with
very large deformations and stretchings

107
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:42,660
extremely important of the streakline. 
As I have indicated earlier on, this

108
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,009
streakline is never tangential, there 
is no reason for it to be so in a non-stationary

109
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:51,629
flow to the streamlines goes
through its head, although it is tangential to

110
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:54,679
the tail. I recall that in the streakline,
the streakline connects particles

111
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:57,730
that were emitted at different instants
and that are physically absolutely not

112
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,929
linked, these are particles really different,
whereas in the pathline, we are following in

113
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:05,579
a Lagrangian manner only one particle,
therefore if now I superimpose the three,

114
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:10,749
I will actually see the differences
with a streakline that is tangential

115
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:15,369
in its emission point, a pathline
that is tangent in the position of the particle

116
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:22,009
and streamlines that are brushing the space
according to the periodicity of the flow.

117
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:28,189
Conclusion, in a non-stationary flow,
there is absolutely no link between

118
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:33,179
the streakline, the pathline and the streamline,
and these three quantities are profoundly

119
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,000
different. They only merge when
the flow is stationary.
