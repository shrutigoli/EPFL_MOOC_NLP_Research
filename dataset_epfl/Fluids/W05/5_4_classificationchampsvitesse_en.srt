00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,090
Hello, welcome to this last module
of the fifth chapter of the course of fluid

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,500
mechanics. A fifth chapter that deals with
the kinematics, i.e. the description

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,189
of the fluids' motions without worrying
about the forces being them. In

4
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:20,820
this course of kinematics, the fourth module
will deal more precisely with the general

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,730
classification of flows in the vicinity of a 
point. We will thus look at the flow

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,640
in the vicinity of a point by zooming
and locally describing in a very general

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,180
way the geometry of the flow
or the topology of the flow. In this

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,200
classification of the velocity fields, we will
introduce in particular a concept

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,120
very important which is the vorticity that
describes the proper rotation of particles

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,040
in the flow. As we have just said,
the velocity field in the vicinity of a point

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,920
x can be expanded by a simple asymptotic 
development or in proper English a Taylor

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,580
expansion. As u is actually a vector
and as x is also a vector, the derivative

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,490
is not a scalar, it is not a vector
but it is simply a tensor, the gradient

14
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:13,010
of the velocity field consisting of 9 components,
i.e. the variation of u in the direction

15
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:20,010
x with respect to x, the variation of v the velocity
along y...  This gradient of the velocity field

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:28,080
that I can maybe write here ∇u
is nothing more than du/dx,du/dy, du/dz,

17
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:38,350
dv/dx, dv/dy, dv/dz, dw/dx, dw/dy, dw/dz can
be in general way decomposed in

18
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,850
a symmetric part and an antisymmetric part,
we can always do this. The symmetric part

19
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:05,850
that is expressed simply as the half-sum
of ∇u and of (∇u)^T called the strain

20
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:17,670
rate tensor, it has a key role
in the constitutive law of a Newtonian fluid.

21
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:29,770
The antisymmetric part, here represented
in blue and often noted Ω is half the difference

22
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,260
between the tensor of velocity gradient and its
transpose. We can decompose the symmetric

23
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,770
part in a more systematic way
in two pieces: S which is the diagonal part

24
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,080
and T which is a part that does not have elements
on the diagonal, which is a part of trace 

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,599
null, that is the most general decomposition
that we can do for

26
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,599
the tensor of velocity gradient. It is the
sum of these two terms that constitute the

27
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,040
strain rate tensor. Be careful,
here many of you may say

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,520
that you have made a mistake, that you did not
choose a course of algebra, no, this

29
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,170
algebraic decomposition is in fact very
relevant from a geomtrical point of view.

30
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,930
I will try here to illustrate it for you. I
am considering the most general motion

31
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,020
in a point x of a particle that we represent
square shaped. The point x is moving at

32
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,220
a velocity u(x) and the neighboring points
are moving with velocities slightly

33
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,010
different, and it is in fact the gradient
of the velocity field that is telling me how the

34
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,629
neighboring points of x are transported at
a velocity that looks like u(x) but that

35
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:41,250
is slightly different. Hence, the transformation
of this square particle in a particle

36
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,410
of different shape can be simply
approached in asymptotic terms,

37
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,140
i.e. when the particle is small,
it can be in fact approached by the

38
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,170
superposition of 4 effects, the first one is
of course the translation at the velocity u(x),

39
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,569
so actually, the particle centered
in x at time 0, when it is moving

40
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,750
of a quantity u(x)dt, it is essentially moving
according to a translation motion. Meaning

41
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,379
that the neighboring points will also be
subjected to this translation. But, it is not

42
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,409
all, due to the antisymmetric part
of the tensor of velocity gradient, there will be

43
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:18,720
also a rotation. This rotation is executed
without expansion, i.e. the area

44
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,350
is conserved and without deformation i.e.
the angles of the particle are

45
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,930
conserved. It is a part purely rotational.
There will also be an part of pure

46
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,220
expansion that corresponds to the diagonal part
of the velocity gradient, which will expand the

47
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,210
particle without changing the angles, and it is
this part of which we can show that, for

48
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,610
an incompressible fluid, we will see this in
chapter 6, that for an incompressible fluid

49
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,580
this part is null, there is no possible
expansion for a fluid that cannot be

50
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,270
compressed or that cannot be expanded. And
then a part t which is a part associated

51
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,080
to the deformation but which is a part
of trace null. This deformation is done

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,310
without rotation of the particle and without variation
of the area, here because I am in 2 dimensions 

53
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,139
or without variation of volume for a particle
in three dimensions. This decomposition is

54
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,650
completely general, i.e in
each point of the flow we can always

55
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,020
decompose the velocity field as the sum
of a translation, which is the velocity at the considered

56
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,430
point, a rotation, which tends
to make the particles turn on themselves,

57
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,780
an expansion and a deformation. If I
take the example of Newton's flow

58
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,590
between a fixed wall and a moving wall,
the pure shear is the sum of an effect

59
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,490
of rotation and an effect of deformation
without expansion. This decomposition

60
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,240
is completely general and it gives a
good geometric vision of what can

61
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,820
happen in a flow. Now,
I will be interested more specifically

62
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,820
at the antisymmetric part Ω. A result
from algebra demonstrates that the application

63
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:52,889
of a antisymmetric tensor that has
only three information as there are

64
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,330
0 on the diagonal and that the non-diagonal
elements of the lower part are

65
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,710
the opposite of the non-diagonal elements of
the upper part. The operation of this

66
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:09,710
antisymmetric tensor in 3 dimensions can
be represented or re-expressed as the

67
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:16,229
cross product of a vector containing
these 3 informations multiplied

68
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:21,770
by the vector on which we apply the tensor.
When I apply here the tensor Ω to the tensor

69
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:28,220
δx, I obtain exactly the same result
than if I apply the cross product between

70
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:35,220
a vector called the vorticity or more
exactly 1/2*the vorticity ^ δx, you

71
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:41,090
remember what the cross product is,
the cross product is a formula, so

72
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,190
I do not have to recall here what a
cross product is. The big question that

73
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,680
we ask ourselves, is how to obtain this vector,
how from the tensor here antisymmetric

74
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,360
is it possible to obtain the vorticity vector
Ω which will actually be taken in a cross

75
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,160
product with δx to obtain the same result.
There is a very simple formula that links

76
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,240
Ω to the velocity field, Ω as I have said
is called the vorticity, this formula

77
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,880
is simply Ω equals curl of u,
what is the curl? The curl

78
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:16,880
is simply the operator that uses
∇ by doing a cross product. I write

79
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:26,160
∇ : ∂/∂x, ∂/∂y and ∂/∂z that I apply
to u, v and w. By doing as such, I obtain,

80
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,960
if I look for example at the first component,
I obtain simply  ∂w/∂y - ∂v/∂x,

81
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:49,889
you recognize the first element
I needed to express the action of the tensor

82
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,889
Ω. I can do for example another case,
let's take the component along z, if I want

83
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:05,889
to calculate the component along z of this cross
product, it will simply make me ∂v/∂x

84
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:13,229
- ∂u/∂y, and this ∂v/∂x - ∂u/∂y,
is in fact ∂v/∂x - ∂u/∂y. There,

85
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,380
it is a way a little algebraic of introducing
Ω but what is the physical meaning of the vorticity

86
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,110
ω ? The physical meaning of the vorticity is
the following: In a rotational motion

87
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,300
where the vorticity rot(u) is different from
0, the particles turn on themselves.

88
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,699
However, when the motion on is irrotational,
it means the curl of u is

89
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:38,969
equal to 0, the particle in its motion
is not turning on itself. I will

90
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,409
give you an example to better understand
this by simply looking at what happens

91
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,420
in vortices. Vortices, are
flows characterized

92
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,189
in particular by the streamlines 
nearly circular, concentric that I

93
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:55,470
have represented here. And here is a well-known
vortex which is the rigid rotation vortex.

94
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,999
In the rigid rotation vortex, the velocity
uθ is simply proportional to the radius,

95
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,889
the more I deviate from the radius center, the more
I turn fast. It is exactly what

96
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:09,149
happens when I put a solid in rotation.
In this case, I can simply calculate the

97
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,589
vorticity. I have to be a little careful,
as the flow is plane, the vorticity

98
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:19,139
will have a non-zero component only
along the ez axis which is perpendicular to

99
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,040
the flow plane, that is the first
thing to have in mind. The second thing

100
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,239
is that I must be careful as I
cannot simply write ∇uθ as

101
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:31,689
I am working in orthoradial coordinates r
and θ and in this case there are metric terms

102
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:35,559
and so the expression of the vorticity is
this one, i.e. it is not simply

103
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:42,559
∂uθ / ∂r but it is 1/r.∂ruθ / ∂r,
this is due to the change of coordinates, I

104
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,800
am in an orthoradial coordinate system. Let's apply
this formula, I obtain 1/r.∂Cr^2 / ∂r,

105
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,519
which gives me in fact 2r/r.C, the areas
are gone and I obtain the vorticity which

106
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,319
is constant equal to 2C, what this means
is that if I take particles that

107
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:13,199
are here on a concentric line relatively
to the outside of the vortex, these are turning

108
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:17,009
of a certain quantity given by
2C and so it is a rotational motion

109
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:21,179
and if I take a particle on a smaller 
concentric circle, they are turning exactly

110
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:24,949
in the same way as the vorticity
here is constant in the vortex. Another

111
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:28,350
vortex well-known model is the point
vortex. In the case of the point vortex, this

112
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:34,600
time the velocity is hyperbolic so it is
a constant C/r, in this case, I apply again

113
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:41,600
the formula and find that ω is simply 
1/r.∂r(C/r) / ∂r, the r are counterbalanced,

114
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:54,139
the derivative of a constant with respect to
r is 0, and so I obtain simply 0. This

115
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,069
vortex which really looks like a
vortex as it has streamlines

116
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:02,449
concentric and circular, is actually
a vortex associated to an irrotational

117
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:06,769
motion, the particles are not turning
on themselves, although they are turning

118
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:10,029
around the center of the vortex. You must be
really really careful when we are talking about

119
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,970
rotation in a flow, there is the proper
rotation of particles linked to the

120
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,299
vorticity and the center of rotation around
which the pathlines, streamlines

121
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:26,329
in stationary flows, are
are simply circular or in  any case concentric

122
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:31,069
and quasi circular, be careful to this difference.
In the reality, a vortex is neither

123
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:36,470
a vortex with a rigid core filled with vorticity,
nor an irrotational vortex with a hyperbolic

124
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:42,040
profile of velocity uθ(r), it is in
fact in general the mixture of both with

125
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,129
a core in rigid rotation
and an irrotational external region, with

126
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:49,759
a velocity profile of uθ that increases linearly
in r in the region still solid and that

127
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,359
decreases non-linearly in 1/r in the
part called potential at the outside of

128
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:59,709
the vortex core. It is what we can
see here for example in a vortex of

129
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:03,660
a drain obtained simply by draining a 
liquid through a small cylindric hole

130
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,709
in a cylindric container.
