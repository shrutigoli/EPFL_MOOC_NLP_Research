00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,469
Hello and welcome to this second module
of the 5th chapter of the course on fluid

2
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:13,320
mechanics. A fifth chapter that deals with
kinematics and in this module we will

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,730
see 3 concepts that are extremely useful
to describe the kinematics of flows.

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:25,730
Namely the pathlines, streaklines
and streamlines. I recall that kinematics

5
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,359
is the field that studies flows
that describes the motions inside

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,930
fluids without worrying about forces that
cause them. Today, we will

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,270
introduce progressively these 3 concepts,
i.e. firstly the notion

8
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:47,460
of pathlines which is linked to the motion
of a particle, then the notion of streaklines

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,920
which already a little more complicated to
define, it involves a line that

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,620
joins the positions of different particles
at the same instant then we will finally introduce

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,600
the notion of streamlines which is
a notion perfectly instantaneous.  Let's start

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,600
by recalling two very special cases,
limit cases of what a flow may be.

13
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:16,039
The first case that we will consider,
we will give the definition of what a

14
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:20,299
uniform flow is. A uniform flow
is a flow that does not depend on

15
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:26,109
space. I recall that in an Eulerian
logic we describe the velocity field

16
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:33,109
by a vector u that depends in a general way
of the space x and time. To say that a flow

17
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:39,869
does not depend on space, it means
that it does not vary in any of the directions

18
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,740
of the space, which means more precisely
that none of the components vary in

19
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,560
any of the directions of space and that is
simply written that the gradient, which is

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,569
a differential operator, of u is equal
to 0. Gradient, you surely all know

21
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:00,130
what the gradient of a scalar is, the gradient
of a scaler is the partial derivative

22
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,630
of this scaler according to the 3 directions
of space, namely x, y, z. The gradient of a

23
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:11,120
vector is what we call a tensor,
a matrix in other words,  that contains all

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,530
the derivatives of all the components of
the vector field: ux, uy, uz according to

25
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,580
the 3 directions: x, y and z. We will say
that a flow is uniform when the

26
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,580
gradient of the velocity field is equal to
0, in other words that the velocity field is

27
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,019
a constant, i.e. of constant norm
and of constant direction everywhere in space.

28
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:40,750
This is the first quite interesting case,
it is the case of the uniform flow. We

29
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,720
will also look now at the case of
the stationary flow. A stationary

30
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,750
flow, is a flow where
the velocity field in any points of space

31
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,720
does not depend on time, i.e. that for
any points of space and for all the

32
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,159
components of the velocity field, the partial
derivative of the velocity is equal to 0 as

33
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,200
a function of time. These concepts will be
useful later on in this course. Let's introduce

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,349
now the notion of pathlines, it is
a notion that is Lagrangian, i.e.

35
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:09,480
that the traces of a particle in
its motion, it is very close of what

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,110
we had defined as the Lagrangian approach
for the description of fluids. Little reminder,

37
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,780
we have defined the Lagrangian approach
as following: In the Lagrangian

38
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,890
approach, we are interested in u(x, y, z,
t)  of a particle in its motion. The

39
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:30,590
particle occupies successive positions
M(x, y, z, t) and the particles is characterized

40
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:37,590
by its position M0, it is tagged by
its position M0 in x0, y0, z0 and t0. Now

41
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,010
we will follow this particle during its
motion. If it is here in the center of the

42
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,569
box at the instant 0, a little later, it
will have occupied a different place at

43
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:53,109
the moment t1 and then another different position
at the moment t2. If now, I join all

44
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,980
the successive position of this particle
as time passes, I obtain a

45
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,489
line that passes by 0 and that is the pathline 
of the particle that went through M0 at the time

46
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,530
t0, a pathline, it is tagged
by a point in space and also by a time.

47
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:16,530
I locate a point in space M0 and a time
t0 where the particle passes at this point M0,

48
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:24,400
and now, if I integrate, so if I look at
the position of this particle at other

49
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,590
moments... Or else in the past, or 
in the future, I obtain the pathline. Mathematically,

50
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,710
this can be defined. Mathematically,
what we will be writing is that the pathline

51
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:40,090
is the whole set of positions X of a particle
which has passed by X0 at t0 and so 

52
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,740
I simply have to solve the ordinary differential
equation that states that the variation of x

53
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,449
with time dX/dt, the derivative of x with
respect to  time, it here concerns a Lagrangian

54
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:55,449
derivative, I am the particle in its
motion, this position X is such that

55
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:02,259
dX/dt is equal to u the velocity field at
this point X which depends on time, at the instant

56
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:07,750
t, the field has also the right, in an Eulerian
way, to depend on t. The velocity

57
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,919
of the particle depends on the position of
the particle X which itself depends on time,

58
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,310
but it also depends explicitly on time
because the velocity field, as we

59
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,389
have seen it before, has the right to depend
explicitly on time. We give to this

60
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,630
ordinary differential equation an initial
condition which is that the position of the particle

61
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,960
at the time 0 is X0, thus I only have to integrate
this differential equation, most often

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,380
numerically, to obtain a pathline.
There is strictly no problem that

63
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,349
the pathlines cross, provided
that they cross at different instants,

64
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:45,009
or else this violates principle of causality,
meaning that subjected to the same forces,

65
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:50,520
two particles that occupy the same position
at the same time must follow the same pathline,

66
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,009
principle of causality. However, if the
particles pass the same point at different

67
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:00,300
times, there is no reason in the
general case why they would occupy the same pathline.

68
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,310
The only case where they will never cross,
is the case of a stationary flow,

69
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,629
meaning that it does not depend on time.
Another thing, we can perfectly imagine

70
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:11,840
a pathline that loops over itself,
this raises no conceptual difficulties,

71
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,000
the particle occupies the same position but
at two different instants. Now,

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,620
let's define the streakline. In order to
define the streakline which is in fact

73
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,080
the whole set of positions occupied at a given
instant T by particles that passed

74
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,629
a given point M0 at times prior
to T. I will try to illustrate this with

75
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:37,099
diagrams. I start by defining 3 pathlines,
a pathline of a red particle, a

76
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:40,970
pathline of a yellow particle, and a 
pathline of a blue particle.If I superimpose

77
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:47,150
these pathlines, I observe that they all
pass through a point of space that I call

78
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:54,090
M0 and I see that the red particle is passing
point M0 at the time t0, where the blue 

79
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,849
particle passes through M0 at the time t1 and
the yellow particle passes thorugh M0 at the time

80
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:06,849
t2- I will now be able to collect
the position of the particles at the time T that

81
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,909
passed through a point M0. M0 is this point
here, T I choose it equal to t3 and I collect

82
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:22,389
all the particles at the time t3, that 
passed through M0. The one that passed through

83
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,409
M0, this is the one that is precisely in M0
at the time t3, is a black particle, it

84
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:30,800
did not have time to move, it is in
M0 at the time t3. Now, I recall

85
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,400
that the yellow particle passed through M0
at the time t2, but now it has continued

86
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,289
its path and has arrived a little
further. I now represent this yellow 

87
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:44,729
particle at the instant t3 but it passed
through M0 at t2. I do the same thing

88
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:48,729
for the blue particle. The blue particle
now at the time t3 is gone widly

89
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:53,960
to the right but remember that at the time
t1, it passed through M0. Same thing

90
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,310
for the red particle which is very close
of leaving the box, the red particle which,

91
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,569
at the time t0 passed through M0. I now have
collected the particles at the time t3 that

92
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:09,039
have all gone in the past through M0
and I can link these particles (I am

93
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,800
not doing it in an arbitrary way), I have
really calculated for each infinitesimal variation

94
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,819
of time the whole set of positions and this
defines the streakline. We see

95
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:23,090
that in a general case, i.e.
in a non-stationary flow, i.e.

96
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,740
where the pathlines passing through a
given point, are not all the same,

97
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,110
they depend on the moment when the particle
passed through this point, which is the case

98
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,140
here, we see that the streakline
does not match at all with the pathlines.

99
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,570
In a more simplified manner, we can say
that although the pathlines integrate

100
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,380
the motion of a fluid in time, so
we are following the same particle, we clearly see that

101
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,399
the streakline collects different
particles at different instants.

102
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,329
The pathline is one particle at
different instants, the streakline

103
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:04,610
is different particles at different
instants. We will see the next concept

104
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,450
that will be the streamline, which is in fact
many particles at a given instant. It

105
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,370
is interesting to notice here that experimentally
we can create streaklines by

106
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,930
injecting a dye in a given point
and that will create a dye filament

107
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,980
that materializes the streakline, it is
a very very efficient manner of vizualising 

108
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,380
flows. Last very useful concept:
the streamline. It is a concept this

109
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,050
time that is profoundly Eulerian, it is
a concept that is associated to the velocity field

110
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:38,720
in a given time. The streamline depends
on time. We can only draw an instantaneous

111
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,930
streamline. Of course, and it is
the case in the flow that I am showing here,

112
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,670
if the flow is stationary, if it
does not depend on time, then its

113
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,649
streamlines do not depend on time either.
How are we going to build the streamlines 

114
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,730
? We will take our velocity field, here
represented by small arrows, vector

115
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,310
field, and we will look for lines that
are tangential in each of their points to

116
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,680
the velocity field, we will start these lines
in different points of space, we will

117
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,680
again give them a tag. An example
of streamline, this streamline

118
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,589
begins relatively straight. Of course,
the flow here is quite parallel,

119
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,860
meaning all the velocity vectors are
parallel therefore it is a rectilinear motion,

120
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,500
then, as we climb
over the bump, the streamline

121
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,950
tends to go up towards the top, to follow,
to fit the shape of the bump. Then we

122
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,740
see that in the downstream area, due to inertia,
this streamline stays much more

123
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,290
parallel and does not follow the shape of the bump.
What must be understood, is that when

124
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,200
I draw this, it is simply a geometrical
property of the flow at a given

125
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,290
instant. I can repeat this operation
and obtain a great number of streamlines,

126
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,589
here represented in blue. I can even
now erase the velocity field and

127
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:59,040
watch only the streamlines. It is 
way, which is quite efficient, quite 

128
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,130
explicit, to describe what is happening
in a flow, particularly, if I look at

129
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,250
the velocity field in the recirculation zone,
i.e. the zone where the velocity

130
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,420
vectors are very small, it is quite
hard to see visually the direction of

131
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,000
arrows and I have to zoom in a lot to
see something from it. However, when

132
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,010
I simply look at the streamlines,
these can be either open, or

133
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,110
closed. When I have a closed
streamline, it indicates the notion of recirculation.

134
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,500
There are still many other things that
I can learn by simply watching

135
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,639
streamlines, we have defined
streamlines as lines that

136
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,519
are everywhere tangential to the velocity field,
this means that the velocity of a fluid

137
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,410
particle, cannot cross a streamline, 
it is always tangential to this

138
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,700
streamline. Thus, I can define
the stream-tube between two adjacent

139
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,880
streamlines. In this stream-tube, as
the velocity is everywhere tangential to these

140
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,529
streamlines and that I cannot cross
these streamlines, the flow rate is simply

141
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:57,620
conserved, the mass flow rate in 
general, because nothing is created, nothing

142
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,040
is lost in the absence of chemical reactions.
In the absence of chemical reactions I have a

143
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,160
mass flow rate that is conserved and what
I see, is that as a consequence, if two

144
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,720
streamlines are tightening, and it is
the case when we have to climb up

145
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,649
the bump, by flow rate conservation, I have to
accelerate, and that is perfectly natural.

146
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,660
It is clear that by going above the bump,
the flow must accelerate, what we call

147
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,810
the Venturi effect simply: I tighten
the streamlines so I am accelerating.

148
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:30,810
Conversely, in the downstream area where we should
decelerate, the inertia of the fluid makes this

149
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,589
deceleration very difficult and a phenomenon
that we call a phenomenon of separation

150
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,149
or detachment occurs with the forming
of a recirculation zone where the

151
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:44,529
streamlines are closed on themselves.
Generally speaking, a streamline

152
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:50,470
never touches a wall, it is either
open, or closed on itself and the

153
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,380
only exception, are what we call
dividing streamlines, I have represented here the 

154
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,519
dividing streamline for you. This dividing streamline
starts from what we call stagnation points,

155
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,959
i.e. points on the wall where
the shear is zero. The line that joins

156
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:09,070
these breakpoints are what we call
the dividing streamlines. When we look at the flow

157
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:15,100
under this form here, it seems to me that the
description of the flow is more explicit

158
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,860
than when we simply look at a velocity
field. Now, what is the equation

159
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,380
of this streamline? It an equation
very simple, it is a differential equation

160
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:30,380
that tells me that the whole set of points x of
this streamline is such that when

161
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,920
I make a small infinitesimal movement
dx along the streamline, I have to

162
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:43,920
stay tangential to the vector u, meaning
that the cross product of u and dx must

163
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,480
be 0. It is a definition quite abstract
but we will see in the module 3 how

164
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,029
to specifically apply it. Be careful,
streamlines depend on the frame of reference.

165
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:59,149
I have done here a thought experiment
very simple for you, I am imagining that a small

166
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:03,750
cylinder is moving at a constant velocity
in a very viscous fluid. These are

167
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,360
the streamlines I can observe
in the laboratory frame of reference. In

168
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,360
the laboratory frame of reference, I see in front
of me this cylinder moving and I see the

169
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:18,680
instantaneous streamlines that have this
shape. They could perfectly be

170
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,459
materialized by pathlines. Now,
if I change the frame of reference, i.e.

171
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:29,949
now I am filming the flow at the 
speed of the moving cylinder, here

172
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:32,899
the flow that I see around me, I
am now in the frame of reference of the cylinder,

173
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:36,899
the streamlines absolutely do not have
the same shape. It is essential to understand

174
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,060
here that streamlines are concepts
that are dependent of the frame of reference in

175
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,790
which we draw them. In conclusion, we
have seen 3 concepts today, we have

176
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,370
seen the pathlines, which is a Lagrangian concept,
the concept of streaklines that considers

177
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,610
different particles at different
moments, and the streamlines that consider

178
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,910
only one instant of time, so a concept
profoundly Eulerian. What must be remembered

179
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,899
is that these families of lines that are
all very useful to visualize the flow,

180
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,040
are equivalent only when the flow
is stationary.
