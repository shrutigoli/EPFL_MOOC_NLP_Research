1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,334
An archive is like a living organism:

2
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:07,046
if you want to understand fully
its current structure

3
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:11,012
you need to understand its history
because an archive changes over time.

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:16,830
It moves, it gets restructured,
it gets old.

5
00:00:17,788 --> 00:00:21,076
Another way of seeing an archive
is seeing it as a volume of volumes

6
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:24,276
because what does the archive really 
is organizing spaces.

7
00:00:24,678 --> 00:00:27,678
You have a big space
cut into smaller spaces

8
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:34,121
which then lead to the conservation,
the indexation of smaller special units :

9
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:38,082
Box, registers, statue, painting.

10
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:42,327
Let's go and have a concrete example.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,882
You see here the corridors
of the state archives in Venice.

12
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:53,019
80 kilometers of documents,
documenting a thousand years of history.

13
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:56,869
Venice is a special case because of
its political origin,

14
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:01,908
it maintained an archival system
over very very long periods.

15
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:06,996
And this is that archival system
composed of very long document series

16
00:01:07,196 --> 00:01:13,515
that we can now use to think about
the possibility of recreating the density

17
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:14,785
of the past.

18
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:18,865
You have documents, registers
but you have also maps for instance.

19
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:22,405
Not one map, but thousands of maps.

20
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:29,721
And these maps give a very detailed account
about the structure and spatial organization

21
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:34,075
of Venice.
But also of many other places.

22
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:40,771
Let's go a bit deeper in the different typologies
of documents we may encounter.

23
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:46,435
Administrative documents, testaments,
contracts.

24
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:52,255
All the documents that permit to have
the organization of a city.

25
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:56,219
It there are some work to be done,
if there are some transformation in the city

26
00:01:56,419 --> 00:02:00,085
there are new laws that are voted.
All this is documented in the archives.

27
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:00,735


28
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:02,143
They used to be at different places in Venice

29
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:05,632
and it's only at the beginning
of the 19th century

30
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:08,632


31
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:09,390
that they got in a single,
very big space.

32
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,652
An ancient covent which is
the state archive of Venice today.

33
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:21,395
Very huge building, 300 rooms,
80 kilometers of shelves

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,926
and the question : how can we transform
that physical space

35
00:02:28,126 --> 00:02:29,874
in an information system.

36
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:34,339
Are we capable of searching 
in so many documents.

37
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:38,853
What type of technology can we use
to make it accessible.

38
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:43,201
3 steps are key to this transformation.

39
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:47,259
The first step is the digitization :
we need first to transform

40
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,457
theses physical documents into images,
millions of images.

41
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:56,481
Second step : transcription, indexation,
segmentation and analysing the documents

42
00:02:56,681 --> 00:03:00,097
so that they are searchable very easily.

43
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:05,185
And last step : connecting the information
which are in the document in a big graph

44
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,265
linking people and places.

45
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:10,465
Typical use case for us would be
a search engine

46
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:14,266
I would like to be capable
of typing the name of a Venitian

47
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,855
for instance Battista Nani
and find all the documents

48
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:20,712
that are related with that person.

49
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:24,277
It seems an easy thing to do
and we do it every day

50
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:28,410
for the data about the present,
it's quite difficult to do

51
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:30,110
for the data about the past.

52
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,310
And this is the core subject
of this course.
