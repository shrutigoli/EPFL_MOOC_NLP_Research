1
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,261
Finally, let's configure the synapse
to realistic biological ranges

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,490
for the AMPA and
the NMDA conductances

3
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:15,687
and the magnesium concentration.

4
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:19,058
We'll record both the NMDA and
AMPA conductances separately

5
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:23,225
to visualize their contribution to
the total conductance trajectory.

6
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:29,536
First we set the AMPA conductance to
1nS, a reasonable biological value

7
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,981
next we set the NMGA conductance

8
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:35,809
to approximately 70% of
the AMPA conductance 

9
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:39,651
as it is a biologically typical
ratio of NMDA to AMPA

10
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:43,383
and we set the magnesium
concentration to 1mM.

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,160
Next we set up recording vectors
for the NMDA and AMPA

12
00:00:49,364 --> 00:00:52,364
specific conductances,
and then we run the simulation.

13
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:56,293
Now we can plot the time courses
of the total conductance

14
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:59,856
and the NMDA and the AMPA
conductances separately.

15
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:04,478
In this case we've used
the "axis" command

16
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:09,117
to zoom in to the pulse
occurring at 100ms.

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,083
As you can see the total conductance
and the AMPA conductance

18
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:15,827
are in a pretty close agreement

19
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:19,701
but there's an additional long tail
component of the total conductance

20
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:24,998
which is due to the NMDA
component in our synapse model.

21
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:31,493
Finally, let's plot the dependence
of the NMDA conductance

22
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:34,126
on the magnesium concentration.

23
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,669
Here we record the NMDA
conductance trajectory

24
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:41,834
due to 1mM, magnesium

25
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:45,221
and now we're going to
compute the trajectories,

26
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:49,550
simulate the trajectories for
a range of magnesium concentrations

27
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:53,509
going from 0.5mM down to 0mM.

28
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:55,437
And we're going to assess each of

29
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:58,879
the time courses of
the NMDA conductance.

30
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,989
Let's execute that step,
and now the last step.

31
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:08,728
As you can see, the conductance
trajectory for the NMDA component

32
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:13,258
is rather small for realistic values
of the magnesium concentration

33
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:17,077
as magnesium goes towards
zero concentration

34
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:20,244
the overall magnitude of
the NMDA conductance

35
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:22,886
is increasing dramatically.

36
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:26,766
This indicates that the NMDA
receptor requires the presence

37
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,021
of magnesium for the voltage block
to be effective.
