1
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:07,987
Let's briefly look now at how
we get to neuron densities.

2
00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:12,037
We are going to come back to this much
later in the next MOOC actually

3
00:00:12,318 --> 00:00:14,567
about how do we reconstruct
the circuit,

4
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:18,026
but I just want to show
you how that is used,

5
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,388
how we use the molecular profiling

6
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:23,230
to actually get to neuronal densities.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,590
So here is a movie that you can see

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,371
that is showing stained cells.
These are cell bodies.

9
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:36,351
Actually, it is staining everything,
glia and neurons,

10
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,288
but then you can stain,
you can apply different stains

11
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:42,214
many different stains.

12
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:44,631
So you can stain for the glia,

13
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:47,963
you can stain for GABAergic cells

14
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:53,805
and you can stain for neurons,
just neurons in general

15
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,175
and you can do many other stains

16
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,313
and using these different stains,

17
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:04,468
you can then start identifying
how many neurons there are

18
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,708
in each of the layers of the neocortex

19
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:12,221
and these are some numbers
and this is in the cell paper

20
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:17,651
that you can you should be following
during this course.

21
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:26,266
The important point to make
here also is that counting

22
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:29,513
how many cells there are in
a particular brain region is very unreliable.

23
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:32,831
It is the most unreliable, probably
one of the most unreliable data-sets

24
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:34,925
you can get to.
If you read a paper,

25
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,299
tells you how many
cells there are in the brain

26
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:39,530
or in a particular part of the brain,

27
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,837
just bear in mind
that there are 20 other papers

28
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:44,056
that will be contradicting that data.

29
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:46,912
The most reliable way to do this

30
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:48,475
is to do block staining.

31
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,387
A big block and then you use clarity,

32
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:54,345
so that you make sure that all your
neurons are in that piece of tissue

33
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:57,746
and there is a lot of certain care
that has to be taken

34
00:01:57,946 --> 00:02:01,164
to make sure that you have controlled
for shrinkage and many other things,

35
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:03,897
to make sure that you really do know

36
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:08,317
how many neurons there
are in a particular part of the brain.

37
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:10,706
Okay. So, here is just a movie,

38
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:13,171
just showing you
that you put them all together,

39
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,685
we are going to come back
to this much more in the future.

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,839
And here again is...

41
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,999
you have the in silico staining
of each of these different peptides.

42
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,731
It is not important what they are.

43
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:29,096
It is just that you have many different
peptides and each of the neuron

44
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:32,893
is stained according to those maps
that I showed you before

45
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:36,387
and then you can do...
so you stain your virtual tissue

46
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:39,825
or the reconstruction
and then you can have a look at

47
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:44,301
what real tissue looks like when
it is stained with the same peptides.

48
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:49,968
And then you count and you
look at the distributions that you see

49
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:55,053
with in silico and the distributions
you see in the real system.

50
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:58,851
So then what you find if you actually...

51
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:01,969
after you have reconstructed
the circuit

52
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:05,275
with different cells
and different layers

53
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:09,295
and then you find
that it actually correlates

54
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:13,244
in terms of the recipe
which was obtained

55
00:03:13,837 --> 00:03:17,150
from getting those densities.
It is one different data set

56
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:23,835
and the actual measurements
obtained from the real tissue.

57
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:29,600
So the reconstruction then basically,
looks like the real tissue.

58
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,919
So if you were an anatomist
and you were staining tissue

59
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,937
and you stained
the virtual piece of tissue,

60
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:38,279
you would see the
same patterns of staining

61
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:44,002
as you do see
in the brain tissue.
