00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:07,012
Hello, and welcome to my part.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,262
I’m Lida Kanari.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,850
I’m doing a PhD in Blue Brain Project

4
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:12,099
and I’m gonna talk about

5
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:13,475
neuronal morphologies.

6
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:15,025
In the first part,

7
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,062
I’m gonna talk about

8
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:19,150
the different parts

9
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:20,825
of neuronal morphologies.

10
00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:23,187
How you can visualize them

11
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,075
using an open source tool called

12
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:28,925
NeuroEM that is available in GitHub.

13
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:30,750
How you can extract

14
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:32,625
basic morphometrics,

15
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:35,450
and then in the second part,

16
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:36,712
I’m gonna talk about

17
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:38,475
some statistical tests

18
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,687
that you can run on those morphometrics

19
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,050
in order to compare

20
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:43,575
different morphologies.

21
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:45,325
This is a neuronal tree

22
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,237
which consists of a soma and a neurite.

23
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:53,787
As you can see,

24
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:56,600
we have different points on the tree.

25
00:00:56,937 --> 00:01:00,287
So the blue points annotate the tips

26
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:02,875
or the terminations as we call them.

27
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,674
The black points

28
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:06,812
are the bifurcation points

29
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:10,249
where two different branches emerge,

30
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:12,524
and the red points

31
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,387
are just continuations.

32
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:18,899
So a pair of points defines a segment.

33
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:23,262
If we put all the segments

34
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:25,962
between two bifurcations together,

35
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:27,687
we generate a section.

36
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,212
A section is a fundamental compartment 

37
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:32,062
of a neuron, so we’re gonna use

38
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:34,812
those fundamental compartments

39
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:35,936
in order to understand

40
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:37,424
the morphology.

41
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:40,949
First, we’re gonna study the global

42
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:43,262
features of the morphology.

43
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:46,474
So those features are length,

44
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,162
the area, or the volume.

45
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:51,374
In order to compute the total length,

46
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:54,162
we take the distance between two points

47
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,499
and we sum up this distance

48
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,549
for all of the points of the tree.

49
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,349
If we wanna compute the area

50
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:04,199
or the volume, we need to use

51
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,112
the diameters of the points.

52
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:09,287
So we generate a truncated cone,

53
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,737
something like that,

54
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:14,862
and so we sum up the area

55
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:17,274
or the volume throughout the whole tree.

56
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,787
Some other global features

57
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:21,949
is the count the number 

58
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:24,337
of bifurcations or terminations.

59
00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:27,262
And then we can go into details

60
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,799
and study the section structure.

61
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:31,612
So for the sections,

62
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:33,175
we can do exactly the same.

63
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,587
Sum up the lengths, or the areas,

64
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:37,037
or the volume of the sections,

65
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:38,987
but now, we also have

66
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:40,437
some other types of features:

67
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:42,862
those are the angles.

68
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,150
The angles can be computed locally

69
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:47,362
and those are called

70
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:49,987
local bifurcation angles,

71
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:52,050
or remotely at the end

72
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:53,862
of the two sections

73
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:56,049
and those are called remote.

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
Then we can compute the branch order

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,650
and the branch order is defined

76
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,525
from the start of the tree

77
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,650
and onwards.

78
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,737
So for each bifurcation,

79
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:10,575
you add one more branch order.

80
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,187
So the first one would be one,

81
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:14,587
and then the second one would be two,

82
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:16,250
three, and so on.

83
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,075
About the tortuosity,

84
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:22,825
we are interested

85
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,175
on what happens within the section.

86
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:28,550
So this section

87
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,437
is one that wiggles a lot,

88
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:35,062
and that has a very high tortuosity.

89
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:38,287
But a section that is completely straight

90
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:41,400
has a tortuosity equal to one

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,862
because the end-to-end distance

92
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,887
and the path distance are the same.

93
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,437
So the tortuosity

94
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:53,225
is defined as the radial distance

95
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:55,475
between its two points

96
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,412
by the path distance.

97
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:05,875
And now another measurement

98
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,362
that is very important

99
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:09,300
is the asymmetry of the tree.

100
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,087
So we can compute that

101
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:12,975
at each bifurcation point again,

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,762
and the asymmetry defines

103
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:17,187
how many branches go on the right,

104
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:19,037
and how many branches go on the left.

105
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:24,412
So a tree that is completely symmetric

106
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:26,700
would be something like that,

107
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,362
and a tree that would be

108
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:29,800
completely asymmetric

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,537
would be something like that.

110
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,400
So all those types of measurements

111
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,112
are fundamentally important

112
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:37,575
for the anatomy of the neuron.

113
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,925
And we’re gonna use NeuroEM

114
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:42,337
in the first tutorial 

115
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:45,450
in order to get all those features.
