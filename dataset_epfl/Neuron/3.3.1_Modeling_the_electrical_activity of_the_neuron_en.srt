1
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:08,073
So here, I want to start
with actually the mechanism

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,878
that enables neurons
to generate electricity.

3
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:14,548
Because I told you so

4
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:17,034
there are these electrical
signals in neurons.

5
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:19,114
But what makes it possible?

6
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:22,104
Why do they generate
electrical activity?

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,900
So here is a schematic
draft or a drawing

8
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:29,093
of a neuron.

9
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:32,965
Of course a neuron is not a circle,
you saw that it has this structure

10
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:37,114
but let's look at it as it is,
so this blue circle

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,365
is supposed to represent
the membrane of the neuron

12
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:45,647
the enclosure of the neuron,
there is a membrane,

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,515
and there is the outside
of the neuron

14
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:51,233
and the inside of a neuron here

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,553
inside of the membrane
and the outside of the neuron here

16
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,001
and between the outside
of the neuron

17
00:00:58,196 --> 00:00:59,783
and the inside of a neuron

18
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:03,306
there is this
ion concentration.

19
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:08,288
Okay, so there are three ions,
key ions that carry charge

20
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:11,487
across the membrane of the neuron.

21
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:15,872
There are the sodium ions,
the potassium ions

22
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:19,813
and the chloride ions,
and these three ions

23
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:22,050
have different concentration

24
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:25,238
between the outside
and the inside of the membrane.

25
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,819
And this different concentration,
as you will see soon

26
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:33,706
can go through,
or the ions can flow through

27
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:36,593
membrane ion channels,
which are particular proteins

28
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:40,555
that might enable when
they open these channels

29
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:44,481
they can enable the flow
of ions, let's say

30
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:47,886
from the outside to the inside
or from the inside to the outside

31
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:53,306
depending on the concentration
gradiance across the membrane.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,883
So here are really typical numbers.

33
00:01:57,105 --> 00:02:01,155
So let's look at the sodium ion,
you can see that on the outside

34
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:05,115
it is highly concentrated
compared to the inside

35
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:09,047
so now if I open
a channel for the sodium

36
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:13,563
the direction of flow will be
from the outside into the inside.

37
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:15,659
In the case of potassium

38
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,875
you see it's highly concentrated
on the inside

39
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,050
and less concentrated
on the outside

40
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,263
so if I open a specific ion
channel for potassium

41
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,748
the current flows
from inside to outside

42
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:33,933
and so is the case for chloride

43
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:36,554
it's highly concentrated
in the outside

44
00:02:36,793 --> 00:02:39,168
it's much less
concentrated on the inside

45
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:44,437
and this will enable chloride to
flow from the outside to the inside

46
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:47,828
in case a chloride channel is opened.

47
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:51,612
So this channel that
you see here schematically

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,415
is specific, it is embedded in
the membrane of a neuron

49
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:01,146
and when open, this specific
ion channel, let's say for chloride

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,337
if this channel is open,
then chloride will start

51
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:07,564
to flow from the outside
to the inside.

52
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:11,029
And if it's, let's say,
a sodium channel

53
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,400
it will do the same.

54
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,609
If this channel is sodium,
specific sodium channel

55
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:18,736
then the sodium will flow from
the outside to the inside

56
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:21,162
and if it would have been
the potassium channel

57
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:23,348
the current will flow
through the channel

58
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:25,543
from the inside to the outside.

59
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,617
So that's really what causes
the membrane of neurons

60
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,448
to be charged,
because these ions are charged

61
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,898
and they have a tendency to flow
from one direction, from in to out

62
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:42,104
or from out to in,
depending on this gradient

63
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,625
of concentrations
and the only question is:

64
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,517
Which ion or which channels
will enable which ion to flow?

65
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:53,785
So if the membrane
is completely sealed

66
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:57,596
completely sealed,
no current will flow

67
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:00,843
and if there are channels open
current will start to flow

68
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,666
and when I say current
I mean either sodium current

69
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:07,873
or potassium current,
or chloride current.

70
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:11,203
These are the three currents
that enable the neuron

71
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:14,383
to become an electrical device.

72
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:18,546
So in order to develop
an understanding about

73
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:26,819
what is really making this
gradiance of ions behave like

74
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:30,012
an electrical device,
there is a very well known

75
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:36,181
Nernst equation here,
which really describes

76
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,095
what is the battery,

77
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:44,800
what is the driving force
of these ions as a function

78
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,643
of the concentration difference
between the outside of the membrane

79
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:50,785
particular ion to the inside.

80
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:52,870
So this is the concentration
of the ion, let's say

81
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:56,862
potassium in the outside,
or potassium in the inside

82
00:04:57,058 --> 00:04:59,745
and this, according
to the Nernst equation,

83
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:04,295
this gradiance with some
constant here, which you can see

84
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:10,589
defined in this case here,
these numbers, these constants

85
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:13,807
will give you voltage here.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,425
So this is a battery in units
of volts (V) or millivolts (mV)

87
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:26,207
and the value of thi battery depends 
from the gradiance from the inside 

88
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:28,748
and the outside of the membrane and 
on this constance,

89
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,928
which is,
by the way this constance

90
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,166
is around 60mV

91
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:42,540
here.

92
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:46,330
And Z is the charge of this
particular ion.

93
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:52,468
So okay, now let's look
at this Nernst equation

94
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,562
for each ion,
so the Nernst equation

95
00:05:54,757 --> 00:06:00,557
described the battery
for a particular ion.

96
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Let's look at the battery
of the sodium

97
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,199
because the sodium is highly
concentrated on the outside

98
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:09,798
and it's less concentrated
on the inside

99
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:13,264
we'll do this Nernst equation
computation, and you will see that

100
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:16,467
you will get a number of +60mV

101
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:21,067
this means because sodium
tends to flow from outside

102
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:25,149
to inside, it tends to charge
the inside of the neuron

103
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:32,102
with the positive charge to
the level of +60mV inside the cell.

104
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:35,806
The potassium, and I can see here
there is a mistake

105
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:39,878
if you compare it to the left,
so the potassium is actually

106
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,224
less concentrated in the outside

107
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,496
and more concentrated
in the inside

108
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,479
it's in Molar (M) here

109
00:06:56,796 --> 00:07:00,946
so there is a tendency,
as we saw here in the left

110
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:06,053
of the potassium to go to flow if
possible, if there is a channel open

111
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:09,747
it will flow from
inside to the outside

112
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,729
and this will leave
a negative trace inside.

113
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,292
You loose positive charge
when the potassium flows

114
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,216
from inside to outside

115
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,474
and this will give you
a battery here

116
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:23,701
of negative charge
inside the cell.

117
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:30,319
So the battery of the potassium
is about -72mV inside the cell

118
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:33,026
compared to the outside.

119
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:36,925
And here you see the chloride and
this is the battery of the chloride.

120
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:41,389
almost -90mV inside
of the neuron.

121
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:48,835
So these are the three basic ions
that generate electrical activity

122
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:55,403
in neurons and in the case,
as it is, with the concentration

123
00:07:55,631 --> 00:08:00,068
using the Nernst equation
you can see the battery

124
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:05,109
for each one separated
on their own.

125
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:07,228
But of course,
they are not on their own

126
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:10,788
because all three of them
appear together

127
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:14,797
in the neuron, inside and outside,
as you can see in the left

128
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:20,197
so we actually have to find a way
to describe the combined voltage

129
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:25,020
or the combined battery
of all three together.

130
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,768
So in order to do that,
in order to understand how does

131
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:32,482
one do that, I'm going back
to the same descriptions

132
00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:37,723
so there is this schematic neuron,
this spherical or circular neuron,

133
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:41,044
the inside of the neuron here,
the outside of the neuron there,

134
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:46,459
there is this channel or channels
that enable sodium, potassium

135
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:50,601
or chloride to flow from
the inside to the outside.

136
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:55,600
And now, I'll define the voltage
across the membrane

137
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:59,813
as the difference between
the voltage outside of the membrane

138
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:01,756
to the voltage inside
of the membrane.

139
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:05,514
So now, I define V membrane here
as the difference between

140
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,730
V in minus V out.

141
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,695
So the difference between
the voltage inside the cell

142
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:16,892
to the voltage outside of the cell.

143
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:22,075
Okay, and here I want to write down

144
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,317
for the first time in this course,
the electrical equivalent circuit

145
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,154
for what I just described
until now.

146
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:37,160
How do I describe
a channel electrically?

147
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:40,711
We saw that a channel
is like a conductor:

148
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:46,209
when open, it can conduct
ions through the channels.

149
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:50,333
So let's call a channel,
or let's draw a channel

150
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:53,407
as a resistor.

151
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,648
So this is now a resistor
or a conductance

152
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:01,959
you know that conductance
and resistors are one

153
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:04,127
over the other.

154
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:10,851
Let's say, this is the conductance
of the sodium channels

155
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:14,586
which is the total conductance
of all the sodium channels

156
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,686
in this piece of membrane,
this is the total conductance

157
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:24,305
of all the sodium channels
that will enable, if opened,

158
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,345
for sodium to flow through.

159
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:34,502
This will be the outside of the cell
the outside of the membrane

160
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,795
and here it will be
the inside of the membrane.

161
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:44,608
Here I draw the battery.

162
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:47,954
This is now the battery.

163
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,593
The Nernst potential for this ion.

164
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:57,937
We know that it's about something
of the order, as we said before

165
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:01,129
+60mV.

166
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:08,817
You can see the large part,
the longer part of the battery

167
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:12,856
is directed towards the inside,
this means that this battery

168
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,131
is positive inside.

169
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:18,269
And this is, as I said

170
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,831
the total conductance that
will enable sodium currents to flow

171
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:32,354
from e outside, in this case,
to the inside of the cell.

172
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:36,463
Now, let's look
at the potassium.

173
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:40,605
This is the total conductance
of all ion channels

174
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:45,627
for the potassium and now
this will be the potassium battery

175
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
or the Nernst potential
of the potassium.

176
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:55,518
This will be the Nernst
potential for the potassium.

177
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:58,343
You can see now that
the negative part of the battery

178
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,108
is directed towards

179
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:05,653
the inside, this is now something
like the order of, as we said, 70mV

180
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,870
or something like that

181
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:15,025
And then there is the third one
which is the chloride conductance

182
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:19,811
G chloride, and there is also

183
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:25,665
this need to be negative

184
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:31,311
ok, so the negative side
of the chloride is directing inside.

185
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,334
Ok?

186
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:36,234
And I also want to add something
that we did not discuss at all

187
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:40,274
and this is the membrane capacitance,

188
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,075
because we also know
from experiments that

189
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,955
there are these ion channels
that enable current to flow

190
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:53,619
through the membrane,
in this direction and so forth

191
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,813
but there is a lot of the membrane
that has no channels,

192
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:03,475
much of the membrane does not allow
charges to flow through

193
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,668
and it behaves like a capacitance.

194
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:12,021
It really accumulates charges,
inside versus outside.

195
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:17,511
So, what I drew now
is actually a mode of the membrane.

196
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:19,844
This is the membrane

197
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,490
this is the outside
of the membrane

198
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,582
this is the inside of the membrane

199
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,268
and between
the outside and the inside

200
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:30,220
there is a voltage chain drop
there is some voltage

201
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,027
we call it V membrane.

202
00:13:33,243 --> 00:13:36,380
So there is the difference
between the outside and the inside

203
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:43,098
which is a combined weighted
sum of this circuit.

204
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:46,769
So this battery with this
conductance contributes something

205
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:50,538
to this membrane voltage and
this conductance and this battery

206
00:13:50,723 --> 00:13:52,834
contribute something
and so forth.

207
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:57,106
And in order to describe
the resting potential

208
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:01,617
which is the basic potential
that the neuron sits on

209
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:05,959
without any particular activity
neither synaptic nor spine

210
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:11,245
now I will have to describe,
or actually solve this circuit.

211
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:13,994
So now I'm going
to solve this circuit.

212
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,270
But we made an intellectual
jump just now

213
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:19,934
from a biological description
of the membrane

214
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:23,505
through the Nernst equation,
knowing that there are these three

215
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:29,973
particular ions into a circuit
that could be written mathematically

216
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:33,167
because now this is an electrical
circuit and we understand

217
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:36,057
the mathematics
of electrical circuits.

218
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:40,543
So in principal, I can write
the equation that describes

219
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,075
this whole circuit.

220
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:45,267
Okay, so now that we have
this circuit

221
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:48,132
I would like now to write the equation 

222
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:52,812
and this comes from
the Kirchhoff law

223
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:58,247
and the Kirchhoff law will give me

224
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,151
the description,
the mathematical description

225
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:01,271
of this circuit.

226
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:02,641
I just want to add one thing:

227
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:05,846
that in what we call the resting potential

228
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:09,059
of the neurons,
so without any stimulation,

229
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:12,469
without any excess activity,
no synaptic activity

230
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:13,944
no spiking activity,

231
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,129
the total current 

232
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,104
so all the currents
going inside and outside

233
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,490
the total current,
which is actually

234
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:24,345
(total membrane current)

235
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:28,059
which is actually the sodium current

236
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,926
plus potassium current

237
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:34,685
plus the chloryide current

238
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:40,117
at steady state, at rest,
without any voltage change

239
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,307
this all should be zero.

240
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:48,249
So based on this equation

241
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:52,359
I'm now writing
the conductance equation

242
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:58,472
so one thing, we have to remember
that if I want to describe a current

243
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,067
over this particular,
let's say, sodium path

244
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:03,939
I am doing the following.

245
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,139
I'm writting now the current

246
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:10,107
for the sodium current
and this is here

247
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,303
so I sodium

248
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:19,889
is actually G sodium

249
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:25,892
multiplied by V,
which is the voltage drop

250
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:29,084
across the membrane
minus the battery

251
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:33,268
of this particular ion.

252
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,102
So this is very simple to understand
because across this battery

253
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,639
there is membrane voltage,
so the difference between

254
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,283
inside and outside,
the voltage difference is here

255
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:55,579
and this voltage difference
is multiplied by the conductance

256
00:16:56,361 --> 00:17:00,474
one over the resistance
of this particular resistance

257
00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:02,701
for this conductance for this ion

258
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:05,901
and this will give you the current,
the sodium current that flows

259
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:09,195
across this branch.

260
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,416
This will be true for all the ions

261
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:14,582
So I could write another
equation similar to that

262
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,844
for the potassium and
for the chloride

263
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:21,901
and because I want all the sum
of all equations to be zero,

264
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,985
then I get if I just do that,
and write I_Na like this

265
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:30,527
And I_K like this, and so forth

266
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:33,728
and you sum them up
and you equate them to zero

267
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:39,140
you will get that the resting
potential, then the voltage at rest

268
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:50,975
without any stimulation is
equal to G_Na multiplied by E_Na

269
00:17:53,194 --> 00:18:01,106
plus G_K multiplied by E_K,
a Nernst potential for the potassium

270
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:07,027
plus G_Cl multiplied by E_Cl

271
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:14,423
divided by G_Na plus G_K

272
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:17,804
plus G_Cl

273
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:26,322
which is in neurons typically
something like -70mV.

274
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,058
So this is very interesting

275
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:36,627
What I just showed you just using
the numbers before that came from

276
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:40,612
the Nernst equation
and using this equation here

277
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:45,842
to describe current flow of one
branch and then over another branch

278
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,671
over the third branch

279
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,040
assuming that these other three
current, only the three ions

280
00:18:51,282 --> 00:18:53,720
that determine the voltage
across the membrane

281
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,370
I now neglecting completely
the capacitance

282
00:18:56,628 --> 00:19:01,128
because there is no voltage change
so there is no capacitance current

283
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:08,061
then I get this equation which is
called the conductance equation

284
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:14,336
which really describes
the voltage across the membrane

285
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,550
of a neuron at rest.

286
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,548
The resting potential.

287
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:21,753
Sometimes it is
called E-rest of V-rest.

288
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:26,707
And I just told you that
it is -70mV inside the cell.

289
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:30,898
this means that at rest,
without doing anything

290
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:34,719
before you get a spike,
before you get a synaptic potential

291
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,846
just at rest.

292
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,433
When all of the currents balance
each other you get net current

293
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:48,316
so there is no voltage change,
the inside of the cell is about 70mV

294
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:52,265
more negative compared
to the outside of the cell.

295
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:56,846
So neurons sits because
of this gradiance

296
00:19:57,051 --> 00:20:00,613
of concentration of
the three ions that I mentioned

297
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:06,697
all the neurons in the world,
sit in a negative potential

298
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,213
inside versus outside,
and this is the reference potential

299
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:12,953
for all the rest of the potentials

300
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:15,567
for all the rest of the electrical activity

301
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:16,717
that I will speaking about.

302
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:21,366
So if I speak about the spike,
it will start from -70mV

303
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:24,215
and then jump to
the positive direction.

304
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:26,096
If I will speak about
the synaptic potential

305
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:30,337
they will start from -70mV,
they could be more positive

306
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:34,147
or more negative,
but all relative to -70mV.

307
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:39,554
So this -70, this 

308
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:42,988
the resting potential is really 
the baseline, the reference potential

309
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,327
for all other development
of other types of signals

310
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:48,203
the spikes
and the synaptic potential.

311
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:54,846
So this is really the essence
of the electrical basis

312
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:58,272
for neuronal activity.

313
00:20:58,664 --> 00:21:01,601
And maybe I will end
by saying the following

314
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:04,067
this part I will end
by saying the following

315
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:08,083
that the trick of neurons,
really the trick of neurons

316
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:12,415
is to be able to change
the conductances very fast 

317
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:16,812
so if I could change
the potassium conductance very fast

318
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:20,396
I will get a more negative
potential inside

319
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,295
because of this negativity here.

320
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,806
If I succeed to change
the sodium conductance very fast

321
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:32,718
I will get a more
positive voltage inside.

322
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:35,919
That's the trick of neurons,
the fast trick of neurons

323
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:40,864
to change potentials,
both synaptic and spiking

324
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:44,068
by changing these conductances.

325
00:21:45,184 --> 00:21:47,704
But what makes these conductances change

326
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,932
that's the trick of
the membrane of the neurons

327
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:53,720
which is very unique
and this is of course

328
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:59,434
the next thing to explain to you
what is the origin of the capability

329
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:03,262
of the conductances of
the membrane to change

330
00:22:03,436 --> 00:22:07,711
and thus generate new voltages,
different voltages

331
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:10,928
the synaptic potentials
and the spiking potentials.

332
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:14,741
So let me summarize
this introductory part

333
00:22:14,937 --> 00:22:18,462
to the electrical
activity of neurons

334
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:21,649
I just said that
the membrane ion channels

335
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,769
the membrane ion channels

336
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:29,600
are the poles are
the conductances when open

337
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:34,765
that enable the flow of currents
from the inside to the outside

338
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:36,896
or from the outside to the inside

339
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,455
across the membrane.

340
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:42,577
And I told you that the three
key ions that play a role

341
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:46,930
in determining the potential
of the membranes

342
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:49,644
of biological membranes,
of neuronal membrane

343
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,848
are the sodium,
the potassium, and the chloride.

344
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:56,276
There are other ions,
for example the calcium

345
00:22:56,302 --> 00:22:58,502
but for the resting
potential at least

346
00:22:58,683 --> 00:23:01,683
these are the three
most important ions.

347
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:08,302
And what really makes this
difference of concentration in ions

348
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,973
enable to generate voltage

349
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:13,410
is their capability to cross the membrane

350
00:23:13,614 --> 00:23:19,439
and this gradient of voltage skeptured 
by the Nernst equation

351
00:23:19,655 --> 00:23:23,655
as a battery, so I can speak about
the three batteries that determine

352
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:28,185
the overall voltage at rest
and also for other potentials.

353
00:23:28,385 --> 00:23:32,187
We saw the ENA,
the battery of the sodium,

354
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:36,521
the Nernst potential for sodium,
the battery for the potassium,

355
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,685
and the battery for the chloride.

356
00:23:39,006 --> 00:23:42,381
And I showed in this conductance
equation that overall you have

357
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,952
some kind of a balance between
the three batteries and their

358
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,638
corresponding conductances.

359
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:54,394
So the conductance of the branch
that has the conductance

360
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:57,802
of the sodium and its batery,

361
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:01,015
the branch that has the potassium
conductance and its battery

362
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:03,131
and the chloride conductance
and its battery

363
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:06,314
the combined equation,
which is the conductance equation

364
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,720
determines the end result
of the resting potential.

365
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:15,741
I showed you that the resting potential,
the typical neuron is around -70mV

366
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:18,933
negative inside compared
to the outside,

367
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:23,544
which by the way means
that the dominant conductance

368
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:28,448
at rest is the potassium conductance,
and the chloride as well,

369
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:32,464
but the potassium conductance
really determines mostly

370
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:36,186
the resting potential because
it is the potassium conductance

371
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,718
which is associated with

372
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,606
a negative battery
of the potassium

373
00:24:40,832 --> 00:24:43,182
it is the one that is the most dominant

374
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:49,933
meaning that at rest,
the sodium is not very conductive

375
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,057
otherwise its battery would
influence the resting potential

376
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,557
and it would be more positive,

377
00:24:55,905 --> 00:25:00,380
but because the sodium
channels are closed at rest

378
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:04,747
the battery of the potassium
is the dominant battery that

379
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,644
determines the resting potential
to a large extent and also

380
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:13,093
we shall see later,
and I just mentioned it at the end

381
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,125
that every electrical activity at least
the fast one like the spike

382
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:19,346
and the synaptic potentials

383
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:24,225
are the result of the changing
of the conductances

384
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,530
these three conductances
that I mentioned,

385
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:28,502
a fast change in the conductance

386
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:31,304
will change the balance
of the batteries or the contribution

387
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:32,807
of the different batteries.

388
00:25:33,027 --> 00:25:37,002
For example if I enable
a change of the sodium conductance

389
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:41,435
G_Na if it becomes big suddenly,
much conductance

390
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,377
many ion channels are open for sodium

391
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:46,394
then it's battery will
become dominant

392
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:47,916
and the resting potentiel

393
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:50,693
will move positively,

394
00:25:50,943 --> 00:25:52,666
to something more positive.

395
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:56,966
And if the potassium
channels are very dominant

396
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:00,119
the value will go more negative
than the resting potential

397
00:26:00,452 --> 00:26:06,165
towards minus 80 or 82 or 85
of the potassium battery.

398
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:08,321
So this is the game of neurons:

399
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:11,944
in order to generate
electrical activity

400
00:26:12,152 --> 00:26:15,002
that will somehow find ways,
and we should talk about

401
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:18,824
the two ways that do it,
to generate the spike

402
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:23,582
or to generate synaptic potentials
using conductance change

403
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,378
of these three ions
that we spoke about.
