So now we are trying to acquainted ourselves very briefly with the nerve cell, with a neuron.
So, of course one cannot speak about neurons without speaking about these two great geniuses:
Ramon y Cajal, Spaniard, and Camillo Golgi, the Italian both got a Nobel prize in 1906 as you can see here for recognizing the structure of neurons.
They really developed methods and used the microscope in order to recognize to decipher who are these building blocks of the nervous system?
Who are these neurons?
By the way, the term neuron came later and they did not invent these nerve cells.
So, you can see here a particular type of nerve cell we call it pukinji cell from one region of the brain, from the cerebellum and you can see Ramon y Cajal was a really good drawer a painter, an artist, you can see here a retina where it also has nerve cells and you can see another region here which is a cortex, which is another type of nerve cells.
All really look like trees, sophisticated trees we shall talk about the particular structure in a second but you can see that every region in the nervous system, it doesnâ€™t matter if you look at the retina or at the cortex, or dip inside the brain a simple animal, a slug, a mouse, a monkey an elephant, a human... is built from these elementary building blocks.
So morphologically they are very beautiful they look like trees, we shall later, of course, try to understand the electrical properties of these cells, but now I am only talking about the structure of these cells.
And Ramon y Cajal was in some sense a visionary, in many senses visionary, and, just by looking at the anatomy as you can see here a drawing, he was speculating that there is a signal or signals that run through this anatomy, as you can see here a drawing, he was speculating that there is a signal or signals that run through this anatomy, here is one signal denoted by an arrow so this is a Ramon y Cajal arrow here, and he wants to say that his part of the neuron which is call an axon, yes, this part of the neuron, which is called axon, there are signals running in a sort of speak in this direction, and then somehow and Ramon y Cajal had no idea how the signal from the axon jumps, sort of speak transferred here in the dendritic tree of the next neuron.
So, I just mentioned two parts of the neuron.
The axon, which is the output device of neurons, and we know today thatâ€™s the case indeed, and the dendritic tree you see the more darker part here that receives input from the axon somehow and then the signal continues to flow this red arrow continues to flow until it reaches this region in the axon of this cell number
B and from this axon there is somehow another jump or connection through this arrow into the dendrites of cell C.
So Ramon y Cajal envisioned some signal flow that flow from the axon into the dendrites and from the dendrites back into the axon of the cell where the dendrites belong to it.
So we already said that neuron is built from the dendritic tree
I will mention it a lot of times a cell body and an axon.
So these are the three parts of the neuron that we shall discuss later on, but already Ramon Y Cajal just by seeing the morphology thought that there must be some kind of signals running on top of this particular anatomy.
And we know today, and I will convince you later that indeed axons are the sending the output device of neurons and the dendrites are the input receiving devices of the neuron and I will show you that actually the input is actually the one signal: the synaptic potential, and the output is another signal: the action potential, or the spike.
Ramon y Cajal noticed something with his primitive microscope: he was already able to see that if you zoom into the dendritic tree here of a cell, by the way he used to call this particular cell which is the majority of the cell type in our cortex in the mammalian cortex itâ€™s called the pyramidal cell.
In this particular cell, when you zoom in into the dendrites you see here a little branch taken from this region of the tree and if you look very carefully you will see that this branch is built from these little protrusions, these little branchlets, very small branchlets something of the order of the thousandth of a millimeter a micrometer long and these are called the dendritic spines.
I will show you later that these dendritic spines are the site for synaptic connection between the axon and the dendrite.
So, Ramon y Cajal already saw more than a hundred years ago, that actually which is a nice and sad story that in his death bed Ramon y Cajal just before he died he drew spines in a little notebook and he wrote down that we must pay attention future scientists should pay attention to these little spines because they are very important, they must have a very important function and we shall show you later that he was absolutely right.
So, remember, the neuron is built from dendrites cell body, axons, and dendrites of some cell types have these little protrusions that we call dendritic spines.
And indeed, if you look at many cell types you can see the dendritic spines on this piece of the dendrite or on this piece of the dendrite on this piece of the dendrite and here you see, by the way a very nice example of an axon, so this is an axon here sorry, this is an axon, coming very close but of course, we donâ€™t know if it makes or doesnâ€™t make a connection with this dendrite.
I will show later that the connection is on the spines in this particular case.
So dendritic spines are very important.
Not all the cells have spines so there are spiny nerve cells and smooth nerve cells, so the dendritic tree does not have these spines, but weâ€™re not going to talk about this detail this is just to show you that the dendritic spines are very important for some types of cells especially these pyramidal cells which Ramon y Cajal liked to call psychic cells because he believed we are psychic, psychological behaving people and that this cell is a part of this capability of us to be psychological behavioral, emotional, and so forth.
Just to give you some numbers just dimensions, average dimensions, of course there are big nerve cells small nerve cells, long axons, short axons, and so forth but just a â€œball parkâ€�, just a region so if you ask what is the total length of dendrites so this is a branched tree and letâ€™s say if I take this tree and make one long wire out of it it will be on the order of something like
10 to 15mm long totally.
But of course, from the body to the dendrite tip is one millimeter, but because there are all these branches, it becomes long.
The total area of dendrite is something of this order
20000 micrometers squared, in terms of the of the area of the dendrites, you have on a spiny neuron like the pyramidal cell,
I showed you here on the left something of the order of in humans we have sometimes
30000 spines per single neuron.
The dimension of the spine is on the order of one square micrometer there about 10000 synaptic inputs connections into a single neuron.
So, if Iâ€™m a single neuron,
I am receiving on my dendrites something of the order of 10000 synapses, connections, and we shall see how to model these synapses soon and the axon could be a very long process connected this region to the brain to this region with a single cell and it can be also something very local.
So, it could go from a few millimeters or less locally to a very long few centimeter long.
So, this is just ballpark dimensions, just for the introduction so that you will know intimately more intimately the structure of the neuron.
This is one beautiful example, itâ€™s coming from Spain from a group there headed by Xavier de Felipe in Madrid reconstructing human neurons.
So, you can see that the neurons
I showed you before from
Ramon y Cajal and Golgi came from many animals it was a mouse, and a fly, and other types of animals that they reconstructed neurons from.
Hereâ€™s is an example of a neuron from a human.
So, this is a pyramidal cell, all this is a pyramidal cell from a human cortex post mortem, and here on the left you can see a piece of a dendrite taking somewhere from here, or from here some locally and you can see that this dendrite like I showed you before for mouse, rat, and so forth also have these dendritic spines.
So, look at this one for example.
Itâ€™s a dendritic spine, itâ€™s dendritic spine.
Many, many dendritic spies, as I said before in human it could range up until 30000, 25000 spines and each of these spines receive an input a synaptic input from a nearby axon of another cell.
Just to show you that a neuron is a neuron in general it has soma, it has dendrites, a cell body and then whatâ€™s an axon and in many cases for their spiny neurons the dendrites are absolutely covered by these little protrusions these dendritic spines they are very, very important for the generation and the connection between... the generation of the synaptic potential and the connection between one nerve to the other.
Just before summarizing the neuron introduction the structure aspect of the neuron you can see now a reconstructed neuron whereby you see the dendritic tree in green so this is the dendritic tree here, the green part, you can see the axonal branching so the axons is really branch, and branch, hereâ€™s a local branching of this axon coming from the same cell, so the axon comes up and then branch, branch, branch and occupies all this region, itâ€™s an axonal tree and in this axonal tree you see many, many many white dots, white spots.
These are called axonal boutons
I will show you later that this is the pre-synaptic side in the axon where the transmitter is located in these boutons and this transmitter, which is a chemical, is the element that enables the communication, which is in this case chemical, between the axon of one cell to the dendrite of another cell.
Just to summarize, a neuron is a really sophisticated, also structurally, but later we shall see also that physiologically, electrically, very sophisticated electrical and morphological element it is in a branching structure, both the dendrites which are more local, and the axons which could be very global, and go elsewhere between one region to another or from my brain, the motor region into my foot a long axon, but you can see that this is a very complicated structure and on the top of this complicated structure this structure knows how to generate electrical signals and propagate these signals from one region to another and connect through these signals one cell to the other.
So here it is.
The structural aspect of the neuron.
