1
00:00:05,811 --> 00:00:08,449
In this lecture, we're going
to have a look at how

2
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:11,544
to design practically, a domain.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,632
And more particularly,  we're going
to have a look at the acquisition

4
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:19,545
of electrophysiology data, 
and morphology reconstruction

5
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:21,095
for a given neuron.

6
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:23,832
So, as part of this lecture

7
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:27,295
we're going to have a more detailed 
look into the use case

8
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:28,995
we're going to model.

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,520
We're going to go through 
the steps of...

10
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:36,712
an interview with a scientist
that explains

11
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,883
what they've been doing
in the lab.

12
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:43,408
And then with another scientist that
expresses the type of question

13
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:46,870
we would like to be able to answer
through the use of the platform

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,258
once the data has been integrated.

15
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:53,765
Then, we're going to go through
the steps of designing a model,

16
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:57,503
both in defining the provenance
patterns

17
00:00:57,703 --> 00:01:01,453
that essentially defines the domain
we're going to design.

18
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:05,653
And then into the specifics of
the entities we're going to create.

19
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:09,503
Finally, we're going to have
a look at the provenance editor

20
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,303
which is a tool you're going
to be using in a graded exercise

21
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:13,712
this week.

22
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:17,218
So here, at the top of the page,
you can see information

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,407
of the specimen that has been used
to capture the information.

24
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:26,442
In this case, it is a mouse line.

25
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:31,417
And you can see the type of neuron
that has been recorded,

26
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:36,442
and the part that really interests 
us here is this data captured.

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,215
Here, you can see that there's
a number of stimuli

28
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:44,527
that have been applied

29
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:48,202
to this neuron in order to record
its electric response.

30
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:51,590
And here we will stick with
the long square one.

31
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:57,402
On the top part of the screen, 
you can see the specific stimuli,

32
00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:00,582
and at the bottom you can see
how the cell responded.

33
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:04,645
So here on the screen 
as it is now, we have

34
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:08,795
all the sequential

35
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:12,170
sweeps that have been applied
with the specific stimuli

36
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,620
to this one neuron.

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,557
What you can then do is to pick
the sweeps one by one

38
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:20,057
and really look at what the specific
stimulation was like,

39
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:22,207
and how the neuron really reacted.

40
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:23,982
And as you flick through them
one by one,

41
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,622
you can see that the intensity
of the stimulation does increase

42
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:33,882
all the way to the neuron 
actually responding

43
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:35,557
to the stimulation.

44
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,248
And, the higher we get, the stronger
the stimulation gets.

45
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:44,968
So this is typically used
also in the lab

46
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:48,618
to identify what is called the real
base of a neuron

47
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:53,518
which is really the thresh hold above 
which the neuron starts responding

48
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:55,518
with spikes.

49
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:00,746
So next, we'll have a brief look at 
what these morphology reconstructions

50
00:03:01,652 --> 00:03:04,652
look like. So I'm going to
now open again this

51
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:08,207
webpage. I have left here
the url

52
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:11,407
for the Allen Institute website,

53
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,279
where you can actually
look at this data.

54
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,167
And this is not really data 
integrated now in our platform

55
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:20,979
but we're going to work
through the steps of doing it.

56
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:23,798
So let's have a look
at this page.

57
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,613
So here, essentially, is 
the morphological reconstruction

58
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:30,725
of the very same neuron.

59
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:34,925
And so, on the left hand side,

60
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,013
we can see that

61
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:41,831
we have the actual
digital captures

62
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:45,031
of the slice, of the neuron
in the slice

63
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:48,231
as it was done in the lab.

64
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:51,284
And so using these

65
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:52,846
images, 

66
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:56,966
someone has actually retraced
the neuron by hand

67
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,841
and recreated a 
3D representation of it.

68
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:03,062
So if I put it back
in it's original shape

69
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:06,012
you can really see here...

70
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:08,889
You can really easily 
match the shape.

71
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:12,089
It is the same representation.
This one is really the original image,

72
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:15,227
and this one is a reconstructed 
one done by 

73
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:18,477
a scientist in the lab.

74
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,133
So these are the two data sets
we're going to

75
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,379
try to integrate into our platform.
And to do so, 

76
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:29,579
we're going to design
a domain

77
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,141
to capture enough information.

78
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:36,865
So in this part, we're going to
pretend to have an interview

79
00:04:37,065 --> 00:04:39,165
with a scientist to discuss

80
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:40,965
the origin of the data.

81
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,653
So we have our scientist
depicted here on the left,

82
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:48,910
and right next to it, I'm going
to show you the summary sentences

83
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,198
of a discussion we've had
with this scientist.

84
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:55,521
And on the bottom part,

85
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:59,196
I'm going to show the provenance
pattern we are inferring

86
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:02,821
from the statements the scientist
is giving us.

87
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:05,684
So the first statement is that
the experiment was done on a rat

88
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:07,946
of the strain Wistar Han.

89
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:10,971
And it was aged p14, 
post natal 14 days.

90
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:14,042
And so quite logically,

91
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:17,483
it leads us to creating an entity

92
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:20,170
which for now I will
call a rat,

93
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:25,577
that allows us to store the 
information such as the species,

94
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:29,127
the strain and the age
of the subject.

95
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:31,643
So, next.

96
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,991
The scientist is telling us that,

97
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:39,070
they have recorded several
characteristics

98
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,158
of single neurons.

99
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,395
Just going to do this one.

100
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:49,289
So next, the scientist 
tell us that

101
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:52,689
they have recorded several 
characteristics of single neurons.

102
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:56,314
So, quite naturally,  we are
going to create

103
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:59,633
a neuron entity which
self derives

104
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,920
from the rat,

105
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:05,453
on which we're going to be able
later on to

106
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:07,603
store these characteristics.

107
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:11,364
The next fact is that

108
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:15,160
recorded electrophysiology
of a single neuron has been done

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,910
and raw data has been captured.

110
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,510
So, again, we can derive an electrophysiology
recording from that neuron,

111
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:24,995
and we can indicate here

112
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:30,045
that raw data has to be attached
to this data set.

113
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:34,727
Next,

114
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,304
they have reconstructed that
morphology of that very same neuron.

115
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:42,016
And same neuron here is quite 
important because

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,597
from the provenance pattern, it means
that from the very same neuron,

117
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:49,660
the same entity derives 
both electrophysiology

118
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,374
and a morphology reconstruction

119
00:06:52,574 --> 00:06:55,274
which also has raw data attached.

120
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:56,774
So far, so good.

121
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,604
Last thing, is that classification
of the neurons

122
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,642
has been made based
on recorded data.

123
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:07,388
And these classifications are
of two types:

124
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:08,959
electric type,

125
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,567
and we have been informed that an
ontology already exists for it,

126
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,682
and we'll also give it
a morphology type.

127
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:18,644
And there again we have an
ontology pre existing.

128
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:22,247
So we take note of it, and we know
we're going to try to integrate with it

129
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:23,734
at a later stage.
