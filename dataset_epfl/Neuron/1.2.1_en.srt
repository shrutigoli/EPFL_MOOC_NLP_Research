1
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:06,782
Okay.

2
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:10,039
In the last lectures,

3
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:13,771
we learned a little bit about
what is simulation neuroscience,

4
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:17,537
the rationale behind it, some
of the principles on which it is based

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,895
and some of the caveats 
to keep in mind.

6
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:25,992
And in this lecture,

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,487
we are going to look at how
we study single neurons,

8
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,765
how we profile the morphologies

9
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:37,600
and how we profile
the electrophysiological properties

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,346
of the neurons.

11
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,168
So, this is an example

12
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:46,376
of an experimental lab

13
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:50,561
that tries to reverse-engineer
or experimentally study

14
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,251
the micro-circuitry,

15
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,306
individual neurons,
synaptic connections

16
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:58,761
and how the micro circuit
is put together.

17
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,508
So there are a number
of components here.

18
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:06,087
You have what is called...

19
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:11,153
..an infrared differential
interference contrast microscope.

20
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:15,811
It is basically a clever trick
you can look it up on the internet.

21
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:19,344
It is a clever trick to get
very high depth view

22
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:23,482
into the tissue.

23
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:28,266
So, it just cleans up some
of the optical noise,

24
00:01:28,809 --> 00:01:30,593
but it is a beautiful technique

25
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:33,544
that was developed
by Hans-Ulrich Dodt

26
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,755
and really pioneered
in Bert Sakmann's lab in Heidelberg.

27
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:42,266
We were all postdocs there at the time

28
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:47,352
and we started doing
a lot of experiments using this

29
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:51,108
kind of microscope, because
it gave us an unprecedented access

30
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:53,537
and view into the neural tissue.

31
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,125
There are these manipulators

32
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:02,589
that will bring electrodes
down into the tissue

33
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,530
that is under the microscope.

34
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,718
It is all controlled by pads

35
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:13,307
and in fact, we even have a setup
which we call fly patching,

36
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:15,606
because it is all done
as a sort of remote cockpit

37
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:18,472
that controls
all of these electrodes.

38
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:24,651
You have amplifiers
that amplify the electrical signal

39
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,459
and you have a number of...

40
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:30,882
you can put imaging
techniques as well.

41
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:34,807
These are controlling
the manipulators,

42
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,613
but you can also
have imaging techniques,

43
00:02:37,813 --> 00:02:41,525
so you can look at fluorescence
or any other kinds of images.

44
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:45,885
It is just another example of lots
of pipettes,

45
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:48,333
the sort of record is 12,

46
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,412
you can only record
12 neurons at a time.

47
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:54,311
It is very few when you think
about the whole brain,

48
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:57,085
but you get very
high resolution recordings.

49
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:00,885
This is a movie that basically just

50
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,220
gives you a little bit more
of a perspective of...

51
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,905
..what the setup looks like

52
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:11,978
and here is a movie that shows you

53
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,800
what patch-clamping is.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,926
This is a glass pipette.

55
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:21,817
The tip is about a micron in diameter
or a little bit bigger

56
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:25,533
and it approaches this neuron

57
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:29,085
and you can see,
it is patching the cell.

58
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:31,876
Now what that means
is that if you have a cell,

59
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:34,062
you come in with a pipette

60
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:35,729
and you come closer,

61
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:39,571
you actually blow...
you put pressure at the back,

62
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:43,335
so it blows solution out from the tip

63
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,923
and it cleans the membrane,

64
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:53,438
so you can actually get
the glass patching onto the cell

65
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,750
and the secret of patch-clamp

66
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,791
which was discovered by...

67
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:06,678
..Hamill and Bert Sakmann
and Erwin Neher,

68
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,038
and they won the Nobel prize for this,

69
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:11,362
is that it forms a gigaseal here,

70
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:13,894
so very high resistance.

71
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:17,804
It is very high resistance
between here,

72
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,112
so the current will not leak

73
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,304
out of here and it means
that you can break this membrane

74
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:26,703
and what you end up with is...

75
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:30,875
..your electrical recording here that

76
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,617
you can then measure
the voltage inside

77
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,983
and as you should know, these
are basic things you should know,

78
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:43,884
inside is negative
compared to the outside,

79
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:47,089
so this is typically about
minus 60 millivolts

80
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:51,187
and then you can see fluctuations
in this voltage.

81
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:55,639
So this is called
whole-cell patch-clamp.

82
00:04:56,515 --> 00:04:58,271
Whole-cell patch-clamp,

83
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:01,775
and there are of course
other configurations

84
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,866
that you can also do to get
a piece of the membrane and so on,

85
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,770
but I won't go into that.

86
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,567
So this is whole-cell patch-clamp
and it gives us

87
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,692
access to a single neuron

88
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:18,671
and with this access
you can inject a dye into it

89
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,724
and here is a movie just showing you

90
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:26,487
what that cell looks like after
we have injected a dye into that cell

91
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:30,247
and stained it like developing
a photograph

92
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:34,188
and then you get a full picture of...

93
00:05:34,388 --> 00:05:37,062
..what that morphology
of that neuron looks like.

94
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:41,625
You can also inject
fluorescent dyes into it.

95
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:47,340
You can inject calcium sensitive dyes,

96
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,871
you can do lots of different things,
injecting all kinds of chemicals

97
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:55,911
and experimental agents into cells

98
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:58,401
and then you can see them.

99
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:01,188
You can of course also record
from the dendrites,

100
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:05,477
you can record from the cell body,
you can record from the axon

101
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:08,363
and there are many studies

102
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:13,586
that you can look up about this,
because a lot of these studies are used

103
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:15,279
in the reconstruction.

104
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:20,897
And that allows you to really
get a very high resolution view

105
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:24,611
of nudges, the morphology,
but also the electrical behavior

106
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:27,123
of a neuron at the cell body
in the dendrites

107
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:30,886
or in the axon.
These are axons going down.

108
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,874
The sort of repertoire
that you can play out here

109
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:39,069
as you obtain a whole-cell,
this is a whole-cell patch clamp here,

110
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:41,808
the pipette is coming in here too.

111
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:44,808
It has broken the membrane.
You have a gigaseal,

112
00:06:46,394 --> 00:06:48,955
so you can record from the cell

113
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:50,957
and this is what
an electrical behavior

114
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:55,188
will give a pulse, if you give it
a step current pulse into the cell

115
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,757
and the cell will react by
producing action potentials.

116
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:02,143
It is producing one
and then a burst of action potentials.

117
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:06,393
It stops and then there is
another burst of action potentials

118
00:07:06,797 --> 00:07:09,987
and this, I will show you 
how we profile this,

119
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,759
so that you can...
you do a lot of testing

120
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,118
to find out how does the neuron react
to electrical current that comes in.

121
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:22,823
You can also suck out some of the...
we call it cytoplasm harvesting

122
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:25,757
where you take out
some of the juice,

123
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:28,027
the cytoplasm
from inside the cell

124
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,965
and you do...

125
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:35,092
you isolate the RNA,
the messenger RNA.

126
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,729
You can convert that to cDNA

127
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:41,863
in a process
called reverse transcription

128
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:46,734
and then you get cDNA
and then you can fish.

129
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:51,073
You put in little probes
with sequences of specific genes

130
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:54,481
and you can fish out different genes.

131
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:57,599
You can ask yourself
"I want to find out,

132
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:02,369
if gene X, this purple one,
is inside the cell".

133
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:06,145
You make a specific gene sequence

134
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:08,458
and you send in this probe

135
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:14,995
and it tells you whether
this purple gene is inside this cell

136
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:19,090
using a process
we call multiplex PCR

137
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:22,994
and today there
are many more approaches

138
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:26,927
to find out which genes
are expressed inside a cell.

139
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:31,331
You can load the cell with a dye
as I said before

140
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:34,588
and then under a microscope,
you can reconstruct it

141
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:36,722
and here in red you see the...

142
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:39,755
in red you see the dendrites

143
00:08:40,643 --> 00:08:41,939
going in different places.

144
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,100
You draw this in three dimensions

145
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,811
under a 3-D microscope
with an XYZ stage.

146
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:51,607
So, you are actually tracing it in 3D

147
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,410
and then you can also trace the axon

148
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,829
and that gives you
the axonal hover of the neuron.

149
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:02,153
You have to do this for many cells.
They take a long time.

150
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:05,349
It takes a week or so
or a few days at least

151
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,925
to draw, trace one cell in 3D,

152
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,764
so you have got
a digital model of the cell

153
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:16,781
and in our case, you know,

154
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,740
we have about a thousand
of these cells reconstructed

155
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,421
which is not,
as I said in the first stage,

156
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:27,129
it is still sparse data,
but that took 20 years to obtain,

157
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:31,462
so you have to find other ways
to build up your data set.

158
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,696
This is just an example

159
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:39,609
where you can see
the genes, the bands.

160
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,702
There are techniques that you
can use to see which genes...

161
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:45,440
These are ion channel genes.

162
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,264
Names of different
ion channel genes

163
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:51,732
and it tells you whether
these ion channels

164
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:55,496
are the gene that they must
switched on inside the cell.

165
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:59,862
So this gives you a genetic profile
or a molecular profile.

166
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:02,043
This is an ion channel profile.

167
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:05,048
You can also look at
calcium binding proteins

168
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,914
or neuro peptides

169
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:15,467
so that you can actually identify
the molecular profile of the cell.

170
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,859
So, this is what you can
do all in a single cell.

171
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,540
You basically get its electrical
profile, morphological profile

172
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,550
and a molecular profile.
