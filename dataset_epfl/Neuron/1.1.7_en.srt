1
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:07,712
Let's look at the informatics
strategies

2
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:12,707
that we use or the principles
of informatics.

3
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:17,576
And as I said earlier
neuroinformatics is probably

4
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:20,776
one of the most challenging
informatics

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:26,003
sciences there are because of the data
heterogeneity, the complexity,

6
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:29,065
the lack of standardization,
the uncertainty,

7
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:33,027
different formats, there are many
many problems

8
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,061
in trying to database the brain.

9
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:42,677
What is very important when
you look at neuroscience data

10
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:46,000
from a simulation neuroscience
perspective

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,560
is that, and you will learn this
more and more as we go further,

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,829
is that all data is good.

13
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:54,599
There is actually no such thing
as bad data.

14
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,514
There is wrong data, there is a lot
of wrong data,

15
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:58,540
In fact, most of the data is wrong.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,088
But all data is good
for reconstruction.

17
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:04,783
Even bad data, even wrong data
that says: "Look, you know,

18
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,983
this is just a wrong experiment".

19
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,486
When you have wrong data,
it actually helps you understand

20
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:12,785
better what is a right data.

21
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:19,116
So, what we try to do
is to build an infrastructure

22
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:22,589
and Sean here is going to give
you a series of lectures on this,

23
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:27,201
we build an infrastructure
that allows us to compare

24
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:30,160
experimental data with
simulation data.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,797
Because that is how we test
and validate the reconstructions.

26
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:38,711
So, you have experiments
and your simulations

27
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:42,453
and we try to make them
as equivalent as possible.

28
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:45,953
And then we want to informatically
map them in a way

29
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:49,328
that we can also compare
them as well, as much as possible.

30
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:53,454
So you want to easily be able
to compare experimental data

31
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:56,654
with simulation data.

32
00:01:56,895 --> 00:02:00,524
You need access to all the data,
all the papers that is out there.

33
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:04,050
There are around 10 million papers
that are relevant

34
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,250
to understanding the brain, not all
directly on the brain

35
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,449
but are relevant to understanding the brain.

36
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:13,364
In some form you want to get
all those papers,

37
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:16,838
you want to mine them for little
nuggets of knowledge

38
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:22,648
that may be used, that you could use
on the experiment side

39
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:27,001
so that at some point you can use
them to validate your reconstruction.

40
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:31,199
So, you want to find all the papers
and associated data.

41
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:38,790
The open access and open data
policies are extremely important

42
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,919
if we want to be able to move
towards simulating the brain,

43
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,588
simulating the heart, liver,
or any part of the body

44
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:49,738
or simulating diseases.

45
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:53,646
It is essential that data
and papers are open.

46
00:02:55,846 --> 00:03:00,545
You want to organize them,
so you have got to create knowledge graphs

47
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:04,660
knowledge spaces, so that you can
mine and analyze this data easily

48
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,034
and ultimately, you actually want to
map them onto an atlas.

49
00:03:09,338 --> 00:03:13,783
So that you can navigate
in the kind of coordinate space

50
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:15,513
that the brain is.

51
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:18,827
You want to navigate through
to different part of the brain

52
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:21,479
and you want to say: "What do
I know about it?

53
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,885
What are all the papers, what
is all the data?"

54
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:28,713
And then I can see experimental
data and I can see simulation data.

55
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:30,250
And I can compare.

56
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:33,033
And I can see how close
is the simulation data

57
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,750
getting to the real data.

58
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:42,967
So, this is the general approach
to informatics or neuroinformatics

59
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,579
that we use.

60
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,950
And again, the principle
is: get all the data.

61
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,957
Wrong data actually helps
in some ways

62
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:59,110
to be able to find out
and understand what is right data.

63
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,240
And I will give you many examples

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,440
of this as we go on
in the next lectures.
