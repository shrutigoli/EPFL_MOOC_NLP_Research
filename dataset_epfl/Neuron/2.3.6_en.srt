1
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:09,808
So to conclude, you have learned
a number of things in this session.

2
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:14,075
First we've looked at the challenges
of data integration in neuro science

3
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:18,255
and a number of approaches
to address them.

4
00:00:18,463 --> 00:00:21,263
We've looked at different
ways to run data integration.

5
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:23,744
There are different
models you can use.

6
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:28,123
It's the fixed data model,
which has some limitations

7
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:30,695
that have been
issues in the past.

8
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,559
We have the user control,
the main design that really gives

9
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:35,695
the full flexibility
to the scientist

10
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:37,605
to really design their model

11
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:41,857
and really capture precisely
the domain they are working on

12
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:46,244
but also we have seen the power
in reusing existing domains

13
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:49,161
and vocabularies
to support your efforts

14
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:51,325
and make your data integration

15
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:54,536
compatible with
the rest of the communities.

16
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:57,926
Finally, we've looked at
the Blue Brain Nexus capabilities

17
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:00,389
and how it enables
data integration.

18
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:02,725
There were several aspects to this.

19
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:07,471
The ability to have an expert
designing their own model

20
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:12,137
to reuse existing domains,
to publish and search data

21
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:15,898
and finally to discover
new data sets

22
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:20,591
that are similar or related
to those you know.
