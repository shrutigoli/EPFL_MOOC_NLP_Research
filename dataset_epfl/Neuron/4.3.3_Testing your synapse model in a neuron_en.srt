1
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:08,415
Now to test our synapse model,
we need to create a neuron

2
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,454
to host our synapse.

3
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:13,865
Following previous exercises
we will create a single compartment

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:17,059
soma neuron
to host the synapse.

5
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:22,137
We start by creating a section
object defining its length,

6
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:26,616
diameter, and inserting
passive membrane properties

7
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:31,440
and we configure the biophysics,
that is the axonal resistance

8
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:35,989
and capacitance for each section.

9
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:41,708
Next we can create the synapse at
the center of the soma compartment.

10
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:44,341
Because the mechanisms
have been loaded

11
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:50,904
this simple AMPA and NMDA name
is now a part of the "h" name space.

12
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:55,758
We can create our synapse model
onto the soma at the center

13
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:57,704
using this command.

14
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:00,958
This results in the synapse object.

15
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:04,666
Now, let's define a stimulus
for our synapse.

16
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:09,821
Here we're going to define 8 spikes
at 20Hz starting at 100ms

17
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:13,590
plus one last spike
500ms later.

18
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:16,462
To this end, we will create
the simulator variable.

19
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:19,374
It is an instance of
a "vectstim" object

20
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:25,318
which is a mechanism which was
defined in the vecevent.mod file

21
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:28,829
along side synapse.mod file
we've just defined.

22
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:33,008
This mechanism is a standard
mechanism for NEURON

23
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:34,497
that allows you to define

24
00:01:34,669 --> 00:01:38,257
the lists of spike times to
be played back to synapses.

25
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:43,320
To use this mechanism,
we define a list of spike times

26
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:48,772
here at 100ms, 150ms, 200ms,
and so on

27
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,921
as described above.

28
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:55,126
We create a "hoc" vector
of these spike times

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,203
and we invoke the play
command of the "vecstim" object

30
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,412
on this vector.

31
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:06,886
Next, we create a "netcon" object,
as you've seen in previous tutorials

32
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:10,059
connecting the simulator
to the synapse

33
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:12,711
and we define a weight of 1.

34
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:18,154
Now let's create a recorder for
the synaptic conductance

35
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:21,932
the current, the soma voltage,
and the time intervals

36
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,255
for this simulation.

37
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:29,108
To do this, as in previous tutorials,
we define vectors and we record

38
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:33,988
from specific references within
the synapse object

39
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:36,648
and the soma object.

40
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:40,687
Time is recorded from
the "h" object, as seen here.

41
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:44,723
Now we're ready to
run our first simulation.

42
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,153
First, let's zero
the NMDA conductance

43
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:49,030
and validate that
the AMPA conductance

44
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,141
is behaving as we expect.

45
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,922
First we simulate,
then we plot

46
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:55,596
the voltage and
the conductance trajectories.

47
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,227
To begin we define the total length
of time the simulation will run.

48
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:02,753
In this case it's 1000ms, or 1s.

49
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:08,793
We zero the conductance of the NMDA
component of the synapse model

50
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:14,298
and set the AMPA component
of the synapse model conductance

51
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:17,050
to a realistic value of 1nS.

52
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:20,437
Next we execute
the "neuron.h.runsim" step

53
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:22,195
to execute the stimulation.

54
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:25,437
Now let's run all the cells
up until this point

55
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:31,777
to start to plot the output,
so we can run "run all above".

56
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:33,849
Now we can plot the results.

57
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:37,808
This command gives us fancy
interactive inline plots.

58
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:40,040
Next, we define
a convenience function

59
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,818
to plot time courses
of depended variables

60
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:45,463
and lets plot the voltages as

61
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,633
a function of time
for this simulation.

62
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:54,162
As you can see we have
a series of synaptic events,

63
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:59,257
neuron is at rest at -70mV,
the postsynaptic potential

64
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:04,849
is just under 1mV for
each of the 20Hz pulses

65
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:10,951
and then 500ms later we have
one pulse as defined in our incoming

66
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:13,146
spike train.

67
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:16,831
The dual exponential model for
the conductance time course

68
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,230
has a closed form for the response,
due to a single pulse.

69
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:29,404
Below, we validate our MOD file
implementation running in NEURON

70
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:32,157
against this closed form solution.

71
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:38,191
So first we plot the time course
simulated in NEURON for

72
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,241
the synaptic conductance.

73
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,996
Here we compute the dual
exponential time course using

74
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:47,393
closed form expression
and we plot that on the same axis

75
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:52,756
for comparison for the pulse
occurring at the 100ms.

76
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:57,163
We take into account the connection
delay in the "netcon" object.

77
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:00,029
Let's see what this produces.

78
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,622
As you can see in red,
the mathematical expression

79
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,239
appears to be lying close to
the solution due to NEURON.

80
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:09,285
Let's zoom in
and take a closer look

81
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:12,902
by clocking on these hairs,
these cross hairs

82
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:20,896
and dragging, we can zoom
in on that specific response.

83
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,765
As you can see, the closed
mathematical expression

84
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,000
is in good agreement with what's
coming out of the NEURON simulator.

85
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,470
This model appears to
be doing what we expected.

86
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:38,227
Now let's also validate
the trajectory

87
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,363
for the NMDA receptor alone.

88
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,736
Here we have to remove
the magnesium block by zeroing

89
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,401
the magnesium concentration.

90
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:50,392
So first we set the NMDA
conductance now to 1nS

91
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:53,489
we've zeroed the magnesium
concentration and we set the AMPA

92
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:55,369
conductance to zero.

93
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,097
And again, we run the simulation.

94
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:01,303
Now  we can plot
the time course again

95
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:05,626
and we can see a few features
of the NMDA conductance

96
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:07,501
that are remarkably different.

97
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,265
Again, there's good agreement
between the mathematical expression

98
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:14,625
and the NEURON expression,
but we can see that the decay time

99
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:17,231
course of the NMDA
receptor is much slower

100
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:20,002
and therefore over
the course of these spike trains

101
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:23,245
these conductances
will accumulate.
