Hi, this is a series of MOOCs on simulation neuroscience.
I'm Henry Markram from the EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology and I run a laboratory on neuro-microcircuitry and the blue brain project.
And these MOOCs will essentially help you to understand first what simulation neuroscience is, second how to reconstruct and simulate neurons and synapses, and then how to build a circuit and finally to be able to simulate circuits, and see what we understand from that.
In the first MOOC, we are going to have an overview and introduction to what simulation neuroscience is.
We will also look at the experimental data that goes behind simulation neuroscience.
We are also going to look at the neuroinformatics, how you organize the data, Sean Hill is going to give you lectures on that.
Then the father of modeling neurons,
Idan Segev, is going to show you how we model theseÂ neurons and Felix SchÃ¼rmann and Werner van Geit are going to show you how we constrain models with data. And then there will be an exam in the final week.
