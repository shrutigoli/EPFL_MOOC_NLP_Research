1
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:11,083
Okay, so we are now into trying
to understand

2
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:13,590
the flow of electrical current

3
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:16,095
of synaptic current in dendrites.

4
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:21,487
This understanding came
from a very, very beautiful work

5
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:23,802
by Wilfred Rall

6
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:28,033
So, Rall in the late 50s

7
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:30,104
developed what he called

8
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:33,122
"The one dimensional passive
cable equation”

9
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:39,525
to describe the flow of synaptic
current generated locally

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,796
let's say on the dendritic spine,
into the dendrite

11
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:47,954
into the rest of the tree,
including the soma and axon

12
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,317
So, what is the idea
between cable equation,

13
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:53,085
Rall's cable equation?

14
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:56,247
The idea here, that here
you have a cable

15
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:01,842
which is supposed to describe
a piece of dendrite.

16
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:07,280
It's one dimensional cable
because we only look at axial current

17
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:10,170
So, you only look at this direction
of flow

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,001
or this direction of flow
in the X direction

19
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:18,904
but not in the Y or the Z direction
of this cube,

20
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:20,754
of this dendritic cube.

21
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:25,062
So this is a cable
that describes the axon

22
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:28,045
this is the dendrite,
this is the membrane here

23
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:34,248
and this is the axial resistivity
inside the dendrite.

24
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:37,439
And the idea is very simple

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,570
but the equation that becomes
is a description of this simple idea

26
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:47,863
is that if you have an axial current
flowing inside the dendrite

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,690
some of it will leak out
from the membrane

28
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,198
and some, after leaking out,
will continue axially

29
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:01,220
longitudinally,
to other region of the cable

30
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:04,100
So, you're going to have
an axial current

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,974
and then a loss through the membrane

32
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:13,934
and the rest is continuing
to flow axially. Ok?

33
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,133
This is in the case
of passive membrane, so you only lose...

34
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:19,436
You inject a current in some location

35
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:22,061
let's say you inject a current
in some location

36
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:26,341
any location you may inject
a current. Ok?

37
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,208
You injected the current here

38
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:30,531
The synapse injected the current here

39
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,612
as if there is an inward current
flowing here.

40
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:36,170
This inward current starts
to flow axially

41
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:39,769
some of it is being lost
to the membrane

42
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:42,046
through the membrane ion channels

43
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,703
the passive ion channels,
they are open

44
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:48,113
Some of the current goes outside,
the rest go here

45
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:50,170
some of it being lost here

46
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,236
So, less current is flowing here

47
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:54,915
and so they will get a decay
of the current

48
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:59,349
less and less current will reach
less and less distance.

49
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:04,175
So, if you write exactly what I spoke
now, in words, in equation

50
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:07,325
you will see this cable equation here

51
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:12,914
Which is actually showing you
in some sense

52
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:18,794
that the axial current splits
into either a membrane current,

53
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:21,534
and we know the description
of the membrane current

54
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,284
because there is capacitance
and there is resistance

55
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:29,848
and we can describe the membrane
potential due to this loss of current

56
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:33,447
through the membrane, and the rest
of the current flow axially;

57
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,923
and this is really
this differential equation

58
00:03:36,123 --> 00:03:40,278
It has space here, X,
which is the axial current

59
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,383
And it has time here

60
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:46,655
which reflects the capacitance
of the membrane

61
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:49,805
and together you get
this cable equation

62
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:52,674
which really describes the loss
of current

63
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:58,246
or the flow of current
through an axial cable

64
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:00,719
but with the loss
through the membrane

65
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,127
That's the idea behind
the cable equation,

66
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,050
without going into the details

67
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:08,840
Rall wrote some very nice papers
analytically

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,439
to solve this cable equation,
I will just give you some intuitions.

69
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,167
Actually intuitions
are the main thing that I'm doing now

70
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,799
without going
into too many practical details

71
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,821
because this you will do
in your exercises.

72
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,148
Let me give you some intuition.

73
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:30,124
Here is a cable,
here is a dendritic cable

74
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:31,794
so it's a branch dendrite.

75
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:34,827
You see the main trunk
and then it branches to one branch

76
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,956
and then it branches
to another branch.

77
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:39,898
Suppose you inject some voltage
at this location.

78
00:04:40,524 --> 00:04:43,285
So, you inject current
and there is some voltage here

79
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:45,554
and you can see that
through this cable

80
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:47,255
because of what I just spoke about

81
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,548
current loss

82
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:52,308
you will get attenuation
of the voltage to this branch point

83
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,346
and then more attenuation
to the dotted branches and so forth

84
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,478
So, that's how a synaptic potential
will look in dendrite.

85
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:01,064
This is another example

86
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,699
suppose you inject the current
in this location

87
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,078
you will get in the injection site
the largest voltage

88
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:11,466
but then it will attenuate
very strongly to this direction, here,

89
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:14,518
or to the right direction, there,

90
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:19,134
and so you will get a big loss,
a very steep attenuation in dendrite.

91
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:23,917
Rall showed that indeed in dendrites
you may get locally large voltage,

92
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,151
synaptic potential locally,
maybe 20 millivolts locally,

93
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:31,655
but this synaptic potential
will attenuate very steeply

94
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:34,495
because of the cable properties
of the dendrite.

95
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:36,745
And we just saw that

96
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,907
but we can also look at the time,
what happens in time

97
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:43,008
not only in space, but in time.

98
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,582
So, let's say that you inject
your current here

99
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,047
a transient current,
very brief current

100
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:51,047
like a synaptic current you inject

101
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:53,343
and then the current decays locally.

102
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:55,601
Then, if you wait enough time

103
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:58,459
you see that after some time
the voltage reaches here

104
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,749
at this location

105
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,621
because the voltage spreads in time

106
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,488
and then here,
after some time it goes down

107
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:07,051
it goes down, it goes down

108
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:11,133
And after some time it goes here
and after enough time

109
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:14,469
the current dissipates
through the membrane

110
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,719
and nothing is left
and you are back to resting potential.

111
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,582
So of course in cable,
because the cable equation

112
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:24,556
as I said before,
has both space and time,

113
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,026
the solution for the cable equation

114
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,105
now it's not ordinary
differential equation

115
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:33,102
but partial differential equation
with X and T

116
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:37,502
it will take both space for decay
of voltage

117
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:40,402
and also voltage will decay in time

118
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:43,118
and that's the solution
for the cable equation:

119
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:45,104
The time and space solution.

120
00:06:45,662 --> 00:06:49,396
This is another example,
so let's say that I inject here

121
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:54,013
at some location X=0
inject a very strong current

122
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,157
and I get a strong voltage

123
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,259
and I'm looking at some distance

124
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:01,389
I will get this, let's say EPSP

125
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:07,680
if I look later at a more distant,
so this is distance

126
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,826
this is close to the injection site

127
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:11,756
further from the injection site,

128
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:14,741
even further,
you can see the attenuation

129
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:18,493
both in time and in space.

130
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:21,427
One interesting thing
is that you can see

131
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:24,654
that the shape of the voltage in time

132
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,368
let's call it the EPSP

133
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:31,089
the shape of the EPSP changes
as a function of distance

134
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,899
from the injection site.

135
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:34,920
This will mean

136
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:36,972
that the synaptic...

137
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:41,325
the shape of the synaptic potential
locally at the synaptic site

138
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,379
will be different
than the shape of the voltage...

139
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,466
of the synaptic voltage away
from the synapse

140
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,874
let's say the cell body

141
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:53,086
It will actually attenuate,
but also will become broader

142
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,831
It will be smeared out,
like you see here

143
00:07:56,031 --> 00:08:01,667
from something that is sharper,
to something that is more smeared out,

144
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,343
that is what is expected
from cable theory

145
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:07,153
Rall's cable theory, for synapses.

146
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,381
You can speak about the velocity

147
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:13,304
how fast the EPSP
or the IPSP propagates

148
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:17,070
from the site of origin
in the dendrite to another location

149
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:19,428
So, this shows you here, the velocity.

150
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:25,959
We didn't discuss this much

151
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:29,415
but the velocity first is very fast

152
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:33,985
and then it comes to kind of a steady
state velocity of the EPSP

153
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:36,012
so this is just to give you a ball park

154
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,512
this could be something

155
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:43,065
on the order
of say 0.1 meter per second

156
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:46,878
Something like that, or even less,

157
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,275
so the synaptic potential
from its origin in the synapse itself

158
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:53,704
in the spine, let's say

159
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:56,722
until the soma it will take some time,

160
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:59,827
there will be a delay,
as you can see here.

161
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:01,530
It happens here, let's say

162
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,408
it takes some time to reach here

163
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,579
it takes even more time to reach here

164
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,692
so there is a propagation delay,

165
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:11,769
there is a dendritic delay
between the origin of the synapse

166
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,807
until the voltage is seen in the soma.

167
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:19,703
This is an important aspect,
because neurons delay the signals,

168
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,544
it's not instantaneous

169
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:24,935
it's actually quite a slow process
of a few milliseconds

170
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:30,006
or tenth of milliseconds
from the synapse to the soma

171
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:33,027
depending on where the synapse is,
relative to the soma.

172
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:38,922
So, this is a demonstration
that Rall already early on, in '67,

173
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:41,132
already showed something important.

174
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:44,736
This is his model of a neuron,
this is the cell body

175
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,064
and this is the distal dendrite,

176
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:53,998
this is firing the dendrite.

177
00:09:54,398 --> 00:09:56,701
So he split the dendritic tree here

178
00:09:57,282 --> 00:10:01,642
into let's say a chain of compartment
number two, number three, number four,

179
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:05,849
and this is very far in the dendrite,
and this is very close to the soma.

180
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:10,855
And he was injecting
simulated synapses to the soma

181
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:14,891
to the proximal compartment
to the more distal, to the more distal,

182
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:18,102
and looking at the shape
of the synaptic potential

183
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:20,890
at the soma as a function
of location.

184
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:24,383
When you normalize this

185
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,207
somatic EPSPs

186
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,582
you see that if you inject
your synapse

187
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:33,748
into compartment number one

188
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:36,518
you get a very fast, local EPSP

189
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,124
If you inject it at compartment
number eight, in here

190
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:45,587
it's this case

191
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,541
and you normalize for the amplitude

192
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:50,403
because of course
it should have been decayed

193
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:52,064
but if you normalize there

194
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:54,659
you see that it takes time
for the synapse

195
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:56,982
synaptic potential to reach the soma

196
00:10:57,849 --> 00:10:59,848
so it's slower

197
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:01,743
but it also broader

198
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:03,863
and now the EPSP is very broad.

199
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:10,475
So, Rall was actually the first one
to understand

200
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:13,822
that the shape of the synaptic potential
as measured at the soma

201
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:18,303
reflects in many way the origin
of the synapse

202
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,715
if it's a very brief EPSP

203
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:25,604
it probably comes from dendritic
region near to the soma

204
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,273
If it's a very sluggish EPSP,
and broad

205
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:33,356
it comes probably
from a distal region

206
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:34,966
so this is a distal synapse.

207
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,458
And because we know that
the dendritic tree is full of synapses

208
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:40,809
some are distal,
some are in the middle

209
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,238
some proximal to the soma and axon

210
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:47,033
we know that the shape of this EPSP

211
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,009
is changed, as a function
of the origin,

212
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,219
at the soma
and also the amplitude changes;

213
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,837
and in may ways, the nearby synapses

214
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:58,141
excitatory synapses
are more effective

215
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:01,942
in de-polarizing the cell,
if it's an EPSP

216
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,584
than the distal synapses,
which attenuate it.

217
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:08,290
So, Rall cable equations enable
us to understand

218
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,109
what is the degree of attenuation,

219
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:14,857
how much a distal synapse
will de-polarize the cell body,

220
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:18,465
how much the same synapse,
if it would have been proximal

221
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:20,308
affect the cell body and so on.

222
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:23,298
So, the cable equation
is really an essential part

223
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:26,250
of understanding how the neuron
collects its inputs

224
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:30,315
and then attenuates these inputs
from the synapses

225
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:32,375
to the cell body and axon,

226
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:35,848
where the second signal, the spike,
is generated.

227
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,957
Now, in order to solve
the cable equations,

228
00:12:40,523 --> 00:12:44,221
in some cases you can do it
analytically as Rall did

229
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:48,900
and really get a mathematical,
clean solution for current injection

230
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,008
in this location or another location

231
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:55,361
and the voltage that emerges
in any other location of the tree,

232
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:59,135
but typically,
especially for conductant changes

233
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:03,629
which is perturbing the membrane
properties by opening ion channels

234
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,897
it's hard to solve analytically

235
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:08,899
and for this you use
what we always now use

236
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:10,491
in all our simulation

237
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,035
which is called
the compartmental modeling.

238
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,954
So, compartmental modeling
is a numerical implication

239
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:20,504
or application of the cable equation

240
00:13:20,704 --> 00:13:23,004
so the cable equation
is an analytical equation

241
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:26,850
the compartment modeling
of the cable equation

242
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,707
is a numerical approximation
of the continuous analytical case.

243
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,962
So, the compartmental modeling

244
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:38,270
is a numerical simulation
of the Rall cable equation.

245
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,300
And the idea is very simple.

246
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,423
So, let's say that you have
a reconstructed dendritic tree

247
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:50,294
and that you know all the electrical
parameter of this dendritic tree:

248
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:54,307
you know the resistance of the soma
you know the capacitance of the soma

249
00:13:54,507 --> 00:13:59,345
you know the resistance of the axial
intracellular resistivity and all that...

250
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:01,670
Let's say that you have
all these properties,

251
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:04,815
so you have ,the cable equation
for this one

252
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,629
but let's say that now you want
to inject the synapse conductance

253
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:10,695
change here

254
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:12,745
and another,
let's say inhibitory synapse

255
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:15,359
so this is inhibitory here,
and excitatory there

256
00:14:15,827 --> 00:14:18,419
and another synapse here, and so on...

257
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:23,467
So, you really want now
to perturb your model neuron

258
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,089
in order to understand
how all these inputs integrate

259
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:31,913
and generate eventually local
voltages but also axonal voltages.

260
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:34,598
So, you take the continuous case

261
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:39,279
which is, as I said, determined
by the cable equation

262
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,501
and you cut it into segments,
or compartments,

263
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,245
here is one compartment,

264
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:49,713
so, you disquieterize,
you take the continuous case

265
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:53,230
and you take a delta X and you decide
this I call a compartment

266
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,017
this I call another compartment

267
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:59,983
So this is one
Delta X disquietization

268
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:02,544
another Delta X disquietization
another Delta X

269
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:07,428
And for this disquieterized
compartments

270
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,349
with this Delta X
supposed to be small enough

271
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:16,787
so that the numerical solution
after this disquietization

272
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:19,874
will approximate the continuous case,

273
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:24,558
then, you get the compartmental
representation of the cable case

274
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,315
so this is now one compartment

275
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,961
this is now another compartment
and so on

276
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,751
and you can see that the idea here
is that to describe each compartment

277
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,217
by the membrane

278
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:39,984
so there is a capacitance
and there is a resistance here

279
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,768
so, this is the membrane
representation here

280
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:47,568
the resistance, and a capacitance
of the membrane

281
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:50,779
and there is this axial resistivity

282
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:53,967
which connects one compartment
to the other compartment:

283
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,493
that's what you see here.

284
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:58,806
So compartmental modeling,
and you will be using that a lot

285
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:01,592
for example, simulated by neuron

286
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:06,921
which is a simulator that is using
compartmental modeling approach

287
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:10,425
to model neurons and network
of neurons

288
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:12,308
bombarded by synapses,

289
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:15,737
and then, of course, because we know
how to model a synapse

290
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:20,800
let's say this synapse, I know how
to edit to compartmental modeling

291
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,594
another segment that will describe
this particular synapse

292
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,482
with its battery as we just discussed.

293
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:31,951
So, that's the compartmental
representation of the cable equation,

294
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:34,462
but the underlying theory

295
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:39,156
mathematical theory for current flow
in passive dendrites

296
00:16:39,356 --> 00:16:42,586
including synapses,
today we can extend it even

297
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:46,723
to dendrites that have some voltage
dependence membrane properties

298
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,019
but we are not going
to talk about this,

299
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:52,639
but the principle is that you take
the equation, which is continuous

300
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:56,412
and you take a discrete set
of equations

301
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:58,356
one for each compartment

302
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:02,553
you connect it together
in a big matrix of connectivity

303
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:05,783
and you solve this matrix numerically;

304
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:09,312
each matrix represents a piece
of a membrane

305
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:12,149
a little segment,
a little compartment

306
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:17,691
plus the ions that runs there,
it could be synaptic

307
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:23,047
or in the case of axon,
it could be excitable channels,

308
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,695
we can do all this by simulation,

309
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,859
like Hodgkin actually simulated
the axon

310
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:30,760
using compartmental modeling
already there,

311
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,558
this is a much sophisticated way
to do it today

312
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:37,659
using the cable equations
and including synapses

313
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:42,009
non-linear excitable channels
or anything you want for the membrane.

314
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:49,209
We have this capability,
and we have this online free software

315
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:54,710
to implement this compartmental
numerical modeling of neurons

316
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,768
So, for example, you can study
what is the local effect of a synapse

317
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:03,112
using this simulation approach.

318
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:05,705
For example, if your synapse

319
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:10,382
so if your G-synapse
was located distally

320
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:13,432
and this would be an excitatory
synapse

321
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,258
so excitatory post synaptic
potential (EPSP) locally

322
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:21,230
you will see that this is a very,
very localized spread

323
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,730
because of this big attenuation
of the synapse

324
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:27,039
the synapse will affect only very
locally the dendritic tree

325
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,786
and a very, very small
amount of the charge

326
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:33,010
of the current injected
by the synapse

327
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,617
will reach the cell body.

328
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:38,118
So, as I mentioned before
this region can have

329
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,692
a big de-polarization
of let's say 10 millivolts

330
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,752
and the cell body will get something
extremely small

331
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:47,085
maybe 0.5 millivolts

332
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:51,648
So, the EPSP will attenuate severely

333
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:55,103
And this means that you cannot use
one EPSP, typically,

334
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,054
to reach threshold for spike varying
at the axon.

335
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,958
You need many EPSPs

336
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:03,196
if you put your synapse here

337
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:07,707
it will be very locally affecting
other local synapses

338
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:11,908
integrating together,
generating local de-polarization

339
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,353
if these are EPSPs

340
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,108
but the big effect will be local

341
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:18,882
and then it will spread and attenuate
distally.

342
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:21,213
These are the only synapses
that work.

343
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:24,133
If the synapse is directed
to the soma, like here

344
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,786
then of course, at the soma
you will get a bigger EPSP

345
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,100
Then, if this same synapse would
have been distally

346
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:34,202
so this is the type of thing 
you can do today, easily,

347
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:37,128
using neuron simulation
or other simulations

348
00:19:37,438 --> 00:19:41,690
in a compartmental modeling
of this reconstructed dendritic tree.

349
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:45,830
Ok, so I think we came to a summary

350
00:19:47,448 --> 00:19:51,171
of how to model synaptic potentials

351
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:58,316
and how to look at it,
in some sense, integratively.

352
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:03,041
Ok, so I mentioned that locally
you have rather large

353
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:04,739
sometimes synaptic potentials

354
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:08,021
both excitatory
as well as inhibitory

355
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:11,796
But not in the same synapse,
or some synapse generate EPSPs

356
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:14,661
some other synapses IPSP,
the same dendrite.

357
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:18,880
And the fact that you have cable

358
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:24,798
cause these dendrites or synapses
to attenuate from the site of origin

359
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:27,422
to other regions,
not only to the soma,

360
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:29,974
so, this synapse may affect
other regions

361
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:32,306
but it attenuates very steeply,

362
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:34,808
each synapse attenuate very steeply

363
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:37,494
because of the cable properties
of the dendrites.

364
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:41,557
This means, as I said,
that locally

365
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:44,559
let's say an EPSP could be
on the spine head

366
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,762
where it's initiated 20, 30 millivolts,

367
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:50,299
but you will see
very small perturbation

368
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:54,877
small EPSP very attenuated
but also smeared out

369
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:58,229
broad at the soma,
maybe half a millivolt, maybe less

370
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:02,977
That means that you need on the order
of maybe 100 or more

371
00:21:03,177 --> 00:21:07,231
excitatory synapses
to converge into the dendritic tree

372
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:09,142
within a given time window

373
00:21:09,342 --> 00:21:14,025
in order for them to summate some
on top of each other

374
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:18,542
together, to reach threshold
for spike firing.

375
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:23,766
Maybe 100 synapses,
each one contributes half a millivolt

376
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:27,671
a third of a millivolt at the soma,
this should ride on top of the other

377
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,827
they should sum up with each other

378
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,398
in order to reach threshold
for spike firing.

379
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:36,336
If they don't,
then there will be no spike.

380
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,798
If there is enough excitatory
synapses

381
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,605
but at the same time you will get
a lot of inhibitory synapses

382
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:48,885
then the inhibitory synapses will tend
to dampen the excitatory synapses

383
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,480
because they have negative signal

384
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,021
and also because they shunt
the membrane

385
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,098
their open conductances

386
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:59,772
So the excitatory current
cannot reach the soma

387
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:02,007
because it is shunted
by the inhibition

388
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:05,401
so this inhibitory effect
is very critical.

389
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:09,416
So actually, the brain in general

390
00:22:09,616 --> 00:22:15,351
and in particular neurons are very
much dependent on this balance

391
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:17,650
between excitation and inhibition.

392
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,149
You should imagine
a lot of excitatory coming

393
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:24,530
let's say in the pyramidal cell
you have 8,000 excitatory synapses

394
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,272
bombarding the tree

395
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:28,641
8,000

396
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:32,837
but there are also 2,000 inhibitory
synapses  or 1,500

397
00:22:33,037 --> 00:22:35,863
that tend to dampen
the excitation,

398
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:39,647
and to shunt, to avoid
this excitation,

399
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:41,889
and whether there will be spike
or not

400
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:46,466
really depends on this balance
between how much excitatory charge

401
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,052
reaches the soma

402
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:51,839
and how much inhibitory charge
dampens the current

403
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,972
from not reaching the soma.

404
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:57,405
The end result,
the sum of all this charge

405
00:22:57,605 --> 00:22:59,135
of many, many synapses

406
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:04,732
out of 10,000 will determine whether
you will get one spike, two spikes

407
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:10,398
a train of spikes, a music of spikes
tatata, stop, tatata and so forth,

408
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,704
this will be determined critically.

409
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:15,655
But how much charge arrives
to the soma

410
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:17,911
positive and negative,

411
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:20,822
whether it reaches threshold
or much above threshold,

412
00:23:21,022 --> 00:23:22,631
or almost threshold,

413
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:24,535
whether one spike, two or three

414
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,604
and also of course
the pattern of activity

415
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:30,924
as I showed you early will depend
on the property

416
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:34,995
of the excitable channels
in the axonal membrane.

417
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:39,423
Some axon will like by themselves
to fire with burst

418
00:23:39,623 --> 00:23:42,583
some will like to fire repetitively,

419
00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:46,867
so it's the charge that arrives,
plus the properties of the axon

420
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:49,927
that will eventually determine
the particular music

421
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:52,318
that this neuron is now playing.

422
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,574
Whether it's tatata stop,
stop, stop, tatata

423
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,386
Whether tatatatata and so forth...

424
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,051
And this is underlying
the neuronal code

425
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:07,397
so it's extremely important
to understand how synapses converge,

426
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:11,908
interact, integrate in the dendrite
reaching the soma,

427
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:18,408
axon, and what type of axon property,
axonal property, excitable properties,

428
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:22,084
how do the axon
interpret these charge

429
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:24,209
whether by a burst or not.

430
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:26,083
When something goes wrong

431
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:29,865
when you have imbalance
between excitation, inhibition

432
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:32,304
let's say in the case
of epileptic seizure

433
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:37,078
then the whole brain goes wild:
too much excitation.

434
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:39,270
If there is too much inhibition

435
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,823
then the brain is too quiet:
no activity.

436
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:45,317
And so, the balance is critical

437
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:49,318
but also the type of activity
within this network

438
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:54,195
is probably standing as an
essence of the type of behavior

439
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:55,711
the state of the brain

440
00:24:56,012 --> 00:25:01,936
whether you are going to be a deep
sleep, REM sleep, no sleep,

441
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:04,289
whether you will have difficulties
in sleep,

442
00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:06,164
whether you will be happy
or sad.

443
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:09,371
All these activities that emerge
from the synapse

444
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,468
and output axons is really something
that we must understand

445
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,045
both in health and disease.

446
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:19,503
Lastly, but I'm not going to talk
about this today

447
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:24,822
these synapses that I mentioned
are a wonderful source of changes

448
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:28,568
in the brain, underlying memory,
learning and memory

449
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:32,135
because I told you that these
synapses may change their efficacy:

450
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,737
because they are analogue signals

451
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:37,745
they may become stronger or weaker

452
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:39,961
as a function of some activity

453
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:43,258
we understand only little
about this plasticity rules,

454
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:46,142
but the plasticity
is within the synapses

455
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:48,291
so, they preserve the memory

456
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:50,708
and when they become stronger
or weaker

457
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:53,769
when they form new synapses between
neurons

458
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:59,330
you form new capability for a circuit
to be active in a particular way,

459
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,075
generates its own particular
new music

460
00:26:02,306 --> 00:26:04,575
which will stand
for your new learning:

461
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:09,046
the letter A, a new face,
a new feeling, a new idea.

462
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:14,965
We must understand synapses,
spikes and network activity

463
00:26:15,402 --> 00:26:17,469
in order to understand a state

464
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:21,566
but we also must understand
plasticity in the synapses

465
00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:24,748
in order to understand
the emergence of new states,

466
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,113
new creative states, hopefully,

467
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:32,910
and that's exactly what we are trying
to understand in neuroscience:

468
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,463
both the activity, the computation,
or the coding

469
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,263
that this activity stands for,

470
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,442
and also the plasticity and learning

471
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:44,777
all embedded in this electrical,
chemical activity

472
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:46,560
of this miraculous brain.
