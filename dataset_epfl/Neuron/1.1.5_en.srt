1
00:00:06,787 --> 00:00:07,797
Okay.

2
00:00:07,997 --> 00:00:10,598
So, in the last lecture we...

3
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:14,591
..explored a little bit what
simulation neuroscience is,

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,675
what the rationale for it is

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,865
and what the principles
on which it is based are.

6
00:00:21,943 --> 00:00:24,680
Now we are going to look
a little bit about how weâ€¦,

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,974
still part of this introduction,

8
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:28,780
how do we...

9
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:32,448
..look, approach data,
what are the data strategies

10
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:35,088
and informatics and so on.

11
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:39,448
So in the case of, you know...

12
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:43,265
..going just up to building
circuits of the brain,

13
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,470
the first approach is,
establish a data hierarchy

14
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:53,803
and there is a reason
that we actually approach

15
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:57,100
simulation neuroscience
at the micro circuit level.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,633
It is because it kind of is 
in the middle between...

17
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:04,264
..brain regions
and the whole brain

18
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,081
and cells and molecules

19
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:10,485
and so you actually capture

20
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:13,812
how do you integrate
the components below.

21
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:17,759
Later you can integrate these components
into higher level components.

22
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:23,698
So, it is relatively simple rules
for how do you approach data.

23
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:26,438
You establish a data hierarchy.

24
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:29,121
And in this case,
it is also relatively simple.

25
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:31,532
You start with your ion channels

26
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:35,053
which are membrane proteins that

27
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:38,125
allow specific ions to flow through

28
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:42,447
and in either directions
or whichever directions,

29
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:48,286
and as they flow through,
they change the voltage of the...

30
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:52,166
..membrane of the neuron

31
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:57,006
and collectively they will shape
the way that the neuron behaves

32
00:01:57,206 --> 00:02:00,795
and we are going to learn
a lot more about that as we go further.

33
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:06,648
The way we do that
and we are going to also

34
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:10,516
go further into that in the next series
of lectures

35
00:02:10,716 --> 00:02:14,170
as we do ion channel screening,
biophysical screening,

36
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,930
one has to actually explore
the biophysics of these channels

37
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:21,182
and then one has to look at neurons

38
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:25,437
and how we study neurons,
how do we record from neurons

39
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:28,418
and stay in neurons
and how do we determine

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,324
how they behave

41
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:34,915
and then their synapses,
how do we get to record

42
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:36,959
how a synapse behaves.

43
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,957
So these are paired recordings

44
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:43,962
and staining the two neurons,

45
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:47,185
so you can see how neurons
connect with each other

46
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:49,948
and then there are also circuits
and how do you study circuits.

47
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:52,338
You can stain them globally,

48
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,688
you can do antibody staining,

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,084
you can do stain for the expression
of the genes,

50
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:02,001
it is called in situ hybridization,

51
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:07,708
or you can actually suck out some
of the cytoplasm from inside a cell

52
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,357
and you can find out which genes
are expressed.

53
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:15,436
You can also
look at the emergent activities

54
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:18,409
that emerge
in the circuit electrically

55
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:19,904
and voltage sensitive.

56
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:23,610
So there are many techniques
and approaches to record

57
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,888
from the sort of levels,

58
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,587
ion channels,
neurons, synapses, circuits

59
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:31,878
and then...

60
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,484
..in order to do the reconstruction,

61
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:36,643
you have to...

62
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:38,421
...and build algorithms,

63
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:41,652
you have to pay attention
to the way you analyze the data.

64
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:44,151
So you have to analyze
in the case of ion channels,

65
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:48,817
you have to analyze the kinetics
of the channels, open and closed.

66
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:53,198
Distribution - where are they 
located? In the cell body

67
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:55,749
or up in the branches?

68
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,643
What are the combinations
of ion channels?

69
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:00,032
That is you can't just have one
type of ion channel,

70
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:02,574
you need lots of different types
of ion channels if you want to get

71
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:04,425
interesting behavior.

72
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:07,644
So, what are the combinations
that are possible?

73
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:10,695
And then how many
of each type do you have?

74
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:15,023
What is the conductance, how much
current does ion channel pass through?

75
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:18,369
So, this allows you to build
a model of the ion channel

76
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,396
and we are going to learn
how we do that in other lectures later.

77
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:27,437
And then you study neurons
and we use patch-clamp

78
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:32,064
and I will show you in subsequent
lectures how we do that

79
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:35,039
and that allows you
to get the morphology,

80
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:39,340
so you can get the branching,
3-D branching structure of a neuron

81
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,051
to the morphology.

82
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:44,243
You can also record from these,
so you can actually

83
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,715
find out how they behave electrically.

84
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:53,452
You can stain them, so you can find out
what proteins are located on to them

85
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:57,861
And you can also suck out
some of this juice

86
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:00,601
from the cytoplasm,
from inside a cell

87
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:05,155
and then you can find out
what genes are switched on in the cell,

88
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,102
so you can find out genes.

89
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:10,823
So it gives you a very
in-depth view of a single neuron

90
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:16,560
in terms of its structure,
its function, its genes,

91
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,325
its proteins and so on.

92
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:21,351
And synapses
are of course more tricky.

93
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:24,952
They are small,
they are half a micron.

94
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:28,907
Basically, a little bit
bigger than a bacteria,

95
00:05:29,107 --> 00:05:31,688
about the size of a bacteria
for many of them.

96
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:35,268
They are the most
complex little devices,

97
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,045
biological devices in the universe,

98
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,347
but how do we record from them,
so you have to record from two cells

99
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:45,962
and then you have to stain both cells,

100
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,860
so you can find
a way for the axon to go out 

101
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,000
to touch the other cell
and how did they form synapses.

102
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:54,477
So you want to measure
and the numbers you need

103
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:56,945
are like synapses per connection,

104
00:05:57,145 --> 00:06:00,971
you need to stimulate and see how much
voltage is produced on the other side

105
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:04,701
by the receiving neurons,
you get the synaptic strength

106
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,907
and then you have to play with
the synaptic transmission

107
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,251
to try to understand
what kind of dynamics,

108
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:16,051
what is the communication
code between two neurons.

109
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:19,896
Synaptic dynamics
and then you can ask,

110
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:22,860
"how does the synapse,
how can it be controlled

111
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,446
if you throw a drug on it
or if you throw a chemical on it

112
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:29,954
like a neuromodulator,
(INAUDIBLE) or adrenaline,  

113
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:31,986
dopamine, histamine".

114
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:36,382
How does that actually change
the behavior of the synapse.

115
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,504
So these are all numbers
that you can get

116
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:41,742
and they are being obtained
in many different ways,

117
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,998
in many different labs
around the world

118
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:49,231
and then you have circuits
and from the circuits you want to know

119
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:51,651
essentially,
how many neurons they are,

120
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:53,936
how many types of neurons they are,

121
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:56,185
how are they arranged together,

122
00:06:56,385 --> 00:07:00,230
how are they positioned,
are they clustered together and so on.

123
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,820
All kinds of geometrical rules

124
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,642
of how do you organize your neurons
in a piece of tissue.

125
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,319
Then there is, of course also,
electrophysiological data

126
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,607
which tells you
how that circuit behaves

127
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:17,089
and many experiments around

128
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:21,384
how little pieces of brain tissue
or circuits behave.

129
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:26,592
So this is, you know, 
to summarize the issue,

130
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:28,947
identify a hierarchy.

131
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:32,288
In this case it is ion channels.
They go into the neurons,

132
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:34,650
the synapses connect
the neurons

133
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:38,491
and you put the neurons
together in a circuit.

134
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:41,591
So these are the components.

135
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,910
When you build your ion channels
you freeze,

136
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,315
you build your neurons, you freeze,
you build your synapses, you freeze,

137
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:49,586
you put them
into the circuit and test.
