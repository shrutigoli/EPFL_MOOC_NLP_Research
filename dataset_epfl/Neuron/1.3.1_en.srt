1
00:00:05,302 --> 00:00:08,159
We looked at studying single neurons.

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:12,113
Two different ways
that we can explore neurons

3
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,791
in terms of the morphology

4
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:17,762
and electro-physiological properties

5
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:22,167
And today we are going to
look at ion channels,

6
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:24,634
profiling, molecular profiling,

7
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:27,481
what do we mean by neuron types

8
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:31,237
and how do we actually
obtain neuron densities

9
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:33,471
and then some caveats in a summary.

10
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,489
So ion channels,

11
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:40,738
they are the heart of neurons
if you wish

12
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:43,782
or heart of the electrical activity
of neurons

13
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:48,108
and it is quite a challenge

14
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:51,283
when you first go in and look
at all the ion channels,

15
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:55,710
but the organization
is actually quite elegant.

16
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:59,785
There are a lot of ion channel
related genes,

17
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,301
but many of these
associated proteins

18
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:08,267
that will regulate ion channels
or that make ion channels work.

19
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:14,242
There are about 280
well characterized ion channels

20
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:18,817
and of them, 145 are voltage-gated

21
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:23,103
which means that when the voltage
changes, they either open or close.

22
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,781
Now, the way to sort of

23
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,455
make it easy
to digest is first of all,

24
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:34,521
everybody should
know that ion channels,

25
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:39,406
they are special
transmembrane proteins that allow,

26
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:42,283
selectively allow ions
to flow through.

27
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:46,359
You can have an ion channel
that selectively allows

28
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:48,602
sodium to flow through for example

29
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:51,899
or specifically calcium

30
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:55,727
or you could
have typically potassium

31
00:01:56,186 --> 00:01:59,085
and what you should all remember
and you should look this up is that

32
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,828
the potassium of course,
is very high on the inside of cells,

33
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:08,361
sodium is very high
on the outside of cells.

34
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,150
Okay.

35
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,750
Calcium is very low.

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,765
60 nanomolar or so
on the inside of cells

37
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:20,675
and calcium
is actually relatively very high

38
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:25,161
outside of cells in the order
of 1 to 2 millimolar.

39
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:28,599
Calcium is in the range
of 60 nanomolar.

40
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,984
There are pumps in that
and we are not going to be considering

41
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:38,806
these at this point in time.
It is not...

42
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,241
something you can get into later.

43
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:44,499
So when you look
at the potassium channels

44
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,451
or just the channels in general,

45
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:49,428
you have the sodium channels,
that is over here.

46
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,735
They are the ones that

47
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:54,853
essentially, help you to get
action potential, spikes.

48
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:59,429
You have the calcium channels
which also get activated.

49
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:02,193
For example in the heart,
most of the action potential

50
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:05,119
starts off as a sodium channel
and you have a long

51
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,731
calcium action potential

52
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:12,825
and in neurons, the sodium
spikes help activate calcium channels

53
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:15,552
which brings calcium into the cell

54
00:03:15,752 --> 00:03:19,618
and that drives a number
of other biochemical processes.

55
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,495
So this is how you get
your excitation.

56
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:27,628
It is with your sodium
and calcium channels

57
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,385
and then you have your
resting membrane potential.

58
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,408
Most cells as you should know
inside is between

59
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:39,235
6 to minus 60 to minus 80 millivolts

60
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:40,696
inside the cell

61
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:44,671
and the way you maintain
that is by keeping a lot of...

62
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:47,321
..potassium inside,
but essentially,

63
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,569
it is about the permeability.

64
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,031
If a membrane that is only permeable

65
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,114
to potassium channels,

66
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:59,905
then you will go to what is called
the potassium Nernst potential

67
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:02,738
which you are going to learn
about later on.

68
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,236
And that keeps
the cell at this potential.

69
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:07,544
So you have to have
sort of leak channels

70
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:10,629
or channels that are just permeable,
they are not...

71
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,505
...necessarily very sensitive
to voltage,

72
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:17,903
they just stay open all the time
and they actually help keep

73
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:22,591
the resting potential.
So that is these.

74
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,797
These K2...

75
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:30,354
and the inward rectifiers.

76
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:33,893
By convention
when current flows out,

77
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:38,163
positive current flows out,
it is called an outward current

78
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:42,532
and when positive current flows in,
it is called an inward current.

79
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:48,897
Okay.
So the resting membrane potential

80
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:52,153
as I said here is controlled
by these channels.

81
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:56,749
The depolarization is controlled
by these channels

82
00:04:57,486 --> 00:05:00,289
and then you have hyperpolarization.

83
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:04,133
What stops the excitation
and brings it back down again,

84
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,414
it is this class of channels,
the voltage activated...

85
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:11,384
...potassium channels

86
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:15,389
and you also have the calcium-activated
potassium channels.

87
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:19,509
So these are very important to

88
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,508
bring the membrane potential
back down again,

89
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,934
to stop the firing
and to allow another spike to occur.

90
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:30,093
So if we focus a little bit on
the voltage activated potassium channels,

91
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:36,492
because they are really the extremely
important in controlling excitation.

92
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:40,635
You block them, you get seizures,
everything goes wrong.

93
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,588
There are 40 genes, only 40 genes

94
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:46,933
in mammalian tissue

95
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,782
and many of them are also similar
in plants and others.

96
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:57,389
In 12 classes,
they are called Kv 1-12

97
00:05:57,996 --> 00:06:03,252
and each gene produces
a specific subunit here

98
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:07,148
and you have to combine
four of them together

99
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:09,069
to form a channel.

100
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:13,552
If you combine, if it is one gene
that produces all four subunits,

101
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:15,619
the same subunit,

102
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:19,802
then you have what is called
a homomeric channel.

103
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,646
But you can have two genes,
each producing two subunits

104
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,906
and when they combine,
you have what is called...

105
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:32,433
..a heteromeric channel.

106
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:37,064
Homomeric for the same,
heteromeric for different subunits,

107
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,948
when different subunits combine.

108
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:42,224
If it was only homomeric channels
that could be produced,

109
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:44,252
you would have 40 channels,

110
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:47,376
of types of potassium channels,
but because there are different combinations

111
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:50,629
they can combine, different
subunits can combine differently,

112
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:54,188
the result is that there is well
over 40 different

113
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:56,741
voltage activated potassium channels.

114
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:59,595
This is very important, because
depending on which one you use,

115
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:03,574
you are going to have a different electrical
property in neurons as I will show you later.

116
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:06,759
So these are the family of...

117
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,259
the Kv family, what we call the Kv family.

118
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,861
How do we characterize
how these ion channels behave?

119
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:19,063
One way is to isolate
the messenger RNA.

120
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,913
To isolate messenger RNA
from the brain,

121
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:25,029
so you basically squash up,
homogenize the tissue,

122
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,229
you isolate the messenger RNA,

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,172
you do PCR amplification,

124
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:35,812
you get your cDNA,
you clone the gene

125
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:38,085
and put it into a vector

126
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:41,002
and you inject that into cell lines.

127
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:45,063
So you produce cell lines.
Cell lines like a Chinese hamster.

128
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:48,225
Ovary cell lines or hex cell lines

129
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:52,350
or different cell lines
that you can use

130
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,573
and then you can inject
the ion channel gene into these cells

131
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,769
and then they express,
they express the channel

132
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:03,371
on the membrane

133
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:07,478
and you can induce
the expression with tetracycline

134
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:11,900
or other kinds of chemicals

135
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:14,386
when you're ready
to study the channel.

136
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:18,239
And in the past it was that you
needed to use patch-clamp.

137
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,192
Patch-clamp, so you come
in with a patch pipette.

138
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:27,444
A very high resistance patch pipette
here as I mentioned yesterday.

139
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:31,756
A high gigaseal. Then you can actually
see this channel opening and closing.

140
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:33,842
Opening and closing.

141
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:37,197
But today we do this
in an industrial way.

142
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:40,772
There are robots and basically,
the robot just

143
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,862
puts the pipettes in 
and patches automatically

144
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:47,864
and so you can do this at
a very high throughput way.

145
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:50,439
Now what you do when you
have your channel and you can study

146
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,018
how it is opening and closing,

147
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:58,434
you stimulate the channel.
Here you can see that

148
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:02,097
you give different pulses
of different amplitudes

149
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:04,504
and you study activation.

150
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:08,384
How does the channel open
when the voltage changes

151
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:11,013
and you study in activation

152
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:14,164
which is how does the channel close

153
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:17,341
once it has been activated.

154
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:20,237
So the voltage is active,

155
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:21,846
but the channel
just starts closing.

156
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:24,763
Even if the voltage is high,
the channel starts closing.

157
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:27,592
So you can see here the channel
starts closing.

158
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,207
And then you have deactivation.

159
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,844
Deactivation is,
after it has been activated,

160
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:37,627
how long does it recover
from this activation.

161
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,728
And then there are
other dynamic variables

162
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:44,255
and different ways
that you can study the channel,

163
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:48,141
but the most important is activation,
inactivation, deactivation.

164
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:53,863
So when you do that
on the 40 ion channel genes,

165
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,393
there are many that are silent,
because

166
00:09:57,593 --> 00:10:00,236
homomeric subunits,
when they combine,

167
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,491
they are not going
to produce any current.

168
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:05,463
For example here,
you are getting silent channels.

169
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:08,165
These are silent channels.

170
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:11,573
But there are many that activate
and the first thing you can see

171
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:14,260
is that they have different
kinds of activation.

172
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,447
Many different kinds of activation.

173
00:10:16,903 --> 00:10:19,084
This is Kv 10.2.

174
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,517
It has a slow activation.

175
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:23,992
This is Kv 1.4,

176
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:29,633
very fast activation
and inactivation.

177
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:34,405
This one has almost no inactivation.
It just keeps being activated.

178
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:38,430
So opening,
you can think of it like this

179
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,191
that opening during a voltage change,

180
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:45,079
you can either be fast activating
or slow activating.

181
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:49,518
Closing while the voltage is on,

182
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:53,793
you can have fast inactivating
or slow inactivating

183
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:58,028
and then how does it recover

184
00:10:58,228 --> 00:11:00,904
after or close after activation.

185
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:04,571
Fast deactivating,
slow deactivating.

186
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:07,216
So you can see now
if you combine,

187
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,747
the combinatorics of combining
this can give you a rich,

188
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:15,449
a very rich diversity
of ion channel kinetics.

189
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:21,731
Now, this rich diversity of kinetics

190
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,611
is very powerful, because if you
combine them in different ways,

191
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:29,180
you can produce neurons with many different
electrical behaviors and properties.

192
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,067
Now unfortunately, at this stage,

193
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:38,307
there isn't a comprehensive
data set of every channel kinetic

194
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:40,900
which we can introduce into a cell

195
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,847
and we are building this and it will
be completed in the next few years.

196
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:50,449
In the meantime,
what we do is we look at classes

197
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:53,491
with build models of classes of channels

198
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:56,218
and we just call them
transient channels

199
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:59,315
or persistent channels
of calcium-activated

200
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,943
and these are basically engineered.

201
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:05,079
So they are engineered channels.

202
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,851
They are not genetically
determined channels.

203
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,115
They are theoretical channels in a way,

204
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,880
but we are replacing these channels

205
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,310
and then you have a neuron
that is very accurate.

206
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:20,563
What is important in relationship
with what I told you about yesterday

207
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:22,888
or in the previous lectures

208
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,076
is that, you can do this

209
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:31,524
and then still fit
the electrical behavior of the neuron,

210
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,528
but what you won't be
able to do is tell

211
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:38,881
what is the significance
of the ion channels.

212
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:42,421
The only purpose,
the ion channel serves is to give you

213
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:45,677
neurons that behave the way
that they behave in the brain

214
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:48,185
and then you can use those neurons
in circuits

215
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:50,666
and you can tell what neurons
are doing in circuits,

216
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:52,735
but not what
the ion channels are doing.

217
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:56,249
So that is what limits
your interpretation of your...

218
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:58,189
...simulation results.

219
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:01,071
Here is Channelpedia.
You can go there.

220
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:04,338
There is a big database
of all the channels,

221
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,408
giving you literature,
telling you about the channels

222
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:11,955
as well as the models
and there are Hodgkin-Huxley models

223
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,583
and Markov models that you can download.

224
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:18,142
You are going to learn how
to do this in later courses.

225
00:13:18,634 --> 00:13:20,532
How to build
the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

226
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:23,856
So the beauty of having many
different types of ion channels

227
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:27,062
is that it depends
on how you mix them.

228
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:31,394
You can create voltage shapes.

229
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:35,242
All kinds of voltage shapes.
You can create bursting behavior

230
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:38,653
and you can shape the way
the neuron is going to behave

231
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:42,046
and here is just
an idea showing you that, you know,

232
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:45,168
depending on what kind
of sodium channel you have,

233
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:48,644
it will determine
how fast the voltage rises.

234
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:52,928
It will determine whether
the action potential gets smaller

235
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:55,973
with each successive one
or stays the same

236
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:58,080
with each successive one

237
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,680
and depending on the voltage activated
potassium channels,

238
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,547
it will decide on many things.
How fast you return,

239
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,320
how deep the return is,

240
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,120
what is called
the afterhyperpolarization potential

241
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:16,453
and whether a new spike can occur
or not occur.

242
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,430
So all these channels,
they really serve to control

243
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,063
many features of the way
the voltage is going to change.
