1
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:08,004
So, to conclude,
you have learned

2
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:09,947
a number of things
in this session.

3
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:13,159
First, we've looked at
the challenges of data integration

4
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:16,779
in neuroscience
and a number of approaches to

5
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:18,294
address them.

6
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:21,247
We've looked at different ways
to run data integration

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,689
there are different
models that you can use.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,495
There's the fixed data model
which has some limitations that

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,753
have been issues in the past.

10
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:33,752
We have the user control,
the main design that will give

11
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:35,954
the full flexibility
to the scientist

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,261
to really design their model
and really capture precisely

13
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:43,711
the domain they are working on,
but also we have seen the power

14
00:00:43,908 --> 00:00:46,245
in re-using existing domains

15
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:49,294
and vocabularies
to support your efforts

16
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:51,307
and make your data integration

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,650
compatible with
the rest of the community's.

18
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:57,198
Finally we've looked at
the Blue Brain Nexus'

19
00:00:57,414 --> 00:01:00,577
capabilities and how it
enables data integration.

20
00:01:00,778 --> 00:01:03,190
There were several aspects to this.

21
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:07,861
The ability to have an expert
designing their own model

22
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:11,985
to re-use existing domains,
to publish and search data

23
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:16,904
and finally, to discover new
data sets that are similar

24
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:20,465
or related to those you know.
