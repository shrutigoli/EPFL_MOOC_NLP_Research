1
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:07,919
Until now, we had the passive model.

2
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:10,076
Passive model means that
we only had the capacitance

3
00:00:10,272 --> 00:00:13,109
in a leakage
conductance in our model.

4
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:16,024
To make our model active,
we're going to introduce two new

5
00:00:16,205 --> 00:00:18,267
components to our model.

6
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:21,927
Namely sodium conductance,
and the potassium conductance.

7
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:26,009
As you can see,
the conductance of these channels

8
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:29,587
is slightly different compared
to the leakage conductance.

9
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:33,746
Leakage conductance had
a fixed conductance value

10
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:38,465
but the sodium and potassium
conductances are voltage dependent.

11
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:41,919
This means that we can have
like feedback mechanisms that

12
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:43,885
create action potential.

13
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:47,085
So now, we have a voltage
dependent sodium channel

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,827
and the voltage dependent
potassium channel.

15
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:54,450
These conductances can be
composed into smaller components

16
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,125
namely, the maximum
conductance of the sodium channel

17
00:00:58,346 --> 00:01:05,634
which is not voltage dependent, and
voltage dependent state variable M

18
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:11,467
and for potassium it's H,
which are ruled by their own

19
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:14,710
differential equations.

20
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:18,295
This maximum conductance of sodium
also called the GNABAR

21
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,006
and for potassium GKABAR

22
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:23,639
are expressed in Siemens
per square centimeter.

23
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:26,807
They basically represent
the density of the ion channels

24
00:01:27,027 --> 00:01:28,565
on the membrane.

25
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:32,679
So now, let's try to set these
two values that are not zero.

26
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,046
So for example, 0.01 for potassium,
and 0.1 for sodium.

27
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:41,393
And then we run our model.

28
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:44,677
You see now, that we created
action potentials.

29
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:50,251
So here, we basically have
a sodium current that

30
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:55,879
creates a feedback mechanism
which causes the voltage to go up

31
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:57,735
very quickly.

32
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,147
To explain what
happens here a bit better

33
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:02,973
we can look at the reversal
potentials of the sodium 

34
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:05,395
and the potassium
and the leak current.

35
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,917
So basically, we have a 50mV
sodium reversal potential

36
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:14,703
-77mV for potassium,
and -65mV for the leak.

37
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,522
So basically,
in the beginning of the spike

38
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:19,568
we have the sodium
channels that open

39
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:22,761
which pulls 50mV in the cell.

40
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:28,387
These sodium channels get
inactivated and at the same time

41
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,520
you also have the potassium
channels that open

42
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:33,578
and they pull back
the voltage to -77mV.

43
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,973
When none of these
channels are active

44
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,573
the leakage current predominates

45
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:42,509
and it pulls the cell to -65mV.

46
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:46,334
Now let's see what happens when
we change some of the parameters.

47
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,246
When we change
the value of the GNABAR

48
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:53,275
we can actually influence
the height of the action potential.

49
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:59,907
We can do the same experiment
for many values of GNABAR.

50
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:03,658
Then we can plot the AP height,
or just the maximum voltage

51
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:05,164
in the trace

52
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:09,458
compared to the GNABAR,
and you get this kind of plot.

53
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,884
The two vertical lines show
two values that we used

54
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,250
in the previous plot.

55
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:21,480
Around 0.08 Siemens per square
centimeters for GNABAR

56
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,301
We also see that
there's a discontinuity.

57
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:27,554
This is basically
the conductance at which

58
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,903
the cell starts firing,
I mean, in this case

59
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:36,251
we didn't have any
action potentials generated.

60
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:39,193
So now we have
a little exercise for you.

61
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:43,393
Do the same as in the previous plot,
but for the potassium

62
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:50,046
for this range, and use step size
in this range of 0.001.

63
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:53,755
So try to plot the results
as in the previous graph

64
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,364
as you will see, all the points
are on a linear curve.

65
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:02,113
So try to fit a linear function
to these data points

66
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:05,821
you can actually use the following
function in NUMPY

67
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:08,558
to do the fitting

68
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:13,269
and send us the two
coefficients of this linear curve.
