1
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:09,405
The first important caveat is that
when you have heteromeric channels,

2
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:11,890
the combinations are vast

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,009
which means it is very unlikely
we can measure them all,

4
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:17,421
so we do need to
find indirect ways

5
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,885
to determine the kinetics of
all the heteromeric channels.

6
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:27,336
The second caveat is that to obtain
very good ion channel data,

7
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:30,912
kinetic data, it needs a lot
of standardization.

8
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:33,932
So you will find a big discrepancy
of ion channel data

9
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:36,311
in the literature,

10
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:41,247
and it is largely due to different
standards being applied

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,196
in different laboratories.

12
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:51,028
The third caveat is that
classifications is still

13
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:54,552
a murky ground,
to classify different neurons

14
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,235
electrically, morphologically,
molecularly...

15
00:00:57,452 --> 00:01:02,872
And ultimately we would need
single cell gene expression

16
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:07,202
patterns, what we call single 
cell transcriptomes

17
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:11,215
which is close, but it is
not yet a solved problem.

18
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:17,096
So, to summarize,
in this lecture,

19
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:19,054
you learned a little bit that

20
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,265
there are many different ion
channel genes,

21
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:25,049
that each produce
different kinetics,

22
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,980
the electrical properties of a
neuron is determined

23
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:30,401
by the kinetics of each ion channel,

24
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:33,600
by the combination of ion channels
that you put into a neuron,

25
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:35,261
by the location where you put them,

26
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:40,627
and the densities of each ion
channel type.

27
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:46,966
If you know how the ion channel
genes are expressed in a neuron,

28
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,774
you can actually calculate 
electrical properties.

29
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:54,208
And you also learned how to obtain

30
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,402
the density of neurons,

31
00:01:57,602 --> 00:02:02,054
or at least got an idea how we
obtain density of neurons.

32
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:05,254
Okay, that is it for today.
