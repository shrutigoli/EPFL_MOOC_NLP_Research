1
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:08,178
Until now, we had a single
compartmental model

2
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:11,362
consisting of just the soma.

3
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:15,027
So now, let's start
adding the dendrite.

4
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:21,088
To do this, you create
a new section: dendrite.

5
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:24,953
And we can also
connect it to the soma.

6
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:27,287
In this case,
we're also going to use

7
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:29,366
the nine compartments
for the dendrite

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,932
instead of just one compartment.

9
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,657
Again, we will add the HH
mechanism to the dendrite

10
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:39,971
but we'll add a passive dendrite,
meaning that we'll disable

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
the sodium and
potassium conductances.

12
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:45,581
So now let's look
at what the effect is

13
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:48,786
of adding this dendrite
to our simulation.

14
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:51,650
We will run the simulation twice

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,427
once with and once
without the dendrite.

16
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:59,406
As you can see, adding the dendrite
has disabled our action potential.

17
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:02,933
This current passes through
two resistances.

18
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:07,569
One is the resistance
of the leak channel

19
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:12,242
and the other is the resistance
of the internal medium

20
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:15,854
inside the dendrite and the soma.

21
00:01:16,232 --> 00:01:19,170
The resistance of
the internal medium

22
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:22,899
of the soma and the dendrites
can be set by the RA variable

23
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:25,068
in the neuron.

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,921
So now, I have a question for you.

25
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:29,506
What happened here?

26
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:33,791
Why are there no action potentials
anymore after adding the dendrite?

27
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:37,207
What could be do to save
the action potentials?

28
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:40,372
I also have a little
exercise for you.

29
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,958
Try to save the action potentials in

30
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:45,901
the soma after you've
disconnected the dendrite

31
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:52,310
by changing the values of "dend_ra"
and "dend_gl" in the code below.

32
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:55,873
While the action potential

33
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,342
is traveling along
this passive dendrite

34
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:00,806
it's height will be attenuated.

35
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:03,008
To show this, we can plot a voltage

36
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:06,215
at different locations
along the dendrite.

37
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:10,452
And we can also make a summary plot

38
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,263
a plot of the percentage
of dendritic length

39
00:02:13,454 --> 00:02:15,667
we are calling from against
the maximum voltage

40
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:19,013
and you will see that you have
an attenuation graph.
