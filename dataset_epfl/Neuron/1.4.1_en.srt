1
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:09,499
In this lecture, we are going to
look at synaptic connections

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,860
how do we characterize
a synaptic connection and briefly

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,662
look at what stochastic synaptic
transmission is and some caveats.

4
00:00:19,892 --> 00:00:24,033
So first of all before we go into
looking at synaptic connections

5
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,411
it is important to understand
the location of synapses.

6
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:36,571
Where they are is extremely
important for what the cell body

7
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:42,382
will sense and hence react when
it sends the input further.

8
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:46,069
So, the location is
a very important feature

9
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:49,902
and it is not just
enough to say neuron

10
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,596
A is connected
to neuron B.

11
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:57,031
In the case of
detailed morphology

12
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,045
the location is
extremely important.

13
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:00,282
And here what you see

14
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:02,159
is experiments very
elegant experiments

15
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,013
done by Stewart and Sakmann,
where they put an electrode

16
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:10,653
into the cell body, and then
an electrode into the dendrites

17
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:15,895
and they evoke this
action potential in the cell body

18
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:20,543
and it traveled backwards,
because we can see the delay

19
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:23,284
and then you see it
in the dendrite after

20
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:25,299
so it basically travels back and

21
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,638
it is called the back-propagating
action potential.

22
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:33,217
This is very important because
this is a signal that mediates

23
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:35,359
plasticity and many,
many other things

24
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,668
and it is a very important part...
a lot of learning theory today.

25
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:44,768
So, this is a key experiment
that is related

26
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:48,799
to the current understanding
of how neurons learn

27
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,222
but it also illustrates that

28
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:57,279
if this propagates
back with a delay

29
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:01,052
it is going to hit different
synapses at different times

30
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,924
so synapses that are sitting
at different places could be

31
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:08,122
effected in very
different ways when

32
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:10,280
action potentials
propagate back.

33
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:12,652
This is another example

34
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:15,845
if you had an input
here in the dendrite

35
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,360
and you inject a sharp
current in the dendrite

36
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:21,873
then this is what you
see in the cell body.

37
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,605
Iran Segev is going
to give you all the theory

38
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:27,437
and the mathematics behind what
happens from here to here

39
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:32,360
but for now what is
important to understand is

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,797
that if you had synapes
here it is quite different

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,490
from having a synapse here,
so location is important

42
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,081
and this rationale is
important for how

43
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:41,827
your characterize
a connection.

44
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:46,938
In the neocortex, there is
actually only one connection

45
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:51,412
out of thousands that
could exist, that has been

46
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:54,215
fully and extensively
characterized

47
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,539
and even in our lab
we only did it once

48
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,054
and then we did it with less
and less data subsequently

49
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:07,148
so this is this paper which is
a comprehensive characterization

50
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:11,436
and I will use it to illustrate what
would be a sort of a comprehensive

51
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:14,278
characterization of
a synaptic connection.

52
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:20,055
So you record from two neurons,
this is your one pipette

53
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:24,336
your second pipette,
and then this is the action axon

54
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:27,446
going from one cell,
and they have collaterals

55
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:31,354
which you can't see here, and these
collaterals move up and they touch,

56
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:39,651
they form synapses on this other neuron,
and when you excite this cell

57
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:43,193
you produce an action potential

58
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:47,387
then in this cell you see
this response occurring

59
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,872
and every time there is
an action potential

60
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:53,746
you can see sometimes
it is a small response

61
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,683
sometimes it is a bigger response,
and a bigger response

62
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:03,088
and so this cell is sending
a message to this cell

63
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:09,106
but it is receiving it with
a different delay and latency

64
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:13,838
which is here, it takes about
one and a half millisecond

65
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:18,588
for the information to get across
to the cell, but there is a distribution

66
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:23,666
and it also has different amplitudes

67
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:30,634
so stochastic in its sense is it has different
amplitudes and different latencies

68
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:32,560
and we are going
to explore why.

69
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:37,086
You can do a much more higher
resolution view where you have

70
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:40,516
what we call
a pre-synaptic spike

71
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:42,070
and then you can look at

72
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,651
the response and
you can characterize

73
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,508
exactly this delay across
many different connections.

74
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:50,365
Previously it was just in one
connection you can see these delays

75
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:53,652
but now you can see
across many connections

76
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:57,229
and you can see
there is a lot of range.

77
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:00,945
So, some cells will
take one millisecond

78
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:02,574
to communicate
with another cell

79
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:07,258
other cells may take six milliseconds
to communicate, the same types of cells,

80
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:11,852
we got this big range of
time delays between neurons.

81
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:16,508
Some responses
will be very short

82
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:21,085
and some responses will
also rise very slowly

83
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:24,006
so they could go very
fast up and down

84
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,467
where they could go
slowly up and slowly down.

85
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:33,765
The amplitude also
varies a lot, up to six

86
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:37,193
actually we have even recorded
even up to about 12mV

87
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:38,904
for this kind
of connection

88
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:41,948
but most of them
around 1mV range.

89
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,760
So, typically, when one neuron
connects to another neuron

90
00:05:45,023 --> 00:05:51,872
it excites it, it is producing a
1mV depolarization,

91
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:56,386
what we call an excitatory
post-synaptic potential.

92
00:05:57,182 --> 00:06:00,929
We can go a little bit further,
and when you study these carefully,

93
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:05,072
so you are triggering the spike here
and you look at the response

94
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:08,444
and then sometime it fails,
nothing happens.

95
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:14,132
If you look at
the amplitudes that you get

96
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:18,746
you either get nothing
or you get a distribution

97
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:22,819
so you get a range
of amplitudes that

98
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,287
can be generated
inside a single cell

99
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,948
but then you have
many connections

100
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,619
where most of them don't fail.

101
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:30,779
So, this is rare for this
type of connection
where most of them don't fail.

102
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:33,686
So, this is rare for this
type of connection

103
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:36,011
but there are many
others that fail

104
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,517
and some of them can
have very high failure rate

105
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:41,637
so they try to communicate
but nothing is getting through.

106
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:47,903
Here you can see an example,
also, of a very strong connection,

107
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:54,246
it is about 6.4 - 6.45 millivolts,
but even on each trial there is

108
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,245
a change in the amplitude
and this is

109
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:56,358
the range of the amplitude,
as you can see.
a change in the amplitude
and this is

110
00:06:56,358 --> 00:07:00,052
the range of the amplitude,
as you can see.

111
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:05,424
So, when neurons communicate
they communicate with a jitter

112
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:09,975
a range from 1ms to 6ms,
and the amplitude can range

113
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:17,142
anything from 1mV to 12mV,
and we need to understand

114
00:07:17,142 --> 00:07:20,517
those mechanisms and how
to recreate those mechanisms.

115
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:29,207
Okay so when you stain these neurons

116
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:30,970
as we explained before
how you stain them,

117
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,613
you load a dye
into these cells,

118
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:35,927
this is a photograph under

119
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,487
a microscope when
you have developed

120
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,611
this dye like a photograph, so
you can see these cells.

121
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:47,393
You can follow the axon
and their collaterals here

122
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:52,672
you can follow them,
and you can identify where the axon

123
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:56,501
is touching the dendrite
of the other cell.

124
00:07:57,116 --> 00:08:00,998
And these areas are what
we call putative synapses

125
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:06,002
because at the light microscope
level you can't identify

126
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,170
whether it is real synapses or not,
you can just say that because the axon

127
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:16,582
is passing by
and touching a dendrite

128
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:20,688
and the axon is forming what
is called a bouton,

129
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:24,560
it is very likely that that is
going to be a synapse.

130
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:28,864
But this can be verified
by looking and doing

131
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:31,926
an electron-microscopic analysis

132
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:37,389
and here you see
the pre-synaptic side with vesicles,

133
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:42,389
these are synaptic vesicles
you see here, and this is the cleft.

134
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:45,203
It is very difficult in
experiments like

135
00:08:45,203 --> 00:08:46,892
this to get very high quality
electro markers,

136
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:52,028
EM pictures,
and this is the synapse

137
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,108
this is the post-synaptic side.

138
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:59,502
So you can verify that,
what we call physical touches

139
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:03,329
are actual synapses at
the electro-microscopic level.

140
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:05,816
Now, what is important
in this is that

141
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:09,475
when we did this analysis where
it immediately became clear

142
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:13,858
is that one neuron
connects with

143
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:17,271
another neuron by
putting many synapses.

144
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:24,997
So, this is not a point contact,
it is a hand contact.

145
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:31,970
Lots of synapses onto
a single neuron.

146
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:37,519
And this is extremely important
because it is a very strong rule

147
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:43,534
in the neocortex and you will
see that this rule later

148
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:48,435
is one of the most important rules
that allows you to actually predict

149
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:50,247
connectivity in the whole circuit.

150
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:50,426
This is what is called
the multi-synapse rule
connectivity in the whole circuit.

151
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:53,716
This is what is called
the multi-synapse rule

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,983
and we are going
to discuss it

153
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:59,577
a lot more about that in the future.

154
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:03,908
The number of
connections varies

155
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,499
between the different
pairs of cells

156
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:11,498
some of them can have
an average of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

157
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,638
sometimes 10 connections

158
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:17,183
so this is the distribution
that you see.

159
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:21,576
The probability that one
neuron will connect

160
00:10:21,576 --> 00:10:28,002
with another neuron is also
quite low, it is around Pc=0.1

161
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:35,365
or 10% and we will discuss
in future lectures

162
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:37,779
what combining this knowledge

163
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,671
with this knowledge
means for connectivity.

164
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:43,389
It has actually a lot
of relevance

165
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,204
for understanding how
neurons connect with each other.

166
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:48,270
So, this is just a view.

167
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:51,419
You can see that when
multiple neurons connect

168
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:54,267
there is a cloud of
synapses that are formed

169
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:54,361
so you can imagine when
one neuron communicates
there is a cloud of
synapses that are formed

170
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,502
so you can imagine when
one neuron communicates

171
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:59,453
with all these others, it is
actually triggering lots

172
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:04,222
and lots of little voltages
in all the other neurons.

173
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:07,951
So this is not going to
reveal how synapses work

174
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:11,747
this you should
read up in textbooks

175
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:15,788
but just to remind you,
you have the axon coming in

176
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,856
it forms a bouton, actually
pretty much it doesn't look like this,

177
00:11:19,856 --> 00:11:26,030
it has a bouton and the bouton
has got mitochondria

178
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,435
which you also see here,
they are the powerhouses

179
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:31,623
they produce ATP
so that this thing can run

180
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,169
it is below a micron, it is like
half a micron typically

181
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:42,658
and when the action potential
propagates down the axon,

182
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:46,783
it gets here, the voltage
shocks the release of these vesicles

183
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:48,969
and the chemical,

184
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:51,342
the neuro-transmitter,
diffuses to the other side

185
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:54,717
in this case Glutamate in
the excitatory connection

186
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:59,045
and it activates receptors,
different kinds of receptors

187
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:01,869
here, AMPA, NMDA, Kainite

188
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:04,804
and when these receptors are

189
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,647
activated they
open and ions flow in.

190
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:13,820
Sodium, potassium may flow out,
calcium may flow in and so on.

191
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:19,256
But, let's look a little bit
at the synaptic dynamics

192
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:23,543
so as we said,
we have one neuron

193
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:34,297
it has in this case six synapses,
and if you isolate

194
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:38,057
and this you can do in the model,
you isolate each of these

195
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:42,827
that are located at different
places, on the (INAUDIBLE) right

196
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:48,243
and you look at this one individually
and this one individually

197
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,664
you can see that they have
very different behaviors.

198
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:57,258
Different amplitudes,
different rise times

199
00:12:57,258 --> 00:13:01,012
delay times, and what
you see in the cell body

200
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:02,771
is also quite different.

201
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:08,915
So, the location is very important
and one has to bare in mind

202
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:09,241
that when the single neuron
communicates with a cell
So, the location is very important
and one has to bare in mind

203
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:12,131
that when the single neuron
communicates with a cell

204
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:16,447
each of the "fingers" that
are communicating is actually

205
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:19,652
exerting a different effect
on the target cell.

206
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,426
Okay, let's briefly look at stochastic
synaptic transmission.

207
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:26,631
This is a very big field as well,
and there is a lot of

208
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:31,521
very interesting ways to analyze
how synapses work

209
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:38,711
and you use methods
called quantal analysis, where

210
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,027
for example if only one vesicle
or one synapse fired

211
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:46,192
you would see this sort of

212
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:50,526
response and that would
be called the quantal size.

213
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:58,805
If two fired synapses are released,
you would see a double amplitude

214
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,539
if three, you would see a triple,
and so on.

215
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,507
And in systems where these are
very nice and clearly separated

216
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:11,083
you see these bumps.

217
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,402
But in the central nervous system,
in the neocortex

218
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:19,603
because the synapses are in
different places in the dendrites

219
00:14:19,873 --> 00:14:21,709
this becomes blurred

220
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:25,005
and you basically see
a very blurry distribution.

221
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:27,599
So it is very difficult to do what is
called quantal analysis

222
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:32,452
in central nervous
system neurons

223
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:36,923
and it is important if you can
do it because you can

224
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:41,828
actually identify how many vesicles,
what is the amplitude

225
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,528
what we call the quantal size

226
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:47,029
how much impact does
a single vesicle have

227
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,780
or a single synapse have
on the post-synaptic side.

228
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:55,856
As an exercise,
try to answer for yourself

229
00:14:56,124 --> 00:14:57,482
the following question.

230
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:03,327
What is the probability of
successful transmission

231
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:07,676
if you have five synapses
in a connection,

232
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:14,485
and each with a probability of
0.5 of releasing when

233
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:17,076
an action potential
comes along?

234
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:21,131
So, you got five synapses,
each one has the probability

235
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:23,389
of 50% chance of releasing.

236
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,094
What is the chance that you
will have a complete failure?

237
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:31,202
Or what is the chance that
it will always be a success?

238
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:37,950
Also calculate what is
the mean amplitude

239
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:40,957
if each quantal size was just one.

240
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,191
So what would be
the average five,

241
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:46,622
each one with
the 0.5 probability,

242
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:49,673
they each produce
one if they worked

243
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:51,606
what would be the average?

244
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:54,668
And calculate what is

245
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:57,638
the coefficient of variation
of the transmission.

246
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:00,940
If you need help,
look at this paper.

247
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:03,553
Okay, let's look
at some caveats.

248
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:11,169
So, the first caveats is
that it is very difficult

249
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:13,490
to obtain detailed
characterizations

250
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,716
of synaptic connections.

251
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:18,328
What I showed you
is one connection

252
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:20,939
that is being extensively
characterized

253
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,513
and since then we have only
partially characterized up to

254
00:16:25,814 --> 00:16:27,765
about twenty-two
other connections.

255
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:30,950
And there are
hundreds that remain

256
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:33,778
and that is one of the reason why
I have to do reconstruction

257
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,552
because you can actually predict
most of those others now

258
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:38,598
and that is what we are going
to do during the course

259
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:42,077
of this MOOC and illustrate
how that is done.

260
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,359
You also cannot verify easily

261
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:50,888
that when an axon
touches a dendrite

262
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,923
that it is a real synapse

263
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:56,247
and you can't always do
electron microscopy.

264
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:59,015
So, you do have to
have data that

265
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:01,642
tells you what is your confidence
that this is a synapse.

266
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,236
And then the last caveat is
that the classical quantal analysis

267
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:11,097
where you can kind of peel
out what is the effective

268
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:14,895
and individual synaptic vesicle
or an individua synapse

269
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,969
and the probability
that it is releasing

270
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:19,391
the size that it is releasing

271
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:24,583
and how the whole connection
works is quite difficult

272
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:28,052
because of the uncertainty
about the locations,

273
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:30,009
the locations are distributed

274
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:33,706
the number of vesicles
that are released

275
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:35,523
maybe one or two or three

276
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:37,995
and then you may
have many synapses.

277
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:41,035
So, these things make
the quantal analysis

278
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:43,274
more difficult in central
nervous system

279
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,800
but it is not impossible

280
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,034
there are statistical
approaches around it.

281
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:52,964
And to summarize what we
learned in this lecture,

282
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:55,648
the most important thing to

283
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:57,473
remember is all
synaptic connections

284
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:59,831
in the neocortex are
multi-synapse connections

285
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,822
they are hand connections,
they are not finger connections.

286
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:07,100
Synaptic responses vary

287
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,174
because every release
site is probabilistic,

288
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:15,471
the vesicle can release
probabilistically,

289
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:19,706
different synapses can
behave probabilistically,

290
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,519
the size of the vesicle
can also vary slightly

291
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:26,273
not hugely, but slightly

292
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,695
and then the locations
of the synapses

293
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:31,158
on the dendrites
can vary a lot.

294
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:39,204
The third piece of information
that you learned here

295
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,766
was that the number of
the synapses per connections

296
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:46,295
depends on the type of
connection, so if I have...

297
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:50,484
I showed you an example,
where it is just parametal cells

298
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,359
and they may form between
3 and 8 connections

299
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,280
if you go to a different
type of cell

300
00:18:57,565 --> 00:19:01,315
it may be between
5 and 20 synapses

301
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:04,831
and so every pair
actually has its own

302
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,469
range of numbers
of connections.

303
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:14,530
And then lastly, because of
stochasticity in both

304
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:21,601
the latency and amplitude vary,
with the action potential

305
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:27,253
one has to bear in mind that it is
a really very noisy signal

306
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:29,547
that is being transmitted from
one neuron to another.

307
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:33,140
Okay, that is it for this lecture.
