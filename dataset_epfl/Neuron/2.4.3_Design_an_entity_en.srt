1
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:08,821
In the next part, I have
already done this

2
00:00:09,229 --> 00:00:11,129
design, and I'm going to
present it to you now.

3
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:13,992
So here are the entities

4
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:17,192
and the specific fields we're
going to put on them.

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,301
So, if you remember,

6
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:24,493
we had drawn a first entity
I called rat. 

7
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:29,831
And just for the sake of having
something sufficiently generic,

8
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,058
I've called it here,
Specimen

9
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:36,296
so we could also later on apply it
to mouse, human, and potentially

10
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:37,973
other species.

11
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:42,849
So the species itself is captured 
through an ontology term

12
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:45,249
as one field, one property.

13
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:48,224
And then we have the strain,
which is another ontology.

14
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:51,211
Turns out that these two, we've
already discussed these,

15
00:00:52,578 --> 00:00:55,191
are coming from the NCBI taxonomy,

16
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:57,728
but still thse two fiels are separated.

17
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:00,952
And we need to capture the sex
of the specimen

18
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:02,527
and finally its age.

19
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:06,539
And as you see here, it is not
yet a literal value.

20
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:09,932
For instance, I could have put 14

21
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:12,644
and define that it is always
expressed in days.

22
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:17,719
Here, I want to give a little more 
flexibility to the users of this domain.

23
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,997
And so I have decided to define

24
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,499
another entity called
Specimen Age

25
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:27,311
and so the fields age here, 

26
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:31,917
is of type Specimen Age which 
itself is defined

27
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:34,227
just beside it.

28
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:38,484
And so the Specimen Age is
made of three properties.

29
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:41,351
1) is the value, the specific age.

30
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:44,914
The unit, and here I want to
constrain

31
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:50,001
this value, the unit,
to three potential units

32
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:53,364
can be in days, can be
expressed in months or in years,

33
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,525
and it's a floating value,

34
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:58,725
so you could put 1.5 years
if you wanted, or 3 days

35
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:00,484
just the same.

36
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,692
And finally we have the period
which can be

37
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,242
pre natal or post natal.

38
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:07,192
Again we have constrained the model

39
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:11,392
and only these two values can be
defined in the submitted entity,

40
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:13,755
and if you fail to reuse
one of these,

41
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:17,092
the system will just fail validation
and let you know

42
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,830
so you can correct your
data submission.

43
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,023
Next, we're going to talk
about the neuron.

44
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:26,987
So here, we have defined
simply three properties.

45
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:30,187
The name, because to a scientist
it might be important to give it

46
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:34,558
the name that was used in
the lab or something intelligible 

47
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:37,258
that will speak to the
intended audience

48
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:39,392
that will consume this data.

49
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,930
So we have the name of the neuron
and then we have two more properties:

50
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:47,192
The morphological type, which here
are written shorter as "mtype",

51
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:51,076
which is of type ontology, and we
have an existing cell type

52
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,947
ontology that you can review
at your leisure

53
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:57,759
in the ontology viewer application
I showed in earlier videos.

54
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:00,790
And we have another property 
called "etype",

55
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,465
which is based on the very same
ontology but a different branch

56
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,279
of it.

57
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,701
And as you can see just here,

58
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,461
there is no data attached
to the neuron

59
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:20,761
just like there was no data attached
to the specimen.

60
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:25,191
Next, we have the data set.

61
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:29,375
And here, at this stage,
I didn't see

62
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:32,575
a need to actually differentiate

63
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:37,475
the electrophysiology recording from
the morphology reconstruction

64
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,950
but we could have done.

65
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:42,892
So here I'm going to use
the data sets entity

66
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:46,767
for both these different types
of data sets.

67
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,676
We can give a name
to our data set:

68
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,876
It's just a plain chain of 
characters, string.

69
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,367
We have a category which is based on
the ontology data category.

70
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,954
So far, so good. We have
a mime type

71
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:02,154
which is really the file format
you have used

72
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:05,025
to save your file on disk

73
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,729
after running the experiment

74
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:09,254
that generated the data.

75
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:12,929
And finally a license,
where you can see well

76
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:17,991
whether it is like usable 
commercially or not commercially.

77
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:21,734
And the last thing we need 
to say here is that

78
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:24,934
we want to allow a user
to attach

79
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,497
raw data to a data set.
This is crucial.
