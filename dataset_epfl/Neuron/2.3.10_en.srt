00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,609
In the last part
of this presentation

2
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:10,541
I would like to talk more about
the minimal information

3
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:13,350
about the Neuro-science data set

4
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:19,926
and to start with, I'm just going
to repeat what MINDS,

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,972
a MINDS-compliant data set
should include.

6
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:25,805
It should define

7
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:27,953
the specimen it has been
generated from

8
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,628
and this should include
the age of the specimen

9
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,375
its sex, the species, the strain.

10
00:00:33,578 --> 00:00:36,928
And again, you should already be
recognizing some of these elements,

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,288
these three, for instance

12
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,799
we've already seen that
they have vocabulary existing

13
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:45,503
to define these things.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,212
The concept of
an entity classification

15
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:52,088
such as cell types for NEURON

16
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:57,274
the concept of a brain location,
whether you want to use

17
00:00:57,445 --> 00:01:01,445
and ontologycal term
to define a logical area

18
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:03,776
or even spacial coordinates if you

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,783
happen to have this
precise information.

20
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:12,792
You want to have the contributors
that enable the generation 

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,735
of these data sets
and their affiliations

22
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:17,397
so you can leave credits to them.

23
00:01:17,873 --> 00:01:20,348
You want to define
the method and parameters

24
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:24,940
used to generate the data,
and the dates they were created on.

25
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:27,181
You want to describe
the data category

26
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:31,116
and the specific data format
you have used to save this data.

27
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:34,046
You want to describe
how to access the data

28
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,028
so where is it stored,
and the format.

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,260
And finally you want
the licence information

30
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,647
so someone can inform himself

31
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,850
about whether they can
re-use this information.

32
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:53,037
So what are the benefits of
a MINDS-compliant data set?

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,335
First, you have to see MINDS
as a very useful tool

34
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:02,059
that creates a community consensus,
as to how to describe

35
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:07,362
in the context of neuro-science,
the properties of a data set

36
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:10,118
and some of these properties
are extremely useful

37
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,318
and we'll actually see
why in the next slide.

38
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:19,324
Next, that provides us consistency
in the process of integrating the data

39
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:23,011
into a platform,
so if we really enforce

40
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:26,651
this MINDS compliance,
you know that all your data sets

41
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:31,776
will have a specimen,
and for instance, the brain region,

42
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,623
and people typically
are very focused on

43
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:38,118
the specimen and
the very specific parts of the brain

44
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:41,560
and that really enables them
to find other data sets

45
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:46,713
that can really help them
move forward in their research.

46
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,347
It gives power to
the search facilities

47
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:53,107
by just having this consistency

48
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:57,791
in the type of information stored,
and the vocabularies being used 

49
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,455
to define them,

50
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,989
it gives a lot of power
to the search facilities.

51
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:06,069
And finally it is really a medium
to find similar and related data sets

52
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:09,502
and this is really the next part
we're going to look at.

53
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:13,082
So here, I have listed
quite a few examples

54
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:17,901
of similarity
and relatedness examples

55
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:21,543
that can be leveraged from simply
annotating your data sets

56
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,293
following the MINDS recommendations,
so I'm just going to list them

57
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:27,782
and illustrate
where appropriate.

58
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,961
So, you could find data sets
that came from the same species

59
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:35,769
but different strains,
different kinds of rats for instance.

60
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:43,468
You could also search for data sets
located in nearby brain regions.

61
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:46,224
You can look for
the same brain regions

62
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:49,050
but in different species or strain.

63
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:52,950
You can use a neuron with
a broder cell classification

64
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:56,682
so for instance,
your neuron may have been

65
00:03:56,928 --> 00:04:01,990
categorized as the Martinotti cell,
but now you want to look at neurons

66
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,849
that are not only Martinotti cells,
but more generally inhibitory cells.

67
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:10,693
So again, playing with
the hierarchy of your ontology.

68
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:13,114
This is something you can do.

69
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:16,801
You can look at other data
categories in the same brain region

70
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:21,871
because bringing different angles
to the data you're currently using

71
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:26,391
you might strengthen your
position in discovering something.

72
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:31,326
You could use the same data category
but in a different brain region

73
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:34,490
for instance you have
electro-physiology in the thalamus

74
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:38,354
and you want to get
the electro-physiology data sets

75
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:43,245
in a different brain region and make
a comparison between them.

76
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:46,019
What is different between
these two brain regions?

77
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,444
You could use another data set
by the same lab

78
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:52,046
or contributor,
or finally

79
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,195
another data set generated
with the exact same protocol 

80
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:58,665
or derived protocol.
