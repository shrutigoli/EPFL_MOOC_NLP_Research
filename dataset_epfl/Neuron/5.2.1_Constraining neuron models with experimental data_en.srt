00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:07,052
Hello, welcome to this week's MOOC

2
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:09,867
on constraining neuronal models
with experimental data

3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,773
My name is Felix Schumann,
I'm a Professor at EPFL

4
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:14,423
working at the Blue Brain Project

5
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:17,223
where for the last couple of years
we've been working

6
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:20,708
on the reconstruction and simulation
of realistic neuronal tissue.

7
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,624
In today's part of the MOOC

8
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:25,613
we will recap the different
mathematical levels

9
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:29,359
of abstraction that are useful
to describe neuronal behavior.

10
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:30,833
And I'll make the point

11
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:33,533
that the multi-compartment
Hodgkin-Huxley formalism

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,983
that were described in other parts
of the MOOC

13
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:38,983
are a good starting point
for realistic neuron models.

14
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:41,699
We'll be talking about experimental
data sets

15
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:44,213
that can help us
to parameterize these models

16
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:47,037
and the challenges that occur
in that process

17
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:49,755
That should keep us busy
for this part of the MOOC

18
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,933
So, if you have a neuron in mind
which you want to model

19
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:57,457
and in this case it's a layer
five parametal cell of a young rat

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,418
and what we want to model

21
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:02,984
is for example,
how would the somatic recording

22
00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:05,268
from the step current ejection
look like

23
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:07,253
how an axe potential is generated

24
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:10,350
or something similar,
rather electrical behavior.

25
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:14,111
You have different possibilities
to try to cast that

26
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,561
into a mathematical model,

27
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:19,126
and it starts with simply modeling
the cell body,

28
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,173
the passive electrical properties
of that,

29
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:27,327
and use the template mechanism
activated

30
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:31,285
after crossing a certain threshold
to initiate an action potential.

31
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:36,387
Or, you can go to the Hodgkin-Huxley
formalism

32
00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:40,542
that extends these types of modeling
with active conductancies

33
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:42,781
for sodium and potassium currents

34
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:45,099
and allows to describe
the action potential

35
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,181
as an emergent property
of the electrical system.

36
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:51,918
Or, you can extend
that further and say

37
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:54,348
“I'm not only modeling
a single compartment"

38
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:58,079
"but I would like to have the formalism
to describe the dendritic tree"

39
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:00,384
"and the cable equation of that.”

40
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:03,813
And this was described
for example by Idan

41
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:07,455
with the Rall equations for using

42
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:10,219
combining the Rall equations
with the Hodgkin-Huxley equations

43
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:16,786
to have a full bio-physical model
of spatially extended neuron

44
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:19,123
with an action potential generated

45
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:24,440
by the bio-physically
correct conductancies.

46
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:26,700
But it doesn't stop there necessarily.

47
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,560
You can imagine that you can go
into even more detail

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,001
and sort of include bio-chemical
reactions, electric fusion

49
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:36,979
and the Lygen Gedinsen cascades
or other things,

50
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:40,429
and then you would have to change
the mathematical formalism again

51
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:44,558
and would have to characterize yet
other properties that lead to

52
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:47,375
for example, something like
an action potential.

53
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:49,675
For the purpose of this MOOC,
we will stick

54
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,391
with the multi-compartment
Hodgkin-Huxley formalism,

55
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,695
essentially for two reasons:
on the one hand

56
00:02:54,895 --> 00:03:00,316
computationally speaking,
it is still the simplest mechanism

57
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:04,308
that can capture spatially
extended features of a neuron

58
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:07,807
and treat the electrical behavior
as an emergent property.

59
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:11,029
At the same time, it has enough hooks

60
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:14,106
in terms of the individual
compartments it's modeling

61
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:16,744
and the different conductances
you can add

62
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:21,661
that it is very amenable
to include new bio-physical detail.

63
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:23,768
And it's exactly these two properties

64
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,819
that it's computationally
still tractable

65
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,198
and yet on the other hand allows
to include a lot of bio-physical detail

66
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:32,189
that make this formalism
very interesting

67
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,961
for realistic neuron modeling.

68
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:39,189
When spanning the timeline
from the original experiments

69
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,658
and modeling of Hodgkin and Huxley

70
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,619
then the theory of Rall

71
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,443
to today, there are an important
number of milestones

72
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:49,055
for this type of modeling

73
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:51,567
which I think I briefly
would like to capture.

74
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,226
On the one hand,
in the end of the 70s

75
00:03:54,526 --> 00:04:01,232
Roger Traub and Llinas started
to extend the level of detail

76
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:04,648
of the cable equations
that resolved up until that date.

77
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:08,394
But note the type of geometries
you see here

78
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:11,189
are still very much motivated

79
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,671
by making the geometries
more realistic

80
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,471
but still as simple as possible.

81
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:19,885
So here, you see still see
the two thirds Power Law,

82
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:24,187
for example, that simplifies certain
mathematical equations.

83
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,264
This is a hippocampal motor neuron

84
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:30,968
and at the time this was computed
on a mid-frame computer.

85
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:34,437
In the same year,
for different morphology here,

86
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:36,665
we're talking now
about a Purkinje cell frog,

87
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:39,374
these simplifications no longer held:

88
00:04:39,604 --> 00:04:43,164
so here the dendritic tree
it doesn't show these symmetries

89
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:46,801
and therefore,
this model has about 60 compartments

90
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:52,615
and does treat these compartments
in their detail,

91
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:57,764
having to solve the full compartmental
equations in Hodgkin and Huxley.

92
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:00,898
It took another couple of years

93
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:05,049
before the morphologies
went really detailed

94
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:08,871
and so this is now work
by Eric De Schutter and Jim Bower

95
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,585
on the Purkinje cell

96
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:13,811
and here we now
have a full dendritic reconstruction

97
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:15,939
of the Purkinje cell tree

98
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:20,284
And the neuron model they did here
had 1,600 compartments,

99
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:24,733
ten different channel types,
with differential channel densities,

100
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:31,046
recreating multiple different parts
of observed behavior of that neuron.

101
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,429
And lastly,
yet a couple of years later,

102
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:37,265
Mainen and Sejnowski
had modeled a parametal cell

103
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,950
where essentially they could show

104
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,936
that the change
in somatic firing you see,

105
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,427
which is of course

106
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:48,607
for example mediated
through different channels

107
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,296
for different channel densities,
that alone

108
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:54,345
a dendritic tree can influence
the somatic firing pattern.

109
00:05:54,545 --> 00:06:00,325
So, what we see here in these last
decades of detailed modeling

110
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:03,672
that on the one hand
the computational available power

111
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:07,201
from mid-frame to personal computers
to more powerful computers,

112
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,499
thanks to Moore's Law,

113
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,061
actually allowed to integrate
much more detail,

114
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:14,858
and at the same time of course
that this more computation detail

115
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:19,263
necessitates having more experimental
data available

116
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,970
but at the same time allowing
to integrate more experimental data.

117
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:28,543
So, when we're talking
about realistic neuron modeling today

118
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,522
and constrained neuron models
with experimental data,

119
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:34,897
we have essentially the computational
power available

120
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:38,658
and we can think about primarily
which data sets we can use

121
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:40,218
to constrain the models.

122
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,668
But the starting point
is still very much the same

123
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:46,027
you want to have a certain morphology
for the neuron of interest

124
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:50,522
you have possibly certain
electrical behavior

125
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:53,509
that you've recorded super-threshold,
sub-threshold

126
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,344
from the soma, from the dendrite,

127
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:59,612
and in the end, you'll have to find
how do I constrain all the parameters

128
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:03,431
that are exposed in the multi
compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley model?

129
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,675
So, we're talking about the typology,

130
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,424
the passive properties of the cable,

131
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:12,597
the active conductancies
in the different parts of the tree

132
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:18,247
their behavior and how many of those
conductancies you have where.

133
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:21,995
We will now go through looking
for these different data sets

134
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:25,663
and what are the things you might
want to keep in mind, when using them.

135
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:27,935
We start with the morphologies

136
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:31,856
and first of all a very good source
to get the morphology reconstructed

137
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:34,047
is to go to neuromorpho.org

138
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:38,737
Now we pick here our favorite neuron
which is labeled by parametal cell

139
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:44,448
and the neuron looks beautiful if you
look at it in this XY coordinate frame.

140
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:48,591
But what you should always do that
from seeing a beautiful neuron

141
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,325
on a screen or on a paper

142
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:52,626
that is not the same as saying that

143
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:56,226
the morphology has all the parameters
needed to constrain your model,

144
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:58,793
and this is one example
what could go wrong.

145
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:01,658
So, if you turn this neuron around
by 90 degrees

146
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:05,402
you find suddenly that there's almost
half of the neuron

147
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:08,906
of the dendritic tree
and the axon missing... why is that?

148
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:12,767
Well, this particular neuron
was recorded and stained in slides

149
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,415
and was at a certain depth

150
00:08:14,615 --> 00:08:16,366
at some point the slides ended

151
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:19,616
and that meant that certain parts
of the neuron are shaved off.

152
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:21,298
You don't see that
in this perspective,

153
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:23,698
but you see it when you turn
the neuron around.

154
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:27,207
So, keep in mind that depending
on what was the recording

155
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,257
staining and reconstruction technique,

156
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:32,439
you have to check whether actually
you have all the data

157
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,665
in your experimental data
to constrain your computation model,

158
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:39,159
because it matters whether
that part of the tree is there or not.

159
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,403
Now, the other systematic artifacts
to look out for

160
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:46,471
is some staining and fixation
methods lead to shrinkage

161
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:50,609
or sort of crumbling and that leads
to wiggly branches

162
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:53,043
which again or other artifacts

163
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:56,815
which could have computational
implications in your model.

164
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:58,702
And you always want to make sure

165
00:08:58,902 --> 00:09:01,261
that sort of some other things
like, for example, axons,

166
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:02,579
are they stained in the first place?

167
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,974
Were they reconstructed?
Are they complete?

168
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:06,377
All these things suddenly matter

169
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:08,627
because essentially an axon
which is not there

170
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:12,588
will not parameterize the cable
in your model.

171
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:15,966
Unfortunately, the story
of morphologies does not end there

172
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:19,634
and there are a number
of other little things

173
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,303
that can keep you off track

174
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,018
when using experimental data
to constrain your model.

175
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:28,971
It can start with that
at the reconstruction process

176
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:31,479
the diameter wasn't explicitly given,

177
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,916
it's still the software
might connect two points

178
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:37,675
even though they have zero diameter
with the line,

179
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,076
but electrically
that is not a good parameter

180
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:42,187
to have in your cable equation model,

181
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:44,992
to have a diameter of zero
in a certain compartment.

182
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:49,962
You might see that due to the way
that these reconstructions happen

183
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:53,739
typically from XY and then the Z
is something that's done

184
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:58,487
through scrolling through the stack
of the slides

185
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:04,344
and when reconstructions get started
and resumed and restarted

186
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:07,682
that sort of not always
the reconstructions are fully aligned

187
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:11,994
again in the XY plane you won't see
these types of artifacts.

188
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:16,433
There, sometimes things
like reverse order reconstructions

189
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,816
that sort of things
were traced inside out

190
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:20,824
and not starting from the cell body

191
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:23,108
think again when you look
at the topology

192
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:27,255
of course it matters tremendously
where these different compartments

193
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,946
are connected with each other.

194
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:33,150
At the same time, sometimes some
things are not connected at all;

195
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:37,911
or spines get reconstructed
as single segment sections;

196
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:41,235
or you might find that certain parts
of the morphology

197
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:44,036
get reconstructed several times

198
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,216
again on a visualization
of such a morphology,

199
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,813
that is not an issue
for electrical modeling

200
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:55,887
all these parameters lead to different
properties of your cell model.

201
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:59,933
So, the take home message here is
simply that using experimental data

202
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,325
for realistic neuron modeling
is crucial,

203
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:05,725
but you have to make sure that
the experimental data set

204
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:07,989
sort of has the accuracy and the quality

205
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,983
so that it gives you a good electrical
passive frame for your model.

206
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:15,770
Moving to ion channels !

207
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,627
So, as per the work
of Hodgkin and Huxley

208
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,642
we know that sodium
and potassium currents

209
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:26,045
are the key to generate
an action potential.

210
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:29,311
So, you could say,
“Well, I want my cell to fire"

211
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:32,537
"I put sodium and potassium currents,
that's it.”.

212
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:37,306
But of course
the story's not as simple

213
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:41,683
and sort of there are many more
details to be possibly considered

214
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:45,382
when you're looking
at your particular neuron in question.

215
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:48,980
And first off, these currents
are mediated

216
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,514
by different ion channels,

217
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:55,596
so there is not just one sodium
and one potassium channel type

218
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:58,306
but they are as a matter of fact,
different ones.

219
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:00,689
And these sodium and potassium
channels shape

220
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,950
a lot sort of
how the neuron de-polarize

221
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,362
how the action potential
gets initiated,

222
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:09,954
how the after hyper-polarization
happens.

223
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,480
And of course
there are additional ions

224
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,352
there are calcium chlorate
and other ions

225
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:18,393
that shape additional parts
of the neuron

226
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:20,849
can be the onset or the spike

227
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:24,464
or the persistent firing behavior
of your neuron.

228
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:29,359
So, again, if you have a neuron
that for example is a delayed spiker

229
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,616
or burst spiker, or something else

230
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:34,306
you will have to add
additional detail

231
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:39,168
that is not in the original sodium
and potassium parameters

232
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:41,475
of Hodgkin and Huxley.

233
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:46,196
Now, as a matter of fact,
there are about 350 ion channel types

234
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:47,426
known in mammals

235
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:51,155
and most of them seem to be expressed
in the nervous system.

236
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:57,060
They roughly categorize
into three different groups.

237
00:12:57,896 --> 00:13:00,029
There are about 150 voltage
gated channels,

238
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,235
there are about 90 ligand
gated channels

239
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:06,615
and there's the third group, others
aquaporous or chloride channels.

240
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,800
So, in principle,
when you're looking at neuron

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,425
and you're looking for data

242
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:16,082
you're looking at having to identify
which of these 350 channels

243
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:17,756
might be in your neuron.

244
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:21,606
But before we go there, first of all
what do we know about these channels?

245
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:23,223
And here you see an overview

246
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:25,662
of the voltage gated ion
channel family

247
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,494
And in this case you can of course
classify them in different ways,

248
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:31,943
you can classify them by ion,
for example

249
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:36,122
but here, they're classified by
on the one hand they're porous

250
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:38,986
and then their similarity
in the amino acids.

251
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:43,451
And you see that sometimes
some channels have four domains,

252
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:47,536
and then sort of that makes them
more similar

253
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:50,692
even though they're letting
through different ions,

254
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:54,420
then, for example calcium channels
to other calcium channels

255
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,456
or on the other hand,
sort of different potassium channels.

256
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,056
to other potassium channels.

257
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:05,253
So, the take home message of that
is that here there is a wealth

258
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:08,144
of ion channel experimental data

259
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:13,612
that might be useful for your
parameterizing of your neuron model,

260
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:17,291
but of course, you have to know
whether sort of which exact channels

261
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:19,032
you might have in your neuron

262
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:22,082
and then the second point
what is known about that channel,

263
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:25,065
and then, you can use the data
to characterize

264
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,430
the particular activation
in activation parameters

265
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,971
in your ion channels

266
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:35,267
that you have put
into your Hodgkin-Huxley model.

267
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:38,941
Now, of course that's exactly
the question:

268
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:41,408
which of these channels
are in my neuron?

269
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:44,497
and there are different ways
of finding

270
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:48,857
of going back to experimental data
to help you with that decision.

271
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:52,667
There are pharmacological methods,
you can do antibody staining

272
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:56,860
you can do single cell multiplex
reverse transcription PCR,

273
00:14:57,305 --> 00:15:00,564
or nowadays you can also try
to do single cell transcriptum.

274
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:04,208
It is all about asking
what in the given cell

275
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:08,776
which genetically identified
ion channels you might have.

276
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,914
This is a diagram of a data set

277
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:15,598
which was done through multiplex
reverse transcription PCR.

278
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:19,069
So essentially there is some
cytoplasm extracted from a cell

279
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:22,784
and you have different genetic probes
to sort of see

280
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:27,598
whether you can fish MR&A sequences
for particular ion channel genes

281
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,156
out of this micro-plasma.

282
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:33,483
Now, of course, having MR&A
is not the same

283
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,754
to say that you have
the protein expressed

284
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:38,754
so these last two methods,
in a way, give you an indication

285
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:41,727
that there is the genetic machinery
has been activated

286
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:43,964
to produce a certain ion channel

287
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:46,796
but it doesn't mean exactly
that you know for sure

288
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:50,079
that the ion channel is there,
but there is a high correlation.

289
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,279
But that being said

290
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:54,295
sort of from these data sets
you can see that even though

291
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,592
and these cell types seem
to have somewhat

292
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:01,290
similar, sustained firing behavior,
they differ in the onset:

293
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,898
so this delayed,
this is burst spiking,

294
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,798
but you can see
is for the ion channels visible here

295
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:12,110
you might see a completely
differential expression

296
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,037
of these channels leading
to these type of firing behaviors.

297
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:18,255
So, these are invaluable data sets

298
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,796
to, out of the jungle of ion channels,

299
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:25,292
choose which ones of those
might be present in your neuron

300
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,844
and helping you to select
which channels you have to model

301
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:33,134
in the first place and where you can
look for parameters for your model.

302
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:39,008
Next, when you now know
which channels you have to consider,

303
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,690
you will have to ask yourself
the question:

304
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,592
do you know the different parameters

305
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,910
like activation,
inactivation parameters

306
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,169
for the channels you want
to put into your model?

307
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:55,815
And a good source for channel models
is ModelDB which is hosted

308
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,594
it's at Yale University,

309
00:16:57,794 --> 00:16:58,883
this is the URL,

310
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,976
and that's a very important resource

311
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:06,804
because there, they track published
models of channels, cells and networks

312
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:10,004
and it sort of allows you to go back
and sort of find out

313
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:13,337
which parameters were used
in the different model.

314
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,373
So, in principle, once you know
your neuron model

315
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:21,373
and the channels you might be able
to go to that resource

316
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,573
and ask the question:

317
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:25,914
"Can I take the parameters
from that channel model?".

318
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:30,228
Now, in practice, the problem
is a little bit more complicated

319
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:33,328
which prompted an activity,
which you see here

320
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:37,146
this part of the screen,
which is the IC Genealogy project

321
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:40,001
which is hosted at Oxford,

322
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:44,586
and what they did
is they went to the ModelDB

323
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:51,200
and extracted every single ion
channel model,

324
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:53,347
and you now have different ways

325
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:55,731
of displaying those ion
channel models:

326
00:17:55,931 --> 00:18:02,159
you can display them
by channel family or current family

327
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,359
but you can also ask
the question sort of

328
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,911
"which model was derived
from which other model?

329
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:08,787
And how similar are these models?"

330
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,156
So, as a matter of fact,
this is a different way

331
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,385
of looking at the jungle
of ion channels,

332
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:15,622
but namely from the model perspective

333
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:18,796
What this really means
is that different modelers

334
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:23,614
for different models might have taken
another modeler's ion channel

335
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:26,379
and then changed it,

336
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,005
to simply say

337
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:31,180
“Look here the equations
were modified from [INAUDIABLE]"

338
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,956
"and we for example change"

339
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:38,616
"the conductions
of the potassium channel”

340
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:44,386
and the reason why they were changing
the channel properties in the model

341
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:47,950
was likely that they wanted
to have their cell

342
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,485
or their network behave
in a certain way.

343
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:53,724
So, as matter of fact,
the channel parameters

344
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:58,366
were treated as a modifiable
or free parameter

345
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:03,191
so that in order to get in later
or higher order behavior

346
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:05,157
you could adjust channel models.

347
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:07,654
But what that really means
is that you depart

348
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:11,166
from the bio-physicallycharacterized
channel

349
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:14,236
as for example done by an experiment.

350
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:17,559
So, of course there is no criticism
in this

351
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,776
because in the end,
you have to ask yourself the question

352
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:23,624
"how good is the experimental data
in the first place?"

353
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:30,458
"Does it have enough quantitative value
to create specific ion channel models?"

354
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:33,502
Or sort of "were they approximations
in the first place?"

355
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:38,486
but what it really means
is that it is not necessarily a given

356
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:41,785
that models of channels
and models of cells

357
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:48,367
use the experimental quantitative
data for modeling the channels

358
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:52,375
but that there was, due
to also the absence of data,

359
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:54,331
a large period of time

360
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:58,032
when models sort of had
to guess channel parameters.

361
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:02,676
Now, the good news
is that this may change with time,

362
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:07,216
and here I would like
to briefly present an endeavor

363
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,025
which is called ChannelNome
and ChannelPedia.

364
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:14,935
And here you can go to ChannelPedia
where you will find good resource

365
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:17,602
of ion channels expressed
in the brain

366
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:21,314
and as well as data sets
and increasingly more models.

367
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:25,988
And this project has been set out
to create cell lines

368
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:30,711
that are genetically identified
individual channel types expressed

369
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:33,812
and then systematically characterized
these channels

370
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:35,462
under different temperatures

371
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:39,543
So, it is actually trying
to systematically obtain the kinetics

372
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:43,149
of all these genetically
identified ion channels.

373
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:47,056
So, once this is complete

374
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:51,146
you will no longer have to go
to a colleague's channel model

375
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:54,329
and sort of modify it for your means,
but you will be able

376
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:57,404
to sort of create channel models
which are backed by data

377
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:01,642
effectively reducing the parameters
that are at your disposal

378
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,747
when sort of creating cell models,

379
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:05,247
making the problem simpler

380
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,915
because you have less parameters
to find.

381
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:15,215
So, this is a typical example
for how increasing experimental work

382
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,901
helps you to sort of extract
more and more parameters

383
00:21:19,101 --> 00:21:20,836
for your realistic neuron models.

384
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,351
Now you can ask yourself the question
sort of "why wasn't that done before?"

385
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:29,075
"Why are we still, today,
talking about that effort?"

386
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:32,328
and the secret lies in a way

387
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:36,354
of how interesting ion channels
are in the first place.

388
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:40,239
Some of these channels were found
to be implicated in certain diseases

389
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:43,450
and then a lot of studies
have been made about that channel,

390
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,550
but some of these channels
are not interesting for disease

391
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,250
they're exotic
and we know very little for the end;

392
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,301
also the genetic characterization
wasn't known

393
00:21:53,706 --> 00:21:56,966
or have since the beginning
of ion channel work

394
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,083
so especially Hodgkin and Huxley
so we know about currents

395
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,690
but we didn't know
about specific ion channels.

396
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,680
So, as a matter of fact,
it is a particular effort

397
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,239
to systematically find
and characterize those channels

398
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:13,620
and we think that has very good value
for realistic neuron modeling.

399
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:19,696
Lastly, once we have morphology,
channels, the channel kinetics

400
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:23,078
we still have to answer the question
as to "where to put them

401
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:25,016
and how many of those channels?"

402
00:22:25,672 --> 00:22:28,823
and that is a complicated story.

403
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,431
Some neurons, of course
are simple

404
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:35,892
so they have a small soma
and just small dendritic trees

405
00:22:36,092 --> 00:22:37,192
like the granule cell

406
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:40,294
where you can actually
through electrical recordings infer

407
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:42,908
the maximum conductance of channels.

408
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:45,985
But other neurons
with an extended dendritic tree

409
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:49,115
it's very difficult to infer
from the somatic recording

410
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:52,044
what could be the channel
distribution in the dendrites

411
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:53,983
or the channel conductances.

412
00:22:54,183 --> 00:22:55,889
So, as a matter of fact

413
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:59,331
through staining, pharmacology,
recordings,

414
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:02,192
we can piece together
some information

415
00:23:02,392 --> 00:23:05,002
about that sort of some channels
are only in the soma

416
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:08,533
or some channels are more
in the apical dendrite,

417
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,791
but the matter of the fact,
the picture remains dirty.

418
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:13,999
So, as it stands today

419
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:20,308
the question of "will we able
to quantitatively

420
00:23:20,508 --> 00:23:25,232
extract channel distributions
and maximum conductances?"

421
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,851
I think remains an open question,

422
00:23:28,051 --> 00:23:30,651
and we will take and talk
in other parts of the MOOC

423
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:34,549
what we can do
to mitigate that challenge.

424
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,933
Let me summarize today's course

425
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:40,233
on constraining neuron models
with experimental data.

426
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,336
So, when you are setting out to build
realistic models for specific neuron

427
00:23:45,536 --> 00:23:48,444
you're faced with having
to identify multiple parameters

428
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:52,333
neuron's topology, diameters,
which type of ion channels

429
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:56,153
ion channel kinetics,
maximum conductances and so on...

430
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:59,756
We think that in order
to make these models meaningful

431
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,362
and the problem achievable
is very important to use

432
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:07,345
as much biological data, experimental
data to constrain these parameters

433
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:09,445
so essentially make
the problem simpler

434
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,770
by reducing the number
of free parameters.

435
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,448
We think in particular that multi-
compartment Hodgkin-Huxley formalism

436
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:19,487
is a good formalism to allow you
to integrate experimental data,

437
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:23,608
it has the right hooks to
sort of include specific parameters

438
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,012
for an ion channel or specific
densities in a certain compartment.

439
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:30,446
So in that sense the multi
compartment Hodgkin-Huxley formalism

440
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:32,714
is not only data driven formalism,

441
00:24:32,914 --> 00:24:35,900
it is data ready,
it makes it easy to absorb data.

442
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,585
That being said,
there are particular parameters

443
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:43,025
that remain more experimentally
inaccessible than others

444
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:47,579
and that might make it necessary
to employ other methods

445
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:50,342
to sort of help find
and constrain parameters

446
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:52,992
which we'll be talking in other parts
of the MOOC.

447
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,233
Thank you very much
for your attention

448
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:55,743
and hope to see you
in the next part of the MOOC.
