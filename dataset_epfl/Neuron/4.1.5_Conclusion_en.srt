00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:09,937
So, thank you very much
for being with me in this part.

2
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:13,081
I hope that you really understood
sort of speak,

3
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:18,089
the essence of what is the level that
we're trying to understand the brain,

4
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:20,193
e.g. is very important

5
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:22,967
because it records
electrical activity, globally;

6
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:27,200
and other means
to record globally activity

7
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:31,998
FMRI, EG, and other methods
are essential to understand

8
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,082
the global activity of the brain,

9
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:38,536
but we need to understand
the local activity of the brain

10
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:40,398
in terms of electrical activity

11
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:42,366
and we know now,
through this course

12
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:46,731
that it is generated
by the intrinsic properties of neurons.

13
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:48,718
These ion channels

14
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:52,496
that are distributed in the axons
and are sensitive to voltage

15
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:56,685
could generate this wonderful all
or none propagating phenomena:

16
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:58,218
the spike.

17
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:04,987
These synaptic receptors
that catch up this transmitter

18
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:08,626
can generate locally the EPSPs,
this other signal

19
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:13,484
and these two signals interact together
to generate this richness

20
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:15,723
of the electrical activity
in the brain

21
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:18,387
and this richness,
especially in the human brain

22
00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:21,301
gives rise to the richness
of what we do,

23
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:24,879
also, our capability due
to its richness

24
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,722
to understand ourselves to develop
mathematical models of the signals

25
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:33,560
and maybe repair the brain,
after such an understanding.

26
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:36,001
That's the role of the scientist,

27
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,961
and I very much hope that now

28
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:39,812
you would think about the brain

29
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:43,369
sometimes as generating
two types of signals:

30
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:46,654
synaptic potential, action potential
and that these signals

31
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:51,086
stand really in the basis,
in the core, of who we are

32
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:53,444
Thank you very much for listening.
