Simulation neuroscience is an emerging approach to integrate the knowledge dispersed throughout the field of neuroscience
The aim is to build a unified empirical picture of the brain to study the biological mechanisms of brain function, behavior and disease.
This is achieved by integrating diverse datasources across the various scales of experimental neuroscience from binocular to clinical into computer simulations.
In a series of three courses you will learn to use the state of the art modeling tools of the HBP brain simulation platform to simulate neurons, build neural networks and perform your own simulation experiments.
This is a unique massive open online course taughtÂ by multidisciplinary team of world-renowned scientists.
In this first course you will gain the knowledge and skills needed to create simulations of biological neurons and synapses.
Professor Henry Markram will open the course and present the basic principles of simulation neuroscience and the neuroscience knowledge it aims to integrate.
Then with professor Sean Hill,
Samuel Kerrienp and Lida Kanari, you'll learn about the structure of neuroscience data, its' analysisÂ and classification, and how to integrate it into the neuroinformatic's platform.
Professor Idan Segev will introduce you to the fascinating world of biological neurons and the mathematical methods to describe their biophysics.
Werner van Geit will show you how to apply these methods to create your own neuron models using the neurone simulator.
From Dr. Srikanth Ramaswamy and Dr. Eilif Muller, you will learn the biology of synaptic transmission in the near cortex, and at the simulator using the neuron simulator.
In the fifth course, professor Schurmann and Werner Van Geit will teach you to constrain neuron models with experimental data using genetic optimization techniques.
We invite you to join us and share our passion to reconstruct, simulate and understand the brain.
