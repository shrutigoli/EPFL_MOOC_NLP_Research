1
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,464
So later I will show you
how to use the model packages

2
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:11,264
from the Jupyter notebooks
we provide

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,210
but just quickly I will
also show what happens

4
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:17,230
if you actually run this
on your local computer.

5
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:19,259
So basically it assumes that you

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,897
have NEURON installed
on your computer

7
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:27,405
I mean, the NMC portal actually
has some instructions on how to

8
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:32,258
set up all the software,
and basically you can...

9
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:39,832
if you go to the directory that
contains the model package

10
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:45,841
you see that there's all
kinds of cells provided

11
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:48,069
in this model package,
so there are some HOC files

12
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:52,097
that contains the procedural code,
there are some shell scripts

13
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:57,761
there is some code
to run the synapses

14
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,974
to generate the plots
and things like that.

15
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:04,870
So there are are two
different things you can do.

16
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,194
You can use the Python
part of the package

17
00:01:10,443 --> 00:01:16,630
it will just generate the traces
that were shown on the website

18
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:20,429
or you can run the whole code
which actually will generate

19
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:24,713
a graphical user interface on your
computer with which you can

20
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:29,036
access the model and activate
the synapses and things like that.

21
00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:32,051
So running the Python code,
I'm not gonna do that here

22
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:35,256
because it's basically
similar to what we

23
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:38,424
show in the Jupyter notebooks.

24
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,261
But I will show you the Graphical
User Interface so this one

25
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:48,926
you can access by running
the "run_hoc" command

26
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:57,026
so this is basically the GUI you get
by executing the "run_hoc" command

27
00:01:57,253 --> 00:02:00,253
so as you can see,
it shows you the morphology

28
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:01,803
of the cell we're going to simulate.

29
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:04,699
So just to be clear,
we're just simulating the voltage

30
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:07,876
of one single post-synaptic cell

31
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:11,123
so in this case Layer five thick-tufted
pyramidal cell.

32
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:14,477
We can also activate
all the synapses

33
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:15,980
of this post-synaptic cell

34
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:24,144
so, for example, we can look at all
the layer 2 or 3 pyramidal cells

35
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:26,088
that project to this cell.

36
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:28,258
We can activate all the synapses.

37
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:31,472
So here, you can actually see
all the synapses projected from

38
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:34,655
this type of cells.

39
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:40,972
And every one of these pre-synaptic
cells all the Elter 3PCs

40
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:43,707
have a poisson
generator connected to them.

41
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:49,311
So, they are basically going to
inject some poisson spike trains

42
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:52,705
into the synapses
with a certain rate

43
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,733
so in this case the poisson
generators of all these cells

44
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:58,275
are set to 10Hz.

45
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:03,964
So now we can run the simulation,
and you see that

46
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:07,813
this is the voltage of our
post-synaptic cell

47
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:12,453
so we basically have
a generation of a spike

48
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,985
because of all the synaptic input
and you also see that

49
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,525
trace is pretty noisy,
because you have

50
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:23,949
a lot of cells injecting
their events to our cell.

51
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:29,369
So in this case,
all these L23PCs are

52
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:32,565
not strong enough to
generate a one on one spike.

53
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:40,214
So we can actually create
some more activity

54
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:45,359
by also activating all the layer 5
thick-tufted pyramidal cells

55
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:49,012
that are projecting to this cell,
so for example

56
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:52,485
by activating all of them,
you see that now we get a massive

57
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:55,843
input from pre-synaptic
cells onto our cell

58
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:59,023
and you get a lot of spikes.

59
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:05,156
In this plot you can also see
the voltage changing

60
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,810
while the simulation is running.

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,385
So another thing you can do
in this interface is to

62
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:17,476
replicate the traces
that are available

63
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,235
on the NMC portal website,
there's a figure with three traces

64
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:27,581
each of them you can replicate
with this interface, so for example

65
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:33,273
you can inject the lower step
current from these three traces

66
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:39,335
and you can run the simulation
and it will show you

67
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:43,474
the exact traces available
on the NMC portal website.

68
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,638
So i just want to mention
that the part that I'm showing now

69
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,942
about running this on your local
computer is just an optional

70
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:04,493
part of this tutorial

71
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:07,682
just something to show
the capabilities

72
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:13,535
of the single cell models,
but if you have trouble installing

73
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,118
some of this software on your
computer there's no issue, you can

74
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:19,274
just look at the Jupyter notebook

75
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,500
tutorial part and that's
more than sufficient.

76
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:26,685
So it's purely optional.
