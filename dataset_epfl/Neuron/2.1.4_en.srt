1
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:09,120
In the last parts of this presentation
I would like to talk more about

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,069
the minimum information,
about neuroscience dataset.

3
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:19,232
And to start with I'm just going
to repeat what MINDS,

4
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:23,098
a MIND compliant dataset
should include.

5
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:27,929
It should define the specimen
it has been generated from

6
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,526
and it should include the age
of the specimen,

7
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,366
it's sex, the species, the strain.

8
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,822
And again, you should already
be recognizing some of these elements:

9
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:39,269
I mean these 3, for instance.

10
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:42,777
We've already seen that
a vocabulary exists

11
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:45,388
to define these things.

12
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:51,754
The concept of an entity of classification
such as cell types or neuron.

13
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:57,244
The concept of brain location
whether you want to use

14
00:00:57,444 --> 00:01:01,557
an ontological term to define
a logical area,

15
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:04,757
or even spatial coordinates
if you happen to have

16
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:07,618
this precise information.

17
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:12,781
You want to have the contributors
that enable the generation

18
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:16,776
of these datasets and their affiliation
so use can give credit to them.

19
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:20,959
You want to define the method
and parameters used,

20
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,647
generate a data, and the dates
they already were created on.

21
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:27,088
You want to describe
the data category

22
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:31,271
and the specific data format
you have used to save these data.

23
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:33,943
You want to describe
how to access data

24
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:35,777
so where is it stored,

25
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:37,609
and the format,

26
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:41,342
and finally, you want
the license information

27
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:45,438
so someone can inform itself
as to whether they can actually re-use

28
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,179
this information.

29
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:52,686
So, what are the benefits
of the MINDS compliant datasets?

30
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:59,085
So, first you have to see MINDS
as a very useful tool to create

31
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,054
a community consensus
as to how to describe

32
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:07,116
in the context of neuroscience
the properties of a dataset.

33
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:09,680
And some of these properties
are extremely useful

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,418
and we'll see why actually

35
00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:13,502
in the next slides.

36
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:19,469
Next, that provides us consistency
in the process of integrating the data

37
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:25,230
into a platform, so if we really
enforce these MINDS compliants

38
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,096
we know that all datasets
will have specimen

39
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:31,389
and point us a brain region,

40
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:35,502
and people typically are very
focused on specimen

41
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:40,219
and very specific parts of the brain
that really enables them to find

42
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:46,392
other datasets that can really help
them moving forward in their research.

43
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:53,181
It gives power to the search facilities
by just having this consistency

44
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:57,766
in the type of information stored
and the vocabularies being used

45
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:59,274
to define them,

46
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:02,177
it gives another power
to search facilities.

47
00:03:02,377 --> 00:03:06,130
And finally, it is with a medium
to find similar and related datasets,

48
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,161
this is in the next part
we're going to look at.

49
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:16,329
So, here, I have listed quite a few
examples of similarity and relatedness

50
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:21,546
examples that can be leveraged
from simply annotating your datasets

51
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:23,879
that are in the MINDS
recommendations.

52
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,855
So I'm just going to list them
and illustrate where appropriate.

53
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:32,084
You could find dataset
that come from the same species

54
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:36,986
but different strains, different
kinds of ruts, for instance.

55
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:43,107
You could also search for datasets
located in nearby brain regions.

56
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,913
You can look for the same brain
regions,

57
00:03:46,113 --> 00:03:48,506
but in different species
or strain.

58
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:53,261
You can use a neuron
with a broader cell classification.

59
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:57,934
So, for instance, your neuron
may have been categorized

60
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:02,009
as the Martinotti cell, but now
you want to look at neurons

61
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,035
that are not only Martinotti cell,
but more generally inhibitory cells.

62
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:10,811
So, again, playing with a hierarchy
of your ontology,

63
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:12,601
this is something you can do.

64
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:16,885
You can look at all the data
category in the same brain region

65
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:21,797
because bringing different angles
to the data you're currently using

66
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:25,629
you might strengthen actually your
position in discovering something.

67
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:31,331
You could use the same data category
but in a different brain region.

68
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:34,531
For instance, you have
electrophysiology in the thalamus

69
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:39,264
and you want to get electrophysiology
datasets in a different brain region

70
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:43,470
and make a comparison between them:

71
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,019
What is different between
these two brain regions?

72
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:50,618
You could use the dataset
by the same lab or contributor,

73
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:55,232
or finally, another dataset generated
with the exact same protocol

74
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:58,432
or derived protocol.
