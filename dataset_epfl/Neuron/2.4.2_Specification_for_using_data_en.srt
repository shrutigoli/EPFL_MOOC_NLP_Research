1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,400
That was part one of this
scientists interview.

2
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:13,534
Now we want to interview
another person.

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,095
Actually it could be the same,
but here

4
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:19,120
I'm depicting it as
a different person.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,262
The first one was with the 
person generating the data.

6
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:26,807
The second one is more of
the user of the integrated data,

7
00:00:27,232 --> 00:00:29,232
and we are very curious 
to find out

8
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:31,882
what it is they want to do
with integrated data

9
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:35,695
because this is going to help us
to design the entities further

10
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:39,232
and add all the relevant
properties on entities

11
00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:43,920
that will enable interesting 
scientific queries to be run.

12
00:00:44,992 --> 00:00:48,692
So I'm going to read through
these statements

13
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:53,092
and this is going to drive later on
the design of the entities.

14
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:57,957
So the scientist wants to get data
related to a specimen's species,

15
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:00,471
strain, or age.

16
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:04,446
So that means that species, 
the strain and the age are things

17
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:07,646
you want to be able to add
into your queries. For instance,

18
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:10,008
give me all data sets

19
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,946
that derives from a rat, 
or mouse, or a human.

20
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,979
Same thing for the strain, and
same thing for the age.

21
00:01:20,568 --> 00:01:24,305
The scientist wants to be able to 
get all data sets from a given neuron.

22
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:26,993
So again, that strengthens 
the assumption 

23
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:29,093
that we need to have
a neuron entity.

24
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,113
This is good, and derivation has
to be made from this neuron entity.

25
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,755
The scientist wants to get
data sets

26
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:39,705
by title, with have called that
category previously.

27
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:44,343
So we'll have to think of putting
this data set category property

28
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:46,244
on our data set.

29
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:51,125
And here, the scientist wants to
get the data set by file format.

30
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:54,837
So again we'll have to think about
integrating an ontology that

31
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:56,900
that represents specific
file formats

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,937
so distinctions could be made

33
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,994
of the electrophysiology, we called
it in Igor format

34
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:07,419
which is one known format 
or NWB for instance

35
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,032
which is another format.

36
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,689
The scientist wants to get neurons
by classification.

37
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:16,889
So in that case, we can figure 
out this by either

38
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:20,021
electric type, or
morphological type.

39
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:25,016
Then the scientist wants to get
data by the protocol used.

40
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:29,906
So we will have to think at the 
level of the activity to capture

41
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:34,309
the protocol and some forms
and we will describe later

42
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:36,299
a proposal for that.

43
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:42,154
And the scientist wants to get data
that specific people generated,

44
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:45,354
so there again the W3C provenance

45
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,724
is already offering that through
the means of the concept of agent.

46
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:54,664
So as long as we tie people
who generated the data

47
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:58,289
to the agent concept of 
the W3C Prov

48
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,902
which will be able to do that. So 
I think we are in quite a good shape

49
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:03,259
to carry on.
