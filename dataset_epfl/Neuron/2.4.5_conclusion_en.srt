00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:07,660
So, to conclude,
in this session,

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,485
we've been learning
a number of things.

3
00:00:09,685 --> 00:00:12,997
First, we've been learning how to
design a specific domain

4
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:15,872
to capture a very concrete use case.

5
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:18,035
This is the one really you're
going to be executing

6
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,997
as part of a grade
exercise this week.

7
00:00:21,197 --> 00:00:25,097
We've been defining the program's
pattern, but we have also been defining

8
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:29,570
all the entities necessary, and the
specific properties that will enable you to

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,295
ask all the questions that the scientists
want to be able to answer.

10
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:38,306
We've integrated relevant
ontologies as part of this domain.

11
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:41,919
And finally, we've really 
ensured that

12
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,119
the domain we have built together 
can answer all the questions

13
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:47,894
that our scientists wanted
to answer.

14
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:49,896
Thank you very much.
