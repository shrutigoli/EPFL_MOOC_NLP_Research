1
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:06,899
Next, let's look
at the molecular profile.

2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:09,716
We will come back to the ion channel
profiling and see

3
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:14,908
how that relates to the way that
the neurons are constructed.

4
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:19,194
Let's briefly look first deeper
into the molecular profile.

5
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,519
So here for example,
we started off,

6
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,340
you remember we said
how do we study neurons.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,473
We can do whole-cell patch-clamp,

8
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:28,562
we get the electrical properties,

9
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:34,069
we get the cytoplasm and we can
determine which genes are expressed

10
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:37,221
and we stay in the cell
and we can get the morphology.

11
00:00:37,794 --> 00:00:41,461
Now what you can do is,
and we can characterize

12
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:44,558
the electrical properties.

13
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:48,688
So you can say electrical property
one, two, three, four, five

14
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:52,390
and you can make a huge list
of seventy or hundred

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,309
electrical features such as,
the speed of the action potential,

16
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:59,716
upswing and downswing
and amplitude and so on

17
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,021
and then you can also take these

18
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:06,304
molecular profiles which genes
are switched on inside the cell

19
00:01:06,994 --> 00:01:10,328
and you can create
Gene 1, Gene 2, Gene 3.

20
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,513
And when you have that,

21
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:15,514
you can start trying to compare

22
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:18,929
and ask yourself:
"If I look just at the genes,

23
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:22,694
how does it relate to what kind
of electrical behavior it is?"

24
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:26,239
So here you see an example
in this blue cell.

25
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,588
These are the genes that are

26
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,961
sort of negatively correlated,

27
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:35,963
which means that it is highly
unlikely to find these genes,

28
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,146
it is highly unlikely to find these
genes in the blue cell,

29
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:46,225
but it is highly likely that you will
find these genes in the blue cell

30
00:01:47,344 --> 00:01:50,293
and here it is the opposite.

31
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:54,001
So these two neurons,
the one has a delay,

32
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:57,616
the other one has a fast start,

33
00:01:58,502 --> 00:02:00,576
they are both fast spiking cells,

34
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:04,237
but they essentially have almost
an inverted gene expression profile.

35
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:06,616
So they are using
almost exactly the opposite

36
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:11,359
set of ion channels to produce
their electrical behavior.

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,237
And this is one of the information sets

38
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,066
we use when we try
and classify neurons.

39
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:25,295
So we don't only look
at their electrical properties,

40
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:30,413
we also have looked deeply into
what genes are expressed in them

41
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:32,912
and that gives us confidence that

42
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,619
we have two different classes.

43
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,835
As you can see in this case,
it is a very clear

44
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:42,591
separation of two
electrical types of cells.

45
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,122
So what you can do is you can take this
and this is a very simple linear operator

46
00:02:48,322 --> 00:02:54,643
where you take your electrical
properties going from E1 to E61

47
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:58,261
and your genetic
or ion channels,

48
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:02,932
Kv 1-1 all the way down
to even calcium binding proteins

49
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:06,777
and other kinds of proteins
that are in the cell.

50
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:12,853
And you can ask how does
each value correlates with each gene.

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,615
And there are a lot of statistic
you can do

52
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:20,386
to see if it is statistically significant

53
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:24,779
and establish an operator
like this which gives you

54
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:29,829
the measure of the correlation
between these different parameters

55
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:33,511
and as I said this
is a very simple linear operator.

56
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:36,396
You can build much more
sophisticated nonlinear operators

57
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:39,365
and multi dependency
operators and so on,

58
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:42,770
but just this linear operator
is already very powerful,

59
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:47,372
because here you can see
that you can actually predict,

60
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:50,336
you can look at the genes
that are switched on

61
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:52,534
and you can apply
the linear operator

62
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:55,347
and you can calculate
with a very small error,

63
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:59,427
the size of an action potential,
the width of an action potential,

64
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:05,151
the fast down swing
of the voltage and so on.

65
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:11,706
And the reason why this is extremely
exciting and important is it means

66
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:15,918
that ultimately, we won't have to record
from every neuron in the brain

67
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:19,072
in order to work out
how it will behave.

68
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:23,105
We can get the gene expression.

69
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:28,392
So this is why one of the big goals

70
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:31,790
of working the Blue Brain Project

71
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,897
is to work with many
labs around the world

72
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:40,377
to try to obtain the single cell
gene expression profiles.

73
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:42,959
So if you go for example
to the human brain

74
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:48,276
or to a nonhuman primate brain
or to any other species,

75
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:51,758
you don't necessarily
have to restart everything.

76
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,575
You have to do some experiments
to see that this holds for example,

77
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:58,363
also in another species,

78
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,513
but then you can actually

79
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:04,238
try and get as much genetic
information as possible

80
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,369
and then you can predict

81
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:09,694
the electrical properties.

82
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:16,097
So that is an example again
of how you constantly look for ways

83
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:19,254
to rely on less and less data.

84
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:25,464
If we had to rely on recording from
every single type of cell in the brain

85
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:29,377
in order to find out what
electrical properties they had,

86
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:33,265
it is going to take us a very, very
long time to understand the brain.

87
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:35,937
This is a way around it.

88
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,738
It is not yet perfect,
but it is the beginning of...

89
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,872
...a step in that direction.

90
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:47,813
So in general,
you can see that what determines,

91
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:51,140
what determines
the electrical properties of a neuron

92
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,625
is essentially
the kinetics of each channel.

93
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:57,718
It depends on which combination--
if you combine this one,

94
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,290
this one, this one and this one,

95
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,395
you are going to get a certain behavior

96
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,645
and if you combine this one
and this one and this one and this one,

97
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:08,547
you get a different behavior.

98
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:14,756
So it depends on this combination

99
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:17,544
and it depends
on the specific kinetics

100
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:22,170
and then it also depends
on the location.

101
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,262
Where is this channel located?

102
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:29,791
Some channels are located
only close to the cell body,

103
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:33,991
other channels are located much
more out in the dendrites.

104
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,569
Other channels are located
more in the axon

105
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,887
and so if you know

106
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:43,132
what the kinetics are,

107
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:45,581
the combination of kinetics

108
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:47,910
and you know where they are,

109
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,203
you are very close to doing very little

110
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:54,270
to simulate a single neuron.

111
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:56,440
You are missing the densities.

112
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,140
You are missing how many
of these channels

113
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,492
do you need to put in
in each compartment.

114
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:05,014
And that is something
that you are going to learn about

115
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:08,623
and actually run an exercise
using BluePyOpt to

116
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:10,965
adjust the densities

117
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:15,851
in order to reproduce
electrical behavior in a neuron.

118
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:19,212
So here is just an example again.

119
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:24,103
The goal here is to get to densities
and in this movie

120
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:26,814
you can...
it is just trying to illustrate

121
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:31,514
how distributing channels
differentially on dendrites

122
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:38,297
can also give you many of these
different electrical properties.

123
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:41,426
The molecular diversity

124
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:46,078
can be mapped,
so you have your morphologies over here

125
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:51,206
and you can also map them
to the electrical properties,

126
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:53,975
so you can produce
this kind of map,

127
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,007
which tells you how many
combinations you can have

128
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,535
which we also spoke
about previously,

129
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:07,012
but what is exciting about this
is that you can continue this map.

130
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:10,220
You can say:
"I have this kind of morphology,

131
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:13,409
it expresses this these proteins"

132
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,853
and in this case,

133
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:18,989
it is expressing two different
kinds of proteins

134
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:24,085
and it will have
one, two, three, four, five

135
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:26,329
different electrical behaviors.

136
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:33,142
So you have this cell
expressing these two proteins

137
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:36,018
and it has five different
electrical behaviors

138
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:40,393
and you can build a map like that
for each of these cells,

139
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:44,390
in terms of what is the probability

140
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,537
that they are going to express
these different proteins.

141
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:50,246
These are calcium binding proteins.

142
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:52,939
They bind calcium and buffer calcium

143
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,431
and these are neuro peptides
and they exert other

144
00:08:56,631 --> 00:09:00,022
modulatory effects
on how the neuron functions.

145
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:03,880
It is not critically important
to remember them.

146
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,536
It is just that you have many, many
proteins and peptides.

147
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:10,054
And we choose these,
because they tend to be

148
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:12,851
characteristic
of some types of cells.

149
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,653
So with this map,
it is possible now

150
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:24,928
to actually go and stain
your model neuron,

151
00:09:25,784 --> 00:09:27,767
because you can
calculate the probabilities

152
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,108
that they are going
to have these proteins,

153
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:33,520
so you can stain them.
You add these proteins

154
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:39,191
probabilistically into these kinds
of neurons for example.

155
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:42,699
And that way you can
stain all your neurons,

156
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,054
in silico neurons,
and then you can of course compare them

157
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,693
to what is seen in vitro,
in the real tissue.

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,018
So with that,
we can now have a look at...

159
00:09:56,218 --> 00:10:00,719
you have a basic idea
of the morphology profiling,

160
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,036
electrophysiology profile,
ion channel profiling,

161
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,423
how we do that,
molecular profiling

162
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:09,727
in terms of other types of proteins
such as calcium binding proteins

163
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:11,456
and neuro peptides.

164
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:15,300
And now let's briefly
look at neuron types

165
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:18,414
and there is...

166
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:23,753
It is quite a huge field.
Debatable.

167
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:29,216
There is no clear consensus
about how to name a neuron,

168
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,788
how to classify a neuron,

169
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:35,993
but there are some important guidelines
and the guidelines that we use

170
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:39,310
when naming a neuron

171
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,226
is a bit like in chemistry.

172
00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:44,073
You start off by...

173
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:47,155
...identifying the location
of the neuron in the brain.

174
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,530
It may be in the visual cortex,
in the layer two,

175
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,558
so you would call it
the visual cortex layer two cell.

176
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,211
And then you identify
the local morphology.

177
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,155
So it may be in
the visual cortex layer two,

178
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:04,737
Martinotti cell.

179
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:10,357
And then you identify what subclass
of electrical behavior it has,

180
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:14,384
so it would be visual cortex,
layer two, Martinotti cell,

181
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:17,159
delayed accommodation.

182
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,091
And then you would identify
what molecular profile it has,

183
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:26,129
such as expressing somatostatin

184
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:29,890
and then you would go further

185
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,808
and indicate as many genes
as you can find within that cell

186
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:36,742
that may characterize
that type of cell

187
00:11:37,252 --> 00:11:40,636
and then ultimately it may be
that two neurons

188
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:43,209
that are almost identical,

189
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:46,338
they will not be genetically
perfectly identical,

190
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,862
but they may be very similar,

191
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:52,005
they could actually project
to different brain regions

192
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,932
and you could classify these
according to the projection type.

193
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:03,842
So the way that we look at neuron
classification and naming

194
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,760
is that we should think
about the dimensions

195
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:12,175
in very separate ways
and combine them in a systematic way

196
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:15,775
starting with location to morphology
to electrical properties,

197
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:18,987
molecular, genetic
and then projection,

198
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:21,013
projection subclasses.
