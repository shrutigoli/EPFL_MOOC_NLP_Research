1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,562
Okay so let's summarize
by looking at caveats.

2
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:12,812
So the main caveat of course is
that there may be critical data

3
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:14,662
that is missing.

4
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:18,987
Now I did mention that the challenge
or the goal, the mission of 

5
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:22,374
simulation beuroscience is not
to get everything.

6
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:26,262
It doesn't mean that we shouldn't
get as much data as possible

7
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:31,887
but the algorithmic goal is to find
what is the minimum data I need

8
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:34,562
to do a complete reconstruction.

9
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:39,532
And in that search for the minimal
data, it may be that there is

10
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:42,069
critical data missing.

11
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:43,994
If you don't have neuronal morphologies,

12
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,769
it is going to be very
difficult to build a circuit.

13
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:49,969
So you have to find a way to
get neuronal morphologies.

14
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:53,169
So we can call them 
critical data or strategic data.

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,155
And that means that one has to go
back to lab and one has to do

16
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:01,656
experiments and one has to obtain
that critical data.

17
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:10,317
The other caveat is that biological
data has a lot of mistakes.

18
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:17,015
In fact there are much more mistakes
than accurate data.

19
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,753
It is by far more that there are
errors than there are correct data.

20
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,558
So we shouldn't be so quick to
believe biological experiments,

21
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:29,482
I am a biological experiment,
I measure lots of things

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,727
and when you actually look at it
and try to use it, you quickly see

23
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,927
if it really fits with other data or not.

24
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:43,215
In fact the best way to find out if
your data is right or wrong

25
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:47,202
is to try to use it in the
combination of others.

26
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,502
And we will show you examples
where this actually does show you

27
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,727
precisely where experiments
have gone wrong.

28
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:04,002
But it does make reconstructing
difficult when you have this huge

29
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:06,340
discrepancy in the
biological data set.

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,338
But on the other hand, it turns
into a positive because you can curate

31
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,952
the data, you can actually
identify what is reasonable.

32
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:16,952
This data is just not reasonable, 

33
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:19,440
it cannot fit with
all this other data.

34
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:24,595
And then the other caveat
and it is not really a caveat, 

35
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:28,607
it just means that we are evolving
in the way that we do Neuroscience.

36
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:32,145
Instead of disciplines
being fragmented

37
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,920
across many labs
and different people,

38
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:43,821
if you do simulation neuroscience,
you have to become multidisciplinary.

39
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:50,496
You have to learn about experiments,
analysis of data, informatics

40
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:56,096
computer science, mathematics, 
algorithmics, computational sciences

41
00:02:56,296 --> 00:02:57,133
and so on.

42
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,083
In summary, we looked at approaches.

43
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:05,571
And it is really experimentation,
theory and the third branch of

44
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:08,571
knowledge generation is
simulation science. 

45
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,771
Not only in neuroscience, in
many of the other sciences.

46
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:16,047
There are 3 branches of how
you advance a knowledge.

47
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:19,685
The rationale for simulation
neuroscience is that it is a

48
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:21,898
big data problem.

49
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:24,260
It is not going to be solved
only with experiments.

50
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,848
It is not going to be solved
only with theory.

51
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,137
The principles of
simulation neuroscience

52
00:03:30,324 --> 00:03:34,937
are fundamentally that you need
to build a dense reconstruction

53
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:36,124
from sparse data.

54
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,149
Your challenge is to find the
smallest data set that will

55
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:41,112
give you a detailed reconstruction.

56
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:43,320
You build bottom up.

57
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,430
In other approaches,
you start top down.

58
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:50,145
Iterative reconstruction,

59
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:54,182
you reconstruct, reconstruct
and it refines.

60
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:57,707
It is almost like a fitting algorithm
or a gradient descent where

61
00:03:57,907 --> 00:04:02,295
gradually the digital reconstruction
becomes more and more precise

62
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:06,253
becoming the digital copy
of the neuro tissue.

63
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,722
The data strategy is
really to establish a 

64
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:11,872
hierarchy of data components.

65
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:15,072
You have to do a lot of very
careful data analysis

66
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:17,084
so you get all the parameters.

67
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,466
Informatics strategy.

68
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,791
Find it all.

69
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:25,003
Bring it all on the table and ask:
"how does it fit together?"

70
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,776
There is some value in every study.

71
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:34,545
And this is actually very powerful
because if you go into the

72
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:37,320
literature and you say
I am only going to find the

73
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:39,983
best work out there,

74
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:43,258
you are going to have a hard time
deciding what is the best work

75
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,033
and there is going to be
contradictions and not

76
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:50,895
but more importantly, you could
miss very important little

77
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,020
statements, findings in bad papers.

78
00:04:55,613 --> 00:05:01,613
So, our approach is, let's find
the gems in any paper.

79
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:05,400
Some papers may have lots of gems
and other papers may only have one

80
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:08,550
and some may have zero but
that is fine, you don't know that

81
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:10,975
and you actually have to
approach it as if there is a gem

82
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:12,488
and I want to look for it.

83
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:16,425
That is the informatics strategy that
we adopt in simulation neuroscience.

84
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:21,110
Reconstruction strategy,
you build the components,

85
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,410
you freeze down and validate up.

86
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:25,535
You validate the emerging properties.

87
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:29,735
You never fit to the emerging or you 
try not to fit to the emerging properties.

88
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:34,319
You build workflows so you can run
this machinery over and over.

89
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:38,656
You validate against independent
data and emerging properties.

90
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,769
And, of course, you need a
supercomputer because you

91
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,994
need a lot of fast communication
and you need a lot of memory

92
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:55,044
and it does simulations and is
about allowing you to mimic

93
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:58,244
experimental neuroscience.
