1
00:00:05,844 --> 00:00:07,857
When we want to start
connecting cells

2
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:10,589
we also need
chemical synapses.

3
00:00:10,806 --> 00:00:14,731
In NEURON a synapse is represented
as a point process.

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:18,031
Such processes are
located at specific locations

5
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:19,636
along the morphology

6
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:22,298
and they will, in general,
inject some current into the cell

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,870
when activated.

8
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:27,895
NEURON have several
build-in synapse types.

9
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:32,698
In this tutorial we will
use the "ExpSyn" Synapse.

10
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:35,402
This is a synapse with
a single exponential decay

11
00:00:35,596 --> 00:00:37,359
of its conductance.

12
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:39,084
The equations to calculate

13
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,316
the current generated
by this synapse

14
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:45,590
are basically the total current is
governed by this equation

15
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:48,816
and the conductance
that is used in this equation

16
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:52,443
has its own differential equation,
which basically shows

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,405
the exponential decay
of the synapse.

18
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:59,378
Every time an event
arrives at the synapse

19
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:03,461
the conductance
is increased by its weight.

20
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:07,329
Now, let's add such
a synapse to the dendrite.

21
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:11,245
To stimulate this synapse,
we have to create a "netstim" object.

22
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:14,605
It basically plays the role
of a pre-synaptic cell.

23
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:17,952
The attributes of this object
specify how many times

24
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,070
we want to stimulate the synapse
with each interval

25
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:24,651
and when we want to start.

26
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:28,688
The noise attribute determines
the stochasticity of the process.

27
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:33,132
Zero means a completely regular
firing of the "netstim" object.

28
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,927
This "netstim" needs to
be connected to the cell.

29
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:39,786
A "netcon" object acts
as a connector between

30
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,974
the pre-synaptic
and the post-synaptic cell.

31
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:45,998
So we basically
connect the "netstim"

32
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:49,209
with "expsyn" on
the post-synaptic cell.

33
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:53,736
And now we can
run the simulation.

34
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,805
As you can see there are five events
arriving in the post-synaptic cell.

35
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,887
Each event injects
a certain current in the cell

36
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:03,873
and slowly decays afterwards.

37
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:07,944
In our last example we will
connect two cells together.

38
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:12,424
We make a pre-synaptic cell,
and inject a current clamp into it

39
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:14,505
so that it spikes.

40
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:17,326
By connecting this cell
to a post-synaptic cell

41
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,352
that doesn't receive a current clamp

42
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:22,063
we can make
the second cell fire also.

43
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,442
So we basically use the cell that

44
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,938
we have created in
this entire tutorial

45
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:31,740
as a post-synaptic cell and we
create a new pre-synaptic cell

46
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,475
with the suffix P that
has a current injected

47
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,615
also record a current from it,
and we also create a "netcon"

48
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,996
that connects our pre-synaptic cell

49
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,501
to our synapse in
the post-synaptic cell.

50
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,876
As we can see, we have
the pre-synaptic cell firing

51
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,688
and the post-synaptic cell
fires with a small delay.
