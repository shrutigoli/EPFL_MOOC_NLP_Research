1
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:08,982
Okay, so how do we profile
the morphologies?

2
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:11,577
Well, when you do
this many times

3
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:18,064
you of course see a vast
number of cell types and here

4
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:20,653
every cell type is colored
a different color

5
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:25,076
and there are many
different morphologies

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,856
different ways that
the dendrites are branching

7
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,143
different ways
the axons are branching

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,252
and so, you need a lot of
examples of each of these cells

9
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:43,396
and here is sort of a catalog,
a sort of a periodic table

10
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:49,081
of the main morphological cell
types that are in the neo-cortex.

11
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:55,821
These are interneurons,
the inhibitory interneurons

12
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:06,208
and these are excitatory,
typically pyramidal cells

13
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:09,382
but there are also
other types of cells

14
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:12,724
that are not strictly pyramidal
cells, but excitatory cells.

15
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:18,629
You can see they have many
different branching features

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,649
they have names,
Martinotti cells

17
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:25,645
Bi-tufted cells,
Double-bouquet cell

18
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:29,550
Bipolar cell, and so on,
and these names

19
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,676
actually come from about a hundred
years of anatomical study

20
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:38,818
starting with Ramon y Cajal,
a very famous Spanish anatomist

21
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:41,928
who actually drew lots of cells.

22
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:43,723
Under a normal microscope

23
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:45,177
he would actually look
under the microscope

24
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:46,833
and then he would
just draw them.

25
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,415
Today we can
trace them in 3D

26
00:01:49,737 --> 00:01:52,615
but he named many
of these cells

27
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:56,757
and many of the famous
anatomists that followed

28
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,350
named many
of these cells.

29
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:07,931
Once you have the morphology,
you can analyze this morphology

30
00:02:08,206 --> 00:02:11,839
and we have released an open
source tool called Neuro-M

31
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:15,099
which you can
actually just run and analyse these

32
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:19,478
and you can get lots of
parameters about the cell

33
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:22,582
how big the cell body is,
how big the arbor is

34
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:26,603
how frequently they branch,
what the angle of branching is

35
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:32,506
and so on, and then these features you
can use either to try to classify cells

36
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:37,591
to see which class a cell fits into

37
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:41,515
but you can also use
them in other ways

38
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:43,972
to build new cells, and I will
show you that in the moment.

39
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:48,722
So, the important thing here
is that the classification

40
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:51,604
is based on local morphology

41
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:54,154
so it is just on the way that
this cell looks.

42
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:57,512
This of course is not
everything about a cell.

43
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:01,594
Cells may project to further places

44
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,880
but it is typically
the excitatory cells,

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,747
they project to different
brain regions

46
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:11,560
they project... whether it is
across the hemisphere

47
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:17,123
or to deeper brain regions or even
just laterally to different parts

48
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:22,300
of the neo cortex, but we just
look at the local morphology

49
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:25,372
and the name is based on
the local morphology.

50
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:28,015
Now one of the caveats in

51
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:32,701
getting morphologies
in slices, brain slices,

52
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,736
you saw the slice before,

53
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,064
is that you actually
shave off in the slice

54
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:42,404
because this is the slice,
that is the thickness of the slice,

55
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:51,673
so, you shave off a part of the neuron,
the branches of a neuron.

56
00:03:52,297 --> 00:03:56,686
So after you have done that,
you have to kind of repair

57
00:03:57,001 --> 00:04:05,470
the missing part and there is
software called Neurorepair

58
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:09,235
which identifies where
these cut points are

59
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:15,268
and then it grows these extended
parts to be consistent

60
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:15,328
with the statistics
of the other side.
and then it grows these extended
parts to be consistent

61
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:18,657
with the statistics
of the other side.

62
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,942
This is how we repair the morphologies.

63
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:28,114
Sometimes we also use data from
in vivo recordings to learn

64
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:37,750
how to do this repairing process
better, so in vivo validation.

65
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:44,791
One needs a certain number of
cells to be able to clone them

66
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:46,450
and make a bigger data set

67
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:48,589
and here what you are seeing
is the averages.

68
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:53,223
The average is many
cells overlayered

69
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:55,010
on top of each other

70
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,966
and you see a sort of an average
hexagonal structure.

71
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:07,402
This helps us obtain the statistics
that you need to, A

72
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:09,933
repair the cells. Also,

73
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:13,437
you can now computationally
clone these cells

74
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:15,295
you can make many
copies of them

75
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:17,455
within the statistical variations.

76
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:22,157
They are not exact copies,
they are statistical copies

77
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:27,734
so even in this case of
the neo-cortical micro circuit

78
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:33,294
we have about a thousand cells,
but we have enough initial statistics,

79
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:38,012
past data statistics, to actually
build hundreds of thousands

80
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:41,970
or millions of copies of each
of these different cell types

81
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:44,220
so we can produce many,
many copies.

82
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:47,315
That is one approach

83
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,125
and a more recent
approach that we are using,

84
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,376
and we won't go into that
in this MOOC, is where we

85
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:56,580
actually computationally
synthesized

86
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:59,398
them using the rules
of how they branch.

87
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:03,067
The idea here is that you

88
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:05,428
want to learn how
to synthesize

89
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:10,626
any cell type in the brain,
and that is a long term goal.
