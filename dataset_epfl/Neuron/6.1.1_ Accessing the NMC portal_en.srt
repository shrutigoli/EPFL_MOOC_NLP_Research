00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:08,973
Hi! In this tutorial I will
introduce to you the neo-cortical

2
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,697
micro-circuit collaboration portal

3
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:16,377
which is a companion website
to the (INAUDIBLE) 2015

4
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:21,006
cell paper publication
which describes a neo-cortical

5
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,129
micro-circuit model.

6
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:27,072
I will show you how to download
single cell electrical models

7
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,426
from this website, how to run them
on a local computer

8
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:36,687
and also we have a Jupyter notebook
that describes how to interact using

9
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:39,874
Python with these electrical models.

10
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:46,623
To access this website you can click
on the link provided in the notebook

11
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:49,819
that comes with this tutorial.

12
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:53,699
The NMC portal consists
of different sub-sections.

13
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,126
There is one sub-section that

14
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:59,304
describes the actual
microcircuit model

15
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:02,578
including all the statistics
that are taken from the model

16
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:06,955
and also you can download
electrical single cell models

17
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,214
from this sub-section.

18
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:12,398
Then there is a literature
consistency section

19
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:16,326
which describes which
papers are consistent

20
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:21,839
or inconsistent with this model,
then there's experimental data

21
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:29,587
provided that was used to build
some parts of this network model

22
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:32,507
and there's also a section with
the videos and the images

23
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,690
related to the building
of this circuit.

24
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:38,456
For this tutorial,
we are mostly

25
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:41,634
interested in
the micro circuit section.

26
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:46,884
This page shows the six layers
of the somatosensory cortex.

27
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,119
On one side you have
the pre-synaptic cells

28
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:53,778
on the other side you have
the post-synaptic cells

29
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:58,838
and the bars in between show
the different connections

30
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:01,869
between all the different layers

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,018
and you can click on each of these
bars to get more information about

32
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:08,791
their connection.

33
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:10,856
In this tutorial we are
mostly interested

34
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:15,252
in the single cell electrical models
available on this website.

35
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:18,170
So we go for example
to the layer five

36
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:21,459
and in this page of layer five
you can see all the difficult

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,142
different morphological types
that are present in this layer.

38
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,199
For this tutorial
we're going to look

39
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:30,888
at a layer 5 thick-tufted
pyramidal cell

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,505
which is also cell-divided
in two different sub-types

41
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:37,641
so here you actually have the two

42
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:41,444
layer five thick-tufted
pyramidal cells

43
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:47,190
and as you can see
on the right side there is

44
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:53,067
a tab that gives some information
about the anatomy of all these

45
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:57,792
layer five thick-tufted pyramidal
cells in our circuit simulation.

46
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:03,498
This link will bring us to a page
that describes this particular

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,407
morpho-electical type.

48
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,522
So morpho-electical
because the morphology

49
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:11,464
is a layer five thick-tufted
pyramidal cell

50
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,083
and the electrical type
is a continuously

51
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:18,164
adapting pyramidal cell
electrical type.

52
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:22,805
This page shows a lot of detail
about this morpho-electrical type.

53
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:26,733
For example, we have the typical
resting potential of this type

54
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,729
a typical input resistance,
and for example

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,770
the membrane time constant.

56
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:35,824
You can also see some
statistic about the anatomy

57
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:39,893
the apical lengths,
the apical volume, for example

58
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,442
the length of the axon,
the volume of the axon,

59
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:47,727
and you can also see which ion channels
have been used on the morphology

60
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:51,616
of this morpho-electrical type.

61
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:57,639
There are also some images,
it shows particular morphology

62
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,235
of this type and also
some traces that were

63
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:04,921
recorded from
this single cell model.

64
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:11,637
As you can see this
page has five tabs.

65
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,897
Each of these tabs presents
one example of morphology

66
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,222
that we picked from the circuits

67
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,606
that represents this
morpho-electrical type.

68
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:26,693
So what we will do in this tutorial
is take the first example

69
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:33,618
of this morpho-electrical type
and simulate it in our notebook

70
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:36,522
and for example one of
the exercises will be

71
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:41,483
to replicate the traces that are
available here on the website.

72
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:43,627
To get access to the model

73
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:46,970
one can just push the download
model button here

74
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,820
which will download a zip file
containing all the procedural

75
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:55,387
code that's necessary to run
this particular model

76
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:59,020
as described here
on this page.
