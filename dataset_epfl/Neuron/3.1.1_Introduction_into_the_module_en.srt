00:00:05,683 --> 00:00:08,371
Welcome everybody to
my part of this course.

2
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:12,684
I will be speaking today,
I have a big challenge today

3
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:17,864
to introduce to you the nerve cells,
in particular the electrical activity

4
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:19,151
of these nerve cells. 

5
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,526
My name is professor Idan Segev
from the Hebrew University

6
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,580
and what I will do today is
actually start with a motivation

7
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:29,949
just to introduce
the electrical activity

8
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:32,111
of the brain,
I'm sure you all know

9
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:34,284
that the brain is
an electrical device

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,605
not only, but certainly it is
an electrical device

11
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:39,450
we can record electrical
activity from the brain

12
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:42,390
for example,
by EEG from the skull

13
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:46,421
but today we’re interested to
understand much more about

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,387
the elementary units,
the nerve cells

15
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:52,262
that generate this electrical activity.

16
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:54,297
So, I will start with
the introduction of the neuron

17
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:58,688
as this is the elementary unit building
block of the nervous system

18
00:00:58,688 --> 00:01:00,125
any nervous system.

19
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:03,279
I will introduce the structure
of the neuron first

20
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:07,141
and then I will go to show
you that this neuron

21
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:10,482
has a special electrical activity,

22
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:14,670
very unique. Actually there is
two type of electrical activity.

23
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:18,436
One type is called
the spike, generated in

24
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,818
one part of the nerve cell,
and the other type of

25
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:21,280
the electrical activity is
called the synaptic potential.
one part of the nerve cell,
and the other type of

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,711
the electrical activity is
called the synaptic potential.

27
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,082
So, basically the same neuron,
the same nerve cell carries

28
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:32,132
two types of electrical activity,
the spike in the axon

29
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:35,100
and the synaptic potential
in the dendrite,

30
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:40,181
we shall try along the course
here to see how does one

31
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:45,988
mathematically model these
two electrical phenomenon

32
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:47,521
the spike and the synapses.

33
00:01:48,683 --> 00:01:52,316
And so, I will show you later
in the next part that what

34
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:56,440
underlies this electrical activity
is charged ion channels

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,175
that cross the membrane
of the nerve cell

36
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:02,159
and this crossing of
the nerve cell’s

37
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:05,025
membrane generates
electrical activity.

38
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:11,134
Then I will go to a model,
a mathematical model generated

39
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:15,178
by Hodgkin and Huxley,
published in 1952

40
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:18,941
a wonderful work where
by a set of equations

41
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:20,440
that we shall introduce here

42
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:26,143
summarize in a compact way
the mathematics of the spike.

43
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,643
So, we can today use
Hodgkin-Huxley mathematically

44
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:32,456
in the computer to replicate,
and you will see it,

45
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:35,761
to replicate the activity of
the spike following this

46
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:38,492
monumental work of

47
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,956
Hodgkin-Huxley
before the World War

48
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:43,535
published later in 1952.

49
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:48,143
And then I’ll go to the other signal:
the synaptic potentials.

50
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:50,520
These are the signals that
run in another region

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,051
of the neuron in dendrites,
and I will show you how

52
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:55,049
to model
synaptic potentials.

53
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:58,914
And then there will be
the challenge to connect the two.

54
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:01,443
I have to show you how
the synaptic potential

55
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:01,475
is generated locally in the dendrites,
propagate from
I have to show you how
the synaptic potential

56
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:06,365
is generated locally in the dendrites,
propagate from

57
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:11,803
the side of origin to the other
side of the neuron to the axon.

58
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:16,276
And so, I will try to combine
these two signals

59
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:17,699
as the neuron does

60
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,118
and show you eventually
how the input

61
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:23,895
the synaptic input,
the synaptic potentials

62
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,740
eventually together,
many of them generate a spike

63
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:32,492
in the other part of the neuron,
in the axon.

64
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:38,806
So, this will be a summary
kind of lesson or session

65
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:43,302
whereby I will take the modeling
of synaptic potentials

66
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,214
I will show you how these
synaptic potentials bombard

67
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:50,521
one part of the neuron,
the dendrite

68
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,615
and generate in
the other part

69
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:55,600
of the neuron
an electrical signal

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,695
another electrical
signal called the spike.

71
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,756
So, this is the plan for today.
