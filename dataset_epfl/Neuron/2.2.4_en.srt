1
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:08,655
So, at this stage I would like
to introduce Blue Brain Nexus

2
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:11,176
which is a platform
we are developing now

3
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:13,690
within the Blue Brain project.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,847
And in a few statements I would like
to tell you what the Brain Nexus is.

5
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:23,619
It is a data repository, you can
store in it all your data

6
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:26,505
and manage it from within
the platform.

7
00:00:26,705 --> 00:00:30,016
It is a metadata catalogue
in a sense that you can create

8
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:35,786
your entities with the very specific
metadata attributes.

9
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:39,806
And you can manage all these
entities in the platform,

10
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,177
and revise them, update them

11
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:44,646
without loosing any
of the information

12
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:48,576
and have full traceability
of who did what on these entities

13
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:50,942
so you can manage all the metadata.

14
00:00:51,142 --> 00:00:54,484
It does treat provenance
as a first class citizen.

15
00:00:54,684 --> 00:00:59,476
That means, when you install
the platform in your institution,

16
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:03,567
like we're doing in the brain,
problems is already ready.

17
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:06,033
So it is a set of entities

18
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,493
like you're going to define your own
entities for your own domain.

19
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:14,747
But there're already preinstalls
and well understood by the platform

20
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:17,684
so you can leverage them
from the beginning.

21
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:21,143
And important thing even so
this presentation

22
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:24,767
is about neuroscience,
Blue Brain Nexus itself

23
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:30,518
is agnostic of any domain,
it is not written to be specific

24
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:34,070
to neuroscience, you could design
any other scientific domain

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,527
or industrial domain on it.

26
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:40,502
So, the point is you have to create
your own domain.

27
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:43,880
Reuse existing domain and bring
them into your platform

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,510
to start collecting your own
metadata and data.

29
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,360
It has a deep understanding
of ontologies and it does support

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,918
them inherently,

31
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:57,308
so you can bring your own
ontologies and vocabularies

32
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:59,200
into the platform.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,348
It is also semantic search engine
that allows you to

34
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:06,075
once you have its metadata
progress information,

35
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:10,673
leverage this information
to ask relevant scientific questions.

36
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:16,962
It is secure for any
whether scientific or industrial

37
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:21,122
purposes you want to be sure
that both your data and your metadata

38
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:24,322
is not being leaked to the wells

39
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:27,686
and when you enter information
and you require

40
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:31,118
that this is only visible by me

41
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,677
the platform enforces these rules

42
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:35,251
and keeps it private.

43
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:38,314
Now, when you're ready to share
your data with your group

44
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:41,514
or the rest of the world,
you can say so and the platform

45
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:45,968
will just reflect these requests
and share the data appropriately.

46
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:51,386
Finally, it is built to handle
very large amount of data

47
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:54,769
and metadata and have a highly
concurrent usage.

48
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:58,963
So, it is built to be a production
system that you can depend on

49
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:00,348
to build your science.

50
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:04,255
So, in these slides I will give you
more concrete information

51
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:09,354
about how you would use the Brain
Nexus to deal with your own domain.

52
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:14,340
So, like I've said it comes
with provenance,

53
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,063
already present in a platform

54
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:22,923
and we haven't really reinvented
provenance, this is a well-defined,

55
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:24,966
well understood concept.

56
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:30,195
And W3C has already defined
a standard for this called W3C-Prov.

57
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:34,022
So, very naturally, we have
imported these concepts

58
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:38,593
into the platform and they
are supported natively.

59
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,519
So, this is what I'm showing here.

60
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:46,152
So, on the right hand side I have
the diagram that illustrate for you

61
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:49,457
what you can do with a platform.

62
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:55,706
So, the lower part here is what
I call the generic part

63
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:57,351
of the platform.

64
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:01,432
So, provenance comes already
with it preinstalled

65
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,441
so we don't have to worry about it.

66
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,257
And as parts of the provenance

67
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:08,524
there's a concept
of a provenance entity

68
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:11,074
which is completely domain agnostic.

69
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:18,517
It is just something that can be used
as an item you can derive from.

70
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:24,116
And so at this stage what is left
for the user to do is to define

71
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:29,146
your own domain and extend
the concept of provenance entity.

72
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:32,739
So, this is what I'm showing here,
you have

73
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,593
I'm not going to take yet
very concrete domain,

74
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:39,632
but let's say your domain is made
of four types of entities,

75
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:43,300
A, B, C and D.

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,448
These entities can extend through
these links.

77
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:52,373
The concept of a provenance entity
and by doing so

78
00:04:52,573 --> 00:04:58,450
you start being able to use them
in any provenance chain.

79
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,658
So, the first step is to define
your own provenance entities

80
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:09,632
and there's a formal way to do that
through schemas

81
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:12,099
and this is many more
of the technical details

82
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:15,150
I will not really dive too deep
into.

83
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,129
But these formats you have to use
to describe simply

84
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,329
how your entities called
and the properties

85
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:25,729
you wish to set on it
and the constrains

86
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:28,264
you want to define on this entity.

87
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:33,232
Once you have defined it,
so you have your file of this project

88
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:36,549
you will have to register it
into the platform.

89
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:39,028
And there's just a way to tell
the platform:

90
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:42,858
here's my entity, it extends
the provenance entity concepts

91
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:48,580
and here's its name
and its definition, please ingest it.

92
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,687
And give me an API
to interface with it.

93
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:55,887
And the important thing here
is by doing so

94
00:05:56,087 --> 00:06:01,233
the platform dynamically
makes available this new entity

95
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:04,234
to anyone who's allowed to use it.

96
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:07,914
And you haven't had to write
a single line of code.

97
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:13,222
So, you're able to define parts
of your domain

98
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:18,214
push them into the platform
and start operating on it right away.

99
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:25,005
So, the platform does support
schema and metadata versioning

100
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:28,655
so obviously you define
your domain today

101
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:33,825
but you may have forgotten something,
or new use case arrives

102
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:37,677
and you need to add another couple
of properties into your entity

103
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:41,534
no problem with that, you can just
take your schema as it were

104
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:47,048
add the necessary information
you want to put in it.

105
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:52,037
Save it again and you will get
a new version of this schema

106
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:54,650
that can then be used
into the platform.

107
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,480
Same goes for the metadata.

108
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,813
So, once you have defined your schema,
you can start creating instances

109
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:05,560
of this entity, so the schema
is really the definition, the shape

110
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,843
of this entity.

111
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:13,032
But the instances of this entity
are really the real data.

112
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,087
And with real value for
the attributes

113
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:19,542
and so you can save them
into the platform.

114
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:22,742
But again there you may have
say, made a mistake,

115
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,476
or you didn't have the full
info at the time you created it

116
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:29,374
so you may want to get back to it
and make an edit and save it again.

117
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,359
So, again, the platform fully
supports this and you can trace

118
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:37,441
who has done exactly what
and look at the full history

119
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:41,973
of both schemas
and provenance entity instances.

120
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:47,915
It does support file upload
and downloads with security in mind.

121
00:07:48,115 --> 00:07:52,285
And finally, once you have into it
define your schema

122
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:56,171
fed the platform with the instances
of these entities

123
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:59,035
for the metadata,

124
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:01,626
you can start brand new
semantic queries

125
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:07,108
that integrate both the metadata
and the provenance stored in a graph.

126
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:11,742
So, the goal really for us
is to give the power back

127
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,082
to our users.

128
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:18,483
So the platform does allow
the scientist to really take care

129
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:21,124
of defining their domain.

130
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:23,527
It's not a fact that they will do it
all by themselves

131
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:27,318
we are going to guide them
and help them defining it

132
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:31,360
and get though some of the technical
hurdles of doing so.

133
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,582
And so we feel that by allowing
the scientist to take control back

134
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:40,638
of the domain they care about
and they also the most knowledgeable

135
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:45,477
about this domain, we can each do
what we're best at.

136
00:08:45,677 --> 00:08:49,322
The scientist about the domain
and the software engineers

137
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:53,544
at building systems that will serve
the purpose of science.

138
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:58,635
So, that's really the ultimate goal
of the Brain Nexus.
