1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,987
So, in this section,
what we are going to cover

2
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:13,795
is an introduction
to simulation neuroscience.

3
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:16,561
First we are going to look
at the approaches to study the brain

4
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:20,439
and then we are going to go through
the rationale, the principles,

5
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:24,969
data strategy, informatics strategies,
reconstruction strategies,

6
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:26,742
and simulation strategies.

7
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:31,416
So, after this course,
this lecture, the first lecture,

8
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:35,394
you should have an understanding
of what simulation neuroscience is,

9
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:38,619
you should have a general idea

10
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:43,723
on how we treat data
and our approach to informatics,

11
00:00:44,596 --> 00:00:47,234
what we mean by reconstruction

12
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:50,756
and what kind of strategies
we use to do reconstruction,

13
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:52,887
tissue reconstruction,

14
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:56,817
and what strategies
we use for simulation.

15
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:58,472
These are very general concepts.

16
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:02,007
We are going to go in the next
lectures much deeper

17
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:05,759
and you should also have an
understanding of what the caveats are

18
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,771
for simulation neuroscience.

19
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:11,518
So, we are going to look
at the approaches to study the brain,

20
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:14,206
because I think we should
take a step back and say:

21
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:17,731
how do we advance
scientific knowledge?

22
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:23,871
With our three branches
of exploratory science if you wish

23
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:26,732
to discover new knowledge.

24
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:29,281
One of them is,
of course experimental.

25
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:31,695
That is the ground truth approach,

26
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:35,191
you observe,
you hypothesize, you test,

27
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:38,799
and you make more measurements.

28
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,297
For the brain of course,
we can look at normal brains.

29
00:01:42,497 --> 00:01:46,109
Everything from genes,
protein, cell, circuits,

30
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:49,235
cognition, psychophysics,
all the way up to behavior,

31
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:54,320
and then of course you have nature's
experiments which are the disease brain.

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,368
You can look at the effect
of toxins, effect of drugs,

33
00:01:57,568 --> 00:01:59,673
lesions on the brain,

34
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:02,409
mutations that are occurring

35
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,249
and degeneration with aging,

36
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:07,644
and all of these
provides you sort of

37
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,570
a repertoire of conditions

38
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,089
where you can actually
try to understand

39
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,070
what the brain is doing.

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,751
The second is
theoretical neuroscience or theory

41
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:22,613
where you essentially hypothesize

42
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:27,223
about the data
or about the observations

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,933
and one can look at them
in at least four different categories.

44
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,073
They are sort of informatics

45
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:38,522
which really tries
to look at the trends

46
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:41,026
or correlations
and patterns in the data.

47
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:44,249
Theoretical neuroscience

48
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:47,465
is trying to explain the data.

49
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:52,147
You see the data, you want to predict
outcomes of an experiment,

50
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,833
and you have a theory
about the data

51
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,860
and your observation.

52
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,046
Computational neuroscience
is more about building

53
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:07,774
a model to replicate
the experimental data

54
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:13,154
and generally,
it is to build a minimal model

55
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:18,122
and the idea is that if you can
explain a phenomenon

56
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:20,800
in the simplest possible way,

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,770
then you have
the deepest understanding.

58
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:29,827
It is debatable, but that is the
idea of computational neuroscience.

59
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:31,804
Then you have
applied neuroscience,

60
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:36,575
where basically you can say
that if I really do understand

61
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:41,308
how neurons work, then I can build
a device that will listen to them

62
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:47,124
and I can develop
a treatment that will cure them

63
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:49,299
and that is applied neuroscience.

64
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:51,962
Then there
is simulation neuroscience

65
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:56,025
and in neuroscience,
this is relatively new.

66
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,382
We're sort of driving this

67
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:01,190
or trying to pioneer this.

68
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,824
And the way to think of simulation
neuroscience is that

69
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:09,308
it unifies both experimental
and theoretical approaches.

70
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,980
The difference in simulation
neuroscience is that you consider

71
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,047
every detail of the brain.

72
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:17,041
Nothing is left out.

73
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:21,732
So for example, if you
had a theory of how language works

74
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,602
and you had a couple of equations
that could build a machine

75
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:27,464
that would be able to speak.

76
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:28,597
That would be wonderful.

77
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:32,582
It would indicate that you
have a deep understanding of language,

78
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:36,851
but it won't help you understand
how a genetic mutation

79
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:39,077
impacts language

80
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:41,531
and how that affects the next
neuron and the next circuit

81
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:45,333
and the brain activity
and how you should treat it.

82
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:48,642
So simulation neuroscience is about
taking all the data into account.

83
00:04:48,842 --> 00:04:51,461
All the knowledge into account
and integrating it.

84
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,900
It is also about filling
the gaps of knowledge

85
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:03,456
with hypotheses, because we may
not be able to measure everything.

86
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:07,303
Okay. So, another way to look at,

87
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:11,857
to get a perspective
on the way we approach the brain

88
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:16,710
is that there are individual researchers

89
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,738
and in the world there are probably
about 200,000 individual neuroscientists

90
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:25,044
that are exploring the brain.

91
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:29,378
So they are looking at a genetic level,
at the protein level,

92
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,575
at the behavioral level
and there is a huge repertoire

93
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:36,478
of different techniques
that can be used

94
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:40,152
to be able to probe the brain

95
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:42,414
and to assess what is going on.

96
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:46,553
And this is producing
a massive range of data

97
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:50,438
and today there are about
a 100,000 scientific papers

98
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:54,972
produced by these individual
research from all around the world.

99
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:57,941
So there is an enormous
amount of data being produced

100
00:05:58,141 --> 00:05:59,828
to understand the brain

101
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:03,024
and we actually do know
lots and lots of little pieces.

102
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:08,540
In individual research,
every lab has its own method,

103
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,884
its own conditions,
its own instruments, its own biases

104
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,210
and of course,
that means that

105
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,936
it is not always easy to compare data

106
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:23,570
and findings across laboratories.

107
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,325
And it is quite a significant
problem that in neuroscience,

108
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:30,649
a significant amount of the research
that has been done in individual

109
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,725
and individual laboratories...

110
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:37,797
...are difficult to reproduce
or impossible to reproduce,

111
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,202
but nevertheless,
they provide a massive source

112
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:42,338
of data and knowledge.

113
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:47,988
The second approach
to the brain is to go large-scale,

114
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:49,754
to go industrial scale.

115
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:53,395
For example,
the way that the Allen Institute

116
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,486
approaches brain mapping

117
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:58,388
or the Human Connectome Project

118
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:00,841
or some parts
of the Human Brain Project,

119
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,470
the European Human Brain Project

120
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,633
and the idea there is to standardize.

121
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,320
In the case of the Allen Institute,
for example, they would

122
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,094
standardize all the methods

123
00:07:12,294 --> 00:07:16,626
and they will produce 20,000 atlases
where each atlas

124
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:19,916
is telling you where one
gene is in the whole brain

125
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:23,979
and so you have 20,000 genes,
20,000 atlases

126
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:26,295
and they do that
very systematically.

127
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:30,378
So, you have very solid,
large block of data.

128
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:33,989
So this is large-scale brain mapping

129
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:38,041
and it is really sort of
industrial scale neuroscience.

130
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,676
It is extremely valuable data
for simulation neuroscience,

131
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:43,831
because it is highly standardized

132
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,988
and it is much easier to use.

133
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,902
But the individual
research is very valuable

134
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,901
to actually validate the model,

135
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:57,420
the reconstructed tissues
that are built afterwards.

136
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,943
So all data is valuable,
all approaches are valuable.

137
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,168
Then of course,
you have to database the brain

138
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:07,216
and this has a very long history.
There is a lot of efforts that have gone

139
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,077
into databasing the brain.

140
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:12,436
It was started in 1990
by Bill Clinton actually.

141
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:15,532
He started
the US Human Brain Project,

142
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:18,011
which was an effort
to database the brain.

143
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,798
It has been a very difficult,
very long journey,

144
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:25,812
because there are so many
different types of data

145
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:28,745
and different conditions
and different questions.

146
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:32,724
It is very difficult to decide
how to database the brain,

147
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:35,382
but there are now
international efforts

148
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,805
and it is also an effort
in the European Human Brain Project

149
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:43,061
to database the brain
in a systematic way.

150
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,511
It is not a solved problem.
There are a lot of challenges

151
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:50,987
and you are going to have a lecture
about it in this MOOC series later on.

152
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:53,796
And how do we approach the data.

153
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:56,898
And then we have of course:

154
00:08:58,335 --> 00:08:59,598
why do we do all of this?

155
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:03,187
In the end, we want to put
all the pieces together

156
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:07,444
and that is reconstruction simulation
or simulation neuroscience.

157
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:12,396
Another aspect is,
which simulation neuroscience

158
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:16,726
and large-scale industry mapping
of the brain introduce

159
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:18,906
is really what is called "team science".

160
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:23,136
It is very different, it is where you have
a lot of people with different expertise

161
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:26,463
sitting around the table
and solving one problem.

162
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:30,025
Very different from the individual...

163
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:34,588
..that is sitting in the lab
and addressing a specific question.

164
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:40,064
It is not whether one is better
or worse than another,

165
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:44,786
they are all part
of the whole approach

166
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:47,726
that the world today is using
to study the brain

167
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:51,526
and they are all playing a specific
role and they have their benefits

168
00:09:51,878 --> 00:09:53,525
in their own particular way.

169
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:57,463
In many cases team neuroscience
is indispensable.

170
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,552
It has to be done that way

171
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:03,072
and in many cases,
you have to have individual research.

172
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,470
Let's look now at the rationale.

173
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,374
Why do we need
to do simulation neuroscience?

174
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:12,241
What is the goal
of doing simulation neuroscience?

175
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,432
We have experiments,
we have theory.

176
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:18,372
Many people say
you only need theory,

177
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:20,303
you only need experiments,

178
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:22,968
you don't need to simulate the brain.

179
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:26,643
There is a lot of debate and discussions
and all kinds of ideas out there

180
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,104
about simulation neuroscience.

181
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:29,615
Why do you need it?

182
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,408
Well, first of all,
what we have to bear in mind

183
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:35,830
is that actually simulation science

184
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:39,770
is at the pinnacle of almost
all the hard sciences.

185
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:43,704
So you have got a material science
in the beginning,

186
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:46,510
you were tinkering around
with chemistry and materials

187
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,079
and you were building things,

188
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,253
you were experimenting how materials work
and how strong they are

189
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:53,898
and how flexible they are
and so on and so forth.

190
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:57,514
Today, you simulate them.

191
00:10:57,714 --> 00:10:59,708
You simulate materials almost

192
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:02,753
and you can actually simulate
a huge repertoire of materials

193
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,936
before you actually produce them.

194
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:09,474
In engineering, there is almost nothing
that is not simulated today.

195
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:11,600
Toilet paper.

196
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,973
Do you realize that you cannot actually
produce toilet paper without simulation?

197
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:20,196
These are very fine,
very soft tissue that you have to cut

198
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:22,953
in very specific ways
and you have to roll them out

199
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:26,071
at lightning speed in perfect...

200
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:28,282
this cannot be done
by experimentation.

201
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,628
It cannot even be done by theory.

202
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:34,318
You actually have to simulate
the physics of the tissue

203
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:37,218
in order to be able to wrap it.

204
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:40,016
Diapers, the space shuttles.

205
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:44,901
They have to be simulated in detail,
all the electronics.

206
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:47,705
Aircrafts,
they are being built through simulations

207
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:50,763
and then they are sent out to fly

208
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:52,689
without even a test run.

209
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,881
They just design them, simulate

210
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:58,626
and they are ready to go.

211
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:02,848
So simulation science is
the pinnacle of most of the sciences.

212
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,632
It hasn't arrived yet
at neuroscience, but...

213
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:08,333
..well, it has arrived now
at neuroscience.

214
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:11,133
So, I want to give you the rationale,
why do we need

215
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,538
simulation neuroscience
to understand the brain?

216
00:12:14,738 --> 00:12:18,291
The first and actually,
the main reason

217
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:22,152
is that understanding
the brain is a big data problem.

218
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:26,122
If you look at the numbers,
you realize that

219
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:29,466
there is no way that you
are going to be able to understand

220
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,629
all these pieces

221
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,747
and how they interact together.

222
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:35,879
You have 20,000 genes.

223
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:40,503
About half of them are expressed
in every cell in the brain.

224
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,342
There is about 1,500
that are very sort of over expressed

225
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:49,972
in the brain, but most cells express
about 30% to 50% of their genes.

226
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:56,014
Then they produce
around 200,000 proteins,

227
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:59,739
different types of proteins,
but each protein has a variant.

228
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:04,077
So you have about a million
protein variants per cell.

229
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:09,119
Then you have,
probably, we predict

230
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:12,621
about a billion molecules in a cell.

231
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:15,947
There are thousands
of molecular pathways.

232
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,458
There are millions of molecular
interactions per second in a cell.

233
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:26,537
There at least 2,000 cell types.

234
00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:30,115
So we have about 900 brain regions.

235
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,571
In each brain region,
there can be...

236
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:37,963
..at a minimum of two types
of cells, but in many cases

237
00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:40,958
10, 20, 50 types of cells.

238
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:43,788
So there is well over
2,000 different cell types.

239
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,797
In the mouse brain, you have about
a thousand kilometers of fibers.

240
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:53,485
In the human brain about
a million kilometers of fibers.

241
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:58,148
In the mouse brain,
about a trillion synapses,

242
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:01,927
in the human brain about
a thousand trillion synapses.

243
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:05,749
Mouse brain about
a hundred million neurons,

244
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:11,411
in the human brain,
about a hundred billion neurons.

245
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:15,314
So just for one instance,

246
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:19,424
one age, one species, one strain,

247
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:22,995
individual variations
and one disease,

248
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,133
this is everything
you have to map

249
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,599
and understand
how they all interact together

250
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,417
to give rise
to the emergent behavior,

251
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:34,559
to give rise
to psychophysical properties,

252
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,242
to give rise to cognition,
to give rise to a behavioral repertoire

253
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:40,045
and so on and so forth.

254
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:43,562
Imagine if you have to
do it for all the ages,

255
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:46,426
all the species,

256
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:48,839
all individual variations,

257
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,321
and for the more or less
600 different brain diseases.

258
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:58,716
This is not a problem that we can solve
only with experimental neuroscience.

259
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,421
Experiments of neuroscience
is key to ground truth.

260
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:06,393
You have to go back and test.
Always go back and test and experiment,

261
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:09,851
but there is no way
that you can understand the brain

262
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:12,828
if you do not have a strategy
where you can look at

263
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:16,086
how all of these elements
are interacting with each other.

264
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:21,225
And be able to predict
and look, explore

265
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:24,757
how they
could be changing the interactions

266
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,260
in different states of age species
and diseases.

267
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:31,201
So it is a big data problem

268
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:35,325
and there is no theory that is going
to solve this whole problem for you

269
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:39,911
in terms of understanding all the details
of what is going on in the brain

270
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:43,206
and there is not one experiment
that is going to solve all of this.

271
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:47,233
So for simulation neuroscience,
the claim is:

272
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:51,614
it is essential
for an ultimate understanding

273
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:53,873
of all the components of the brain

274
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:56,546
and how they give rise to us,

275
00:15:56,746 --> 00:16:00,121
our personalities and behavior.
