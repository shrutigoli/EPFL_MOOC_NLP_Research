1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,271
In this session, I will be
talking about another

2
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:10,239
aspect of neuroinformatics,
which is Brain Atlases

3
00:00:10,503 --> 00:00:14,001
and the link, also, to
the Knowledge Space.

4
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:19,329
Brain Atlases are actually
important in neuroinformatics

5
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:22,548
for organizing data,
because they establish

6
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:25,898
a link between
the semantics and space.

7
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:28,735
A Brain Atlas actually
consists of three things.

8
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:33,440
One is a coordinate space,
defined by a 3D template volume

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,101
a parcellation, which is  the parcel,
the Brain regions typically

10
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:42,301
within that volume defined
by a 3D boundary,

11
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:47,284
and an ontology, or defined
names and relationships between

12
00:00:47,284 --> 00:00:50,349
those brain regions defined
by the parcellations.

13
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:53,614
So these atlases can be
used to integrate data

14
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:57,314
using either the coordinates
of the space

15
00:00:57,552 --> 00:01:00,479
or the semantic tags
from the ontologies

16
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:00,551
and both can be
used to integrate.
or the semantic tags
from the ontologies

17
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:02,764
and both can be
used to integrate.

18
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,952
So, on this slide
I’ll show how you can

19
00:01:05,952 --> 00:01:08,963
search for data,
data that’s been registered

20
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:10,698
and annotated with
the ontologies,

21
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:13,401
and once you’ve annotated
the data you can

22
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:15,951
actually search for
a property, for example

23
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,454
a type of the cell,
a Martinotti cell

24
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:21,212
when you search for it,
you immediately find all those

25
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:23,388
cells that have been
tagged by Martinotti

26
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:27,475
or parametal cell type,
you can find it, discover it

27
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:32,300
and actually filter out
for a specific cell type

28
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:34,803
and go and find
out further

29
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,454
details and download
the data.

30
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:37,642
So, this is
important because

31
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:42,578
all of those aspects the data
that have been registered

32
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:44,594
with the meta data that
make it discoverable.

33
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:48,710
But then, with Atlases if
you tag the brain region

34
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,704
that the neuron morphology
is coming from

35
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,518
you can find data
also according

36
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,095
to the specific
brain region.

37
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,816
And here we’re looking at
a particular data set

38
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:01,595
from a collaborator in China

39
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,651
from Wu Han
the Britain Chance

40
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:06,508
Center for
Biomedical Photonics

41
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:06,538
where they’ve done
a whole brain
Center for
Biomedical Photonics

42
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:08,027
where they’ve done
a whole brain

43
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:10,461
Golgi scan
of the rat brain

44
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:14,668
and by viewing that, you can
see individual morphologies

45
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,245
throughout any
part of the brain

46
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:19,011
and by overlaying
the brain regions

47
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:21,289
you can find out which brain
regions are those from.

48
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:25,498
Now, we’ve also integrated
the Allen Reference Atlas

49
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:27,839
the latest common
coordinate framework,

50
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:30,699
and from each brain
region you can find out

51
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:33,188
the name of the regions,
but also we’ve searched

52
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:35,077
to something called
Knowledge Space

53
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:38,247
which is really a way
of searching for data

54
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:39,862
from around
the world, including

55
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:41,333
our own Knowledge Graph.

56
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:44,996
So, goes back and finds you
data from the hippocampus

57
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:48,032
that has been registered within
the Knowledge Graph,

58
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:51,485
but in addition it will allow you
to go off and search data

59
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,168
from databases from
around the world.

60
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:56,370
So for thalamus you can see
many different types of data

61
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,126
physiology,
gene expression,

62
00:02:58,126 --> 00:03:01,449
models, and so on,
from other databases.

63
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:07,388
Now if we go back to
the more occipital

64
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:12,496
area, say the primary visual
cortex in the mouse,

65
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,625
the primary visual area layer five

66
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,761
this is where the Allen
institute has been working

67
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,984
to capture a lot
of different neuron types

68
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:24,046
and actually this
provides a way searching

69
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:28,606
linking out of the atlas,
to go directly to

70
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:31,953
the Allen Institute’s data,
it’s all indexed

71
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:34,005
all linked in to
those atlases

72
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:36,018
as well as their
electrophysiological data,

73
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,763
which is provided as well.

74
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:44,180
So, the KnowledgeSpace
is that place, you just saw

75
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,278
that the Atlas links to
the knowledge space,
So, the KnowledgeSpace
is that place, you just saw

76
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:46,325
that the Atlas links to
the knowledge space,

77
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:47,884
but the Knowledge
Space is actually

78
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:52,726
the online encyclopedia
that you can use

79
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:56,617
to search for any particular
neuroscience concept,

80
00:03:56,617 --> 00:03:59,118
in this case, say,
we can go to the neocortex

81
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:00,405
you get
a definition of that,

82
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:02,795
you can find the related literature,
you can find

83
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:07,199
for example, how much
literature has been

84
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,132
published per year,
the place of neocortex

85
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:13,321
within a particular ontology,
and then link out to

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,448
the other data sets,
in this case neuromorpho.org

87
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:21,464
which has large number of
morphologies from neocortex

88
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,340
and you can find
other types of data

89
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,451
as we’ve seen before,
from the Allen Institute,

90
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:30,764
specific layer five
parametal cells,

91
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:35,344
and actually go in and directly
go get that data.

92
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,080
So in this session,
you’ve learned about

93
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,325
organizing data using Brain Atlases,
searching for data,

94
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:47,824
finding data via a Brain Atlas,
and through that integration

95
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:51,422
the common ontologies and
also knowledge-space.org

96
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:51,463
which is an online
encyclopedia
the common ontologies and
also knowledge-space.org

97
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:53,463
which is an online
encyclopedia

98
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:54,588
that is integrated

99
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:57,464
with this ecosystem using
the common ontologies

100
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,389
to discover data
that’s federated

101
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:01,827
from around the world.
