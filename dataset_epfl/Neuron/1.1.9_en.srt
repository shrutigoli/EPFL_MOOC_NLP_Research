1
00:00:05,174 --> 00:00:08,106
So, let's now go
to reconstruction strategies.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,362
In reconstruction,
I already mentioned

3
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:13,118
that you build
your components bottom up.

4
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:16,552
So you start with your ion channels,
you build your neurons,

5
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:20,726
you build your synapses,
you connect your neurons with synapses

6
00:00:20,926 --> 00:00:22,243
and you get circuits.

7
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:26,175
You package them into workflows

8
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:30,274
and to workflows and you automate
these workflows as much as possible,

9
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:34,292
because as I said, the most important
thing in simulation neuroscience

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,292
is actually to reconstruct,

11
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:40,055
test, validate, find mistakes,

12
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:42,365
reconstruct again and again
and again and again

13
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:45,912
until it becomes a digital copy
of the tissue.

14
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:52,158
So here is an example
and we will be going over that

15
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:55,449
in over many lectures.
You have your neurons,

16
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,155
you find out all your types of neurons

17
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:03,207
and then you work out
how to position them together

18
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:06,618
and then you find out
how to connect them together

19
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:09,135
and then you add the physiology,

20
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,691
how do they behave,
every neuron behaves.

21
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,475
And then how every synapse behaves

22
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:17,333
and then you have a circuit.

23
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:20,971
The last part that we will look at
is simulation strategies

24
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:27,023
and of course this involves billions
and billions of calculations

25
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,742
in order to compute
every ion channel opening

26
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:36,994
and there may be tens of thousands
of ion channels in a single neuron

27
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:40,899
and then there are currents
flowing inside a neuron.

28
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,465
So there are a lot of calculations

29
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:47,359
and Felix is going to give
you some ideas of the numbers

30
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:50,954
of calculations and types
of calculations that have to be done,

31
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:53,712
but clearly you need a supercomputer.

32
00:01:53,932 --> 00:01:56,593
But sometimes people say
"oh, why didn't you do it on the grid?"

33
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:59,998
or "why didn't you do it
on some cluster or whatever?"

34
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:04,324
The important thing
about simulating neural tissue,

35
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:07,342
not building a model,
(INAUDIBLE) simulating your tissue,

36
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:11,139
a digital reconstruction is that...

37
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,964
...the whole simulation will run

38
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:20,631
as slow as
or fast as the slowest interaction.

39
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:25,444
The neurons have too much memory
to be on one processor,

40
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:29,781
so each processor
has to transmit information

41
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:31,381
to another processor

42
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:34,569
and so when
the neurons communicate,

43
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:38,236
they are actually
communicating between processes

44
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:40,164
and if you had a grid for example,

45
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:42,840
and just one connection was slow,

46
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:45,062
you would have to wait.

47
00:02:45,262 --> 00:02:49,746
The whole brain, the whole tissue
that you have reconstructed has to wait

48
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:54,077
for that transmission
to occur before the rest can happen.

49
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:58,410
So you need a supercomputer,
where there is fast interconnect.

50
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:02,277
So that is why
you need a supercomputer,

51
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:06,653
you need
to have simulation code, of course

52
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:11,132
that can distribute
this problem of all these neurons

53
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,720
across many, many processes

54
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:18,041
and so you need the parallel code
and in the Blue Brain Project we have...

55
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:21,781
..worked with the father of

56
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:24,976
one of the most important
simulators called NEURON,

57
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,405
it is Michael Hines from Yale,

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,589
and we worked with him
to advance this code,

59
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:36,521
so that it can really run very large
scale simulations on supercomputers.

60
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,262
So you need parallel code

61
00:03:40,143 --> 00:03:43,585
and then there are lots of other
challenges.

62
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:48,464
Supercomputers
were designed and built largely

63
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:52,458
for nuclear simulations

64
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:55,441
and for other kinds
of applications in physics

65
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:57,396
and in particle physics,

66
00:03:57,597 --> 00:03:59,734
where you have a big problem,
you ask a question

67
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:02,534
and you get the simple answer back.

68
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:06,039
It is not as simple. It is a very 
interesting answer, but you get an answer back

69
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,875
and in simulation neuroscience,
you want to...

70
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:11,868
you are dealing with a lot of memory
and you want to know everything

71
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:15,494
that is happening inside
the reconstructed tissue.

72
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:20,195
So you need
data intensive supercomputing

73
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:24,103
and you need efficient algorithms
to handle data.

74
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:27,154
You need to balance the load.
One neuron may be very big

75
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:28,710
another one may be very small,

76
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,573
so you need to know how to distribute
your neurons across processes

77
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,056
and you need to know how to manage all
your resources, your computing resources.

78
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:39,372
One may be going very slowly,
one may be going very fast.

79
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:43,006
So it is a resource
management challenge,

80
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:45,362
it is a data management challenge,

81
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,473
but principally, you can summarize
that as you need

82
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:52,010
data intensive supercomputing

83
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:58,208
and supercomputers are slowly
moving in that direction

84
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:01,043
where they can hold a lot of memory.

85
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:05,864
Now the value of simulations,
why do you need a simulation?

86
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:08,947
Is it just that you get
a nice pretty picture?

87
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:12,482
Well, it is because if you build it,

88
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:14,648
you want to see how it behaves

89
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:19,058
and you want to be able to compare
it to a real piece of tissue.

90
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:25,152
So the way we see the reconstructed
tissue is like a virtual brain

91
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:27,373
or virtual piece of tissue

92
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:31,398
and we want
that we can visualize it

93
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:35,194
and experiment on it
as if it is a real piece of tissue.

94
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:39,052
Now we look at real pieces
of tissues under the microscope.

95
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,469
We stain their cells,

96
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,974
we measure them electrically

97
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,820
and so we actually do very similar...

98
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,060
we build in silico microscopes,

99
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,844
in silico recording devices and so on,

100
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:58,017
so that we can directly compare
experiments with a virtual tissue.

101
00:05:58,536 --> 00:06:00,536
Here is just an example,

102
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:05,567
where the difference
when you have a reconstruction,

103
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:09,952
a detailed reconstruction, 
compared to the biological tissue

104
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,736
is that in the reconstruction,

105
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,750
you know everything.

106
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:18,097
You know every neuron,
the name of every neuron,

107
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:21,419
you know every single
spike that is occurring,

108
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:25,027
where the neuron is located,
you know every synapse

109
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:30,401
and so it gives you an x-ray
view into the digital tissue.

110
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,810
This is impossible in experiments.

111
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:40,090
You can get a tiny small view
into what is going on,

112
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,527
but you can't get a global view
and you can't get a deep view.

113
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:46,693
So by reconstructing the tissue,

114
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:50,314
if your algorithms are good enough

115
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:53,748
to replicate the tissue,

116
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:59,451
then you
have a virtual exploratory environment

117
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:02,825
where you have an x-ray view
into all the mechanisms.

118
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:06,480
And in subsequent lectures, we will see

119
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,603
the power of that.
That it can actually give you,

120
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:12,848
take you way beyond
what experiments can do.

121
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:15,539
You can explore mechanisms,

122
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:17,869
you can test hypotheses

123
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,978
about how the circuit behaves

124
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:24,214
in ways that 
are impossible experimentally.
