1
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:06,372
In this lecture

2
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:09,095
we are going to focus
on synaptic dynamics.

3
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:12,886
In the previous one,
we touched briefly on

4
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:17,203
the quantal size of the kinetics,
of the strengths of the synapse

5
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:20,104
the amplitude of the synapse,
and now we are going to focus

6
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:24,219
on the dynamics of
transmission in particular.

7
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:31,931
So, when you record from
four neurons, 1, 2, 3, 4

8
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,464
it is not that they are all
connected to each other.

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,260
You will find that
10% are connected

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,918
so there is a 10% chance that
they are going to be connected to each other

11
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:48,177
in this case it maybe that this
one is connected to this one

12
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:50,769
but remember with
multiple synapses.

13
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:56,456
Now, what I showed you
previously was that it was

14
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,893
what was the response to
a single action potential

15
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:03,113
that you produce this EPSP.

16
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:07,865
EPSP as your action potential.

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,917
But if you give a train
of action potentials

18
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,743
so it is a high frequency train
of action potentials

19
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:16,895
you see that the amplitude
starts dropping

20
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:24,753
and if you then wait,
you wait for 500ms

21
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:27,958
and you give another
action potential

22
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,929
you see that it is recovered
to some extent,

23
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,191
it hasn't completely recovered,

24
00:01:32,488 --> 00:01:35,629
you would have to wait longer
before it recovers to this level.

25
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:39,661
This is called synaptic depression.

26
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:49,804
Now, it is extremely important

27
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:53,210
because every synapse has
some synaptic depression.

28
00:01:54,117 --> 00:01:57,006
So they are not
linear synapses,

29
00:01:57,253 --> 00:02:00,284
there isn't any case
in the neocortex

30
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:04,597
at least where every spike
has the same effect

31
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:07,362
if it is given in a high
frequency.

32
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:13,791
So this is synaptic depression,
so you have the conductance

33
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:17,069
which is the amplitude,
how big is this response

34
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:20,295
and that is only for
the first action potential

35
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:25,021
which you see here as well,
and then if you give a train

36
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:29,027
you see this drop,
so we call this the weights

37
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:34,089
and what most people know in neuroscience 
and most people use in neuroscience

38
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:37,386
and when they build
models of the brain

39
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:38,890
and neural network models

40
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:42,345
they have two
neurons that

41
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:44,655
are connected and they
adjust the weights.

42
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:46,219
This is what they are
talking about

43
00:02:46,638 --> 00:02:49,292
as what is the magnitude
of the response when

44
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,596
one neuron communicates
with another neuron

45
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:56,032
but it is not that simple and it is
actually much more exciting

46
00:02:56,323 --> 00:03:00,514
that there is also an interesting
dynamic in the transmission

47
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:04,515
so it is almost as if the synapse
gets tired of communicating

48
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,203
you start communicating,
it is a loud sound in the beginning

49
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:09,939
and then it gets softer.

50
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:13,269
Now, it has
interesting behavior

51
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:16,752
interesting properties
of synaptic depression

52
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:23,344
is that if you start off with 10Hz,
you see this kind of depression

53
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:27,042
and then you go to
20Hz, 30Hz, 40Hz

54
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:29,045
and it depresses faster.

55
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:35,456
If you plotted on a curve,

56
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:40,792
you see that the synaptic
amplitude drops significantly

57
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:46,218
and these two
curves are actually

58
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:51,760
in high calcium
and low calcium.

59
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,450
This is the low calcium case.

60
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,157
The reason why
we drop calcium

61
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:57,277
is because it lowers
the probability of release

62
00:03:57,277 --> 00:04:00,340
so that the EPSP
starts off smaller.

63
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:05,939
If the calcium is high it starts off
bigger and depresses faster.

64
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:13,217
But what is interesting is that,
at a certain frequency

65
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:19,076
the amplitude drops inversely
proportional to the frequency.

66
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:22,235
It is what we call one of F behavior

67
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:25,544
and that is important because
it means that beyond

68
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:27,580
this frequency
you can fire

69
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:31,737
the presynaptic cell
as fast as you want

70
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,175
but the product of

71
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,793
the amplitude and
the frequency stays constant.

72
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,409
Which means you are screaming
as loud as you want

73
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,307
and the louder you
scream the more

74
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:45,947
the amplitude is adjusted

75
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,611
so that you hear exactly the same thing,
and you can see that here

76
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:54,086
the steady state amplitude plateaus.

77
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:57,925
So that means that
neurons have a limit

78
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:59,849
in how they are communicating

79
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,600
with this you can't
just jack up the volume

80
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,381
you can't just communicate
faster and harder

81
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:10,759
there is a dynamic, it is reacting
to how you communicate

82
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:13,455
and this is going to turn out
to be extremely important

83
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:22,517
shaping the dynamics of
neural circuits and we believe

84
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:25,224
they are fundamental
to the emergence

85
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:28,118
of higher level
cognitive functions. 

86
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,738
Now, an interesting principal,

87
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:34,626
there are a few principals
we have learned from this

88
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:40,614
and the first is that, when you...
these are three cells here

89
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,660
there are three cells here,
one, two, three

90
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:48,769
and one cell is communicating
to both these cells

91
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:54,275
so here is the action
potential train from cell one

92
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:57,773
that is communicating
to the other three

93
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,506
and in one cell you can
see a strong response

94
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,583
and in other cell you
see a small response

95
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:09,032
and that is probably just
because it has less synapses

96
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:12,183
so it is just connecting
with maybe

97
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:14,594
two or three or
four synapses

98
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:19,982
and here it is maybe connecting
with five or six synapses

99
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:26,139
but also because the probability
of release here may be low

100
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:30,026
and the probability of
release here may be high.

101
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:34,049
The principal here is that

102
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:36,783
even though they have
different amplitudes

103
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:41,664
they all show depression,

104
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:47,320
and so the principal is,
when these types

105
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,128
of cells communicate
with each other

106
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:53,769
these are layer five
parametal cells, they depress.

107
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:58,503
And this is going to be
important as you are will

108
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,362
see in the next few slides.

109
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:03,009
Now, what you also
find is that if you have

110
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,332
two of the same
type of cell

111
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:07,897
and they communicate
with each other

112
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:10,479
you see the depression,
which is what you see here.

113
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:16,160
But, if it is also
the same axon and

114
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:18,972
it touches
another type of cell

115
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:21,913
suddenly you see an opposite
type of behavior

116
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,727
the synapse gets stronger

117
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:25,195
and actually it even
gets so stronger

118
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,850
it starts firing this other cell.

119
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:31,939
So, this singe cell can
start communicating

120
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:33,893
and then it kind of warms up

121
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:36,571
and it gets stronger
until this cell reacts.

122
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:51,268
This is called synaptic
facilitation. Okay.

123
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:58,836
Synaptic facilitation has
another interesting dynamic

124
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,664
in response to frequency.

125
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,255
So, when you increase
the frequency here

126
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:07,645
the amplitude first grows,
and then it reaches a peak

127
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:11,628
and then it starts depressing,
and it starts depressing because

128
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:15,985
this synapse also has depression

129
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:18,303
it is just that it
has a slower time

130
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:20,550
constant for the depression.

131
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:24,911
So, first you see the facilitation,
that you see here

132
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:27,519
that makes the amplitude
grow and then it drops

133
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:29,431
and what is interesting is that

134
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:32,821
depending on how much
facilitation there is

135
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,555
you can actually
calculate when it is

136
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:37,832
going to reach its
peak frequency.

137
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,583
This is very important because

138
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:44,726
that means that these synapses
behave like bandpass filters.

139
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,614
At a certain frequency
they are going to be the strongest.

140
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:51,566
If the frequency is lower
they are going to be very weak

141
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:54,695
and if it is much higher, they are
going to be very weak as well.

142
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,862
So, there is a certain frequency
that that they have got to fire

143
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,800
in order to have a maximum
effect on the other cell.

144
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:03,308
What this translates into

145
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:06,085
is that if you have
poisson type of firing

146
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,928
which is what
you have when you

147
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:10,565
record from
neurons in the brain

148
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:13,495
actually it doesn't look like this,
it needs structure

149
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:16,025
it looks like there is noise,
they are just firing

150
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:20,968
and if you apply that kind of
firing to a pre-synaptic cell

151
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:22,760
and you look at the response

152
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,690
you see wildly
fluctuating amplitudes

153
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:32,343
so you do not get
a constant amplitude

154
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:35,900
which is what most
people today still

155
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,187
even ten years
after this discovery,

156
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:43,010
most people still use
in neural networks

157
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:46,109
constant amplitude synapses
with just the weight

158
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:48,078
and not with the dynamics.

159
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:52,937
But this is how all synapses
in the neocortex behave.

160
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:55,040
Now there are three classes

161
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,815
there are the synapses
that facilitate,

162
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:03,341
they grow, and we classify

163
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:06,310
them and you can actually distinguish
them statistically

164
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,463
you can cluster them

165
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:09,730
and you can show that
these are different classes

166
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:13,314
these will occur between
certain types of cells

167
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:16,243
and not between other
types of cells

168
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:18,236
and then you have
the depressing synapses

169
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:23,390
and then you have what we
call pseudo linear synapses,

170
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:26,719
synapses that with
a facilitation and depression

171
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,986
are almost balanced

172
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:32,640
so the synapse can fire
at very high frequencies

173
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:35,053
and they only show a
mild depression.

174
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:37,552
Now what is
interesting is that if

175
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,312
you look at a single neuron

176
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:43,078
now you have to consider that
there are many

177
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:45,812
different types of cells that

178
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,800
are communicating with this cell

179
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:52,004
and each of them can use
a different type of synapse.

180
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,923
That means that this
neuron is interpreting

181
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,859
even exactly the same
action potential train

182
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:02,161
that may be coming

183
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,281
even if they could inject the same

184
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:06,205
action potential train
from each of these cells

185
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:09,316
this neuron would interpret
this message differently

186
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:13,722
from each neuron, for each neuron.

187
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:18,816
But it doesn't just stop there,
it is because these

188
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:24,523
synapses are also distributed
in many different places.

189
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:27,504
So, now you can see that what

190
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:30,445
a single neuron listens to,

191
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:34,212
when it is listening to this crowd
of other neurons around it

192
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:39,348
depending on which
cell it is listening to,

193
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,942
those synapses are sitting on
different parts of the dendrite

194
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:47,144
and it is interpreting
the input from those

195
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:48,738
different parts of the dendrite

196
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:52,006
in a unique way
specific to that cell.

197
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,160
So it is almost as if every
neuron has its own way of

198
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,988
selectively listening to
specific types of cells.

199
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:05,976
And this complicated
map actually is just a map

200
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:12,484
of what kind of synapse
you are going to place

201
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:16,139
or exist between
different types of cells.

202
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:19,281
There are actually
thousands, 

203
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,050
as close to three thousand
different types of connections

204
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,828
in this micro circuitry
of the neocortex

205
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:27,546
and we haven't recorded
from all of them

206
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:30,295
but what we have discovered
was a set of principles

207
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:34,552
that allow us to extrapolate that

208
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:37,921
if you have a parametal cell

209
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:41,828
and it is connecting with
the Martinotti cell

210
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,130
or any that have these
electrical properties

211
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:48,056
then it is going to use
this type of synapse

212
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:51,726
and if it is connecting
onto a basket cell that

213
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:53,722
has these electrical
properties

214
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,681
then it is going to use
this type of synapse.

215
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,850
This way we actually
have a way today

216
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,153
to almost completely
specify what kind

217
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:06,497
of synapse exist between
different pairs of cells

218
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,837
even though we haven't
recorded from all of them.

219
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:15,652
So, the caveats in what
I have showed you today

220
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:20,004
is that synaptic dynamics
may change during recording

221
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:21,366
which I haven't told you

222
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:24,460
but it is because the dynamics

223
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:28,661
in a synapse may require
an energy supply

224
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:30,301
and if you patch a cell

225
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,693
you may dilute
the energy supply

226
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:37,176
ATP, and creating phosphate and
other support systems.

227
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:40,964
So one has to be careful
when studying dynamics

228
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:44,509
to ensure that you are doing it in
a way that you are not depleting

229
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:47,519
to see a sort of rundown
of the dynamics.

230
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:53,897
The second caveat is that there
is a combinatorial principal,

231
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:56,168
it depends on
the identity of

232
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,555
the pre and
the post synaptic cell

233
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:01,777
as to what kind of synapse
they are going to put in there.

234
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:06,180
That means that you really
need to solve a very big puzzle

235
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:10,301
where you have all your cell types,
versus all your cell types

236
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:11,520
and you have to find out

237
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:13,709
what type of synapse to put
between all of them

238
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:21,529
and that is not possible to do,
even for a small piece of the brain

239
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:23,357
let alone the whole brain

240
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:26,623
but what is possible is to get
some principal so you can

241
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:29,494
infer that between this type
of cell and that type of cell

242
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,870
they are going to place this
type of synapse.

243
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:39,276
The third caveat is that you need
to understand dynamics

244
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:42,476
you have to stimulate
the pre-synaptic cell

245
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,882
with a train of action potentials.

246
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:49,368
Many people stimulate
with one spike

247
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,465
then you are blind
to the dynamics

248
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:55,011
and if you stimulate
with two spikes

249
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:58,556
you can look
into the theory

250
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:01,679
it is impossible to work out
what the dynamics are.

251
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:06,481
So, what is called the pen pulse
protocol is insufficient

252
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,759
to characterize
synaptic dynamics

253
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:11,635
and it is an important
caveat to remember

254
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,789
if one wants to characterize
or interpret

255
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,711
synaptic data that one
finds in the literature.

256
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:21,947
Okay, so what you learned
in this lecture was

257
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:26,544
that there are strong frequency
dependence synaptic dynamics

258
00:15:27,372 --> 00:15:29,775
in all connections
in the neocortex

259
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:31,231
there is no exceptions.

260
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:36,993
Most excitatory to excitatory
synaptic transmission

261
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:39,182
shows synaptic depression

262
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:42,842
although there is depression
between all kinds of cells

263
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:46,366
and in some you have
synaptic facilitation,

264
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:49,338
typically onto certain
types of inter-neurons

265
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:53,825
or inhibitory cells, so they
get activated with a delay.

266
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,289
And then the same axon can travel

267
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:01,538
and have a depressing synapse

268
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:05,213
and then the next bouton can
have a facilitating synapse

269
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:09,437
so when a single neuron communicates
with a thousand other neurons

270
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:14,888
it actually has different synapses
to interpret the same message.

271
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:20,837
So it is like I am sending a broadcast signal,
and everybody that is listening

272
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:23,539
hears something different.

273
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:28,338
So, the last thing you have learned
is that the synaptic dynamics

274
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:32,478
depends on both the pre and
post synaptic neurons

275
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:36,210
so it is a partnering, so you
take any two people,

276
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,727
it depends on the identities
of the two people

277
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,149
as to how they are going

278
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,232
to interpret what
each other are saying.

279
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:48,339
Same person talks
to another person

280
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,515
there is a different
interpretation

281
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,304
because there is
a different synapse.

282
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:56,121
Okay, that is it for this
time, thank you.
