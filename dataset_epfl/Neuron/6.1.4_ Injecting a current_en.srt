1
00:00:05,621 --> 00:00:07,897
So now that we have a cell
object in the soma

2
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:10,598
we can, just as in other tutorials

3
00:00:10,784 --> 00:00:14,959
inject a step current
into the soma object.

4
00:00:15,623 --> 00:00:20,598
For this, we create an I_Clamp,
and we set certain variables

5
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:23,806
for example, we say we're
going to inject for 400ms

6
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:28,587
after a delay of 100ms,
and we'll inject a certain amount

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,750
of nano amps into the cell.

8
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:36,142
So you might be wondering where
is this specific nano amp value

9
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:38,170
coming from?

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,320
Basically, the traces you see
on the website have a certain amount

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,830
of current injected into them.

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,185
This current values can actually
be extracted from a file

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,505
that's located in
the model directory

14
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:56,685
the file is called
"current_amps.dat"

15
00:00:56,888 --> 00:01:00,188
and here you see the code that
actually reads all these values.

16
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:04,198
So the file contains
four different values

17
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:10,232
and you see that we use the later
one for our current injection here

18
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:12,964
so the first one is
the holding current

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,090
I'll explain this in a second,
and the last three values are

20
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,749
three different step currents
and every step current

21
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:29,127
corresponds to one trace that can
be seen on the NMC portal website.

22
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,279
The holding current is actually
athe current that's injected during

23
00:01:34,457 --> 00:01:38,532
the entire length of the experiment
and it's used by

24
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,732
the experimentalists to hold
the cell at a certain

25
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,318
pre-defined voltage.

26
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:49,143
So for example in our case
it's arround -84mV to -85mV.

27
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:53,118
So now let's run a little
simulation with this

28
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:54,463
step current.

29
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:58,017
So in this case, again
the "init.hoc" file

30
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,191
provided us with the convenience
function, create recording

31
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:06,686
to automatically initialize
some recording variables

32
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:11,678
and we can easily run the simulation
by setting the "tstop" value

33
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:14,491
so the length of the simulation,
so we're going to simulate

34
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:21,783
for 600ms and with
a time step of 0.05ms.

35
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:26,149
So let's execute this box of code.

36
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:32,116
As you can see it will take a little
bit of time to simulate the cell.

37
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:35,049
Just as in previous tutorials
I have written a little

38
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:38,917
convenience function
to plot the voltage

39
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:42,749
so now we can actually get
the time and voltage from

40
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:45,301
some variables in NEURON

41
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:47,853
and plot a graph.

42
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:53,034
As you can see, the model
has fired six spikes

43
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,703
in accommodating
fashion.

44
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:59,313
So now we have a little
exercise for you.

45
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:03,113
As you can see,
this trace will not correspond

46
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:08,445
to the traces that are located
on the MNC portal website.

47
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:13,509
So this is, because for example here
we are only simulating for 600ms

48
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:16,949
while on the website
we're simulating for 3 seconds.

49
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:20,146
So basically rewrite
the code above a bit

50
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:23,696
so that you stimulate for
a longer time and you also

51
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,877
have to inject another current
using another I_Clamp

52
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:30,012
that represents the holding current.

53
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:33,011
So you basically have to inject
that current for the entire

54
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:36,147
length of the simulation.
