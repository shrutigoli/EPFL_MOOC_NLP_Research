1
00:00:05,608 --> 00:00:07,869
Okay now,
let’s continue 

2
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:12,906
looking at the neuron
as an electrical device.

3
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,777
So, here is a neuron again.

4
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:19,356
You can see in dark
the dendritic tree

5
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:22,296
you can see in light red

6
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:25,715
the axonal tree of
this pyramidal neuron

7
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:28,338
and you can see
actually if you

8
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:30,400
look carefully on
the dendritic tree

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,712
you can see these boutons,
that I’ve just mentioned

10
00:00:32,712 --> 00:00:34,357
these little spots.

11
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,573
Another one, another one,
another one.

12
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,698
Sometimes ten thousand
of these spots...

13
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:43,733
as I mentioned these are
the pre-synaptic sites in axon

14
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:46,747
that will connect
to some dendrites

15
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:48,169
that are not shown here.

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,620
So this is a neuron.

17
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:54,533
Now I want to highlight
for you by drawing them

18
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:57,726
the two types
of elementary signals,

19
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:00,524
the basic signals that the
neurons carry.

20
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:06,822
So, let’s assume that I record
from inside of a dendrite

21
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:11,115
so this electrode now
is supposed to impale

22
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:12,986
deep into the dendrite,

23
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:15,516
we shall discuss this
inter-cellular recording,

24
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:19,344
so this is a cell in my brain now,
or in your brain

25
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:24,094
and now I’m drawing for you
what are the electrical signals

26
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:26,816
that we call the synaptic
potentials here

27
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:28,409
that you would see.

28
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:31,377
In vivo,
in the living behaving brain.

29
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:35,045
So, this will be a potential and
you would see things like that.

30
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:39,677
Something goes up,
something goes down

31
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:42,968
up, down, up, down.

32
00:01:43,476 --> 00:01:45,999
You see these
voltage fluctuations

33
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,431
so this is voltage

34
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:52,056
and this is on the range
between 1mV to 10mV.

35
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:59,991
These are the synaptic potentials,
so this you’ll see in dendrites

36
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:04,168
these little bumps of voltage
of potential, small ones,

37
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:07,072
some are going up,
some are going down,

38
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:14,318
and in time you will see some
kind of noisy voltage trace.

39
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,725
These are synaptic potentials,
they are built of many elements

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,460
we shall talk about this
particular one element:

41
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:24,247
the synaptic potential,
a single synaptic potential.

42
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,289
Here you see many of them.

43
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:29,711
And later we shall also see
that these many of them

44
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,748
are built of these two types.

45
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,587
One is an excitatory
synaptic potential

46
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,757
and the other is the inhibitory
synaptic potential,

47
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:40,724
now superimposed
one on top of the other.

48
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:42,927
So that’s what
happens in dendrites.

49
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:46,620
This is one type of signal,
the synaptic potential.

50
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,591
The other type of signal you
will see typically in the axon

51
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,226
so now if I record from the axon,
from inside the axon

52
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:57,288
I will see something like that,
I will see this noise

53
00:02:57,288 --> 00:03:00,496
that I showed you before,
the synaptic noise, or voltage,

54
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:02,369
and from time to time
you see this

55
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,636
kind of very big
phenomenon, the spike.

56
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:15,652
Noise, spike, spike, spike.

57
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:20,747
So these are the spikes
and they, sort of speak

58
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:23,683
ride on top of
synaptic potentials

59
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:25,961
that are recorded
in the axon

60
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:28,934
actually in the axon you
mostly see only the spike

61
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,722
but if you recorded
the beginning of the axon here

62
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:34,117
you will see also
the synaptic potentials.

63
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:36,758
So you can see that,
somehow the synaptic potentials

64
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:41,928
are underlying the spike,
this little voltage fluctuations

65
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:45,223
are underlying the spike here

66
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:49,118
and from time to time,
you get this big thing.

67
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:53,502
The spike, which is
about 100mV

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,082
so a tenth of
a volt in amplitude.

69
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:04,341
So to summarize, you saw
two types of electrical activity

70
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:07,439
in the same neuron.
In the dendrites you saw

71
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,814
what we call synaptic potentials,
small ones

72
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:15,297
maybe 1mV, 10mV, small ones,
and in the axon

73
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,860
near the cell body,
you will see both of them

74
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:22,516
and occasionally these
big signals called spikes.

75
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,425
So, these are two
different signals

76
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:26,437
running in two
different regions.

77
00:04:26,572 --> 00:04:33,200
Dendrites carry synaptic potentials,
axons carry spikes

78
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:37,183
or action potentials,
as they are used to be called,

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,210
so synaptic potentials
and action potentials.

80
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,305
It’s an action,
suddenly big

81
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:45,036
but we shall call it spike,
now the action potential

82
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:47,962
will be called the spike,
and the synaptic potential

83
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:52,171
and what my
mission is in this

84
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,147
part of the course
is to develop

85
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:57,210
the mathematical models
to describe these

86
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,333
two signals mathematically

87
00:04:59,536 --> 00:05:01,614
and then simulate them
in the computer

88
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,178
so that we should be able to

89
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,730
mathematically simulate
a neuron

90
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:10,380
and mathematically simulate
the connection

91
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,592
between neuron, the synapses and
the synaptic potential

92
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,568
generated by this connection,
so that eventually after knowing

93
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,478
how to simulate a single
neuron electrical activity

94
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:24,220
we will be able to simulate
network activity

95
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,503
and that’s what we want to
achieve in this course.

96
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:30,062
You will be able to simulate,
not only a neuron

97
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,228
not only a synapse,
not only a spike

98
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,028
not only a synaptic potentials

99
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:38,372
but the activity in large
connected network of neurons.

100
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:44,755
So now let me show you
just as an illustration

101
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,530
how does the spike

102
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,249
in the living brain,
how does the spike really

103
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:55,451
not only look like,
but sound like

104
00:05:55,702 --> 00:06:01,565
so, the experimental connected
each spike into the loudspeaker

105
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:03,843
so whenever there would be
a spike of 100mV

106
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:06,424
you would hear
“tak, tak, tak, tak”

107
00:06:06,763 --> 00:06:09,113
like I did for the Parkinson
case where I did

108
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:10,988
on my own voice
“tak, tak, tak, tak”

109
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,205
experimentally like to hear

110
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:15,923
the spikes
by connecting in vivo

111
00:06:16,238 --> 00:06:18,314
in the behaving brain,
while recording from

112
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:22,065
the axon and listen to the spikes,
so they know now that

113
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:23,655
the cell now fires spikes.

114
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:27,016
So let’s hear the firing
of spikes in vivo

115
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,118
in the axon of a real

116
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:31,896
in this case,
pyramidal celll.

117
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:33,067
Let's hear it.

118
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:37,332
Okay so, this “tak, tak, tak”,
these are the spikes

119
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:42,477
these white little vertical
lines are the spikes

120
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:46,098
And you can see that this cell
fires a particular set of spikes

121
00:06:46,317 --> 00:06:48,872
and this is the footprint,
the electrical footprint

122
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:51,786
of this prototypical neuron.

123
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:54,884
As I said before, every neuron
goes “ra, tak, tak, tak”

124
00:06:54,884 --> 00:07:00,665
this is the typical activity of
the spiking activity in the axon

125
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:04,623
and actually in the cell body
of the neurons in general.

126
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,660
One interesting thing,
and I want to finalize this part

127
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:13,319
of general introduction of
the electrical activity of neurons

128
00:07:13,612 --> 00:07:16,895
by showing you that
different cell types that

129
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:18,441
are morphologically different

130
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:21,649
are sometimes
morphologically different.

131
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:27,924
So here you see a diversity of
the type of morphological cells

132
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:33,884
you see this cell which
is a bigger one

133
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:36,832
and now I don’t want to give
names to the different cells

134
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:40,585
but the different cells
are nomenclature

135
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:43,739
for different cell types in terms of
the morphology, and so forth

136
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:49,711
but this is one cell type here,
and this is another cell type there

137
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:52,169
and in this case,
it’s a morphological type

138
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:55,482
when I say type,
I say morphological type

139
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:57,166
so this is another
morphological type.

140
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,541
So, these are like different
trees in the jungle.

141
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,573
One is bigger,
one is more branched

142
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:03,087
one is less branched,
and so forth

143
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:05,046
but notice something
interesting here

144
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:09,290
that these different
morphologies

145
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,416
when you record from
these particular cells

146
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:16,888
you also see that they fire
different patterns of spikes.

147
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:20,150
So this cell tends to
fire this pattern

148
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,418
of spikes when stimulated

149
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:25,852
and this cell fires this
pattern of spikes

150
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:27,969
so you see you can
think of each cell

151
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,838
as an electrical instrument
firing spikes at the axon

152
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:35,159
but the structure
of these spikes

153
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:37,756
is sometimes
“ta, ta, ta, ta”

154
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:39,001
like in this case

155
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,864
sometimes “ta   , ta   , ta”

156
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,847
sometimes the cell is a burster

157
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:47,048
“ta, ta, ta, ta, stop,
ta, ta, ta, ta, stop"

158
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:49,379
a third burst “ta, ta, ta”,
and so forth

159
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:54,358
so they also have not only
a structural phase

160
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,457
but also the electrical phase

161
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,597
they are different in their
electrical capabilities.

162
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,374
We don’t know exactly how
many types of electrical cells

163
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,155
we have in the brain today,
but it is hundreds of types

164
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:08,065
probably of morphological types

165
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:13,061
and maybe some tens
or so electrical types

166
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:15,030
at least in the cortex,
we know more today.

167
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,783
But I wanted to tell
you the main thing

168
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:19,562
that the spike is a spike.

169
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,607
It doesn’t matter
if it’s this cell

170
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:23,232
on the left or this
cell on the right

171
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,659
they generate very
similar spikes

172
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:28,908
so the elementary beat,
the elementary unit

173
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:33,248
of a spike is something
universal for many cell types

174
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:38,624
all cell types are very similar,
this 100mV amplitude phenomenon

175
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:41,467
but in terms of structure
in the spikes

176
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:45,772
like in the bar code, sometimes
it’s structured like this

177
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:49,170
sometimes it’s structured like
that for different cell types

178
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,175
that are physiologically different

179
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:54,064
but all use the spike which is

180
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:58,185
a universal signal
for nerve cells

181
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:00,671
but in a different
pattern of firing.

182
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,658
And this is of course
very important

183
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:04,922
to generate the music

184
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:08,658
the philharmonic huge
orchestra of many cells

185
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,328
firing together now
when I’m talking to you.

186
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:14,752
So they are diverse
morphologically

187
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:17,464
they use the same
spike as a unit

188
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,969
but they build these
patterns of spikes

189
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:23,955
from individual spikes like
a bar code in the grocery store

190
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,009
but notice that in
the grocery store

191
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:28,013
you have different widths of lines

192
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,243
some of them are thicker,
some of them are thinner

193
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:35,011
and in this case the bar code
is built of same width of spikes

194
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:39,153
so the amplitude is 100mV,
and the duration

195
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:40,635
of these “tak”
and disappearing

196
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:43,668
“tak” and disappearing
is about a millisecond

197
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,398
a thousandth of a second.

198
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:45,449
So this is the electrical activity,
so I’ve introduced
a thousandth of a second.

199
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:48,601
So this is the electrical activity,
so I’ve introduced

200
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:51,276
to you now the electrical
activity of neurons

201
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,291
and I want to proceed into

202
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:59,324
trying to model these
signals mathematically.

203
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,228
So, let’s summarize.

204
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:04,229
I told you,
you should think

205
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,367
of a neuron as build
of three main regions

206
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,290
the cell body,
which is the chemical, molecular

207
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:13,162
genetic machinery,
a dendritic tree

208
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,618
that is about one millimeter long,
sometimes shorter

209
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:19,288
but extending to
one millimeter

210
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,790
but it can be long if you spread
it up until a few millimeters

211
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,585
ten or twenty millimeters,
and an axonal tree

212
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,663
that also comes
from the cell body

213
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:29,947
at least in mammals,
and then branch

214
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:30,475
branch, branch,
it could be very long
at least in mammals,
and then branch

215
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:31,836
branch, branch,
it could be very long

216
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,675
centimeter sometimes meters,
or very short locally

217
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:38,470
I told you that the dendrites
carry synaptic potentials

218
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:42,207
whereas the axons carry spikes

219
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:43,986
so these two
separate signals

220
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:46,008
appear in separate regions.

221
00:11:46,184 --> 00:11:46,934
In the axon

222
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,482
you won’t find
synaptic potential

223
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:50,898
but rather spikes

224
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:55,038
and in the dendrites typically,
although recently we’ve also found out

225
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:58,767
that dendrites could
also carry spikes

226
00:11:58,767 --> 00:11:58,806
but typically,
dendrites carry synaptic potential
that dendrites could
also carry spikes

227
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:01,835
but typically,
dendrites carry synaptic potential

228
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:04,007
and I will show you
that they are

229
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:07,927
different in
their propery

230
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:11,298
and they are modeled
different mathematically.

231
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:15,611
Also, I just ended
by showing you that

232
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:20,099
the brain is built from
many different cell types

233
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:21,332
or neuron types

234
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:24,243
both morphological types
and also electrical types

235
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,006
so they have different morphology

236
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,614
and different
physiological properties

237
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:33,616
but basically
all of them carry

238
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:36,149
both synaptic potentials,
in the dendrites

239
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:38,115
no matter if it’s a big dendrite
or a small dendrite

240
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,312
there you will find
synaptic potential

241
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,868
and if in the axon,
no matter if it’s a long axon

242
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:45,587
or a short axon,
you will find the spikes.
