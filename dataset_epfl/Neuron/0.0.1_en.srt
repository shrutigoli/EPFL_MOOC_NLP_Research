00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:09,435
Hi, this is a series of MOOCs
on simulation neuroscience.

2
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:12,654
I'm Henry Markram
from the EPFL,

3
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:15,303
the Swiss Federal Institute
for Technology

4
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:18,959
and I run a laboratory on
neuro-microcircuitry

5
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:21,109
and the blue brain project.

6
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:24,969
And these MOOCs
will essentially

7
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:30,396
help you to understand first
what simulation neuroscience is,

8
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:34,897
second how to reconstruct
and simulate neurons

9
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:36,821
and synapses,

10
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:39,188
and then how to build a circuit

11
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:41,823
and finally to be able
to simulate circuits,

12
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:45,074
and see what we understand from that.

13
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:48,529
In the first MOOC, we are going
to have an overview

14
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:51,419
and introduction to what
simulation neuroscience is.

15
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:57,354
We will also look at the experimental
data that goes behind

16
00:00:57,554 --> 00:00:59,269
simulation neuroscience.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,048
We are also going to look
at the neuroinformatics,

18
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:06,703
how you organize the data, Sean Hill
is going to give you lectures on that.

19
00:01:08,512 --> 00:01:13,574
Then the father of modeling neurons,
Idan Segev, is going to show you

20
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,774
how we model these neurons

21
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:25,318
and Felix Schürmann and Werner van Geit are
going to show you how we constrain

22
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:28,456
models with data. And then
there will be an exam in the final week.
