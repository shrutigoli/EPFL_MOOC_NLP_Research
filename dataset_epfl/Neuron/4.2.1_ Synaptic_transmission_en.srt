00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,758
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:09,543
My name is Shrikanth Ramaswamy,
I'm a senior neuroscientist in

3
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:10,782
the Blue Brain project.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,418
Today I will talk to
you about modeling

5
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:14,383
synaptic transmission
between neurons.

6
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:18,395
In the first part of the lecture
I'll talk about the synaptic brain

7
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:20,580
a brief history about the synapse,

8
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:23,262
what are the excitatory
and inhibitory synapses,

9
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:25,305
the process
of synaptic transmission,

10
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:27,324
the diversity
of neurotransmitters,

11
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:29,574
and synaptic receptors in the brain,

12
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:32,011
what's quantal release
and driving force,

13
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,565
mechanisms of
synaptic channel gating,

14
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:36,797
and how to model these mechanisms,

15
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:41,683
synaptic transmission mediated
AMPA and NMDA receptors,

16
00:00:41,893 --> 00:00:43,693
and we'll conclude by providing
the summary of all that

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,942
I spoke about in this lecture.

18
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:49,797
The human brain consist
of about 86 billion neurons

19
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:53,038
which are connected to each other
by 100 trillion synapses.

20
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,985
In the nervous system,
a synapse is the structure

21
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:58,875
that permits a neuron
or a nerve cell

22
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:01,400
to pass an electrical
or a chemical signal

23
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:02,763
to another neuron.

24
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:06,791
the goal of any synapse is to
either excite or inhibit

25
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:09,697
the neuronal membrane
that generates or suppress

26
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:12,002
an action potential in the neuron.

27
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:15,645
Understanding synaptic function
is crucial for brain function

28
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,983
because synapses are implicated
in virtually all brain diseases

29
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,744
and psychotic illnesses.

30
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:26,327
Synapses can be chemical
or electrical.

31
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:31,102
However, this lecture will focus
only on chemical synapses.

32
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:36,846
The history of the synapse began
in the early 19th century

33
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:41,083
by the Italian anatomist
Camillo Golgi who proposed

34
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:44,194
the Reticular theory which
postulated that

35
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:47,043
the nervous system consists
of a continuous network

36
00:01:47,261 --> 00:01:48,561
or "Reticulum".

37
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:52,177
According to Golgi's Reticular
theory there are fibers, dendrites

38
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,566
and neuron cells that would be
directly connected to each other

39
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,995
by cytoplasmic bridges
with neuron cell bodies

40
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,352
that were meant to provide
only nourishment support.

41
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:09,027
However, and equally
illustrious anatomist in Spain

42
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,757
by the name of Santiago Ramón y Cajal,
around the same time

43
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,117
challenge Golgi's Reticular theory

44
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,430
and postulated that
the nervous system

45
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:21,802
is not a continuous network,
but rather consists of separate

46
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:24,993
discontinuous units,
or nerve cells called neurons.

47
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,465
Cajal proposed the Neuron doctorine

48
00:02:27,663 --> 00:02:30,238
by adding the law
of dynamic polarization

49
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:33,801
which states that neuronal signals
only travel in one direction

50
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:37,392
in the neuron,
from the dendrites and cell bodies

51
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,169
to axons.

52
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:41,510
Golgi's Reticular
theory was rejected

53
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,348
by the Neuroscience community as
false and Cajal's Neuron Doctorine

54
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:48,243
failed to explain how a signal
could be transferred from 

55
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,123
one neuron to the next.

56
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:52,212
All those specialized
contact regions

57
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,506
in neurons were
soon suspected

58
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:58,462
to be responsible for this process
of exchanging information.

59
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:01,490
No mechanistic explanation
would actually be forthcoming

60
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:03,885
for a considerable amount of time.

61
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:08,162
It was only in the 1930's
that Charles Scott Sherrington

62
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:12,363
at the university of Oxford
adapted the term "synapse"

63
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:15,566
from the greek "syn",
meaning together

64
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:21,149
and "aptein", meaning to clasp,
and coined the term "synapse"

65
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:24,811
that's widely used in
neuroscience today.

66
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:28,101
So what is the process of
synaptic transmission in detail?

67
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:30,803
Let's first look at
the structure of the synapse.

68
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:35,849
Virtually every synapse in
the mammalian brain consists of

69
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,710
a presynaptic locus, which is
a part of the presynaptic cell

70
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,517
and the axon terminal of
the presynaptic cell.

71
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:48,373
And the presynaptic locus consists
of a neurotransmitter that's packed

72
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:51,573
into synaptic vesicles.

73
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,969
A synapse also consists of
the postsynaptic locus

74
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:59,721
with the post synaptic
receptors on

75
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:01,905
the dendrite of
the postsynaptic cell

76
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:05,369
and the pre and postsynaptic
loci are actually separated

77
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:10,893
by a small synaptic cleft
in the order of nano meters.

78
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:16,397
Then an action potential invites
the presynaptic terminal,

79
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:21,361
it causes the release of the calcium
by opening calcium channels

80
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:24,059
in the presynaptic terminal,

81
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:27,636
and calcium channels in
the presynaptic terminal

82
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,055
then cause
neurotransmitter release.

83
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:35,862
Neurotransmitters that's released,
flows across the synaptic cleft

84
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:38,926
and it binds
to postsynaptic receptors

85
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:42,082
which are nothing
by ion channels

86
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:45,827
and these ion channels
open and close

87
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,625
depending of the kind
of neurotransmitter

88
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:55,274
and 'cause the conductance
change that creates a current flow,

89
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:59,145
and the current flow actually

90
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:02,318
causes post synaptic
potential changes,

91
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:05,875
and the postsynaptic
cell could either get excited

92
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:10,085
or inhibited depending on
the kind of neurotransmitter.

93
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:14,933
And it's the summation of
the postsynaptic potentials

94
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:20,527
that actually decide whether
an action potential occurs or not.

95
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:22,638
So in summary:

96
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:28,198
when neurotransmitter is
released it flows across the cleft

97
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:33,311
binds to receptors,
postsynaptic receptors

98
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,177
which are nothing but ion channels
which open or close depending

99
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,977
on the kind of neurotransmitter.

100
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:42,028
This causes the conductance change
and therefore a current flow

101
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:45,748
in the postsynaptic membrane
and creates a postsynaptic

102
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,127
membrane potential change.

103
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,384
And depending on the kind
of neurotransmitter

104
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:55,372
the postsynaptic cell is
either excited or inhibited

105
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:58,961
and it's the summation
of postsynaptic potentials

106
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:03,991
that actually determines whether
an action potential occurs or not.

107
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:07,560
Let's go back to
the structure of the synapse.

108
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:10,332
As I mentioned before,
a synapse consists of

109
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:13,831
a presynaptic locus and
the postsynaptic locus

110
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:20,295
that's separated
by a synaptic cleft.

111
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:27,410
Now the presynaptic part
consist of vesicles that

112
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:31,669
are tiny sacs
containing neurotransmitters.

113
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:36,242
The postsynaptic locus actually
consists of many postsynaptic

114
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:41,671
receptors on the dendrites
of the post synaptic neuron.

115
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:45,283
When the neurotransmitter is
released it flows across the cleft

116
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:50,038
and bind to post synaptic receptors.

117
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:54,404
So the presynaptic part is basically
responsible for the release

118
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,599
of vesicles which contain
the neurotransmitter

119
00:06:57,846 --> 00:07:01,421
and also to oversee
the dynamics of the vesicle pool,

120
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:05,601
whereas the postsynaptic locus
is responsible to ensure that

121
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:09,582
the neurotransmitter
binds to receptors

122
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:13,608
and the receptors that
are opening and closing

123
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:16,828
cause a synaptic current.

124
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:19,255
The synaptic current that's

125
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:22,633
generated at
the postsynaptic receptor

126
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:27,589
due to the neurotransmitter release
can be mathematically formulated

127
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:34,621
as the synaptic current,
I(syn) is equal to

128
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:41,044
the synaptic conductance g(syn),
multiplied by the driving force

129
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:47,800
of the synapse which is represented
by the difference between

130
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,979
the membrane potential
of the post-synaptic part

131
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,863
and the universal potential or
the equilibrium potential of

132
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,070
the postsynaptic receptor.

133
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:04,721
You're already familiar with
what's the driving force

134
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:10,789
based on Idan Seget's lecture,
but I'll just refresh your memory

135
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,142
again.

136
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:19,207
So the driving force is represented
by the difference between

137
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:22,300
the membrane potential
and the universal potential

138
00:08:22,493 --> 00:08:26,443
of an ion channel, or the synaptic
receptor in this case.

139
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:30,307
And the universal potential
is the membrane potential

140
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:35,419
at which a given neurotransmitter
causes no net current flow of ions

141
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:40,129
so the neurotransmitter
receptor's ion channel.

142
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:46,520
In the brain there are
broadly two kinds of synapses

143
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:50,738
Excitatory synapses
and Inhibitory synapses.

144
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,170
Excitatory synapses cause
the release of glutamate 

145
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:58,276
as the primary neurotransmitter.

146
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:02,188
Glutamate released then causes
the opening of sodium channels

147
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:06,859
in an excitatory synapse,
whereas in an inhibitory synapse

148
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,667
the primary neurotransmitter
released is GABA

149
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,173
and GABA released causes
the opening of chloride channels

150
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:16,815
in the postsynaptic locus.

151
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:21,983
Excitatory or glutamatergic synapses
are also called asymmetric

152
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:25,414
or Type 1 synapses,
because if you looked at

153
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:30,226
the structure of an excitatory
synapse under an electron microscope

154
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:35,453
you would see an asymmetry
between the presynaptic locus

155
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,334
and the postsynaptic locus.

156
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:42,376
Excitatory synapses consist
of AMPA synapses

157
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:45,169
that mediate fast
synaptic transmission

158
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:49,523
or NMDA synapses, that mediate
slow synaptic transmission.

159
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:56,790
The typical universal potential of
an excitatory synapse is around 0mV

160
00:09:57,457 --> 00:10:01,682
whereas inhibitory,
or GABAergic synapses

161
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:05,384
are also know as symmetric,
or type B synapses.

162
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:06,144
Why?

163
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:10,217
Because again, if you looked
at the structure of

164
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,326
an inhibitory synapse under
an electron microscope

165
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,819
you would see that the presynaptic
and the postsynaptic loci

166
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:21,164
are actually symmetric.

167
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:25,277
Our inhibitory synapses
consist of GABA A synapses

168
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:28,455
that mediate fast
GABAergic transmission

169
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:34,160
GABA A synapses have a typical
universal potential of about -80mV

170
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:39,845
and GABA B synapses, that mediate
slow GABAergic transmission,

171
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:45,410
GABA B synapses have a universal
potential of around -100mV.

172
00:10:45,623 --> 00:10:49,173
The universal potential of
the GABA A synapse is close

173
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:55,411
to the universal potential
of chloride ions

174
00:10:55,927 --> 00:11:04,215
whereas the universal potential
of GABA B synapse is close to

175
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:08,954
the universal potential
of potassium channels or ions.

176
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,732
There's a huge diversity of
neuro transmitters in the brain

177
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,423
as you've just learned before,
excitatory synapses cause

178
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:20,424
the release of glutamate that
could be picked up by AMPA

179
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:25,432
or MNDA, or metabotropic
glutamatergic receptors.

180
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:29,271
These receptors could further
be ionotropic or metabotropic

181
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:31,309
I'll talk to you
about ionotropic

182
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:34,463
and metabotropic
receptors soon after

183
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:38,295
and AMPA receptors mediate
very fast synaptic transmission

184
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:41,100
and NMDA receptors
are voltage dependent

185
00:11:41,336 --> 00:11:43,499
mediate slow synaptic transmission.

186
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:46,703
Metabotropic glutamatergic
receptors as well mediate

187
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:49,801
slow synaptic transmission
and are coupled to intercellular

188
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:53,789
proteins and second messengers,
I'll talk to you again

189
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:57,068
about this a little later.

190
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:00,371
Inhibitory synapses,
as you've just learned

191
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:03,394
release GABA as
the chief neurotransmitter

192
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:08,491
and GABA could be sensed by either
GABA A receptors or GABA B receptors

193
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:12,022
GABA A receptors
mediate fast inhibition

194
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:15,506
GABA B receptors
mediate slow inhibition.

195
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:19,981
In addition to glutamate and GABA

196
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,978
there's also a zoo of
neuromodulators in the brain

197
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:29,889
such as acetylcholine, which is
responsible for wakefulness

198
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:32,195
and the tension,
noradrenaline

199
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:35,306
which is
responsible for arousal

200
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,017
serotonin and dopamine,
which are responsible for

201
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:42,058
motivation, reward,
and happiness

202
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,557
and histamine that's responsible

203
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:49,314
for hunger, thirst,
as well as wakefulness.

204
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:53,293
So these neuromodulators
are also sensed by a diversity

205
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:59,633
of receptors which are either
ionotropic or motabotropic.

206
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,775
Just like there's a diversity of
neurotransmitters in the brain

207
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:06,911
there's also a diversity of
synaptic receptors in the brain

208
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:10,626
but synaptic receptors
could be considered

209
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:13,309
under two broad classes:

210
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:17,115
ionotropic receptors
and metabotropic receptors.

211
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,050
So, how are these receptors
different from each other

212
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,510
and how do they function?

213
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:23,743
Let's look at
the ionotropic receptors.

214
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:26,590
When the neurotransmitter
flows across the cleft

215
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:33,005
it binds to receptors on
the postsynaptic membrane.

216
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:37,080
and these synaptic receptors
are nothing but ion channels

217
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:41,724
which actually open
to let certain ions in,

218
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:44,806
depending on the kind of
neurotransmitter that's released.

219
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,872
If the neurotransmitter released
was glutamate, that causes

220
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:56,927
the flow of sodium ions
across the membrane

221
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:59,606
from outside of the cell
to the inside of the cell.

222
00:13:59,813 --> 00:14:03,863
If the neurotransmitter
released released is GABA

223
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:08,088
that causes the flow
of chloride ions

224
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:12,229
from outside the cell
to inside the cell.

225
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:16,002
And when these ions flow
from outside to inside

226
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:21,541
they cause a membrane potential
change in the postsynaptic receptor,

227
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:24,334
and depending on what kind
of neuron transmitter released

228
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:27,263
if it's glutamate,
it causes the depolarization

229
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:30,328
of the postsynaptic membrane,
if it's GABA it causes

230
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,510
the hyper polarization
of the postsynaptic membrane.

231
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:36,902
The second class
of synaptic receptors

232
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:38,691
are metabotropic receptors.

233
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,350
Metabotropic receptors
have a more complicated

234
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,366
function than ionotropic receptors.

235
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,821
So how do metabotropic
receptors work?

236
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:49,002
When the neurotransmitter
flows across the cleft

237
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:55,946
it binds to postsynaptic
metabotropic receptors.

238
00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:01,501
and the binding of neurotransmitter
activates G proteins, which are

239
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:05,603
intercellular proteins inside
the postsynaptic neuron.

240
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,933
These intercellular proteins

241
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:10,543
G proteins,
consist of many sub-units

242
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:14,104
alpha, beta, or gama,
for example.

243
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:19,801
When G protein is activated
upon a neurotransmitter binding

244
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:23,888
it causes further activation
of intercellular messengers

245
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:27,114
which are like transport
mechanisms inside the cell

246
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:32,730
and these intercellular messengers
then modulate ion channels

247
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:36,072
and when ion channels
are modulated they open

248
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:41,088
and let ions that are outside
of the cell flow through them

249
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:44,298
to inside of the cell.

250
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:52,409
If the neurotransmitter released
is glutamate then that causes

251
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,863
a net depolarization of
the postsynaptic membrane.

252
00:15:57,106 --> 00:16:01,906
Whereas if the neurotransmitter
released is GABA

253
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:08,455
that causes a net hyper polarization
of the postsynaptic membrane.

254
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,691
Let's do a quick recap about
all that I've just spoke about.

255
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:19,115
Now you know that a synapse
consists of a presynaptic locus

256
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:23,690
and a postsynaptic locus
that are separated by a synaptic cleft

257
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,035
the presynaptic part consists of
vesicles that are packed with

258
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:30,810
neurotransmitters,
and the post synaptic part

259
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:36,329
consists of receptors that send
the flow of neurotransmitter across

260
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,928
the cleft and the neurotransmitters
that are released binds to

261
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:45,214
postsynaptic receptors to either
hyper polarize or depolarize

262
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:46,842
the post synaptic membrane.

263
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:50,067
The presynaptic part
consists of vesicle release

264
00:16:50,263 --> 00:16:52,588
maintaining the dynamics
of the vesicle pool

265
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:55,916
and the postsynaptic part ensures
that the transmitter binds to

266
00:16:56,131 --> 00:17:00,506
the receptors and that the opening
and closing of receptors result in

267
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:03,481
the synaptic current.

268
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:09,916
So the universal potential,
or the equilibrium potential

269
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:16,159
of a synapse, that Idan Segev
already spoke to you about earlier,

270
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,799
determines that
the driving force of a synapse

271
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:24,878
and the driving force along with
the synaptic conductance

272
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:30,057
determines the net current
that's generated in the synapse.

273
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,767
Let's focus a bit more
on the mechanism

274
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,912
of neurotransmitter released and
the driving force at the synapse

275
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:44,399
When neurotransmitters
are released into the synapse

276
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:48,877
they are released in
packaged vesicles called Quanta.

277
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:52,741
So these vesicles
called Quanta are sacs

278
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:55,959
that are packed with
neurotransmitter

279
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:01,825
a single quantum of vesicle release
generates what is known

280
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,153
as a miniature end plate potential.

281
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:10,227
The miniature end
plate potential 

282
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:13,194
is the smallest amount
of stimulation that

283
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:16,779
one neuron can send
to another neuron.

284
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:22,923
Each synapse further has a number
of independent release sites

285
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:25,244
denoted by N

286
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:31,527
and each release site N
releases a single vesicle

287
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:35,008
with a certain probability
of a release, P(rel).

288
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:41,157
So this release probability P(rel)
or U(t) as it will be the explained

289
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:44,416
to you in the subsequent
part of the lecture

290
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:52,603
when I will talk about implementing
a widely used synapse model.

291
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:58,942
So the number of released vesicles
obeys a binomial distribution

292
00:18:59,156 --> 00:19:03,018
and the release probability
the overall release probability

293
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,805
at a synapse is actually a function
of the number of released vesicles

294
00:19:08,998 --> 00:19:11,698
and the number of released
vesicles further depend on

295
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:15,187
the number of release sites
and the probability of

296
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,299
release of a single vesicle.

297
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:21,016


298
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:26,850
So the mean of
the number of release sites

299
00:19:27,106 --> 00:19:31,918
is actually a function of the number
of independent release sites

300
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:36,033
and the probability of release
of a single vesicle.

301
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:42,009
So when neurotransmitter
is released it causes a change

302
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,360
in the synaptic conductance

303
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:51,596
and that then causes
a synaptic current.

304
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:56,217
The synaptic current could either
hyperpolarize or depolarize

305
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:59,371
the postsynaptic membrane,
depending on the synaptic

306
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:04,545
conductance and the driving force,
which is nothing but the difference

307
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,563
of the membrane potential
of the postsynaptic membrane

308
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:14,340
and the reversal potential
of the synapse.

309
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:19,162
Furthermore,
the synaptic conductance

310
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:24,246
is the function of the peak synaptic
conductance a the synapse

311
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:29,086
which is also governed by
the number of release sites

312
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:33,508
and the release probability.

313
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:36,223
Another way to modify
the synaptic channel gating is

314
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:39,492
by means of double
exponential synapse

315
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,911
which is to model slow
synaptic transmission

316
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:47,161
such as synaptic transmission
mediated by MNDA receptors.

317
00:20:47,357 --> 00:20:49,870
So in the case where
double exponential synapse

318
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:54,427
the synaptic response is
characterized by an opening

319
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:59,492
or a rising phase that indicates
the opening of the receptor

320
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:04,692
and a closing, or a decay phase,
that indicates

321
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:09,839
And another way to model
the synaptic channel gating is by

322
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:12,569
means of a double
exponential synapse.

323
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,384
This is particularly useful to
model slow synaptic transmission

324
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,030
such as synaptic transmission
mediated by an MNDA receptor.

325
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:26,142
The kinetics of a double exponential
synapse is characterized by

326
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:30,405
a rising phase that indicates
the opening of a receptor

327
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,499
and a decay phase,
that indicates the closing

328
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:34,764
of a receptor.

329
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:38,798
So the double exponential synapse
is a sum of two exponential

330
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:43,739
the rising phase exponential
and the decay phase exponential

331
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:50,014
the rising phase is overseen
by a rise time constant, τ(d)

332
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:56,022
and the decay phase is governed
by the decay time constant, or τ(d)

333
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:59,397
and k is the normalization
coefficient that is used

334
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:04,522
to determine the kinetics of
the double exponential synapse.

335
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:08,869
There are two main types of
excitatory synaptic receptors

336
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,357
in the brain, AMPA
and NMDA receptors.

337
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,541
AMPA receptors,
as I've mentioned before

338
00:22:16,772 --> 00:22:21,535
mediate fast synaptic transmission
and the associated ion channels

339
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:25,263
with AMPA receptors are more
permeable to sodium

340
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:28,963
and potassium ions,
rather than calcium ions.

341
00:22:29,246 --> 00:22:35,183
On the other hand, NMDA receptors
mediate slower synaptic transmission

342
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:40,047
and are structurally more complex
than AMPA receptors

343
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:44,823
because NMDA receptors contain
separate binding sites

344
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:51,104
for a glutamate, or magnesium,
or zinc, for example

345
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:55,092
and NMDA gated ion channels
are more permeable

346
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,120
to calcium than sodium ions.

347
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,283
Let's try and understand a bit
more on how NMDA receptors work.

348
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:07,876
So when an action potential invites
the presynaptic terminal

349
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:10,464
it causes the release of glutamate.

350
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:13,449
The release of glutamate
then diffuses across

351
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:18,417
the synaptic cleft and is sensed
by the NMDA receptors.

352
00:23:19,318 --> 00:23:22,156
NMDA receptors at
resting membrane potential

353
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:27,141
which is typically around -70mV
when the neuron is at rest

354
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:32,029
are blocked by magnesium ions
that prevent the flow of sodium

355
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:36,187
or calcium ions from
outside cell to inside cell.

356
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:41,389
These magnesium ions are released
when the membrane potential

357
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:46,714
of the neuron is about -30mV

358
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:50,121
and when the magnesium
block is released

359
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,273
at more depolarizing potentials,
then that causes the entry

360
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:59,696
of sodium and calcium from
outside of the cell

361
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:03,143
to inside of the cell
through the NMDA receptor.

362
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:07,948
So the NMDA receptor only conducts
when the membrane potential

363
00:24:08,184 --> 00:24:12,822
is greater than -30mV, and in
the presence of glutamate.

364
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:18,404
NMDA receptors have important
physiological functions, for example

365
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:24,352
they act as molecular coincidence
detectors that sense the entry

366
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,920
of sodium and calcium influx from

367
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:29,405
outside of the cell
to inside of the cell

368
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:32,616
and this has many
intercellular effects

369
00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:38,432
which for example, could cause
mechanisms of long term potentiation

370
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:41,722
or long term depression,
which are fundamental

371
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:44,261
for learning N memory.

372
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:50,119
So, the NMDA receptor
is basically blocked by

373
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:55,708
magnesium at membrane potentials
close to the resting potential

374
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,044
that's about -70mV

375
00:24:58,234 --> 00:25:04,921
and the magnesium block prevents
the influx of sodium or calcium ions

376
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,995
to the NMDA receptor.

377
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:11,390
However, at membrane potentials
of around -30mV

378
00:25:11,584 --> 00:25:15,096
which is more depolarized
than the resting brain potential

379
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:19,929
the magnesium block is released,
and therefore the NMDA receptor

380
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:26,757
is able to conduct sodium
or calcium ions through it.

381
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:32,357
The total synaptic conductance at
an NMDA receptor is a function

382
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,535
of the concentration of magnesium

383
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:39,625
and the resting membrane
potential of the neuron.

384
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:42,062
Some experiments were

385
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:45,487
done by Craig Jahr
and Chuck Stevens in 1990

386
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:52,016
where Jahr and Stevens recorded
from cultured hippocampal neurons

387
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:57,842
actually showed that the synaptic
conductance at the NMDA receptor

388
00:25:58,031 --> 00:26:00,006
is a function of
the magnesium concentration

389
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,046
and the resting membrane potential.

390
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:06,824
So what Jahr and Stevens did was,
they held their postsynaptic neuron

391
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:13,110
at different membrane potentials
from -80mV to +60mV

392
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:18,814
and at each of these potentials
they recorded the NMDA conductance

393
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:23,490
and found that at more
hyperpolarized potentials

394
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:28,391
closer to rest, for example,
are -80mV, -70mV

395
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,223
the NMDA conductance
was quite negligible

396
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:36,794
and the NMDA conductance marginally
began to increase in magnitude

397
00:26:36,982 --> 00:26:41,632
when the magnesium block
was relieved around -13mV.

398
00:26:42,664 --> 00:26:46,414
So Jahr and Stevens then came up
with a mathematical formulation

399
00:26:46,622 --> 00:26:49,609
for the NMDA conductance,
which is a function of

400
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:53,576
magnesium concentration
and the resting membrane potential

401
00:26:53,816 --> 00:27:00,016
which can actually be shown
through a series of sigmoid profiles

402
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:02,438
depending on
the magnesium concentration

403
00:27:02,644 --> 00:27:04,881
and the holding voltage.

404
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:06,606
So the steep of the sigmoid is

405
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:08,897
a function of a magnesium
concentration

406
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,855
and the holding
potential of the neuron.

407
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:18,175
Therefore the total NMDA conductance
which is a function of the voltage

408
00:27:18,408 --> 00:27:20,695
and magnesium concentration

409
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,095
times the release probability,
the number of release sites

410
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:28,283
and the release probability

411
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:34,246
times the driving force,
determines the total NMDA current

412
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:36,466
at a synapse.

413
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:40,481
So excitatory postsynaptic currents
in the brain are a combination

414
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:43,967
of AMPA and NMDA
receptor functions.

415
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:47,743
The AMPA response of
an excitatory postsynaptic current

416
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:51,809
is fast and short, whereas
the NMDA response of

417
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,773
an excitatory postsynaptic
current is slow and long.

418
00:27:57,579 --> 00:27:59,167
The AMPA part could respond

419
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:02,779
to the early phase of
the postsynaptic current

420
00:28:03,094 --> 00:28:06,257
and the NMDA could
respond to the late phase

421
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:08,895
of the postsynaptic current.

422
00:28:09,682 --> 00:28:12,682


423
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,997
The contribution of the AMPA
and the NMDA receptor functions

424
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,118
to the postsynaptic current,
can actually be studied

425
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:22,341
pharmacologically by blocking
the NMDA component 

426
00:28:22,564 --> 00:28:25,176
or even the AMPA component,
for example

427
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:28,876
this is an experiment where,
at a more depolarized

428
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:31,798
membrane potential of about -40mV

429
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:35,470
where the NMDA receptors
are supposed to be active,

430
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:38,590
when NMDA receptors were blocked

431
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:42,310
the late component of
the synaptic current was also almost

432
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,032
blocked;

433
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:52,094
whereas at -80mV for example, which
is around resting membrane potential,

434
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:57,735
it was seen that the NMDA component,
which wasn't functional,

435
00:28:57,943 --> 00:29:03,255
had no contribution what so ever to
the excitatory postsynaptic current.

436
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:07,310
So this can be even better
understood by means

437
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:08,838
of this current voltage

438
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,020
relationship after
synaptic current

439
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:17,052
where the black line actually shows
the AMPA component

440
00:29:17,246 --> 00:29:20,621
and as you see here,
the AMPA component

441
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:26,611
is already active around
resting membrane potential,

442
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:30,277
whereas the NMDA component
is not as active around

443
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:33,306
the resting membrane potential,
and for the NMDA component

444
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:37,120
to be active, the membrane
potential should actually be around

445
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,771
-30mV.

446
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:42,116
So in this part of the lecture
you've learned about

447
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:44,760
the structure of the synapse,

448
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:48,519
what are expiatory
and inhibitory synapses,

449
00:29:48,723 --> 00:29:53,673
the diversity of synaptic
transmitters and receptors

450
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:55,033
in the brain,

451
00:29:55,236 --> 00:29:58,236
what are ionotropic and
metabotropic receptors,

452
00:29:58,536 --> 00:30:01,748
how does one model synaptic
channel gating either as

453
00:30:01,941 --> 00:30:05,554
a single exponential,
or a double exponential,

454
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:09,424
what are AMPA and NMDA receptors,
how do they function,

455
00:30:09,632 --> 00:30:12,482
and that NMDA receptors
are more complex in their

456
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:16,218
function compared to AMPA receptors,
because they are blocked by

457
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:19,208
magnesium ions at resting
membrane potential

458
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:23,344
and this block is only relieved
at more depolarized potentials

459
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:27,195
for -30mV, which then causes
the NMDA receptors

460
00:30:27,412 --> 00:30:31,487
to conduct sodium
calcium ions through them.
