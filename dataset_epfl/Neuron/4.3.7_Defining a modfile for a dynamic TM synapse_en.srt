00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:07,307
Hi and welcome to
our second tutorial

2
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:09,444
on modeling synapse dynamics.

3
00:00:09,663 --> 00:00:13,075
We'll continue where we left off
modeling the glutamate receptor

4
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:16,483
in the previous tutorial,
and interactively augmented

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,140
with the model of short term
depression and facilitation.

6
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:24,523
In the previous lecture,
my colleague (INAUDIBLE)

7
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:29,620
described for you a model of
short term synaptic dynamics.

8
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:35,885
Facilitation and depression.

9
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:39,683
The commonly used model for
facilitation and depression

10
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:42,869
is the Tsodyks and Markram model.

11
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,803
As it was described previously,
the model accounts for

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,035
the dynamics of
a reserve vesicle pool.

13
00:00:53,875 --> 00:01:01,037
In particular, the "Docked" vesicles
form the readily releasable pool.

14
00:01:01,498 --> 00:01:03,423
In the Tsodyks Markram model

15
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:07,203
R refers to
the fraction of available

16
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:12,004
vesicles in the readily
releasable pool.

17
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:22,491
And U(se) refers to
the running probability of release.

18
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:31,489
These two variables, R and U(se),
make up the state variables

19
00:01:32,502 --> 00:01:35,502
of the Tsodyks Markram model.

20
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:42,519
The R variable accounts
for synaptic depression

21
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:45,989
whereas the facilitation aspect
of the model is accounted for

22
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:48,001
in the second differential equation

23
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:51,748
in the dynamic of
the release probability.

24
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:56,191
Now, let's implement the various
components of this mathematical

25
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:58,903
formulation of
the Tsodyks Markram model

26
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,072
into a NEURON and model file.

27
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:04,525
The model we will implement
today is based on

28
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:09,101
the Tsodyks Markram model
for short term facilitation

29
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:14,175
and depression, as it is described
in the Fuhrmann 2001 publication

30
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:16,186
here.

31
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:19,361
In this tutorial, we're going
to learn how to implement

32
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,982
the mathematical formulations of
the model into NMODL syntax

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,392
and therefore gain a deeper

34
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,365
appreciation of
the different components

35
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,327
of the NMODL language,
and also a deeper understanding

36
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,157
of this widely used formulation
of synapse dynamics.

37
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:40,561
To begin, let's start where we left
off with the MOD file

38
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:43,781
for the simple AMPA
and NMDA receptor.

39
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:51,201
If we go to our Jupyter home space,
and go into the mechanisms directory

40
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:58,490
let's create a copy of the previous
MOD file which we will then

41
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:00,139
subsequently modify.

42
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:09,233
So, we duplicate, then we rename,
let's call it the Tsodyks Markram

43
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:11,818
AMPA and NMDA synapse.

44
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,523
Now, we can edit the file.

45
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:19,039
First let's update the comments.

46
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:33,238
Now that we've updated
the comments in the preambule 

47
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:36,737
let's start adding the required
components to implement

48
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:38,487
this addition to the model.

49
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:42,246
First, we should
rename the point process.

50
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:45,651
This is the unique name given
to the model which we'll then

51
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:48,756
employ in the Jupyter
Python Interpreter to

52
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:51,656
create an instance of the model.

53
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:59,388
Here we will give it the name
"TsodyksMarkram_AMPA_NMDA".

54
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:03,403
Now let's add the additional
required parameters.

55
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:11,443
The Tsodyks Markram
model has three parameters.

56
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,476
A time constant for
recovery from depression

57
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:22,352
a time constant for relaxation
from facilitation

58
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:30,949
and a baseline release probability
in the absence of facilitation.

59
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:37,391
Now, let's add these parameters
into our NMODL file.

60
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:41,540
We can add these parameters of
the Tsodyks Markram model

61
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,257
as follows.

62
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:48,184
First, the time constant of
recovery from depression:

63
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:51,868
we'll give it an intermediate
value of 200 and the unit

64
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:55,056
of that value is milliseconds.

65
00:04:55,276 --> 00:05:04,789
Here a comment, time constant
of recovery from depression.

66
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:08,406
Next, the second parameter
is the time constant

67
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:12,052
of relaxation from facilitation.

68
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:17,602
We'll also give that a time constant
for 200ms, these are default values

69
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
and they can be overridden
then in the Python Interpreter.

70
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:25,086
And the final
parameter is "U1".

71
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:29,357
We will give it an intermediate
value of 0.5

72
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:33,667
it's a dimensional's quantity
and it is the baseline

73
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:37,328
release probability.

74
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,047
Next we should add
the additional state variables

75
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:43,296
for the Tsodyks Markram model.

76
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,928
Let's add them here.

77
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:52,382
The state variables of
the Tsodyks Markram model

78
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:57,939
are the variables of the first order

79
00:05:58,135 --> 00:06:00,123
time derivative on
the left hand side

80
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,982
that is R, the fraction of available

81
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:06,183
vesicles in the readily
releasable pool

82
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:12,033
and U(se), the running value
of the release probability.

83
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:19,266
We can add the state variables
U(se) and R as follows.

84
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,010
Simply declare them.

85
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,827
Give them a comment as to
their purpose and you're done.

86
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:32,183
In the assigned block of the synapse
no additional modification

87
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,397
are required.

88
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,764
Since we've added
two new state variables

89
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:39,824
we need to also declare
their initial conditions.

90
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:45,376
Here we give R the value of
a completely recovered

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,288
readily releasable pool,
that is that

92
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:51,669
the fraction of available
vesicles is equal to one

93
00:06:51,855 --> 00:07:00,117
and the release probability we give
it its fully relaxed value of zero.

94
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:04,460
For the break point block
no additional modifications

95
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:10,257
are required except to model
the sub-block, defining the ODEs.

96
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:13,246
The ODEs are defined in this block.

97
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,471
Let's recap
the mathematical expression

98
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,522
for the Tsodyks Markram model.

99
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:23,874
This system of two ODEs has both
a time continuous component

100
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:29,317
as shown here,
and as shown here,

101
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:32,865
and event triggered components.

102
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,990
As shown here,
and here.

103
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:42,178
These two components will
be treated separately

104
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:44,458
in the NMODL file.

105
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:50,034
First let's consider the time
continuous components.

106
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:54,710
An ODE, a first order linear ODE for

107
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:58,609
the fraction of
the available vesicles

108
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,954
and likewise for the running
value of the release probability.

109
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,695
In the ODE's block we define only

110
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:09,893
the dynamics of the time
continuous component.

111
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:13,508
That is, R prime,
the time derivative of R

112
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:19,174
is equal to 1-R,
divided by tau_recovery

113
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:25,903
this results in an exponential
relaxation of R towards 1

114
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:30,643
that is an exponential recovery with
time constant of tau_recovery.

115
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:34,947
And secondly,
the continuous dynamics

116
00:08:35,162 --> 00:08:37,437
of the running
release probability

117
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:39,244
U(se).

118
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:41,599
That is the time
derivative of the U(se)

119
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:47,147
is equal to -U(se) over
tau_facilitation.

120
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:54,492
This shows that U(se) exponentially
relaxes to a value of zero.

121
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:57,706
With a time constant of "tau_facil".

122
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:02,302
Finally we must augment
the "NET_RECEIVE" block

123
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:04,592
this is the piece of code that is

124
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,770
executed for each
pre-synaptic spike event.

125
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:12,965
First we must define a local
variable for the derived quantity A

126
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:16,156
which is the scalar
of the synaptic response as

127
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,598
a function of the least probability
and fraction of available vesicles.

128
00:09:23,282 --> 00:09:27,707
Now, let's define the pre-synaptic
spike triggered updates

129
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:32,097
of the release probability and
fraction of available vesicles.

130
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:36,753
Now, let's consider the event
triggered portions of this system

131
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:38,645
of ODEs.

132
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:47,097
This term in the differential
equation for the fraction

133
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:53,350
of readily releasable vesicles
is an event triggered component

134
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:57,878
as it can be seen by the delta
function with respect to time

135
00:09:58,103 --> 00:10:00,041
of the pre-synaptic spike.

136
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:06,495
The meaning of this is that
at the arrival time of

137
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:09,671
the pre-synaptic spike

138
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:14,618
the fraction of available
vesicles is decreased

139
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:19,303
by an amount proportional to
the current fraction of

140
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:23,139
available vesicles and their
probability that they release.

141
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:27,014
The decrease is indicated
by the minus sign.

142
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:31,976
Likewise, the differential equation
for the release probability

143
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:36,073
also contains a spike
triggered term.

144
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:41,329
The meaning of this term
is that following a spike

145
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:45,483
the value of the release
probability takes on U1

146
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:50,870
if the running value of
the release probability is zero.

147
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:54,660
However, this model
accounts for facilitation in that

148
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:57,463
should the current running
value of the release probability

149
00:10:57,653 --> 00:11:03,078
be greater than zero, then
the value of the release probability

150
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:10,261
will be incremented beyond
the baseline value of U1.

151
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:16,896
This term ensures that the value
of the release probability

152
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:19,522
never exceeds one.

153
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:23,526
The first update to compute is
the update of the running value

154
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,768
of the release probability,
U(se).

155
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:30,576
That is updated according
to the expression given

156
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:36,030
U goes to U(se) plus
the additional delta term

157
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:42,112
in the ODE, U1 times one,
minus U(se).

158
00:11:42,913 --> 00:11:45,825
The next update to compute
is the update of the fraction of

159
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:47,659
available vesicles.

160
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:55,412
Here, R goes to R minus U(se)
times R.

161
00:11:55,603 --> 00:12:00,278
The fraction of available vesicles R
is reduced by an amount

162
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:03,454
proportional to the currently
available vesicles

163
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,595
and the fraction of those
vesicles that are released.

164
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,896
The final step is
to compute the factor A

165
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:14,243
which modulates the synaptic weight.

166
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:24,808
We insert this term here,
here, here, and here

167
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,422
because it modulates, as we said,
the synaptic weight

168
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,177
so it should modulate each
of these cases where 

169
00:12:31,404 --> 00:12:32,754
weight appears.

170
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,958
And now, what value does A take on?

171
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:41,843
This system of differential
equations describes the evolution of

172
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:46,318
the fraction of available vesicles

173
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:53,746
and the running release probability
as a function of time.

174
00:12:54,463 --> 00:13:02,113
For a series of pre-synaptic spikes
arriving at times as indicated here.

175
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:11,334
These traces give you the evolution
of the respected state variables.

176
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:19,884
To compute the modulation of
the synaptic conductance

177
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:26,543
as a function of these
running R and U values

178
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:32,521
we multiply the overall synaptic
conductance by a factor A,

179
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:37,634
which is the fraction of vesicles
available in the readily

180
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:39,731
releasable pool

181
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:45,123
times the running value
of the release probability.

182
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:54,144
Interestingly, this product
is also the amount

183
00:13:54,515 --> 00:14:01,552
by which R is deprecated for
each incoming pre-synaptic spike.

184
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:08,260
Also note, that as T
is time dependent and U(se)

185
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:10,151
is time dependent

186
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:15,340
the value of A is
also time dependent

187
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:20,961
and takes on specific values

188
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:28,691
at each point in time when
a pre-synaptic spike occurs

189
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:36,580
according to the running value of R
and U(se) at the time of the spike.

190
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:40,562
Now we add this A term
into the "NET_RECEIVE" block.

191
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:43,227
U(se) times R.

192
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:47,354
Now take note, one tricky aspect
of the Tsodyks Markram is where

193
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,104
"A" should be computed.

194
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:55,793
Depending on if you were
to compute "A" here, or here, or here

195
00:14:56,634 --> 00:15:00,222
the value, or magnitude of
the synaptic transmission event

196
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:01,654
can be different.

197
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:04,798
It turns out that the correct
interpretation is to compute

198
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:06,558
"A" here

199
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,571
after the U(se) has been updated
with facilitatory mechanisms

200
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:14,451
but before the fraction of
readily releasable vesicles

201
00:15:14,636 --> 00:15:17,636
has been depleted by
the release event.

202
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:22,983
Intuitively this makes sense
in so far as the fraction

203
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:27,265
of readily releasable vesicles that
is depleted is actually equal to A.

204
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:32,313
That is the readily releasable pool
is depleted by exactly those

205
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:36,385
vesicles which mediate
the synaptic response.

206
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:41,356
Now, we're almost done,
the only remaining thing to do

207
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:48,104
is to go back up to the top
to the NEURON block

208
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:52,796
and declare the additional
parameters such that they can

209
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,123
be configured by the user,
that is tau_recovery

210
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,756
tau_facilitation, and U1.

211
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,260
With that we've completed
our new MOD file of the AMPA

212
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,840
and NMDA glutamate receptor,
incorporating

213
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,062
Tsodyks Markram
short term dynamics.

214
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:14,243
Let's save the file.
