1
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:15,455
Simulation neuroscience
is an emerging approach

2
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:19,384
to integrate the knowledge dispersed
throughout the field of neuroscience

3
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:23,526
The aim is to build a unified
empirical picture of the brain

4
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,968
to study the biological mechanisms
of brain function, behavior and disease.

5
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:33,277
This is achieved by integrating
diverse datasources

6
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:36,477
across the various scales of
experimental neuroscience

7
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:40,560
from binocular to clinical
into computer simulations.

8
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:44,263
In a series of three courses
you will learn to use

9
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:48,606
the state of the art modeling tools
of the HBP brain simulation platform

10
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:51,806
to simulate neurons,
build neural networks

11
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:55,006
and perform your own
simulation experiments.

12
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:58,206
This is a unique
massive open online course

13
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:02,927
taught by multidisciplinary team
of world-renowned scientists.

14
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:06,947
In this first course you will
gain the knowledge and skills

15
00:01:07,147 --> 00:01:11,602
needed to create simulations of
biological neurons and synapses.

16
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:14,861
Professor Henry Markram
will open the course

17
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:18,363
and present the basic principles
of simulation neuroscience

18
00:01:18,563 --> 00:01:21,563
and the neuroscience knowledge
it aims to integrate.

19
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:27,050
Then with professor Sean Hill,
Samuel Kerrienp and Lida Kanari,

20
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,901
you'll learn about the structure
of neuroscience data,

21
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:33,305
its' analysis and classification,
and how to integrate it

22
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:35,620
into the neuroinformatic's platform.

23
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:40,187
Professor Idan Segev will introduce
you to the fascinating world

24
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:43,387
of biological neurons
and the mathematical methods

25
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:45,439
to describe their biophysics.

26
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:49,188
Werner van Geit will show you
how to apply these methods

27
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,919
to create your own neuron models
using the neurone simulator.

28
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:56,732
From Dr. Srikanth Ramaswamy
and Dr. Eilif Muller,

29
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:59,682
you will learn the biology
of synaptic transmission

30
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:00,973
in the near cortex,

31
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:04,173
and at the simulator using
the neuron simulator.

32
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:08,982
In the fifth course, professor Schurmann
and Werner Van Geit

33
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,297
will teach you to constrain
neuron models

34
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:15,420
with experimental data using
genetic optimization techniques.

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,620
We invite you to join us
and share our passion 

36
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,514
to reconstruct, simulate and
understand the brain.
