1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,311
I want to start with the motivation.

2
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:10,265
So here is the motivation, I could
give you many, many examples

3
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:14,573
because as you all know,
all that we do basically

4
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:17,119
like myself speaking to you now

5
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:20,067
feeling a certain feeling,
moving my hand

6
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:24,861
recognizing a face,
but also becoming sick,

7
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:31,787
neurological sickness, is reflected
by an electrical activity

8
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:33,922
in a particular region in the brain.

9
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:36,416
And I want to show you
a very dramatic example 

10
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:38,640
of a Parkinsons patient.

11
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:43,945
So what you see here on the screen,
is the scheme of a patient that is normal.

12
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:50,798
And the red electrode here is just
showing you a recording from this site.

13
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:54,813
So this is a site, it's called
Basal Ganglia, it's deep into the brain.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,982
And in this region, in a normal
Non-Parkinsonian patient,

15
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:04,420
a monkey or a human patient,

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,468
you will see this electrical
activity on the right top part

17
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,442
which we call normal activity.

18
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:14,817
So you see now electrical activity
of three nerve cells,

19
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:19,544
individual nerve cells, we call that
in vivo, in the living behaving brain.

20
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:24,850
And you can see a phenomena
that is very, very special

21
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,654
actually to nerve cells.

22
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,470
So if I just highlight
what you see

23
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:37,483
there is this voltage on the Y-axis,
and in the X-axis you will see time.

24
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:41,540
So what I'm now doing, I'm now
syncing, so to speak

25
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,896
the electrical activities,
so each blip here is a spike.

26
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:48,357
We shall study more later
how to model the spikes. 

27
00:01:48,557 --> 00:01:52,848
So each one is a spike, it's about
100 millivolts, a tenth of a volt.

28
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:57,697
And in this particular top cell,
if I would put a loudspeaker

29
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:03,174
I would hear something like
the tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk.

30
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:07,649
Stop-tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk.

31
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:12,638
So this cell fires spikes
in this particular rhythm,

32
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:14,779
as I just sang for you.

33
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:17,686
The other cell, the middle one
is much more rigorous

34
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:19,598
so it fires more strongly.

35
00:02:19,798 --> 00:02:24,313
Again spikes: 
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu.

36
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:29,838
And the third cell, the lower one
is firing spikes less frequently

37
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:35,078
for tuk(pause)-tuk-tuk-tuk-
(pause)tuk-tuk.

38
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:39,201
So this is a normal activity of
a normal Non-Parkinsonian brain.

39
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:43,702
But see what happens when this
particular region of the brain

40
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:46,294
the Basal Ganglia
become Parkinsonian.

41
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:51,409
Now you see the activity
of three cells in the bottom trays.

42
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:53,598
But these three cells, as you can
immediately see

43
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,774
have a different
pattern of activity.

44
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:58,086
So for example, let's look
at the top one.

45
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:03,127
You can see that the first activity
is a burst of a set of spikes

46
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:09,163
So tu-tu-tu stop tu-tu-tu
stop tu-tu-tu stop.

47
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:12,716
So this cell is now not anymore
like the previous one in a normal case

48
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:16,065
it fires rather sporadically
and randomly, so to speak

49
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:19,265
here there is a very clear
pattern of activity.

50
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,486
A burst, stop.
A burst, stop.

51
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:26,613
Something or the other of 5
or 10 bursts of spikes per second.

52
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:30,983
The second cell, the middle cell,
and the top cell

53
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:33,855
are actually doing similar things,
surprisingly.

54
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:37,138
There are other replica,
they are similar

55
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:39,300
in terms of their activity
to the first cell.

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,606
So all the three cells
are doing tu-tu-tu-tu-tu stop.

57
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,456
Tu-tu-tu-tu-tu stop.

58
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,988
The whole network is now
synchronized, firing together

59
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:54,855
in a bursty fashion, firing, stop,
firing, stop.

60
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:59,658
The output of this activity
is the Parkinsonian tremor.

61
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:03,438
So the tremor of the Parkinsonian
is the reflection

62
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,508
of this particular state
of the brain

63
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,708
in this particular region of the brain.

64
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:13,184
This is one example of many
that I could show you

65
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:16,783
that any behavior
in health and disease

66
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:21,053
is reflected by a particular
music of activity

67
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:23,672
if you want to call it this way,
an orchestra of activity

68
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,850
of many, many, many millions
of cells.

69
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:29,382
You only saw three here that fire
in a particular pattern

70
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:34,208
And this particular pattern stands
or reflects or codes

71
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:40,129
for a particular state of the brain,
sleep or awake, happy or sad,

72
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:45,178
involved with the face recognition
or not, and so forth...

73
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:47,777
Or sick with Parkinson's
or with Alzheimer's

74
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:50,326
or with other
devastating diseases.

75
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:54,237
So the importance of understanding
the electrical activity in the brain

76
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:57,374
comes from the fact that we know
that any state

77
00:04:57,618 --> 00:05:00,751
in the brain is reflected by
a particular activity

78
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,699
like in the case of Parkinson's.

79
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:06,011
I'll show you even more,
dramatic, how

80
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:09,202
electrical is the brain by
the following example.

81
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:15,662
So in the last 20 years or so,
investigators, scientists,

82
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:19,884
and physicians, decided to do
something to the Parkinsonian brain.

83
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:24,289
What they tried to do
is to intervene electrically

84
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:27,643
with the erroneous activity
that I showed you before

85
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:30,850
just now in the Parkinsonian case.

86
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,812
where you have the synchronus rhythm
of activity

87
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:37,923
which is reflected by this
Parkinsonian disease.

88
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:41,922
And they tried to intervene
into this region

89
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:45,122
by taking a battery,

90
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,548
Like the battery that people use
for pacemaking the heart,

91
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:53,477
but in this cas instead of connecting

92
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:57,201
the wire of the battery to the heart,
pacemaking the heart,

93
00:05:57,401 --> 00:06:02,321
the wire now goes, as you can see
here, up top and then into the brain.

94
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:04,823
Into this particular region
of the brain.

95
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,817
It's a simple operation, relatively.

96
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:11,293
It is called Deep Brain Stimulation
because then you can activate

97
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:15,047
the battery, you can see here
a set of stimuli

98
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:18,093
a set of pulses generated
by the battery.

99
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:22,396
The physician can manipulate
the frequency and the amplitude

100
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:25,347
and so forth, of this stimulation.

101
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:28,711
And now you stimulate the brain
of the Parkinsonian patient.

102
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:32,926
So you stimulate deep brain
by electrical activity

103
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,251
coming from the battery.

104
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,800
And I want to show you
a huge success, a great success

105
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:42,450
of repairing the Parkinsonian
disease

106
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,280
or the symptoms of
the Parkinsonian disease

107
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,716
by intervening directly
with the electrical activity

108
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,916
of the brain
of the Parkinsonian patient.

109
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:57,130
So first, I want to show you an
example of this devastating disease.

110
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,329
This is a very serious disease
of a Parkinsonian patient

111
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:03,331
at Hadassah Medical School,

112
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,858
before the deep brain stimulation,
the operation.

113
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,419
So here it is.

114
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:14,247
you can see the difficulties
in generating a movement,

115
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:17,334
in balancing the body.

116
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:20,002
And very soon you will see the 
difficulty in generating

117
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,205
a particular rhythm
like I am doing now

118
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:25,386
fast, or slow,
or even slower.

119
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:28,494
This is something that a typical
Parkinsonian patient

120
00:07:28,694 --> 00:07:32,434
cannot do, because he has
this rhythm generated

121
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:36,282
in the Basal Ganglia, and this
particular rhythm

122
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:40,951
deterministically dictates
the activity, the tremor

123
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:46,050
and the patient cannot really
generate his or her own

124
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,337
rhythm of, let's say,
hand movement

125
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:51,576
because the brain region
really dictates the movement.

126
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:54,876
So you can see now, for example
how difficult it is for the patient

127
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:58,452
to do something as simple
as we typically do

128
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,383
if we are not sick with Parkinson's.

129
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,970
So this is a Parkinsonian patient.

130
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:08,609
I'm sure you saw cases like these,
that's one case.

131
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:14,379
Now I want to show you the same
person, the same patient

132
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:20,075
after being operated, and after
being injected with electrical current

133
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,416
Deep Brain Stimulation
into this region

134
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:25,200
And see really a miraculous success.

135
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,778
So here it is.

136
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:32,193
So this is the same patient,
now getting the stimuli.

137
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:35,673
This electrical stimulus from
the battery into his head.

138
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:39,597
You can see that he is walking
almost normally, wonderful.

139
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:43,289
And he is really balanced, and you
can see very shortly

140
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,442
that he can do this hand rhyth

141
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,730
that I just mentioned before.

142
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:51,884
So in many ways he doesn't have
Parkinson's anymore.

143
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,476
It's not totally true, but he can
drive now,

144
00:08:56,676 --> 00:09:00,195
He can go to the grocery now,
he can live.

145
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:03,395
And of course, when you stop
the stimulation

146
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:07,076
it's gone, he's back to becoming
Parkinsonian.

147
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:10,493
So, it's a symptomatic treatment,
very successful.

148
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:12,874
You can see he's now balanced
and so on.

149
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:16,074
So this is just another
very clear example

150
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:19,423
of how our brain
is an electrical device

151
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:22,319
generating
it's own electrical activity

152
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,467
When everything is fine,
then everything is fine,

153
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:29,071
we shall call it normal.
But when something goes wrong

154
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:30,575
there is a disease.

155
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:34,785
When something changes,
then I go to sleep in that activity.

156
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:38,381
When I am creative,
when I am in love

157
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:42,484
when I am sad
there is electrical activity

158
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:45,113
that changes in a particular
region and reflects

159
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:50,037
these states of the brain:
love, suffering,

160
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:54,410
Parkinson's, hand movement,
creativity

161
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,080
the feeling of free will
and so forth.

162
00:09:57,191 --> 00:10:01,758
So this is why it is so absolutely
essential to understand

163
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,728
what makes the brain active
electrically.

164
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:08,273
That's exactly what I'm trying
to explain to you today.
