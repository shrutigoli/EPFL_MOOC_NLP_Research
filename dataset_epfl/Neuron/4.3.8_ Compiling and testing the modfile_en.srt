1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,155
Now we can go back to our notebook

2
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:10,842
and see if the MOD
file compiles correctly.

3
00:00:11,654 --> 00:00:17,354
As before, we use NRNIV model
to compile our new mechanism.

4
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,555
Let's evaluate that cell.

5
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:24,696
And indeed, the compilation seems
to have completed successfully.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,437
As seen by this statement,
should an error have occurred

7
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:31,884
error messages would
have occurred on this line.

8
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:36,188
Now let's try our synapse model,
as before we configure

9
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:38,683
the NEURON interpreter

10
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:42,716
we configure a neuron
to host out synapse in.

11
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:46,548
Now, let's create the synapse at
the center of the soma compartment.

12
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:50,556
Here, we've replaced simple AMPA
and NMDA with our new

13
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:53,984
Tsodyks Markram
AMPA NMDA model name.

14
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:59,366
Keep in mind that this name has
to exactly agree with the name

15
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:01,812
we provided in
the process declaration

16
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:06,446
in the NEURON block
of the NMODL file.

17
00:01:07,213 --> 00:01:09,675
Now let's go to full screen.

18
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:15,054
Next we define the stimulus
again we will use 8 spikes at 20Hz

19
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:18,960
and a subsequent
single spike 500ms later

20
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:20,833
as our standard protocol.

21
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:24,492
Again, we define
a "VecStim" mechanism

22
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:28,409
we provide the spike times
as a list in units of milliseconds

23
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:34,527
and we execute the play statement
on a vector of those spike times.

24
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:37,753
A "NetCon" object is created
to connect the stimulator

25
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,937
with the synapse object.

26
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:45,803
We define the weight of
the connection to be one.

27
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:49,037
And it's in units of nano Siemens.

28
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:52,322
Next we create a recorder for
the synaptic conductance

29
00:01:52,518 --> 00:01:55,756
current, sum of voltage,
and time intervals as before

30
00:01:56,072 --> 00:02:02,022
and also for U(se) and R state
variables of the synapse model.

31
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:05,907
Now let's configure biologically
plausible values for the AMPA

32
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:07,913
and NMDA model parameters.

33
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:12,847
First, the AMPA conductance
will take on the value of 2nS

34
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:17,786
and the AMPA conductance
will take on the value of 2nS

35
00:02:17,978 --> 00:02:20,116
and the conductance of
the NMDA channel

36
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:23,684
will take on 70% of the value
of the AMPA conductance.

37
00:02:23,948 --> 00:02:26,948
And magnesium is set to 1mM.

38
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:29,816
First, to try out our model,
let's configure parameters for

39
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:34,441
the pseudo linear synapse
dynamics E3 and simulate.

40
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:42,609
To this end we configure a baseline
release probability of 0.2,

41
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:47,654
a recovery time constant of 200ms,
and facilitation time constant

42
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:51,031
that is approximately equal to
the recovery type constant

43
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:52,681
here 200ms.

44
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:57,250
Let's run for a total time
of one second

45
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:00,476
and plot the results.

46
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,095
Here we use similar plotting

47
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,255
functionality to
the previous tutorial.

48
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:08,934
We use this magic command
to invoke fancy interactive

49
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:10,485
inline plots.

50
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:14,747
This is a convenience function to
plot time courses of state variables

51
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,122
through the simulation.

52
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:21,740
Now, let's plot the time course of R
and U(se) throughout the simulation.

53
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:27,356
In this graph, each
of these saw-tooth jumps

54
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:31,020
are the times of occurrence
of the pre-synaptic spike

55
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:35,182
when a post-synaptic release
event has been triggered

56
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:41,181
as it can be seen in the time course
of the synaptic conductance

57
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:45,128
of this synapse.

58
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:47,545
The blue trace indicates

59
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:52,135
the fraction of readily
releasable vesicles

60
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:58,326
and at each pre-synaptic event it is
jumping down by a certain amount

61
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:05,039
and after which it is recovering
with a time constant of 200ms.

62
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:10,274
As you can see here,
after about 450ms

63
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,255
there's an exponential relaxation
with a time constant of 200ms

64
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:19,700
towards the fully
recovered value of 1.

65
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:23,509
Conversely, for each synaptic spike
the running value of the release

66
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,735
probability initially jumps up
by a value of U1

67
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:32,169
and decays with a time constant
of tau_facilitation, in this case

68
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:33,982
200ms.

69
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,309
Since the time between spikes
is much shorter than

70
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:39,006
the time constant of
relaxation and facilitation

71
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:44,554
each incoming spike causes
an increase in the running value

72
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:46,122
of the release probability.

73
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:49,433
As such, we can see
a general trend of the facilitation

74
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,873
that is an increase in
the release probability

75
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:52,746
of the synapse.

76
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:56,049
Likewise, as the synapse facilitates

77
00:04:56,234 --> 00:05:00,133
the fraction of readily releasable
vesicles that is emitted

78
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:03,812
for a given pre-synaptic spike,
is increasing.

79
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:07,061
However, this is balanced
with the fact that the total

80
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:10,394
fraction of available
vesicles is depleting.

81
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,680
According to this general trend.

82
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:18,367
As a result for
the pseudo-linear synapse

83
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:24,260
the overall total conductance,
although it fluctuates

84
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:27,444
maintains a fairly even value.

85
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:35,092
In this case, somewhere
between 0.4nS and 0.5nS.

86
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:40,100
Now let's configure
a depressing synapse E2.

87
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:44,093
Such synapses have a much
higher baseline release probability

88
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:47,433
a longer recovery time from
depression and a very short

89
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:50,658
relaxation time of facilitation.

90
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:52,952
Now, here we can see
the analogous plot

91
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,329
for the depressing synapse.

92
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:58,482
As you could see,
the initial release probability

93
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:03,857
of this synapse is 0.5,
and exactly half or

94
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,958
the readily releasable pool
is released on the first

95
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,633
pre-synaptic spike.

96
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:12,121
And subsequently half is released
again and half is released again

97
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:14,742
and half is released again,
and so on.

98
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:17,913
There is a very slow time
constant of recovery such that

99
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:20,667
in between spikes there's
very little recovery

100
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:23,285
of the readily releasable pool.

101
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:26,728
Now looking at the facilitation
dynamics, as you can see

102
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:30,674
the release probability
takes on a value of 0.5

103
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:35,724
and rapidly decays
back to baseline.

104
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:38,922
Such that,
for each pre-synaptic spike

105
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:41,252
the attained value of
the release probability

106
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:45,094
is only U1, or 0.5.

107
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:49,383
As a result the dynamics of this
synapse is determined primarily

108
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:54,428
by the dynamics of
the readily releasable pool.

109
00:06:54,642 --> 00:07:00,529
And as such, the product of R
times U(se) equal to A

110
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,318
is a generally decreasing value,
as it can be seen

111
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:06,878
in the dynamics of the conductance.

112
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:11,908
an initially large value,
but generally rapidly decreasing

113
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,572
synaptic responses.

114
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:19,163
500ms later the synapse
has recovered somewhat

115
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:24,081
from this train of eight pulses,
but it hasn't recovered entirely

116
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:26,132
to it's baseline value.

117
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:29,380
That concludes our tutorial
on modeling synapse dynamics

118
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:33,383
with NEURON and
the NMODL language.
