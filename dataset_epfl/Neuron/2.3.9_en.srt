1
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:09,707
Next, I will take you
through the steps of creating

2
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:11,741
your own domain.

3
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:15,659
Here, I'm still going to stay
in the realm of neuroscience

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,160
but, typically, the way this happens
is that scientists come to us

5
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:26,328
and just describes their
needs with the platform

6
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:31,295
and that, altogether, allows us
to define a specific entity.

7
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:35,487
Here, I've taken
the example of a neuron

8
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:38,685
and through the discussion with
the scientists we have identified

9
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:42,359
that it needs to have a name,
it needs to have a morphology type

10
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:46,115
and an electrical type,
each of which are going

11
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:51,784
to be based on specific ontologies
that already predefine

12
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:54,600
these morphology types
and electrical types.

13
00:00:54,791 --> 00:01:00,703
And so, once this has been written,
typically by a knowledge engineer

14
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:06,552
in the Blue Brain Nexus project,
then this can be pushed into

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,646
the platform registers so
people can start using it.

16
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:18,854
The next step is now I have
two scientists that both are

17
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:21,858
working on their
own favorite neurons

18
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:25,543
and they have done experiments,
and they have identified

19
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:30,209
that in the top part here,
that neuron is a pyramidal cell

20
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,974
it is also a stuttering cell.

21
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:37,230
You can then, either through
a private interface

22
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:40,392
or through a ware application,
enter this information

23
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:42,264
push it into the platform,

24
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:45,218
other scientists can
do the same thing,

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,058
and should they set the ACL,
the Access Control Lists correctly

26
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:55,443
on their own respective
entities and share it, say

27
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:58,535
with people from their group,
and let's assume that these

28
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:01,884
three people are
working in the same group

29
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:05,807
then that person can then
request from the platform:

30
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:08,233
"Show me all neurons"

31
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:12,520
and you're getting
the two entities back

32
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:16,114
that these two
scientists have defined.

33
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:21,443
So, it is a simplistic example,
but all of that, we have been able

34
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:24,631
to do without having
to modify the platform

35
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:28,650
without writing code,
and just designing new things

36
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:33,467
declaring things into the platform,
and automatically people can

37
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:37,949
start using it and getting value
out of it, and we feel amazing.

38
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:44,275
So, we've just seen
an example on how to

39
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,927
define your own domain.

40
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:50,425
Now, many domains have already
been defined by other communities.

41
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:55,606
I just want to take a few minutes
to describe a few existing domains

42
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:58,840
that you might want
to consider re-using.

43
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:01,881
Here, this is probably
the most used vocabulary

44
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:05,926
on the internet today
in the age of Facebook and LinkedIn.

45
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:09,598
It is called FOAF,
or Friend of a Friend

46
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:14,934
and it simply describes a person
and their social network.

47
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:20,115
It's a very simple concept,
but FOAF has defined

48
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:25,720
a very specific vocabulary
that allows you to define

49
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:29,044
someone or a piece of software.

50
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,457
So for instance here,
we can define the name of a person

51
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:38,196
their title, you can have
images that depict that person

52
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,893
and you can have a family name,
a given name

53
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:45,064
here, quite an important piece of

54
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:52,183
vocabulary is the other people
that that person knows

55
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:55,130
so this is how you start
describing your social network

56
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:57,764
and connecting that
person to other people.

57
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:00,498
And I will not read all
these attributes

58
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:03,372
but there's a number of others
you can potentially be using

59
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,174
whether that person has
a chatline from Jabber

60
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,011
so you can connect with them,

61
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:11,856
or that person works for
a very specific organization

62
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:14,822
so potentially in
the Blue Brain Nexus

63
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:18,000
you can take this vocabulary,
select the properties

64
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:22,546
that are interesting to you
and register the concept

65
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:28,708
of an agent or a person,
leveraging this vocabulary

66
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:31,901
making very clear that it
comes from the FOAF

67
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,619
and just start using it.

68
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:37,146
So the previous example

69
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:41,245
was really outside of
the neuroscience field

70
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,324
and here for the sake of
illustrating neuroscience

71
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:47,319
I want to take another domain

72
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:53,181
that really is in
the realm of neuroscience

73
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:58,072
and so NIDM is one of such
domains that deal with

74
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:00,986
the neuroimaging data model.

75
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:05,546
And I'm really not planning to
get into the deep details

76
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:10,664
of how this is described,
but we can see here that

77
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,140
the whole community
has come together to define

78
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:16,446
a very specific kind of workflow.

79
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:20,831
So it covers the acquisition
of imagery data

80
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:24,107
it caters for the representation

81
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:27,296
of the raw data that
has been acquired

82
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:32,524
the description of specific
analysis and workflows,

83
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:38,802
it allows you to represent derived
data from what you have acquired

84
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:41,994
and to do so it leverages
the W3C Prov

85
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,792
just like we do in
the Blue Brain Nexus.

86
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:48,718
You can also capture
the publications that have been

87
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:55,070
created from whatever workflow's
derived data you have created

88
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,201
and as well as the distribution

89
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:02,048
and sharing of the queries
via a common API.

90
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:04,997
This is more of a platform,
I guess, of their own

91
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:12,555
but as the specific data model,
here all of these could be leveraged

92
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:16,436
in the Blue Brain Nexus by just
importing this very specific domain

93
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:24,870
and declaring it as within the name
space of NIDM and just re-use it.

94
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:28,087
A community, like I said,
has already spent time

95
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:33,411
defining these carefully,
and by leveraging it

96
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:36,978
you render also the data
you push into the platform

97
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:39,885
and make it compatible with data

98
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:42,315
sitting on potentially
other data repositories

99
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,940
which is a very powerful
way to combine data.

100
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,619
Here we have a very brief overview

101
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:55,082
of the NIDM domain representation,
and here they are leveraging

102
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,341
the visual representation
of the W3FC Prov.

103
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,191
And so you can see
just the main elements

104
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:09,654
which are the project on which
you're working the specific study

105
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,796
and the acquisition of the data.

106
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:14,433
And here again, they have emphasized

107
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,137
that they are using
the following provenance elements

108
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:21,041
and you find again that you
should be familiar with it

109
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:25,466
they consist of agents of activity,
of entity, and attributes.

110
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:30,351
So, again, a really powerful way
to leverage existing domains

111
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:35,943
and vocabularies and bring them
into your Blue Brain Nexus instance.
