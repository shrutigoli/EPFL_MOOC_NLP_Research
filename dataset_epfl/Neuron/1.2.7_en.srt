1
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:07,948
We briefly looked at how
you study single neurons,

2
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:11,148
we looked at how you
obtain the morphology,

3
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:13,639
how you could analyze
the morphology,

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,864
there is a lot more that you can
read up on morphometrics,

5
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:21,187
there is open source software
that we have released

6
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:25,288
that you can use to analyze
the morphologies.

7
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:28,912
And we looked at
how you record from cells,

8
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:31,688
obtain electrophysiological
properties,

9
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:34,888
and how you characterize them,

10
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:38,088
and how you can use that
to identify different behaviors.

11
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,075
There is a lot in the literature
and a lot of publications

12
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:44,000
on how you classify based
on these properties.

13
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:48,794
It is not all clear sometimes,
that it is a clear class,

14
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:53,357
but there are approaches to be able
to objectively classify,

15
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:55,607
semi-objectively classify,

16
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:59,757
and sometimes very
subjectively classify cells.

17
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:03,807
It is a big area of research to
decide what really are classes,

18
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:09,767
but in many cases, you have to
look at multiple lines of evidence

19
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:13,294
in order to decide what a class is,
or whether there is a class.

20
00:01:13,494 --> 00:01:16,494
Lastly, let's look at
just some caveats,

21
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:21,735
and here that main
caveat, of course,

22
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:25,383
is that you have to get such
high resolution data,

23
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:29,109
you need to record
from brain tissue,

24
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:32,309
and brain tissue means you have
got to cut the tissue,

25
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,509
and that means that you have
cut neurons

26
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:40,460
and you have to find a way
to repair these cut parts.

27
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:46,356
With patch clamp, of course, which
gives you the highest resolution

28
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:49,373
view of the morphology and the
electrical properties

29
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:52,573
and molecular properties
of a single neuron

30
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:55,773
but you can only record
from a few neurons.

31
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:58,872
That is one limitation of it.

32
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:02,859
So this really gives you
high-quality spa state.

33
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:09,034
And then, you have to classify.

34
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:12,371
There is a whole field of science
based on the classification

35
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:14,959
of different morphologies and
electrical types,

36
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,621
to decide what they are.

37
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:21,496
In summary, we learned about
brain slices,

38
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:24,334
that that is where the source of

39
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:27,534
a lot of very detailed,
high-resolution data comes from.

40
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:30,296
We learned a little bit about
patch-clamp,

41
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,388
but, again, I encourage you to
go and read up

42
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,430
about the electronics, and the
biophysics,

43
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,313
and the electrophysiological
principles behind it.

44
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:43,801
We learned how to obtain
morphologies.

45
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:47,901
And we learned how to
obtain electrical properties.
