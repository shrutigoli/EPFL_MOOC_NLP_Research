1
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:09,522
So now we are trying to
acquainted ourselves 

2
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:13,105
very briefly with the nerve
cell, with a neuron.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,801
So, of course one cannot
speak about neurons

4
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:19,725
without speaking about
these two great geniuses:

5
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:26,021
Ramon y Cajal, Spaniard,
and Camillo Golgi, the Italian

6
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:30,020
both got a Nobel prize in 1906
as you can see here

7
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:33,361
for recognizing
the structure of neurons.

8
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:35,441
They really developed methods

9
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:39,476
and used the microscope
in order to recognize

10
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:44,017
to decipher who are
these building blocks

11
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:45,598
of the nervous system?

12
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:47,601
Who are these neurons?

13
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:49,658
By the way, the term
neuron came later

14
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:53,169
and they did not invent
these nerve cells.

15
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:57,395
So, you can see here
a particular type of nerve cell

16
00:00:57,395 --> 00:01:00,067
we call it pukinji cell
from one region

17
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,953
of the brain,
from the cerebellum

18
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:06,566
and you can see Ramon y Cajal
was a really good drawer

19
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:11,414
a painter, an artist,
you can see here a retina

20
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,774
where it also has nerve cells

21
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,908
and you can see
another region here

22
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:22,143
which is a cortex, which is
another type of nerve cells.

23
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:26,923
All really look like trees,
sophisticated trees

24
00:01:26,923 --> 00:01:29,860
we shall talk about the particular
structure in a second

25
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:32,518
but you can see
that every region

26
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:33,847
in the nervous system,

27
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:35,552
it doesn’t matter if
you look at the retina

28
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:37,844
or at the cortex,
or dip inside the brain

29
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:43,229
a simple animal, a slug,
a mouse, a monkey

30
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:45,594
an elephant,
a human... is built from

31
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,423
these elementary
building blocks.

32
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:48,512
So morphologically

33
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,052
they are very beautiful
they look like trees,

34
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,617
we shall later, of course,
try to understand

35
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:55,279
the electrical properties
of these cells,

36
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:58,830
but now I am only talking about
the structure of these cells.

37
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:02,828
And Ramon y Cajal was in
some sense a visionary,

38
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:06,770
in many senses visionary, and,
just by looking at the anatomy

39
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:11,290
as you can see here a drawing,
he was speculating that

40
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:11,969
there is a signal or signals
that run through this anatomy,
as you can see here a drawing,
he was speculating that

41
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,654
there is a signal or signals
that run through this anatomy,

42
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:21,994
here is one signal denoted
by an arrow

43
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:24,056
so this is a Ramon y Cajal
arrow here,

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,197
and he wants to say that
his part of the neuron

45
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:34,172
which is call an axon, yes,
this part of the neuron,

46
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:36,399
which is called axon, there
are signals running

47
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:39,384
in a sort of speak in this direction,
and then somehow

48
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:41,591
and Ramon y Cajal
had no idea how

49
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:44,854
the signal from the axon jumps,
sort of speak

50
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:48,982
transferred here
in the dendritic tree

51
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:51,852
of the next neuron.

52
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,532
So, I just mentioned two
parts of the neuron.

53
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:59,781
The axon, which is the output
device of neurons,

54
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:03,000
and we know today that’s
the case indeed,

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,453
and the dendritic tree

56
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:06,295
you see the more
darker part here

57
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,245
that receives input from
the axon somehow

58
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:12,822
and then the signal
continues to flow

59
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:15,400
this red arrow
continues to flow

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,186
until it reaches this region

61
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:22,590
in the axon of this cell number
B and from this axon there

62
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,481
is somehow another jump or
connection through this arrow

63
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:29,809
into the dendrites of cell C.

64
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:32,937
So Ramon y Cajal envisioned
some signal flow

65
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:36,748
that flow from the axon
into the dendrites

66
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:40,946
and from the dendrites
back into the axon of the cell

67
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,376
where the dendrites
belong to it.

68
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,353
So we already said
that neuron

69
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:48,544
is built from
the dendritic tree

70
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,575
I will mention it
a lot of times

71
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:53,433
a cell body
and an axon.

72
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:55,435
So these are the three
parts of the neuron

73
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,152
that we shall discuss later on,
but already Ramon Y Cajal

74
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:01,622
just by seeing
the morphology thought

75
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:04,251
that there must be some
kind of signals running

76
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,765
on top of this
particular anatomy.

77
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:10,172
And we know today,
and I will convince you later

78
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:12,436
that indeed axons
are the sending

79
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:14,515
the output device
of neurons

80
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:17,555
and the dendrites
are the input

81
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:20,265
receiving devices
of the neuron

82
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:21,700
and I will show you
that actually

83
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,071
the input is actually
the one signal:

84
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:28,105
the synaptic potential, and
the output is another signal:

85
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:30,696
the action potential,
or the spike.

86
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:32,730
Ramon y Cajal
noticed something

87
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,726
with his primitive
microscope:

88
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:37,950
he was already
able to see

89
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:41,356
that if you zoom into
the dendritic tree here

90
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,071
of a cell, by the way he used
to call this particular cell

91
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:48,798
which is the majority
of the cell type

92
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:51,171
in our cortex in
the mammalian cortex

93
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,933
it’s called the pyramidal cell.

94
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:57,697
In this particular cell, when you
zoom in into the dendrites

95
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:03,905
you see here a little
branch taken from this

96
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:05,216
region of the tree

97
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:07,795
and if you look very carefully
you will see that this branch

98
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,168
is built from these
little protrusions,

99
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:13,607
these little branchlets,
very small branchlets

100
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:16,526
something of the order of
the thousandth of a millimeter

101
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:18,260
a micrometer long

102
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,464
and these are called
the dendritic spines.

103
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:23,556
I will show you later that
these dendritic spines

104
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:28,368
are the site for synaptic
connection between

105
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:29,776
the axon and the dendrite.

106
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:32,681
So, Ramon y Cajal
already saw

107
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:36,476
more than a hundred years ago,
that actually

108
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,447
which is a nice
and sad story that

109
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:43,812
in his death bed Ramon y Cajal
just before he died

110
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:47,638
he drew spines in
a little notebook

111
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,131
and he wrote down that
we must pay attention

112
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,419
future scientists
should pay

113
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,540
attention to
these little spines

114
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:58,060
because they
are very important,

115
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,730
they must have a very
important function

116
00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:03,589
and we shall show you later
that he was absolutely right.

117
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,342
So, remember, the neuron
is built from dendrites

118
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,882
cell body, axons, and dendrites
of some cell types

119
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:17,210
have these little protrusions
that we call dendritic spines.

120
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:20,971
And indeed, if you look
at many cell types

121
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:22,678
you can see
the dendritic spines

122
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,302
on this piece
of the dendrite

123
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,975
or on this piece
of the dendrite

124
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:27,776
on this piece of
the dendrite

125
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:30,081
and here you see,
by the way

126
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:33,711
a very nice example of an axon,
so this is an axon here

127
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,067
sorry, this is an axon,
coming very close

128
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:39,052
but of course, we don’t know
if it makes or doesn’t make

129
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:41,039
a connection with
this dendrite.

130
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:42,211
I will show later that

131
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,008
the connection is
on the spines

132
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:45,582
in this particular case.

133
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:48,287
So dendritic spines
are very important.

134
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:50,311
Not all the cells
have spines

135
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:51,991
so there are
spiny nerve cells

136
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:55,804
and smooth nerve cells,
so the dendritic tree

137
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:57,241
does not have these spines,

138
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,492
but we’re not going to
talk about this detail

139
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:01,228
this is just to show you that
the dendritic spines

140
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:03,289
are very important for
some types of cells

141
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,335
especially these
pyramidal cells

142
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:08,102
which Ramon y Cajal liked
to call psychic cells

143
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:12,261
because he believed
we are psychic, psychological

144
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:14,058
behaving people

145
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,827
and that this cell is a part
of this capability of us

146
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:21,492
to be psychological behavioral,
emotional, and so forth.

147
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:24,414
Just to give you
some numbers

148
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,430
just dimensions,
average dimensions,

149
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,431
of course there are
big nerve cells

150
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:32,852
small nerve cells, long axons,
short axons, and so forth

151
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,840
but just a “ball park”,
just a region

152
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,820
so if you ask what is
the total length of dendrites

153
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,163
so this is
a branched tree

154
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:42,259
and let’s say if I take this
tree and make one

155
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:44,012
long wire out of it

156
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,340
it will be on the order
of something like

157
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:49,903
10 to 15mm long totally.

158
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:53,323
But of course, from the body
to the dendrite tip

159
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,531
is one millimeter,
but because there

160
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:58,484
are all these branches,
it becomes long.

161
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:02,259
The total area of dendrite
is something of this order

162
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,761
20000 micrometers squared,
in terms of the of

163
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:10,012
the area of the dendrites,
you have on a spiny neuron

164
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:12,804
like the pyramidal cell,
I showed you here on the left

165
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:15,464
something of the order of
8000, 10000

166
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:20,944
in humans we have sometimes
30000 spines per single neuron.

167
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:23,730
The dimension of
the spine is on

168
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:27,412
the order of one
square micrometer

169
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:32,040
there about 10000
synaptic inputs

170
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:34,481
connections into
a single neuron.

171
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,824
So, if I’m a single neuron,
I am receiving on my dendrites

172
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,322
something of the order of 10000
synapses, connections,

173
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,719
and we shall see how to model
these synapses soon

174
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,448
and the axon could be
a very long process

175
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:51,899
connected this region
to the brain to this region

176
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,197
with a single cell

177
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:55,151
and it can be also
something very local.

178
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:56,792
So, it could go from
a few millimeters

179
00:08:57,122 --> 00:09:00,479
or less locally to a very
long few centimeter long.

180
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:05,476
So, this is just ballpark dimensions,
just for the introduction

181
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:07,915
so that you will
know intimately

182
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:11,705
more intimately
the structure of the neuron.

183
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:17,661
This is one beautiful example,
it’s coming from Spain

184
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:22,720
from a group there headed
by Xavier de Felipe in Madrid

185
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:25,628
reconstructing
human neurons.

186
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:28,541
So, you can see that the neurons
I showed you before from

187
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:31,883
Ramon y Cajal and Golgi
came from many animals

188
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,491
it was a mouse, and a fly,
and other types of animals

189
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,428
that they reconstructed
neurons from.

190
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:40,523
Here’s is an example of
a neuron from a human.

191
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:45,178
So, this is a pyramidal cell,
all this is a pyramidal cell

192
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,371
from a human cortex
post mortem,

193
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:53,206
and here on the left you can
see a piece of a dendrite

194
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,902
taking somewhere
from here, or from here

195
00:09:56,593 --> 00:09:59,546
some locally and you can
see that this dendrite

196
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:04,047
like I showed you before for
mouse, rat, and so forth

197
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:07,068
also have these
dendritic spines.

198
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:09,091
So, look at this
one for example.

199
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:13,546
It’s a dendritic spine,
it’s dendritic spine.

200
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:16,261
Many, many dendritic spies,
as I said before

201
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:20,495
in human it could range up
until 30000, 25000 spines

202
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,496
and each of these spines
receive an input

203
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:27,528
a synaptic input from
a nearby axon of another cell.

204
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,074
Just to show you
that a neuron

205
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:31,687
is a neuron in general

206
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,308
it has soma, it has
dendrites, a cell body

207
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,706
and then what’s an axon

208
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,611
and in many cases for
their spiny neurons

209
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:40,282
the dendrites are absolutely

210
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:42,950
covered by these
little protrusions

211
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:44,422
these dendritic spines

212
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:46,405
they are very, very important
for the generation

213
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:49,080
and the connection
between...

214
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:51,590
the generation of
the synaptic potential

215
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,347
and the connection between
one nerve to the other.

216
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:57,876
Just before summarizing
the neuron introduction

217
00:10:58,185 --> 00:10:59,706
the structure aspect
of the neuron

218
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:01,575
you can see now
a reconstructed

219
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:03,123
neuron whereby

220
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:05,481
you see the dendritic
tree in green

221
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:08,060
so this is the dendritic
tree here,

222
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,471
the green part,

223
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:13,099
you can see
the axonal branching

224
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:16,614
so the axons is really
branch, and branch,

225
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:19,331
here’s a local
branching of this axon

226
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,709
coming from the same cell,
so the axon comes up

227
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:23,961
and then branch,
branch, branch

228
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:27,804
and occupies all this region,
it’s an axonal tree

229
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:31,523
and in this axonal tree
you see many, many

230
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:34,394
many white dots,
white spots.

231
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,473
These are called
axonal boutons

232
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:38,416
I will show you
later that this is

233
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,763
the pre-synaptic
side in the axon

234
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:44,583
where the transmitter is
located in these boutons

235
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:48,178
and this transmitter,
which is a chemical,

236
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:52,928
is the element that
enables the communication,

237
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:54,053
which is in this case

238
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:57,149
chemical, between
the axon of one cell

239
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:59,490
to the dendrite
of another cell.

240
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:03,558
Just to summarize, a neuron
is a really sophisticated,

241
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:06,474
also structurally,
but later we shall see also

242
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:08,604
that physiologically,
electrically,

243
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:12,490
very sophisticated electrical
and morphological element

244
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:16,540
it is in a branching structure,
both the dendrites

245
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,931
which are more local,
and the axons

246
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:21,960
which could be very global,
and go elsewhere

247
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:23,877
between one
region to another

248
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:27,504
or from my brain,
the motor region into my foot

249
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:30,335
a long axon, but you
can see that this

250
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,192
is a very complicated structure

251
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,002
and on the top of this
complicated structure

252
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:38,268
this structure knows how to
generate electrical signals

253
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:41,565
and propagate these signals
from one region to another

254
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:45,019
and connect through these
signals one cell to the other.

255
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,142
So here it is.

256
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,743
The structural aspect
of the neuron.
