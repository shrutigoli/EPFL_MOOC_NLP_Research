So, to conclude, you have learned a number of things in this session.
First, we've looked at the challenges of data integration in neuroscience and a number of approaches to address them.
We've looked at different ways to run data integration there are different models that you can use.
There's the fixed data model which has some limitations that have been issues in the past.
We have the user control, the main design that will give the full flexibility to the scientist to really design their model and really capture precisely the domain they are working on, but also we have seen the power in re-using existing domains and vocabularies to support your efforts and make your data integration compatible with the rest of the community's.
Finally we've looked at the Blue Brain Nexus' capabilities and how it enables data integration.
There were several aspects to this.
The ability to have an expert designing their own model to re-use existing domains, to publish and search data and finally, to discover new data sets that are similar or related to those you know.
