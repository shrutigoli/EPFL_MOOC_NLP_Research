1
00:00:05,862 --> 00:00:09,800
Here, we have defined already

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,013
our provenance pattern,

3
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:15,231
but we have also been told
by the scientists that

4
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:18,531
they want to capture the protocol
that will allow to generate

5
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:21,731
the various entities in 
this provenance pattern,

6
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:25,181
and also to capture the agents
that  contributed

7
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:28,519
or were part of these activities.

8
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:32,909
So I have now introduced
these three levels.

9
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:36,897
The concept of an activity from
which we can also add protocols

10
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:38,709
and agents and so on...

11
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,447
So originally, we only
had these links,

12
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:46,422
and so now we have the ability
to ensure the additional information

13
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:48,722
the scientist does need.

14
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:52,027
At this stage, 

15
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:55,227
now we can define all
the fields that are

16
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,750
defining an activity.

17
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,774
So, not so many. We have a type,
like I said, we're going to differentiate

18
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:05,778
experimental activity

19
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:08,203
from potentially others
like classifications.

20
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:11,113
We have the method
that has been used,

21
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:14,338
so in ontology terms describing
the specific methods, and we have

22
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,976
measurement methods, ontology
for that.

23
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:19,954
We want to define the protocol

24
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:22,804
and this protocol will be

25
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:25,208
further defined down here.

26
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:29,177
And finally, we have the
list of agents

27
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:31,114
that is defined here.

28
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:34,384
So an agent is also accompanied
by its role

29
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:37,659
in the activity, and we have 
an ontology for that as well.

30
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,748
If you get a little further on
the definition of the protocol

31
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:44,736
it's not again very much there but
we want to give it a title.

32
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:48,261
We want to give it a description, 
and you could see that as the

33
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:51,911
materials and methods of
a typical scientific publication.

34
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,936
So, a thorough description 
of all the steps

35
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:59,886
that led to the execution

36
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,623
of this activity.

37
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:06,537
And finally, if there are any
known publications

38
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:09,524
that describe this protocol,
you can capture them

39
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:13,524
using the concept of cross 
references here shortened to Xref

40
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,194
which is defined here.

41
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,484
And so, a cross reference
is simply

42
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:24,834
built with two fields:

43
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,034
A database which can be
for instance

44
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:31,152
a DOI or (INAUDIBLE)

45
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:34,972
and then an identifier.

46
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:38,522
If you have selected a database
DOI, then you would put the DOI

47
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:39,910
identifier.

48
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,922
And if you've selected (INAUDIBLE)

49
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:44,672
you will make sure you
have a (INAUDIBLE) IDENTIFIER.

50
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,635
Just a very simple way to
describe a cross reference.

51
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:51,236
On the lower part now we can
have a look at the agents

52
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:54,198
and here we have the given
name, which is a string.

53
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:57,398
The family name a string, the email
which is very important so we can

54
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,798
facilitate contacts to the people.

55
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:06,334
And the affiliation that agent,
that person was related to.

56
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:10,259
And the affiliation is this
right here,

57
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:13,009
we can have the laboratory
the person works in,

58
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,784
and finally the organisation
that person works in.

59
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:18,115
And so we have here,

60
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:21,243
a definition of the activity

61
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,931
that does capture 
enough details

62
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:26,981
so the scientists can ask 
the question they wanted to ask.
