1
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:08,129
Let's look now at the
electrophysiological profiling,

2
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:11,329
how do we profile the electrical
behavior of neurons.

3
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:16,528
So, as I said, you obtain
these wholesale recordings

4
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:18,353
from cells.

5
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:26,624
So you find out, you stimulate a
positive current into this,

6
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:29,824
so you get a step pulse here.

7
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:33,997
And then you see how the cell reacts,
in this case, it's producing a burst,

8
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:36,033
it stops, and then
fires more spikes.

9
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:41,389
Here you do a high resolution,
it is a short time frame,

10
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:46,023
so you can actually look at when
does the action potential start,

11
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:50,241
you can get the amplitude,
you can see how fast it is rising,

12
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:53,441
you can see how fast it is falling,

13
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,759
you can see how deep it goes after,
because some can go...

14
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:02,115
afterhyperpolarization,
can be very big, some shallow.

15
00:01:05,218 --> 00:01:09,806
You can give it a ramp pulse
to find out what is the threshold,

16
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:13,006
what is the threshold of the action
potential,

17
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:18,137
when does the cell start generating
action potentials,

18
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:23,118
and then you can give a range of
different current pulses

19
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:27,964
to see how the cell will react to
different current pulses.

20
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:32,663
You can try to give a series of
strong pulses to see

21
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:35,863
whether the action
potential will change,

22
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:39,942
in some cells, the action potential
drops and gets very small,

23
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,406
in other cases they don't.

24
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:47,099
So the amplitude can change,
and those old properties...

25
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,371
You can give short pulses and look
what happens afterwards.

26
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:54,071
And you can see here,

27
00:01:54,271 --> 00:02:00,234
that the cell hyperpolarizes
and it recovers slowly after that.

28
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:06,246
So this is an afterhyperpolarization
potential.

29
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:11,225
You can give it a
negative pulse inward,

30
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:16,257
and then hyperpolarize the membrane
very fast and then it relaxes back.

31
00:02:16,457 --> 00:02:21,009
And you will see in
Idan Segev's course

32
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:28,075
that this can be used to calculate a
lot of properties about the membrane.

33
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:33,582
Then you can also give different pulses
below thresholds, sub-thresholds.

34
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:38,143
And you can calculate the input,
the IV curve,

35
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:42,411
the current-voltage relationship
of a cell.

36
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:46,015
So the idea is you do a whole
battery of stimuli,

37
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:50,101
to actually probe a neuron and see
how it reacts.

38
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:53,301
It is a bit like a psychologist
for neurons.

39
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:58,369
And then you classify the
electrical behavior.

40
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,569
So, when you do that,
what we have found is that

41
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:09,264
there are essentially eleven types
of behaviors.

42
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:22,014
You have cells that are slow-firing
cells, for example, here or here.

43
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:26,173
You have very fast-firing cells,
they can go at high speed,

44
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,373
these are fast-spikers or
non-accommodating,

45
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:32,573
classical non-accommodating cells.

46
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:35,532
You have cells that,
when you excite them,

47
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:39,288
they say: "wait a minute",
and there is a delay,

48
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:42,488
and then they start spiking.

49
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:45,147
And you have the opposite,

50
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:48,347
where the cell starts
with a burst

51
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:51,547
so it starts actually with
a very high frequency burst,

52
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:54,747
and then it slows down.

53
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,230
So you have all these different ways
that a cell can behave,

54
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,430
some stutter, we call them
"stuttering cells", like here,

55
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,610
that is almost like a morse code.
Stuttering cells.

56
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:08,217
Others are even called
"irregular spiking",

57
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:11,267
it means you can't actually predict
when the cell is going to fire.

58
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:15,493
You stimulate it and then in some
other process they just

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,872
fire whenever they
seem to want to fire,

60
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:23,118
it is not as predictable as any of
these other approaches.

61
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:27,752
One thing that we found is that
for every morphology,

62
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:33,160
you can have multiple different ways
that they can behave.

63
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,724
So you can get a certain
morphological type of cell,

64
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:40,249
and you can discover
that same type of cell

65
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:42,809
can behave in different ways.

66
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:45,148
So either a fast-spiking cell,

67
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:49,704
this is a burst irregular-spiking cell...

68
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:56,953
So we call these
morpho-electrical types.

69
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:01,052
And so, in combination,

70
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,252
you can try and map the morphology
with,

71
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:13,697
"for this given morphology,
which electrical types do you find?"

72
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:18,246
And you can create a map between
different morphologies,

73
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:20,097
these are morphologies

74
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:23,297
and the different
electrical behaviors.

75
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:27,206
And what that gives you is,
in the case here,

76
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:34,226
where you have
fifty-five morphologies,

77
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:37,426
and you have
eleven electrical types.

78
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:39,763
In combination, it gives you

79
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:43,576
207 morpho-electrical types.

80
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:48,666
So these are the individual
characters, if you wish,

81
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,330
of the circuit.
