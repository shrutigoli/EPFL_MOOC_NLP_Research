1
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:10,633
So next I will take you to the steps
of creating your own domain,

2
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:15,829
so here I'm still going to stay
in the realm of neuroscience

3
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:20,273
but typically the way this happens
is that scientists come to us

4
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:25,595
and they just describe their
needs with the platform

5
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:31,206
and that allows us together
to define a specific entity.

6
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:36,641
So here, we've taken the example
of a neuron and through discussion

7
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:38,693
with the scientist,
we have identified

8
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,505
that it needs to have a name,
it needs to have a morphology type

9
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:47,712
and an electrical type each of which
are going to be based on specific

10
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:51,679
ontologies that already predefined

11
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:54,743
these morphological types
and electrical types.

12
00:00:54,926 --> 00:01:00,626
And so, once this has been written,
typically by a knowledge engineer

13
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:06,394
in the Blue Brain Nexus project.
These can be then pushed

14
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:10,482
into the platform register
where people can start using it.

15
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,082
So the next step is

16
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,353
now I have two scientists
that are both working

17
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:24,280
on their own favorite neurons,
and they have done experiments

18
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:28,141
and they have identified that,
in the top part here

19
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:32,982
that neuron is a pyramidal cell,
and is also a stuttering cell.

20
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:37,266
You can then, through
either parametric interface

21
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,335
or through a ware application,
enter this information

22
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:43,748
push it into the platform,
but other scientists can do

23
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,050
the same thing.

24
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:50,987
And should they set the ACL, so
the Access Control Lists correctly

25
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:56,662
on their own respective entities,
and share it with people from

26
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,696
their group, and let's assume these

27
00:01:58,897 --> 00:02:02,309
three people are working
in the same group.

28
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:05,784
And that person can then
request from the platform:

29
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:07,819
"Show me all neurons."

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,955
and you're getting back
the two entities

31
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:15,786
that these two scientists
have defined.

32
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:20,999
So it is a simplistic example,
but all of that we have been

33
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:24,545
able to do without having
to modify the platform 

34
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:28,538
without writing code,
and just designing new things 

35
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,874
declaring things into
the platform and automatically

36
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:36,154
people can start using it
and get values out of it.

37
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:39,379
And we find that amazing.

38
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:45,969
So, we've just seen an example
on how to define your own domain.

39
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:50,391
Now many domains have already
been defined by other communities.

40
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:53,221
And so I just want to take
a few minutes to describe

41
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:55,797
a few existing domains

42
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:58,437
that you might want
to consider reusing

43
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:01,938
so here, this is probably
the most used vocabulary

44
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:06,309
on the internet today in the age
of Facebook, LinkedIn

45
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:09,671
it's called the FOEF,
or Friend of a Friend.

46
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:14,832
It simply describes a person
and their social network.

47
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:21,412
And it's a very simple concept,
but FOEF has defined a very specific

48
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:28,451
vocabulary that allows you to define
someone or a piece of software.

49
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,076
So, for instance here,
we can define the name of a person

50
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:38,297
its title, you can have images
that depict that person

51
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,807
and you can have
the Family name, the Given name.

52
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:46,278
Here, quite an important
piece of vocabulary

53
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:52,306
is the other people
that that person knows

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,120
so this is how you start
describing your social network

55
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:57,652
and connecting that
person to other people.

56
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,625
And I will not read all these
attributes, but there's a number

57
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:05,089
of others you could potentially be
using whether that person has

58
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,765
a chat line from Jabber,
so you can connect with it

59
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:13,562
or that person works for a very
specific organization so potentially

60
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,187
in the Blue Brain Nexus
you could take this vocabulary

61
00:04:16,386 --> 00:04:20,198
select the properties that
are interesting to you

62
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:26,784
and register the concept
of an agent or a person

63
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:30,077
leveraging this vocabulary,
making very clear that

64
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:34,706
it comes for FOAF,
and just start using it.

65
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:41,312
So the previous example was really
outside of the neuroscience field.

66
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,412
And here for the sake
of illustrating neuroscience

67
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:47,094
I want to take another domain

68
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:53,472
that really is in
the realm of neuroscience

69
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:57,551
and so an IDM is one of such domains

70
00:04:57,743 --> 00:05:00,893
that deal with
the neuro-imaging data model

71
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:06,799
and so, we're not planning to
get into deep details of how this is

72
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:10,590
described but we can see here that

73
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:13,339
the whole community
has come together

74
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:16,388
to define a very specific
kind of workflow.

75
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:21,472
So, it covers the acquisition
of imagery data

76
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:27,091
it caters for the representation of
the raw data that has been acquired

77
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:33,394
the description of specific
analysis and workflows .

78
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:38,757
It allows you to represent derived
data from what you have acquired

79
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,019
and to do so, it leverages
the W3C-Prove

80
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,811
just like we do in
Blue Brain Nexus.

81
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:48,649
You can also capture
the publications that have been

82
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:55,177
created from whatever workflows
derived data you have created

83
00:05:55,415 --> 00:06:00,352
and as well as the distribution
and sharing of the queries via

84
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,280
a common API.

85
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:05,126
So this is more of
the platform, I guess of their own,

86
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:10,112
but as the specific
data model here,

87
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,428
all of these could be leveraged
in Blue Brain Nexus

88
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,674
by just importing
a very specific domain

89
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:22,940
and declaring it as within
the name space of NIDM

90
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:24,678
and just reuse it.

91
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,677
The community, like I said,
has already spent time defining

92
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,244
these carefully.

93
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:35,930
By leveraging it you also
render the data you push

94
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:40,255
into the platform and make it
compatible with data sitting

95
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:43,135
on other data repositories
potentially, which is

96
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:46,344
a very powerful way to combine data.

97
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,723
Here we have a very brief
overview of the NIDM

98
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:55,551
domain representation
and here they are leveraging

99
00:06:55,773 --> 00:07:00,110
the visual representation
of the W3C-Prove

100
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:04,404
and so you can see just
the main elements which

101
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,649
are the project on
which you're working

102
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:12,731
the specific study
and the acquisition of data.

103
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:15,668
And here again they emphasize
that they are using

104
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:18,252
the following provenance elements

105
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:20,986
and you find again and you
should be familiar with it,

106
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:25,328
it consists of agents of activity,
of entity, and attributes.

107
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:30,502
So, again a really powerful way
to leverage existing domain

108
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:35,857
and vocabularies and bring them
into your Blue Brain Nexus instance.
