1
00:00:05,932 --> 00:00:07,982
So, in this slide we're going to

2
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:11,173
look a little deeper
into ontologies.

3
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:16,109
So, Sean has already given you
basic information about what

4
00:00:16,304 --> 00:00:18,867
ontologies are,
and I will not expand on this.

5
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,611
What I'm really interested
in doing here is to show you

6
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:26,421
for the domain of neuroscience
which ontologies we have decided

7
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:30,619
to integrate in our
Blue Brain Nexus platform.

8
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:36,158
So, a lot of the ontologies we
have integrated have been either

9
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:39,459
taken from the Neuroscience
Information Framework

10
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:42,840
or co-developed with them.

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,833
The goal of NIF is to define
these concepts

12
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:52,448
for the domain of neuroscience
and share them so the community

13
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:57,694
can re-use them and have
a common agreement on how to define

14
00:00:57,912 --> 00:00:59,900
neuroscientific concepts.

15
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:03,391
They have defined
the NIF standard ontologies

16
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:06,475
which integrate a number
of existing ontologies

17
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:10,441
such as, (INAUDIBLE), for instance
to define Brain regions

18
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:15,902
in a manner that is agnostic
of which specimen

19
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:19,078
or species they come from,

20
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:23,315
(Gaby?) for instance for
the description of small molecules

21
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:27,648
the gene ontology or OBE,
and quite a few others.

22
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:33,369
Now in this part here,
what I would like to illustrate

23
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:37,928
is a number of ontologies
we have decided to use

24
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,250
in the Blue Brain Nexus platform for
the domain of neuroscience.

25
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,780
So, for instance,
around the specimens

26
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:50,639
we have the definition
of species and strain

27
00:01:50,874 --> 00:01:53,962
so this is really helping
in defining what kind of

28
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:57,808
animal or subject that was,
so these two

29
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:00,074
we have created them ourselves.

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:06,460
This is the part of the NCBI,
taxonomy.

31
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:14,806
And so, whenever dealing with
ontologies it is really important to

32
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:19,229
do enough research
to find out if there is any

33
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:22,408
vocabulary already
existing in the community

34
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:26,739
so that we can just leverage them.
It really would be a waste of time

35
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,454
for us to reinvent what
is already working

36
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:33,443
and well accepted by the community,
but there's also a strong advantage

37
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:38,517
in using and reusing these
already defined vocabularies,

38
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:45,108
and very simply if someone describes
a rat with a very specific concept

39
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:49,667
and you have also defined a rat
with the same concept

40
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,057
so even if you're storing your
data in different places

41
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,290
they become compatible,
you know that what you call a rat

42
00:02:56,515 --> 00:03:00,940
is also what they call a rat,
and so if, for instance,

43
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:04,778
in your lab you deal with
electrophysiology only

44
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,541
and that other person deals
only with morphology

45
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:14,276
at least, the data is compatible
at the level of the species

46
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:18,720
and it is very clear to deduce
from the use of the vocabulary

47
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:20,852
you have chosen.

48
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:25,435
The next one will be just
a vocabulary to define a sex

49
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:28,996
of the specimen, male or female.

50
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:33,929
Then we have a number of ontologies
for the description of data sets.

51
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:38,405
So we have the category,
so what kind of data set is it?

52
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:42,859
Is it electrophysiology,
or morphology image

53
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,548
imagery data.

54
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:47,191
That's the specific data format

55
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:52,335
that is used to serialize this data,
the raw data, when you save it

56
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:56,550
on your disk it is a concrete format
that you have chosen

57
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,586
and so there's a way
in the meta data

58
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:01,028
to describe this and this
becomes very important

59
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,170
if you look for electrophysiology
in a very specific format

60
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:06,735
because you have a workflow
that requires it

61
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,778
you can then filter the data
on the platform

62
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:11,775
and only get those that match
and will become compatible

63
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,421
with what you're trying to achieve.

64
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:17,895
Next, we have a licence ontology,
which allows us to define

65
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:22,670
who can re-use the data you
are publishing into the platform.

66
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:24,816
So I will not
underestimate this one.

67
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:28,890
If you decide that your data cannot
be re-used for commercial purposes

68
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:31,230
you can actually define that there.

69
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:35,834
Finally we have the storage of
the data set and this is a way

70
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:39,023
to describe where you have
stored your data.

71
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:44,368
So it can be, through the platform,
in which case you don't really

72
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:47,488
need to know where it's configured,
you just have to know that

73
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:50,095
the people managing the platform
have configured it in a way

74
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:54,146
that the data is going to be
backed up and is safe.

75
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:58,620
But if you were to store the data on
an external storage to the platform

76
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:02,040
here we have an ontology to
actually allow you to describe this.

77
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:04,528
So you can easily find the data.

78
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,343
For instance, it is stored
in a cloud on Amazon 

79
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,520
and you can define it there.

80
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:13,550
Then we have the concept
of sample classification

81
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:17,574
which is really important to us,
because from a lot of the data sets

82
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:22,209
we are integrating,
scientists take the time to make

83
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:27,676
statements on the entities:
we integrate, neurons, for instance

84
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:31,067
and it will give them
electric types

85
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,390
morphology types, and so,
we have the designed ontology

86
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:41,750
that allows that
description with NIF.

87
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,515
Finally, another way to classify
them is to define what kind

88
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:48,102
of neurotransmitters
some entities are

89
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:50,044
so that's another kind of ontology

90
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,224
but I won't get into
the details of that here.

91
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:58,164
A lot of the data we integrate
really makes sense when we

92
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:02,530
anchor it in specific brain spaces.

93
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:09,823
So we have a number of existing
brain atlases that are references

94
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:15,582
for specific species,
whether it is the Allen mouse CCFv3

95
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:19,673
or the Waxholm for the rat

96
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:23,304
we have an ontology that defines

97
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:27,299
the logical reference
for these spaces

98
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:32,001
and these can be annotated
at the level of a data set.

99
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:41,114
More detailed in that concept
is the parcellation schemes.

100
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:46,491
So here we enter, still within
the concept of anchoring data

101
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:50,092
into an atlas, now we want to,
what we talked about

102
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:57,139
in which specific region of an atlas
so your data set is to be anchored.

103
00:06:57,337 --> 00:07:02,587
And so different atlas spaces
come with parcellation schemes

104
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:08,147
where anatomists have just looked
at this space and defined

105
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,610
sub-volumes of this space that
correspond to specific brain regions

106
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:17,009
or brain parcels.

107
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,859
So we have three here,
which I've put as examples

108
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:23,702
actually we have
quite a few others,

109
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:28,360
and these define,
again, a vocabulary

110
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,184
to describe these brain regions.

111
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:35,152
But they are really specific
to that atlas space.

112
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,369
Finally, we have some
ontologies to describe...

113
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:44,590
that are really linked more
to the provenance concepts

114
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:47,362
that really allows to enrich it.

115
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:50,927
So, for instance, we have
the type of the activity run

116
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:53,827
whether it is an experimental
type ran in the lab

117
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,222
or a computational task,
you know, simply run in a computer

118
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:03,309
or classification activity,
so you have these very short

119
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:06,623
vocabularies that really
enable you to describe

120
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:13,851
via the activity you want to define,
and later on filter through

121
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,202
the semantic searches.

122
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,298
Then we have measurement methods,
so an ontology to describe

123
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:22,970
what kind of methods
you have applied to generate

124
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,418
new entities.

125
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:28,352
And finally, the role of
the agents involved

126
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:31,256
in a given activity

127
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:35,357
whether it was like the principle
investigator of a project

128
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:41,606
or a researcher doing
accurate experiments in the lab.

129
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:51,161
So this is not fully exhaustive,
but it is a set of ontologies we use

130
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,455
to annotate our data
in the context of neuro science.

131
00:08:56,677 --> 00:09:00,352
So here just to tie it all together
and show you that we have

132
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,729
a central place where
you can actually

133
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,706
introspect all these ontologies.

134
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:08,298
We have what we call
the ontology viewer.

135
00:09:08,477 --> 00:09:12,027
So if you open this
with an application

136
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:16,554
you can list all the ontologies
currently available and integrated

137
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,435
into the platform.

138
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:21,397
And so here we have regrouped them
by logical topics

139
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:24,131
so we have a number
of parcellation schemes

140
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:29,804
and you can see,
if I take the Waxholm Space

141
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:33,414
you can look into white matter.

142
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,339
So here, you can see
in the video the hierarchy

143
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:43,066
of this brain region
and the relations that

144
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:49,476
that region is further defined
by these three other sub-regions.

145
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:55,683
And through here you can
really introspect every ontology

146
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:57,021
we have done.

147
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:01,314
So if you want to have a look
at electrophysiology

148
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,963
it has a parent term that
is physiological data

149
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:08,425
and here you have
the specific data set

150
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:10,723
category that allows
you to define:

151
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:15,001
"This data set is
an electrophysiology recording."

152
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:18,111
The nice thing you
can do with that is that 

153
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:22,700
if you have used this vocabulary
to describe your data

154
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:26,214
and you're interested in,
not only electrophysiology

155
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,820
but also, say,
functional imaging

156
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:32,776
you could leverage
the hierarchy of this ontology

157
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:37,832
for instance, by using the term
"physiological data"

158
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:41,027
and the system is intelligent
enough to know that

159
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:44,711
because you have annotated with
"electrophysiology" it knows

160
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:49,287
that electrophysiology is a sub-type
of physiological data

161
00:10:49,513 --> 00:10:51,488
and so it will retrieve
from the system

162
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:54,644
all electrophysiology,
as well as functional imaging

163
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:57,450
effective connectivity,
and functional connectivity.

164
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:59,442
So you can really leverage the power

165
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,330
of ontologies
and more abstract concepts

166
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:05,515
to make interesting
scientific questions.
