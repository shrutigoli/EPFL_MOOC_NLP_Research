1
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:08,722
I will be talking in this session
about ontologies.

2
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:10,626
So, what are ontologies

3
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:12,695
and why are they useful
for neuroscience?

4
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:17,304
Well, ontology actually comes
from two Greek words

5
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:20,492
“onto” for existence
or being real

6
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:24,037
and “logia” for science
or study.

7
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:25,641
So, ontology is really

8
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:28,533
the science of what
exists or is real.

9
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:36,036
So, an ontology is actually
a formal representation

10
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:39,005
of knowledge
about a specific set

11
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,484
of entities or concepts.

12
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:42,502
That is how we use it
in Computer science

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,538
it is much more of a schema,
it is a controlled vocabulary.

14
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:51,756
In fact, ontologies can provide
several different useful tools

15
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:54,330
for organizing data
and expressing knowledge.

16
00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:57,930
For one, it is providing
a controlled vocabulary

17
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:01,815
for referring to
a set of specific

18
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:03,570
entities or concepts

19
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:08,129
it also contains the relationships
between these entities

20
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:11,470
and it defines
specific properties

21
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,237
of these entities
as well, it can.

22
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:15,831
And those are
important things

23
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:19,836
in how do we structure
and express concepts

24
00:01:19,836 --> 00:01:22,024
their properties,
and their relationships.

25
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,180
That is really what
an ontology is for.

26
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,953
So, and ontology for
a brain region

27
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:31,958
it is actually quite important
that it provides

28
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,756
a 3D boundary but
linked to a specific name

29
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:39,579
and the relationship to
any sub-structures

30
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:45,335
or any parent structure,
so the ontology used

31
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:47,313
for the Allen Brain
Institute Atlas started

32
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,032
from the Swanson
ontology

33
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:54,016
and they really used this
to capture, for example

34
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:56,286
the structures
within the cortex

35
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:58,599
the sub-structures,
and the relationship of,

36
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:02,145
for example,
the cortex to the diencephalon.

37
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:07,485
So, it is using both data
structures for describing

38
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:10,986
the 3D boundary but also
within the standard space

39
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:14,489
linking these regions to
a standard name

40
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,095
and then abbreviation.

41
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:19,708
For the data set used in
the Blue Brain project

42
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,922
used for the initial
Somatosensory cortex model.

43
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:27,028
There is a large
variety of data

44
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:29,526
from many
different aspects

45
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,210
including
electrophysiological data

46
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,054
per-synaptic responses,
gene expression

47
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:36,912
morphological data,
and you have got to organize

48
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:39,615
that by actually annotating
the structure with

49
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:42,667
structured ontologies
in order to understand

50
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,053
how do you want to
build a model of these

51
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:48,851
what are the key entities,
what are their relationships

52
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,341
and what are their properties
that you’re modeling.

53
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:54,043
So, we had to develop
ontologies

54
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:57,099
for neuron morphologies

55
00:02:57,494 --> 00:03:02,776
and we identified fifty-five
morphological types.

56
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:05,913
Here, this picture shows
the different types

57
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:08,537
of neurons on the left,
you see the interneurons

58
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:10,776
the inhibitory interneurons,
and on the right

59
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:12,765
are the excitatory
parameter cells

60
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:18,766
and stellate cells,
and each one has a name.

61
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:22,545
Currently you see,
at the top of the column

62
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:25,679
the abbreviations,
but for example

63
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:29,358
you have got a layer one
neurogliaform cell

64
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:36,247
so in layer one
the NGC cell is listed

65
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,142
the layer five
Martinotti cell.

66
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:41,596
Layer five thick tough
parameter cell type one

67
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,614
and these names are
used to characterize

68
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,159
the specific properties of
neuron morphologies

69
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:50,250
and that is useful
for organizing

70
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,004
and being consistent
with how you refer

71
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:57,408
to different types of neurons
within this particular brain region.

72
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,834
The Blue Brain Ontologies
for Electrical Types

73
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:04,517
actually is based on
the Berthier classification

74
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:10,455
and that means defining
how does the cell fire initially

75
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:14,069
so the initial firing type,
there is a burst

76
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,564
a continuous,
or a delay

77
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:18,781
and you can see this
in the example traces

78
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:24,457
where maybe initially there is
a short high frequency burst

79
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,628
and other cells start
off immediately

80
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,430
firing without a burst

81
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,662
or there is maybe
a delay in starting

82
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:35,550
the firing response from
the current injection.

83
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:38,580
Similarly, for the sustained
firing tether a different type

84
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:43,304
some cells adapt whether their
inter-spike interval decreases

85
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,596
some are non-adapting
where their

86
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,429
inter-spike interval
remains constant

87
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:50,079
some are fast spiking,
so they have deeper

88
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,318
after hyper-polarization and
they fire in higher frequencies

89
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:55,256
and some are
irregular spiking

90
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:57,832
where their
inter-spike interval

91
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,148
may be quite variable.

92
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:01,705
And so out of those
for the cells in

93
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:05,570
the somatosensory cortex
haindling region

94
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:08,159
we have identified
eleven electrical types

95
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:12,283
and those are the combinations
of initial firing type

96
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:14,144
and sustained firing type.

97
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:18,266
That forms the ontology for
electrical types in Blue Brain.

98
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:21,844
And here is a table
from the 2015.

99
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:24,738
cell paper authored
by Markam et. al.

100
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:28,504
which relates this
inter-neuron classes

101
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:31,315
to other cell properties
and cell types

102
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:33,708
described in the literature,
and for example

103
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,909
there are many
different ways

104
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,625
to talk about a cell type

105
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,969
many different
dimensions along

106
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:41,284
which you can
characterize

107
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,454
Those include,
for example

108
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:46,736
proteins that are
expressed in the cell

109
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:49,595
so molecular markers,
electrical types

110
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:51,629
as we have seen from
the electrical properties

111
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:54,155
the morphological properties,
the morphological shapes

112
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:58,233
but there are many others,
including the projections target

113
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:00,893
where do these cells
target within the brain

114
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,971
or which types of cells
do they receive from.

115
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:07,407
There are many possible ways,
but we choose specifically

116
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:11,344
to characterize cells based
on their morphology

117
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,252
and electro-physiology.

118
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:15,769
Now that does
have a relationship

119
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:17,899
to specific
molecular markers

120
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,975
and that is very useful
for interfacing

121
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:22,139
with very
described properties

122
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,594
and also, we use gene
expression information

123
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:28,595
to identify which types
of ion channels

124
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:31,969
are present within
a particular cell type.

125
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,488
And so the morpho-electric
cell type ontology

126
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,842
actually combines which
of the morphology types

127
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:43,701
the M types, combine
with the electrical type

128
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:47,974
so this is really combining
those two ontologies

129
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,202
that we talked about earlier,
to create a new one

130
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,062
where there are 207

131
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,330
morpho-electric
types of cells.

132
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:59,615
And we have data on
how many of those occur

133
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:01,552
how many of each of those
possibilities happen.

134
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:03,952
Now all combinations
of all morphologies

135
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:06,639
and all electrical
types do not occur.

136
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,421
So it is just the common
subset, which is 207.

137
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,766
The connections between
these cells are actually

138
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:18,205
defined by different
types of synapses

139
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,544
and there are specific
properties that govern

140
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:22,058
these synapses

141
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:24,901
and we have got
inhibitory synapses

142
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,184
and excitatory and
these are ignite

143
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:29,300
by different
neuro transmitters.

144
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,028
They also occur
with specific kinetics

145
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:37,030
which are facilitating,
depressing, or pseudo-linear

146
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,542
between specific types
of pre-synaptic cells

147
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:44,780
and post-synaptic cell,
and those pre-synaptic types

148
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,215
are morpho-electric types.

149
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:47,301
So, we have got a map of

150
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,074
synapse types
defined according
So, we have got a map of

151
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:49,406
synapse types
defined according

152
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:53,617
to pre-synaptic
morpho-electric class

153
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:57,238
of cell and the post-synaptic
morpho-electric class

154
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:00,599
and then identified by
the specific kinetics

155
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:03,226
of that synapse,
either facilitating

156
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:04,847
depressing,
pseudo-linear

157
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:06,833
inhibitory,
or excitatory

158
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:10,175
and those are
very key to

159
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:13,455
the definition of this
synapse ontology.

160
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:16,392
Finally, in defining
the micro circuits

161
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:19,595
there is a number of
specific properties

162
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:21,705
that we have defined
to describe

163
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:23,876
a somatosensory
cortex micro-circuit

164
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,707
and we see that in general
these same properties can

165
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,473
be used to describe

166
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:31,581
micro-circuits
throughout the brain.

167
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:34,611
First of all, you have got to have
a volume boundary

168
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,895
You need to know the minimal
boundary sufficient

169
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:40,846
to create a complete micro-circuit,
and in this case

170
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:43,241
we used the saturation of

171
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,065
the dendritic density
to define that.

172
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:47,876
You have got to
know the cell types

173
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:49,910
that I have described earlier

174
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,507
in terms of
morphological types

175
00:08:51,507 --> 00:08:53,053
and the electro-physiological
types

176
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:55,172
and their combinations
to make

177
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:57,985
morpho-electric types,
the total cell count

178
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:01,337
and then the distribution,
where of the ME types

179
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:04,142
where of these
Morpho-electric cells

180
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:06,285
Morpho-electric types of cells.

181
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:08,457
Where are they distributed,
in which density

182
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:11,692
in which distribution
throughout that volume?

183
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,861
And then the synapse
type maps

184
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:16,475
so you’re combining a number
of ontologies into

185
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:18,001
the definition of
the micro-circuit.

186
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:22,040
And then, finally,
a type specific bouton density

187
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,321
is actually critical to making
a functional conversion

188
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:27,379
to the number
of synapse

189
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:29,171
to the actually
number of synapses.

190
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:30,986
So, in this session
you have learned

191
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,409
about what is an ontology

192
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:36,857
how are ontologies used in
the data driven modeling

193
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:39,159
and some examples
of ontologies

194
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:40,880
in the Blue Brain project.
