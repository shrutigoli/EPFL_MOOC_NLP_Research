So, to conclude, in this session, we've been learning a number of things.
First, we've been learning how to design a specific domain to capture a very concrete use case.
This is the one really you're going to be executing as part of a grade exercise this week.
We've been defining the program's pattern, but we have also been defining all the entities necessary, and the specific properties that will enable you to ask all the questions that the scientists want to be able to answer.
We've integrated relevant ontologies as part of this domain.
And finally, we've really ensured that the domain we have built together can answer all the questions that our scientists wanted to answer.
Thank you very much.
