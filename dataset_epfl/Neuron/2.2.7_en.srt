1
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:10,810
So, in this slide we're going
to look deeper into ontologies.

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,631
So, Sean has already given you
basic information

3
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:18,972
about what ontologies are
and we will not expand on this.

4
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:22,848
What I'm really interested
in doing here is to show you

5
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:26,513
for the domain of neuroscience
which ontologies we have decided

6
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:30,129
to integrate in our Blue Brain Nexus
platform.

7
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:36,903
So, a lot of the ontologies we have
integrated have been either taken

8
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:42,183
from the Neuroscience Information
Framework co-developed with them.

9
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:49,120
The goal of NIF is to define
these concepts

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,541
for them in neuroscience and share
them so the community can re-use them

11
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:59,384
and have a commun agreement to define
neuroscientific concepts.

12
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:03,617
They have defined
the NIF Standard Ontologies

13
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:06,426
which integrate a number
of existing ontologies

14
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:10,200
such as Uberon, for instance
to define brain regions

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,110
in manner that is agnostic
of which specimen

16
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,596
or species they come from.

17
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:23,102
Gabi for instance for description
of small molecules,

18
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:27,745
the gene ontology or Obi
and quite a few others.

19
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:31,698
Now in this part, here under,

20
00:01:31,898 --> 00:01:36,178
what I would like to illustrate
is a number of ontologies

21
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:40,025
we have decided to use
in the Brain Nexus platform

22
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,970
for the domain of neuroscience.

23
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,964
So, for instance, around
the specimens

24
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:50,646
we have the definition of species
and strain,

25
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:55,928
so this is really helping in defining
what kind of animal subject

26
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:59,998
that was, so these two we haven't 
created ourselves:

27
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:08,512
this is part of the NSBI taxonomy.

28
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:14,312
And so it is, when dealing
with ontologies, really important

29
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:19,946
to do enough research to find
out : are there any vocabularies

30
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:22,155
already existing in the community

31
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,381
so that we can just leverage them.

32
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:28,911
It really would be a waste of time
first to reinvent what is already

33
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:31,537
working and well accepted
by the community,

34
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:36,119
but is also a strong advantage
in using and re-using these

35
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,489
these already defined vocabularies.

36
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:42,938
And very simply if someone
describes rats

37
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:47,116
with a very specific concept
and you have also defined

38
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:51,349
rats with again that same concept
so then even though you're storing

39
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,672
your data in different places
they become compatible:

40
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:58,408
You know that what you call a rat
is also what they call a rat.

41
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:02,653
And so, if, for instance,
in your lab you deal with

42
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:06,688
electrophysiology only,
and that other person deals only

43
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:11,271
with morphology, the data,
at least, is compatible

44
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:17,043
at the level of the species
and it is very clear to deduce

45
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:19,814
from the use of the vocabulary
you have chosen.

46
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:23,321
And then next one will just be...

47
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:28,587
Yeah, a vocabulary to define the sex
of the specimen-male, female.

48
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:34,178
Then we have a number of ontologies
for the description of datasets,

49
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:38,659
so we have the category, so what
kind of dataset is it,

50
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:44,284
is it an electrophysiology, morphology,
image, imagery data?

51
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:49,601
This specific data format
that is used to serialize

52
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:53,241
this data, the raw data
when you save it on your disc

53
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,903
there's a concrete format
that you have chosen

54
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,308
and so there's a way to metadata
to describe this.

55
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:03,032
This becomes very important
if you look for electrophysiology

56
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:06,386
in a very specific format because
you have a work that requires it

57
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:09,751
you can then filter that though
in a platform and only get those

58
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:13,397
that match and will be compatible
with what you're trying to achieve.

59
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:18,218
Next, we have a license ontology
which allows us to define

60
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,568
who can re-use the data
you're publishing into the platform.

61
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:24,735
So, do not underestimate this one.

62
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:28,702
If you decide that your data cannot
be re-used for commercial purpose

63
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,793
you can actually define it there.

64
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:34,810
Finally, we have the storage
of the dataset

65
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,987
and this is really a way to describe
where have you stored your data.

66
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:44,797
So it can be through the platform
in which case you don't really need

67
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:47,997
to know where it's configured,
you just have to know that the people

68
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:50,973
managing the platform have
configured it in a way that the data

69
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:54,173
is going to be backed up and is safe.

70
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:58,008
But if you were to store the data
on a next storage

71
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,208
to the platform, here we have
an ontology to actually allow you

72
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:04,601
to describe this, so you can easily
define the data.

73
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:09,489
For instance, it is store in a cloud
in Amazon and you can define that.

74
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:13,466
Then we have the concept
of sample classification

75
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,702
which is really important to us,

76
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:19,640
because from a lot of the datasets
we are integrating

77
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,439
scientists take the time to make
statements on the entities

78
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,100
that we integrate, neurons
for instance,

79
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,825
and it will give them electric types,
morphology types.

80
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:40,211
And so we have the design ontology
that allows that description.

81
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:45,530
Finally, another way to classify
them is to define what kind

82
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,542
of neurotransmitters, some entities
are also as another kind of ontology,

83
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:52,140
but we won't be getting
to the details of it here.

84
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,400
A lot of the data we integrate
really makes sense when

85
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,347
we anchor it in specific
brain spaces.

86
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:09,833
So, we have a number of existing
brain atlases that are references

87
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:15,426
for specific species whether
it is Allen mouse CCFv3

88
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,596
or Waxholm for the rats.

89
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:25,558
We have an ontology that defines
the logical reference

90
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:29,562
for these spaces and this can
be annotated on the level

91
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:32,162
of a dataset, for instance.

92
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:39,217
More detailed in that concept

93
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:43,319
is the parcellation schemes,
so here we enter still within

94
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,490
the concept of anchoring data
into an atlas,

95
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,015
now we want to actually talk about
in which specific region

96
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:56,705
of an atlas your dataset
is to be anchored.

97
00:06:56,905 --> 00:07:02,319
And so, different atlas spaces
come with parcellation schemes

98
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,569
where anatomists have just looked
at these spaced and defined

99
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:13,559
the subvolumes of this space
that corresponds to specific

100
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,553
brain regions or brain parcels.

101
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:19,277
And so we have three here,

102
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:23,218
which are put as examples,
we have actually quite a few others

103
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:28,955
and these define again
vocabulary to describe

104
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:30,117
these brain regions,

105
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:34,872
but they are really specific
to that very specific atlas space.

106
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:41,284
Finally, we have some ontologies
that are really linked

107
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:46,789
more to the provenance concepts
that really allows to then reach it.

108
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:50,920
So, for instance, we have the type
of the activity run,

109
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,947
whether these experimental type
run in a lab

110
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:57,147
or a computational task,
you know, simply run

111
00:07:57,347 --> 00:08:02,146
in a computer or a classification
activity, so you have these

112
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:06,844
very short vocabularies that really
enable you to describe

113
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:12,622
the activity you want to define
and later on filter

114
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:15,737
through the semantic searches.

115
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:18,383
Then we have measurement methods

116
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,851
so another ontology to describe
the kind of message you've applied

117
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,349
to generate new entities.

118
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:31,455
And finally, the role of the agents
involved in a given activity:

119
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:35,087
whether it was the principal
investigator of a project

120
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:41,195
or researcher doing the actual
experiments in the lab.

121
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:50,714
So, this is not fully exorstive
but it is a set of ontologies we use

122
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:56,014
to annotate our data in the context
of neuroscience.

123
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:59,547
So here, just to tie
it altogether and show you

124
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,429
that we have a central place
where you can actually introspect

125
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:08,285
all these ontologies, we have
what we call the Ontology Viewer.

126
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:14,664
So, if you open this web application
you can list all the ontologies

127
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:18,325
currently available and integrated
into the platform.

128
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,525
And so here we have regrouped
them by logical topics,

129
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:24,018
so we have a number of parcellation
schemes

130
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:29,550
and you can see, if I take
the Waxholm space

131
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,976
you can look into white matter
and...

132
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:40,449
so here you can see there is video
hierarchy of this brain region

133
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:49,241
and relation is that that region is further
defined by these three other subregions.

134
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:55,801
And you can through here really
introspect every ontologies

135
00:09:56,001 --> 00:10:01,193
we have done, so if you want
to have a look at electrophysiology

136
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,759
it has a parent term that
is physiologycal data.

137
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,035
And here you have the specific
dataset category

138
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:14,011
that allows you to define all, this
dataset is electrophysiology recording

139
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:19,435
The nice thing you can do
with that is that if you have used

140
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,549
this vocabulary
to describe your data

141
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:27,494
and you're interested in not only
electrophysiology, but also, say,

142
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:31,980
functional imaging, you could
leverage to hierarchy

143
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,608
of this ontology by, for instance,
using the term Physiologycal Data

144
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:40,731
and the system is intelligent
enough to know that's

145
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,359
because you have annotated
with electrophysiology

146
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,407
it knows that electrophysiology
is a subtype of Physiologycal Data

147
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,608
and so it will pull back
from the system

148
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,547
all electrophysiology as well as
function imaging,

149
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:57,554
effective connectivity
and functional connectivity.

150
00:10:57,754 --> 00:11:01,175
So you can really leverage the power
of ontologies and more abstract

151
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:05,703
concepts to make interesting
scientific questions.
