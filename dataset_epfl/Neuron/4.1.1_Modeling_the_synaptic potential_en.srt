1
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:08,153
Ok, so I promised you that
we'll go to the synaptic potential

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,097
and here it is

3
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:11,517
so let me give you
a little description

4
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:13,458
of what is a synaptic potential.

5
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:16,072
I already drew
synaptic potentials for you

6
00:00:16,272 --> 00:00:19,085
but now I want to
go into more detail.

7
00:00:19,337 --> 00:00:22,775
So if you zoom in using
an electron microscope

8
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:25,843
on the left part of the slide

9
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:29,043
you will see a piece of a
dendrite here...

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,192
And zoom in and you see
all these dendritic spines

11
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:41,154
one dendritic spine,
another dendritic spine

12
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:45,038
and you can see here,
schematically, an axon.

13
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:47,978
So you have to think
of this dendritic tree

14
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:50,731
with many little spines
and an axon

15
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:55,874
like an electrical fire,
where a wire goes through the tree

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,410
continues elsewhere

17
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:00,150
but sometimes while
going through the tree

18
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:02,901
it, sort of speak, touches
but not physically

19
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:04,440
as I will show in a second

20
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,018
but it comes very, very close
to a dendritic spine.

21
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:12,328
And there in these dendritic spines
there is this thing that we call

22
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:16,453
synapse, between the axon
and the dendritic spine.

23
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:19,695
So let's look here,
this is a high resolution

24
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,410
electron microscope of an axon,
this is an axon here

25
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:32,110
and this is a dendritic spine
of cell B

26
00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:36,692
for this was an axon of cell A,
and this is a dendrite of cell B

27
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:38,373
or a spine of cell B

28
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,248
and between them, not touching,
there is a little space

29
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,375
it's called the synaptic cleft.

30
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,770
In the axon you see these vesicles,
you see one vesicle here

31
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:54,096
and another vesicle here,
a third vesicle here

32
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:56,892
and in the dendrite,
here in the dendritic spine

33
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:59,093
in the head of the dendritic spine

34
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:02,417
yes, here in this location,
the head of the dendritic spine

35
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:05,534
we know that there
are these receptors

36
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:08,794
for particular chemicals,
so here there will be a receptor

37
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:11,386
a receptor, a receptor,
a receptor,

38
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:15,489
and this receptor is sitting on
the membrane of the dendritic spine

39
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:18,704
waiting, sort of speak,
for the release of the transmitters

40
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:24,094
from the vesicles here,
in the axon.

41
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,515
So in the axon
there are these vesicles

42
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:31,868
full of neurotransmittors 

43
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:36,287
could be gaba,
one name of a transmitter,

44
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:40,591
could be glutamate,
another name of a transmitter,

45
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:44,356
inside here many thousands
of molecules of transmitters

46
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:46,665
are within these vesicles.

47
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,490
In the axon you know
that there are spikes always

48
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,819
and in the dendrite you know
there is a synaptic potential, here.

49
00:02:56,986 --> 00:02:57,711
Ok?

50
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:01,402
And the question is,
how does the spike in the axon

51
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,999
eventually generate
a synaptic potential

52
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:08,445
in the dendrite?

53
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,329
As I said,
they don't touch each other

54
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:13,505
so the spike cannot
go through electrically:

55
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:15,559
it's a chemical synapse,

56
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:18,414
so we are now talking about
the chemical synapse,

57
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:21,601
and this chemical synapse means

58
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:26,445
that there is a chemical substance
between the pre-synaptic side

59
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:29,026
which is the axon,
to the post-synaptic side

60
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:33,700
which is the dendrite,
and this chemical is really the one

61
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:35,926
which does the communication.

62
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:39,049
But in order for
the chemical to be released

63
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:43,987
we will need a spike in the axon
and this spike here that you see

64
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:48,634
when it arrives to this button,
to this pre-synaptic region

65
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:54,002
where you have all these vesicles,
these spikes in a miraculous process

66
00:03:54,208 --> 00:04:02,383
fuse the vesicle into the membrane
here and releases into the space

67
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:03,750
the transmitter.

68
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:07,879
So the spite is responsible
through a complicated process

69
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:10,785
to release, to fuse the vesicle into

70
00:04:10,973 --> 00:04:14,198
the pre-synaptic membrane
of the button and enable

71
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:18,705
the flow of this chemical
transmitter glutamate

72
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:24,802
into the space of the cleft between
the axon and the dendrite

73
00:04:24,993 --> 00:04:33,018
and some of these chemicals,
some of these molecules

74
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:39,221
are captured, bound to the receptor
in the post-synaptic side

75
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:44,119
and these receptors are really
behaving like ion channels

76
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:48,841
meaning that when they are
bound by the transmitter

77
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,875
these ion channels in
the post-synaptic membrane

78
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,617
start to open,
and here again

79
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:57,008
you have current flow.

80
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,362
So to summarize what I said,
you have an axon of cell A

81
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:06,555
an action potential arrives here

82
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:12,784
and it causes the release,
the fusion of this vesicle,

83
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,990
and the release
of this neurotransmitter.

84
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:19,851
In the post-synaptic side,
in the dendritic spine

85
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,701
you have these receptors,
here is a receptor,

86
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:29,578
that is very particularly sensitive
to the presence of this chemical.

87
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:34,677
Let's say, glutamite, acetylcholine,
dopamine, serotonin,

88
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:38,811
depending which transmitter
is being released from the axon

89
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,998
but after it is being released

90
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:43,909
it bind to the receptor

91
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:52,664
and when the receptor is bound,
there is a channel being open

92
00:05:52,905 --> 00:05:56,305
and through this ion channel,
there is a current flow.

93
00:05:56,495 --> 00:06:00,032
So what I just told you is that,
now we are speaking about

94
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:02,539
different types of channels
in the dendrites.

95
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,412
I am talking about
the post-synaptic side

96
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,110
this side here,
the sides with the receptors

97
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:11,614
and I'm saying that when there is

98
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,811
a transmitter binding
to the receptors

99
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:19,463
these receptors behave as a channel,
or attached to a channel

100
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:23,094
and this ion channel,
which we already know, opens

101
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,558
but in this case, these ion channels are 
not voltage dependent (like in the case

102
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,363
of the spike in the axon but they are 
transmitter dependent, chemical dependent,

103
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:38,731
so these are chemical synapses
and these are chemical receptors

104
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:42,543
and these channels
are chemically sensitive.

105
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:45,303
So now I'm talking about
the different types of channels

106
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:50,559
in the dendrites, but again,
these ion channels, when open

107
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:53,458
will change the voltage here.

108
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:56,688
If a positive current flows
because they're open

109
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:59,068
we will get a positive current.

110
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:05,077
If a positive current flows outside
you will get a negative voltage.

111
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:09,399
Ok? So that's the origin
of synaptic potential,

112
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:15,701
and now I'm going to talk about
the model, the mathematical model,

113
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,583
the electrical circuit
and the mathematical model

114
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,180
of the post-synaptic potential,
the potential in the dendrite.

115
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,341
So first, let's look at
the equivalent cylinder

116
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:29,686
so as I drew before,
as Hodgkins Huxley did

117
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:34,206
they drew the electrical circuit
of the post-synaptic region.

118
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:38,294
Now I'm drawing for you
the electrical circuit

119
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:41,511
of the postsynaptic membrane here.

120
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:46,059
What do we have here,
in the post-synaptic membrane?

121
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:50,762
Again we have the same
thing that we saw before.

122
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:55,421
We have some channels,
we call it G-synapse:

123
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,527
the conductance
of the ion channels

124
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:01,024
that are sensitive
to the transmitter.

125
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:04,913
In this case, they will
be dependent on time.

126
00:08:05,102 --> 00:08:06,499
Why on time ?

127
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:11,217
Because when, for a given time,
there is a transmitter in the cleft

128
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:16,731
they will open, and then this
transmitter will be taken away

129
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:20,745
which happens due
to certain mechanism

130
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:24,142
we don't want the transmitter
to stay there too long

131
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:29,949
so it is released from the vesicles,
it is bound to the receptors

132
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,293
and after some times it goes out.

133
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,554
So I'm writing here,
I'll write it again.

134
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:42,262
I'll have more space,
it will be the synaptic conductance

135
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:53,758
which depends on the opening
of the post-synaptic ion channels

136
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:58,287
which will give you a conductance
that will depend on the transmitter.

137
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:02,887
It's time dependent,
and transmitter dependent

138
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:05,641
T is for time, but you can
think about this

139
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:08,996
as the Transmitter also,
and this will be attached

140
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:13,897
to particular battery because it
will depend on which ion will flow.

141
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:17,871
Will it be chloride ion,
sodium ion, potassium ion?

142
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:22,129
So this battery is
the synaptic battery.

143
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:25,970
It will depend on the ion type

144
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,165
or ions that might flow
through this channel.

145
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:33,661
So this Nernst's equation
of the conductance equation

146
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,953
which is the extension of
the Nernst equation

147
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:38,719
will describe this battery
as we did for the resting potential

148
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,003
but in this case,
it will be a battery

149
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,210
that will describe
the battery of the synapse

150
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:47,498
due to the opening
of the new synaptic channels.

151
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:50,045
Ok, this is the inside of the cell

152
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,240
as before,
this is the outside of the cell

153
00:09:55,986 --> 00:10:01,161
You have also other channels here,
so these are the resting channels

154
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:04,477
so the membrane of the spine
also has these other channels

155
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,937
that are neither voltage

156
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:12,706
nor chemically sensitive and
you have the resting potential here

157
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:19,172
which is negative inside, let's call it
E-rest, about -70, let's say,

158
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:27,563
and here you have the capacitor C.

159
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:32,453
Okay, so this has to be closed.

160
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:37,557
So this particular branch

161
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,869
the synaptic branch

162
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:45,935
is typically closed.

163
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:48,302
Why? Because there are
no transmitters.

164
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,615
And if there are no transmitters,
this branch doesn't function

165
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,762
because the conductance doesn't open

166
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:57,750
there is no current flow
due to no transmitter.

167
00:10:57,963 --> 00:11:02,188
But as soon as there is
a transmitter this one is closed

168
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:07,841
meaning that you have a new
channel or channels being open

169
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:09,281
due to the transmitter. 

170
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:13,287
So this is the circuit which is
actually much simpler than

171
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:16,148
the Hodgkin-Huxley excitable
membrane circuit,

172
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:19,336
this is for the synaptic,
post-synaptic membrane circuit.

173
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:24,409
A very simple circuit
and you can solve it mathematically,

174
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:27,599
for example
if the synaptic conductance

175
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:35,535
is a step current like this,
G-synapse, let's say that

176
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:38,722
it opens for a brief time
when there is a transmitter, 

177
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:43,022
and then it closes, then I can

178
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:46,222
easily solve this circuit.

179
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:50,936
Ok, so let's see,
we are now writing

180
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:54,154
the equation for the post-synaptic
potential.

181
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,802
So the post synaptic potential will
be the voltage that will develop

182
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:01,998
between the two sides
of the membrane, V.

183
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:07,496
So I want to say that first of all
the current, the membrane current, 

184
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,856
total membrane current,
through the membrane

185
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,207
which is the sum of all currents,
is the sum of the synaptic current

186
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:31,820
plus the passive or resting
leak current, plus C(dv/dt), ok,

187
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:38,823
and now I'm writing down
particularly the different currents

188
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:45,340
so the synaptic current itself
will be G-synapse multiplied 

189
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:49,710
by V minus E-synapse.

190
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:53,356
And again V is
the membrane potential

191
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:56,554
that I actually want to compute,
because this will be the potential

192
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,189
generated by the opening
of this conductance,

193
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:10,681
plus G =-rest multiplied
by V minus E-rest plus C(dv/dt).

194
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:15,450
Ok?

195
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:22,807
And now, in order to solve it,
to get the real synaptic voltage,

196
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:26,026
we'll call it, let's say,
V-synapse,

197
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:35,386
I can say that this V-synapse
is actually the following equation

198
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:37,313
which we already know
because it is

199
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:39,796
the conductance equation that
I showed you before,

200
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:45,079
but in this case it is
G-synapse multiplied

201
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,570
by E-synapse

202
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:51,103
plus G-rest multiplied by-E rest

203
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:58,613
divided by G-synapse plus G-rest

204
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,808
So this will be the study state case.

205
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:05,443
If there would not have
been any capacitant here

206
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:13,521
this will be the steady state
synaptic voltage after changing

207
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,016
this conductance.

208
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:20,048
So this will be again a competition,
between the battery of the synapse

209
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:23,841
the resting battery here and
the ratio between the conductances

210
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:26,774
so let's say if
the synaptic conductance

211
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:29,963
is very, very strong relative
to the resting conductance

212
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:34,913
then the voltage will be close
to the battery of the synapse 

213
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:40,404
If let's say, if the conductance
of the synapse is purely sodium

214
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:46,507
then each synapse will be E and A,
the Nerst potential for sodium

215
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:51,761
and the voltage of the synapse will
reach +60mV which doesn't happen

216
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:55,764
but it could've happened if
it was a channel only for sodium.

217
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:59,509
But here, we also have here,
because of the conductance here

218
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:03,680
capacitance here you also have
something that is time dependent

219
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:13,865
and it looks something like that,
minus G-synapse plus G-rest

220
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:21,950
T divided by C.

221
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:28,835
So actually, this is the solution
for this equation which is

222
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,039
a simple electrical equation
using Kirchhoff law

223
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:38,886
and this tells you that if you
activate the synaptic conductance

224
00:15:39,082 --> 00:15:43,107
you will get a voltage change, which 
we called V-synapse that starts at 

225
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:50,717
the resting potential, let's say 
-70mV and here you activate

226
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,899
this location
let's say G synapse

227
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:56,393
and then you get
some synaptic potential

228
00:15:56,613 --> 00:16:04,175
that will grow as long
as you have synaptic conductance

229
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,504
but when you close the 
synaptic conductance,

230
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:09,146
it will go back to the resting potential.

231
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:12,565
This will be your
synaptic potential.

232
00:16:13,475 --> 00:16:15,612
In this case, the synaptic battery

233
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:18,798
is positive relative
to the resting potential.

234
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:23,177
If you would activate,
let's say from here this location

235
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:29,924
another synapse,
which opens potassium channels

236
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:34,092
then you will get this signal.

237
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:39,195
This signal we called
"excitatory synaptic potential"

238
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:46,328
it tends to depolarize the membrane,
make the -70 less negative

239
00:16:46,535 --> 00:16:51,910
and this potential they call it
"inhibitory post-synaptic potential"

240
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:56,852
which makes the -70 more negative 

241
00:16:57,052 --> 00:17:00,052
let's say to -75

242
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:06,592
This is the inhibitory
post-synaptic potential.

243
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,425
So you have two types of synapses

244
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:10,676
the excitatory
post-synaptic potentials

245
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:15,578
the excitatory synapses which
are particular sets of synapses

246
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,761
actually all the synapses,
or most of the synapses, not all,

247
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,971
most of the synapses that
contact the dendritic spines

248
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:25,175
tend to be of the excitatory type.

249
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:27,846
This means that
the battery associated with

250
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,467
these particular synapses 
in the post-synaptic membrane

251
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:35,561
is a positive battery relative
to rest, this positive battery

252
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,469
when the battery is expressed
because a channel is open

253
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:42,265
then you will have
a positive voltage

254
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:46,326
and EPSP, "excitatory
post-synaptic potential",

255
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:49,555
this will be this fellow here,

256
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,550
and in other locations,
other synapses may contact

257
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,520
with the dendrite, not the spine,
but directly with the dendrite

258
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:03,096
when they open they
open ion channels typically

259
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:06,307
either for chloride
or for potassium

260
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:09,893
and this will carry the resting potential
to a more negative region

261
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:13,111
this will be the inhibitory synapses.

262
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:16,298
They will cause inhibitory
post-synaptic potential.

263
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:20,373
I just told you that there is
this mechanism of

264
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:22,937
this synaptic potentials which 
heavily relies 

265
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:29,672
on the presence of ion channels
in the dendrites that are sensitive

266
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:33,110
to chemical, to transmitter

267
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:35,812
that is released from the 
pre-synaptic side

268
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:38,326
bound into the post-synaptic receptor

269
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:40,960
open ion channels, and then

270
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:43,826
it depends of which ion channels are open.

271
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:47,599
If these ion channels carry
inward positive current

272
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:50,888
this will generate positive potential,
excitatory post-synaptic potential

273
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:54,084
excitatory post-synaptic potential

274
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:59,125
and if it will carry let's say,
potassium channel from 

275
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:02,362
the inside to outside it will 
make the inside more negative,

276
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:05,576
this will cause an IPSP

277
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
an inhibitory
post-synaptic potential.

278
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,984
So you have the synapse,
but you have two types

279
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:14,193
of potentials using
the same principal mechanism

280
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,741
depending on which
ion channels are open.

281
00:19:16,964 --> 00:19:18,288
So again the whole trick.

282
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:21,485
like in the spike or channels were sensitive 
to voltage,

283
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:26,151
and they open due to voltage,
so these are the excitable channels

284
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:27,561
in the axon

285
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:32,288
in the dendrite you have
chemical dependent channels

286
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:36,007
but basically you have
two types of ion channels

287
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:41,226
one that tends to bring
positive current into the cell

288
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:42,483
and this will be called

289
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:44,734
the excitatory
post-synaptic potential

290
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:48,889
and those that will carry
positive current from insidep

291
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:52,843
to outside and will make the inside
more negative

292
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,083
this will be the inhibitor
post synaptic potential.

293
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,925
The mechanism is the same, but now
it depends on chemical transmittors.

294
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:03,084
And that's the beauty of the neuron.

295
00:20:03,263 --> 00:20:07,713
In one region the dendritic tree
has the channels that are sensitive

296
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,044
to chemicals and these chemical are
being released by the nearby axons

297
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:17,458
through this
marvelous special device

298
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,549
that we call synapse,
and in the axon you have

299
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,770
the other type of channels
that are sensitive to voltage

300
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:27,088
and they generate the spike.

301
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:30,287
So let us summarize

302
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:33,426
through the equations.

303
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:38,303
You have a synaptic current
that depends on

304
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:43,639
the synaptic conductance
and on the battery of

305
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:46,038
the respective conductance.

306
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:48,025
It could be a battery that
is more negative than

307
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:51,227
rest or more positive
than rest.

308
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:55,432
It will be inhibitory
or excitatory synapses.

309
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:58,631
So I want to go now
to describe our way

310
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:01,835
of describing
the conductance of a synapse.

311
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:05,094
So I mentioned that this time
dependent conductance

312
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:10,079
of the synapse depends
of the transmitter in the cleft

313
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:12,033
that bound to receptors.

314
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:15,358
And we think about this binding
of receptors are when you bind

315
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:18,614
the channel opens
and then when the channel gets rid, 

316
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:23,752
sort of speak, of the transmitter

317
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:25,547
then there is less
and less conductance

318
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,992
and you can describe it as follows.

319
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:37,612
They say that the synaptic
conductance has some peak value

320
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,007
and some normalization parameter N

321
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:45,347
and then we describe it
mathematically

322
00:21:45,657 --> 00:21:50,582
with a good description,
as I will show you in a second.

323
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:01,724
So these parts are supposed
to be describing the rise

324
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:06,191
of the synaptic conductance,
and this part is supposed to

325
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:09,783
describe the decay of
the synaptic conductance with time,

326
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:14,576
and if you look at this equation,
it looks like something like this.

327
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,852
So the conductance
of the synapse looks

328
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:21,995
something like this, so this is
the synaptic conductance G-synapse

329
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:28,564
this is the peak synaptic
conductance G-peak

330
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:32,913
which, by the way, can be,
just to give you numbers

331
00:22:33,192 --> 00:22:36,192
it could be something of
the order of 1nS,

332
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:39,795
it's a very small
conductance locally.

333
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:45,287
And this is one way to
think about the conductance.

334
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:51,624
And in the case of EPSP or IPSP,
this particular conductance

335
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:56,650
depending on which battery,
will generate different directions

336
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,384
of voltage change.

337
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:02,260
So in the case of G of EPSP,
this synaptic conductance

338
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:08,749
that I just described,
is associated with the battery

339
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:14,838
that is positive relative to rest,
let's say that this is now

340
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:24,587
-10mV, this is the inside,
this is the outside

341
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:27,001
of the cell,

342
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:28,904
and of course there is the other

343
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:32,077
resting potential
and it's related battery

344
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:37,427
but this when current flows,
in this case it will flow from

345
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:40,626
outside to inside
then it will give

346
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:43,865
a voltage that will look like this

347
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,623
V-synapse.

348
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:49,789
This is what we
usually call the EPSP.

349
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,822
This is more positive than rest,
and in this case

350
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,012
it's the same conductance idea
exactly as before

351
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:06,355
but there is the synaptic
conductance G-synapse

352
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:11,266
but in this case, the battery
associated with the synapse

353
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:14,835
let's say potassium battery,
for example

354
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,511
yes, and this is the in,
and this is the out,

355
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:28,205
this will generate a negative
voltage, this will be an IPSP

356
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:31,417
inhibitory post-synaptic potential.

357
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:36,329
So that's all that you need to know,
you have the equation here

358
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:38,681
that describes well the opening

359
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:41,871
and the closing of
the synaptic channels,

360
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:44,408
and now you know that the opening

361
00:24:44,603 --> 00:24:46,435
and the closing of synaptic channels

362
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:49,854
will generate current flow
from inside to outside 

363
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:54,662
or from outside to inside and
this is expressed by the battery

364
00:24:54,879 --> 00:25:02,242
whether it's negative inside IPSP,
or a negative inside IPSP.

365
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:05,446
Excitetory synapses,
inhibitory synapses.

366
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:08,729
These are the two types
of synapses that you see.

367
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,321
So it's very interesting
to think about the dendrites

368
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:14,213
receiving two types of synapses 
converge on

369
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:15,454
the dendritic tree.

370
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:19,426
Some of the synapse locally
generate a positive voltage signal

371
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:25,506
the IPSP, some of the signals
converge locally also generate IPSP

372
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:30,261
a negative signal relative to rest
and this signals intermix between

373
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,560
themselves to generate the 
overall little things

374
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:37,057
that I drew before,
because if you record as I said

375
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:45,322
if you record from the dendrite here
you see EPSP, IPSP, EPSP, IPSP...

376
00:25:45,702 --> 00:25:48,977
so this is the voltage trace
that I drew before

377
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,347
but now you know that
it is composed of two synaptic types

378
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:57,765
the IPSPs, excitatory synapses,
the IPSP, and they inter-mingle

379
00:25:57,964 --> 00:26:03,727
integrate together and eventually
flow through the dendrite into

380
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,930
the other region, or the rest 
of the dendrite.

381
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:09,543
And this is what I need
to explain to you next.

382
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:13,504
Explain to you how the synaptic
potential are generated locally

383
00:26:13,894 --> 00:26:17,981
the spine head or locally that
dendritic side whether there

384
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,302
is a synaptic conduct
between axon and dendrite

385
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:25,550
now I need to explain to you
how this synaptic current

386
00:26:25,788 --> 00:26:31,576
and voltages merge together,
and flow everywhere in the dendrite

387
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:34,104
also including axon and the soma.

388
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:38,409
So to summarize this part.

389
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,943
Synapses are the connecting
sides between the axons of

390
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:48,311
pre-synaptic cell, cell A,
to the dendrite of

391
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:51,509
the post-synaptic cell, cell B.

392
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:59,088
When the spike reaches, arrives,
to the pre-synaptic side, the button

393
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:05,131
where you have these vesicles,
it releases, through a process,

394
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:09,253
the transmitter that is
embedded between the vesicle

395
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:16,262
into the synaptic cleft

396
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,313
a very narrow gap

397
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:24,546
and then it is being captured by
the receptors that are just sitting

398
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:27,771
opposite to the button.

399
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:33,266
So the button is here, the cleft of
the dendrite

400
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:35,333
the cleft is here and here there are

401
00:27:35,402 --> 00:27:38,210
these receptors,
so here I open a vesicle

402
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:43,502
and the vesicle is now bound
to the receptor.

403
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:47,256
When it binds to the receptor,
there are these specific ion channels

404
00:27:50,573 --> 00:27:54,223
either of potassiums, or of sodium,
or of chloride,

405
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:59,063
you already know these ions,
but this time 

406
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,857
so chemical dependent receptors.

407
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:05,041
chemical gated receptors.

408
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:08,212
So they are not excitable channels,
they are not voltage dependent

409
00:28:08,472 --> 00:28:10,139
but they are chemical dependent.

410
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:13,415
They can generate
the post synaptic potential.

411
00:28:13,615 --> 00:28:16,204
The post synaptic potential
in the dendrite

412
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,841
has two dimensions,
two sides.

413
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,699
It could be excitatory
post-synaptic potential

414
00:28:21,912 --> 00:28:25,199
which means the potential
moves more positively

415
00:28:25,446 --> 00:28:29,884
due to the corresponding battery
of this particular ion or ions

416
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:35,056
that are open due to the receptor,
or it could be an IPSP

417
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:37,316
inhibitory post-synaptic potential

418
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,320
again due to the corresponding battery.

419
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:44,175
So there is no miraculous difference

420
00:28:44,395 --> 00:28:46,932
between inhibitory
and excitatory synapses

421
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:51,676
the difference is which channels
are being open post-synapticly.

422
00:28:51,884 --> 00:28:54,521
We know today,
and that's very interesting

423
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:57,041
that in our cortex,
for example

424
00:28:57,221 --> 00:29:00,221
the excitatory transmitter
typically is the glutamate

425
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:02,218
not always, but glutamate

426
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:07,966
when it releases the pre-synaptic
side it tends to open ion channels

427
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:11,881
that let current flow through
them positively into the membrane

428
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:17,213
of the dendrite,
giving rise to the positive voltage:

429
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:19,470
Excitatory post-synaptic potential.

430
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:24,016
And gaba,
gamma-aminobutyric acid

431
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,563
is released from other axons
which we call inhibitory axons

432
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:35,899
these other axons release gaba,
gaba is bound to the receptor

433
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:39,598
of the post-synaptic cell,
dendrite of the same dendrite

434
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,305
but in another location

435
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,488
and this other location has receptors for

436
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:47,442
and these receptors for gaba are open

437
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:52,011
they may open ion channels,
potassium ion channels

438
00:29:52,197 --> 00:29:56,147
or chloride ion channels,
we call it gaba A and gaba B

439
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:59,347
anyway so these receptors carry
the voltage

440
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:04,583
to more negative relative to rest,
and this increased negativity

441
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:09,021
is expressed as inhibitory
post-synaptic potentials:

442
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:11,657
Inhibitory synapses.

443
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:16,998
Finally and very interestingly,
unlike the spike in the axon

444
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:19,487
which is an all or non phenomenon

445
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:23,431
so it's a digital phenomenon,
a zero-one phenomenon.

446
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:28,200
The synaptic potentials are graded,
analog phenomenon 

447
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:33,625
so a particular synapse could
become stronger if you want

448
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,722
or weaker if you want,
so the EPSP can became larger 

449
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:42,851
or smaller EPSP,
or smaller larger IPSP

450
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,688
depending for example,
on the density of receptors

451
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:50,400
in the post-synaptic membrane,
you have many receptors

452
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,882
than the same
amount of transmitters

453
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:54,836
binding to many receptors

454
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:58,889
will generate more current
and thus more voltage.

455
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:03,727
Or if there will be less
or maybe even no receptors

456
00:31:03,913 --> 00:31:07,276
then the release of the transmitter
will cause no voltage

457
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,165
in the post-synaptic membrane,
so it's a graded phenomenon

458
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,350
the EPSP and the IPSP are graded

459
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:17,586
they can attain
different voltage values

460
00:31:17,786 --> 00:31:22,152
1mV, 1.5mV, 2mV, and so forth

461
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:26,195
so it's graded, an analog signal
and this means that the dendrites

462
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:29,835
tend to carry analog
signals the synaptic potentials

463
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:34,615
the axon carries digital signals
which is the spiking activity

464
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:37,243
and so you have the same
micro chip in the brain

465
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,983
the same cell, in one region
is an analogue region

466
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:43,454
in another region
is a digital region

467
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:46,654
and of course they should
interact with each other

468
00:31:46,883 --> 00:31:48,957
because eventually
the input to the dendrite

469
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:51,427
the synaptic input to
the dendrite

470
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,743
should generate
: yes or no

471
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:57,552
depending if you reach or not,
especially in the axon

472
00:31:57,752 --> 00:32:00,316
a spike, so how do they interact ?

473
00:32:00,706 --> 00:32:02,756
The synaptic input,
the analogue signal,

474
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:05,542
and this spike output,
digital signal?

475
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:07,895
How do they interact ?

476
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:11,137
This is the next topic.
