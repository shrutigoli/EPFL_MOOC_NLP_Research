Okay now, letâ€™s continue looking at the neuron as an electrical device.
So, here is a neuron again.
You can see in dark the dendritic tree you can see in light red the axonal tree of this pyramidal neuron and you can see actually if you look carefully on the dendritic tree you can see these boutons, that Iâ€™ve just mentioned these little spots.
Another one, another one, another one.
Sometimes ten thousand of these spots... as I mentioned these are the pre-synaptic sites in axon that will connect to some dendrites that are not shown here.
So this is a neuron.
Now I want to highlight for you by drawing them the two types of elementary signals, the basic signals that the neurons carry.
So, letâ€™s assume that I record from inside of a dendrite so this electrode now is supposed to impale deep into the dendrite, we shall discuss this inter-cellular recording, so this is a cell in my brain now, or in your brain and now Iâ€™m drawing for you what are the electrical signals that we call the synaptic potentials here that you would see.
In vivo, in the living behaving brain.
So, this will be a potential and you would see things like that.
Something goes up, something goes down up, down, up, down.
You see these voltage fluctuations so this is voltage and this is on the range between 1mV to 10mV.
These are the synaptic potentials, so this youâ€™ll see in dendrites these little bumps of voltage of potential, small ones, some are going up, some are going down, and in time you will see some kind of noisy voltage trace.
These are synaptic potentials, they are built of many elements we shall talk about this particular one element: the synaptic potential, a single synaptic potential.
Here you see many of them.
And later we shall also see that these many of them are built of these two types.
One is an excitatory synaptic potential and the other is the inhibitory synaptic potential, now superimposed one on top of the other.
So thatâ€™s what happens in dendrites.
This is one type of signal, the synaptic potential.
The other type of signal you will see typically in the axon so now if I record from the axon, from inside the axon
I will see something like that,
I will see this noise that I showed you before, the synaptic noise, or voltage, and from time to time you see this kind of very big phenomenon, the spike.
Noise, spike, spike, spike.
So these are the spikes and they, sort of speak ride on top of synaptic potentials that are recorded in the axon actually in the axon you mostly see only the spike but if you recorded the beginning of the axon here you will see also the synaptic potentials.
So you can see that, somehow the synaptic potentials are underlying the spike, this little voltage fluctuations are underlying the spike here and from time to time, you get this big thing.
The spike, which is about 100mV so a tenth of a volt in amplitude.
So to summarize, you saw two types of electrical activity in the same neuron.
In the dendrites you saw what we call synaptic potentials, small ones maybe 1mV, 10mV, small ones, and in the axon near the cell body, you will see both of them and occasionally these big signals called spikes.
So, these are two different signals running in two different regions.
Dendrites carry synaptic potentials, axons carry spikes or action potentials, as they are used to be called, so synaptic potentials and action potentials.
Itâ€™s an action, suddenly big but we shall call it spike, now the action potential will be called the spike, and the synaptic potential and what my mission is in this part of the course is to develop the mathematical models to describe these two signals mathematically and then simulate them in the computer so that we should be able to mathematically simulate a neuron and mathematically simulate the connection between neuron, the synapses and the synaptic potential generated by this connection, so that eventually after knowing how to simulate a single neuron electrical activity we will be able to simulate network activity and thatâ€™s what we want to achieve in this course.
You will be able to simulate, not only a neuron not only a synapse, not only a spike not only a synaptic potentials but the activity in large connected network of neurons.
So now let me show you just as an illustration how does the spike in the living brain, how does the spike really not only look like, but sound like so, the experimental connected each spike into the loudspeaker so whenever there would be a spike of 100mV you would hear â€œtak, tak, tak, takâ€� like I did for the Parkinson case where I did on my own voice â€œtak, tak, tak, takâ€� experimentally like to hear the spikes by connecting in vivo in the behaving brain, while recording from the axon and listen to the spikes, so they know now that the cell now fires spikes.
So letâ€™s hear the firing of spikes in vivo in the axon of a real in this case, pyramidal celll.
Let's hear it.
Okay so, this â€œtak, tak, takâ€�, these are the spikes these white little vertical lines are the spikes
And you can see that this cell fires a particular set of spikes and this is the footprint, the electrical footprint of this prototypical neuron.
As I said before, every neuron goes â€œra, tak, tak, takâ€� this is the typical activity of the spiking activity in the axon and actually in the cell body of the neurons in general.
One interesting thing, and I want to finalize this part of general introduction of the electrical activity of neurons by showing you that different cell types that are morphologically different are sometimes morphologically different.
So here you see a diversity of the type of morphological cells you see this cell which is a bigger one and now I donâ€™t want to give names to the different cells but the different cells are nomenclature for different cell types in terms of the morphology, and so forth but this is one cell type here, and this is another cell type there and in this case, itâ€™s a morphological type when I say type,
I say morphological type so this is another morphological type.
So, these are like different trees in the jungle.
One is bigger, one is more branched one is less branched, and so forth but notice something interesting here that these different morphologies when you record from these particular cells you also see that they fire different patterns of spikes.
So this cell tends to fire this pattern of spikes when stimulated and this cell fires this pattern of spikes so you see you can think of each cell as an electrical instrument firing spikes at the axon but the structure of these spikes is sometimes â€œta, ta, ta, taâ€� like in this case sometimes â€œta   , ta   , taâ€� sometimes the cell is a burster â€œta, ta, ta, ta, stop, ta, ta, ta, ta, stop" a third burst â€œta, ta, taâ€�, and so forth so they also have not only a structural phase but also the electrical phase they are different in their electrical capabilities.
We donâ€™t know exactly how many types of electrical cells we have in the brain today, but it is hundreds of types probably of morphological types and maybe some tens or so electrical types at least in the cortex, we know more today.
But I wanted to tell you the main thing that the spike is a spike.
It doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s this cell on the left or this cell on the right they generate very similar spikes so the elementary beat, the elementary unit of a spike is something universal for many cell types all cell types are very similar, this 100mV amplitude phenomenon but in terms of structure in the spikes like in the bar code, sometimes itâ€™s structured like this sometimes itâ€™s structured like that for different cell types that are physiologically different but all use the spike which is a universal signal for nerve cells but in a different pattern of firing.
And this is of course very important to generate the music the philharmonic huge orchestra of many cells firing together now when Iâ€™m talking to you.
So they are diverse morphologically they use the same spike as a unit but they build these patterns of spikes from individual spikes like a bar code in the grocery store but notice that in the grocery store you have different widths of lines some of them are thicker, some of them are thinner and in this case the bar code is built of same width of spikes so the amplitude is 100mV, and the duration of these â€œtakâ€� and disappearing â€œtakâ€� and disappearing is about a millisecond a thousandth of a second.
So this is the electrical activity, so Iâ€™ve introduced a thousandth of a second.
So this is the electrical activity, so Iâ€™ve introduced to you now the electrical activity of neurons and I want to proceed into trying to model these signals mathematically.
So, letâ€™s summarize.
I told you, you should think of a neuron as build of three main regions the cell body, which is the chemical, molecular genetic machinery, a dendritic tree that is about one millimeter long, sometimes shorter but extending to one millimeter but it can be long if you spread it up until a few millimeters ten or twenty millimeters, and an axonal tree that also comes from the cell body at least in mammals, and then branch branch, branch, it could be very long at least in mammals, and then branch branch, branch, it could be very long centimeter sometimes meters, or very short locally
I told you that the dendrites carry synaptic potentials whereas the axons carry spikes so these two separate signals appear in separate regions.
In the axon you wonâ€™t find synaptic potential but rather spikes and in the dendrites typically, although recently weâ€™ve also found out that dendrites could also carry spikes but typically, dendrites carry synaptic potential that dendrites could also carry spikes but typically, dendrites carry synaptic potential and I will show you that they are different in their propery and they are modeled different mathematically.
Also, I just ended by showing you that the brain is built from many different cell types or neuron types both morphological types and also electrical types so they have different morphology and different physiological properties but basically all of them carry both synaptic potentials, in the dendrites no matter if itâ€™s a big dendrite or a small dendrite there you will find synaptic potential and if in the axon, no matter if itâ€™s a long axon or a short axon, you will find the spikes.
