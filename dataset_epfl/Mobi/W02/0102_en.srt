00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:05,789
Hello,

2
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:07,277
My name is Marie-Paule Thomas.

3
00:00:07,277 --> 00:00:10,608
I did my doctoral thesis at the Urban Sociology Laboratory

4
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:11,398
at EPFL

5
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,113
on the subject of residential choices

6
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,610
and household lifestyle.

7
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:17,516
Why and how people choose their place of living?

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,101
It is the subject we will discuss today.

9
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,268
For three years now,

10
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:25,464
I have worked in an consulting firm, called E-consulting,

11
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:27,879
where I advise municipalities and town planners

12
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,313
in the implementation of their housing policy.

13
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:32,595
Therefore, this course will present

14
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:35,640
As much as theoretical results than practical examples.

15
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:39,148
How can we start from household location choices

16
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:41,243
to rethink urban planning?

17
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:43,944
In this course we present

18
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:47,584
the main results of the Swiss research program PNR 54

19
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:49,204
sustainable urban habitat

20
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:51,594
which was the subject of my doctoral thesis.

21
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:55,292
The objective of this research was to analyze

22
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:58,261
arbitrations residential household location.

23
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:00,438
Why and how

24
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:03,001
families choose to locate?

25
00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:05,419
We began with three observations:

26
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,166
The individualisation of society.

27
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,422
So people are increasingly

28
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:11,376
different.

29
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,973
Increased mobility.

30
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:17,071
And increased segmentation of territories.

31
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:20,660
Commonly in research, three major theoretical currents

32
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,424
explain residential mobility.

33
00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:24,325
In the first type of approach,

34
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:27,746
the individual determines its location based on a vision

35
00:01:27,946 --> 00:01:29,852
both rational and strategic.

36
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:31,975
These approaches are rather worn

37
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:33,895
by real estate specialists,

38
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:36,228
engineers, economists, demographers,

39
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:39,302
all these experts who favor an analytical framework

40
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:41,612
metrical or economical.

41
00:01:41,998 --> 00:01:44,938
Thus, a household will determine its location

42
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,980
depending on their income,

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,004
ie a level of rent,

44
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:51,108
depending on the size of the household

45
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:53,045
ie a housing size,

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,820
or as a function of the distance of workplaces,

47
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,323
or of amenities.

48
00:01:58,214 --> 00:02:00,377
In rational actions theories,

49
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:04,341
the variables are mainly metrical or economical.

50
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:06,296
The second type of approach

51
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:09,472
explains residential choice by social logics.

52
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:11,060
The majority of these approaches

53
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,034
are rather carried by anthropologists

54
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:14,450
and sociologists.

55
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:17,770
In these approaches, the choice of residential location

56
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,421
is explained by social variables

57
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:22,131
by values.

58
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,450
The choice of place of life is thus influenced

59
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:26,503
either by family logics:

60
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:29,708
we want to live next to our family or next to the grandparents,

61
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,030
according to statutory logic:

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,008
we want a big house,

63
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:37,292
a great car, to show our social status,

64
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:40,506
or depending on cultural logics:

65
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:43,428
depending on who we are, which country we live in,

66
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,865
from where we have been socialized,

67
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:49,480
we will want to live in a place that resemble us.

68
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,140
All of these approaches

69
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,882
thus explain

70
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:55,631
residential choices based on social parameters.

71
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,479
I will live next to my relatives

72
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:01,385
in a place that distinguish myself socially,

73
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:04,434
or in a place that fits my values.

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,379
The third approach, less worked on,

75
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:10,657
explains residential choice in relation to sensitive logic.

76
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:13,626
Often these theories are carried, for example,

77
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,816
by architects.

78
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,488
Depending on who we are,

79
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:17,936
our history

80
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:21,999
the sensitive dimension can be, in fact, very important for people.

81
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,648
While we may have determined a location based

82
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,888
on a distance

83
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:28,662
on a public transportation stop

84
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:30,574
not too far from the grandmother.

85
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,754
Eventually what will be decisive

86
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,375
between the choice of two dwellings

87
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,657
of similar size and similar budgets in the near perimeter

88
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:38,779
from the grandparents,

89
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:39,774
is :

90
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:42,100
the light there will be in the housing,

91
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,385
the smell of the neighborhood,

92
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:46,322
the fact that we feel well.

93
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:49,356
In approaches we will remember later,

94
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:51,889
we consider that these three logical actions

95
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:52,836
are important.

96
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:55,395
Rational logic, social and sensitive.

97
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:57,543
When a household chooses a location,

98
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:59,885
it takes into account these three parameters.

99
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:02,852
Thus, in a choice of residential location,

100
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:06,992
a household observes both functional qualities,

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,815
therefore the services, amenities,

102
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:11,467
the price, size of dwelling.

103
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:13,047
Social qualities:

104
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,357
Is there a community life in the neighborhood?

105
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:18,046
Is it important for me to meet my neighbors?

106
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:19,957
Do I want to live next to my family?

107
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:22,654
Do I want to be in a place that distinguishes me socially?

108
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:24,166
And sensitive qualities:

109
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,256
Is that in a place where I feel good?

110
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,340
Do I want to live in this dwelling?

111
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,260
or on the contrary,

112
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,892
it has a light,

113
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:32,262
a color, an environment

114
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:33,983
that does not suit me at all.

115
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:36,347
In the research process in housing,

116
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:38,675
it is observed that there are often two stages.

117
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,856
First, a location is defined

118
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:42,694
or geographical area of ​​residence

119
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,760
according to his lifestyle,

120
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,116
for example, one wants to live in an area

121
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:49,489
up to 10 km

122
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:51,833
around the grandparents,

123
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,140
next to

124
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,497
a public transportation stop

125
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,002
and not too far

126
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,086
from a green space

127
00:04:58,116 --> 00:05:00,009
so that my children can play.

128
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:01,840
Then once we have determined

129
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,037
this geographical area, or these location settings,

130
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:07,231
we will go in search

131
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:08,701
of a home that matches

132
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:09,844
my budget,

133
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:11,430
my household type,

134
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:13,488
so if for example I am a family

135
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:15,367
I will seek a three or four parts,

136
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:17,512
and my values.

137
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:19,013
Let's take an example :

138
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:21,582
here we have a young middle-class couple

139
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:23,261
which will soon have a child.

140
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:24,730
For this couple,

141
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,496
it is very important, in terms of location criteria,

142
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:30,682
to be close to public transportation, be able to move by bicycle,

143
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:32,254
they love the social mix,

144
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:37,308
and they want a range of services and amenities nearby,

145
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:38,598
be it shopping,

146
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:39,924
cultural life

147
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:41,483
restaurants, cafes.

148
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:43,066
In terms of location,

149
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:46,253
so far they prefer to live in an urban center.

150
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:47,448
Once they have

151
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:48,622
identified

152
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,646
cities or small towns with all these criteria,

153
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:54,686
they will go in search of three parts

154
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:55,944
rather old

155
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:57,204
corresponding

156
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,459
to their budget

157
00:05:58,549 --> 00:05:59,754
of middle class.

158
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:03,474
If we summarize our results in terms of residential location,

159
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:06,571
we have highlighted six areas of differentiation

160
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:08,246
of residential preferences.

161
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:10,661
The first axis, the Security gradient,

162
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,310
distinguishes people

163
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:15,304
for whom being between peers is very important,

164
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:18,028
from other people who will value social mix.

165
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:21,872
Do I want to live with neighbors similar to me ?

166
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:22,878
or on the contrary,

167
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,958
live next to neighbors

168
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,278
who are not like me?

169
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:28,388
The friendliness gradient

170
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:30,225
distinguishes household

171
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:32,590
who feel that neighborlyhood,

172
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,644
so as in the picture on the right,

173
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,717
is very important.

174
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:38,685
Is it important for me to meet my neighbors

175
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:39,615
everyday

176
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,288
and at all times of the day

177
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:44,283
because I love the friendliness and community life,

178
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:47,600
or, on the contrary, I want to live in an individualistic way

179
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,172
and I do not want to pass by my neighbors every day.

180
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,163
So this axis distinguishes people for whom

181
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,904
community and easy life is very important,

182
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:57,448
from more individualistic households.

183
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:00,359
This axis will be particularly important

184
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:03,187
in the definition of architectural projects.

185
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:04,710
Do I conceive

186
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,215
dwellings or buildings

187
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:09,886
that will allow me to meet others?

188
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:12,114
or, on the contrary, do I design buildings

189
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:14,867
which will ensure that I do not cross my neighbors?

190
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:17,046
The social gradient anchor

191
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,263
distinguishes, on the one hand,

192
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:22,845
households for whom it is important to live near relatives

193
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:25,100
or their friends,

194
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:29,077
from households for which this parameter will not count.

195
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,086
The gradient of elitism

196
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:34,802
distinguishes households valuing a socially distinguished place of living

197
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:36,692
with a good reputation in the neighborhood,

198
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:38,778
a good social status,

199
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:41,150
as opposed to households caring less

200
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,410
of these distinctive logic

201
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,935
in choosing where they live.

202
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,680
It thus distinguishes household with traditional values,

203
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,822
of households with more post-materialist values

204
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,751
enhancing personal development.

205
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,356
The density gradient distinguishes households

206
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:58,911
valuing local services,

207
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,653
the ability to go

208
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:03,397
to a shop or a service by walk

209
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,383
from households that use more

210
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:08,830
the car in their daily lives

211
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,389
and for which proximity to local services counts less.

212
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,805
It distinguished too, households valuing country life

213
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,949
of households with life

214
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,474
more connected to the urban agglomeration.

215
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:22,564
The serenity gradient is itself universal.

216
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:25,923
It shows that in the criteria for residential location,

217
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,093
the concepts of peace,

218
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:29,911
proximity to nature and green spaces,

219
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:32,586
are very important for all households.

220
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:34,607
We have seen that there are six axes

221
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,949
differentiation of residential preferences,

222
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,007
but finally,

223
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:41,122
how these different location criteria form a system?

224
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,559
Depending on our lifestyle,

225
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:46,444
we will develop different visions of the quality of life.

226
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,889
In our research we have shown

227
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,688
that for an equivalent type of household

228
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:52,041
and at the same income level,

229
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,853
one can have different lifestyles.

230
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,161
One can, thus, enhance urban life,

231
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:57,805
have its organic basket,

232
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,929
rather move on public transport,

233
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,498
be an artist who does not have much money

234
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:04,228
and live in a housing

235
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:05,948
with a suitable rent,

236
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:07,672
then a few years later,

237
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:09,932
one will still move in public transport

238
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:12,046
will still love uban life,

239
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:14,981
and will still have its organic vegetable basket,

240
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:18,058
but maybe one will become a cultural framework

241
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,036
in a large institution.

242
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:23,167
One will have a different income

243
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,707
but still the same lifestyle.

244
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:29,731
Thus we see that for the traditional criteria of the income of the type of household

245
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:30,792
the lifestyle

246
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:34,498
is decisive to explain the choice of residential location.

247
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,584
Depending on who we are,

248
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:38,744
we can define where we live,

249
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,964
according to the maxim: "describe me where you live,

250
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,464
I will tell you who you are".

251
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,644
In the segmentation that we have put in place

252
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:47,673
at the Urban Sociology Laboratory,

253
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:50,427
we identified six lifestyles

254
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:53,442
which have six different views of the quality of life,

255
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:55,195
with two large groups:

256
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:56,445
the classics

257
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:57,535
and contemporary.

258
00:09:57,718 --> 00:09:58,687
We observe

259
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:00,063
that these typologies

260
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,933
or those living groups

261
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:04,675
are found in other researches

262
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:08,846
whether in marketing or research institutes.

263
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,850
Like the Sinus-Milieus

264
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,476
or the Friedlander Partners Institute.

265
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:14,822
Finally,

266
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:17,793
we have also shown that these different lifestyles,

267
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:20,725
from the most classical to the most contemporary,

268
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:23,038
are the result of a historical sedimentation.

269
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:26,479
While 100 years ago, we were all rural households

270
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:29,739
who lived on a farm next door to our parents,

271
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,164
now,

272
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,279
100 years later,

273
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:35,119
there is an infinity of ways of living

274
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,340
or at least

275
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,351
six main groups which are divided into two classes

276
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,411
thaht we will present you now.

277
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:42,526
The classics

278
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:45,917
match the lifestyles including residential aspirations

279
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:49,401
and lifestyles are similar to values ​​rather traditional,

280
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:52,030
regardless of the type of household income.

281
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:55,893
They prefer quiet residential environments, monofunctional

282
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:57,556
with beautiful visual clearances

283
00:10:57,884 --> 00:10:59,257
on a human scale

284
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,780
in a neighborhood promoting being between oneself

285
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,833
security

286
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:04,703
and a certain social status.

287
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:08,021
Preferably they are looking for recent real estate,

288
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:10,973
if possible in property, if they have the means.

289
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:15,267
They rather prefer private transport.

290
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:19,367
The Classic ideal residential is an individual house.

291
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:22,132
The contemporary lifestyles

292
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:24,220
appeared more recently

293
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,975
during the last thirty years.

294
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,600
In parallel with the movement that we have called:

295
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,907
"Gentrification movement" in the literature.

296
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:35,989
Contemporaries often have more progressive values

297
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:37,501
or less traditional

298
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,498
then the previous group.

299
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:41,393
Both are often dual-income,

300
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:44,295
they advocate social diversity, living together,

301
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:46,819
light modes of transport, public transport,

302
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:47,849
cultural life,

303
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:49,899
ecological values.

304
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,469
They thereby prefer

305
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:53,329
active residential environments,

306
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,847
intensive, mixed,

307
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,712
dense and urban

308
00:11:56,712 --> 00:12:00,004
where cultural and artistic activity is intense.

309
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:02,717
The residential ideal of contemporary

310
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:04,973
is an apartment in an old building,

311
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,195
a loft,

312
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:09,705
or an apartment in a modern building,

313
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:10,995
like here

314
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:12,293
in the right picture,

315
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,857
in a building in Copenhagen, Denmark.

316
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:16,152
If we summarize,

317
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,992
we have two large groups of residential lifestyles.

318
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:23,275
On one hand, the classic that emphasize individual residential mobility,

319
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,493
Being between one-self, individualism, and instead value

320
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:28,943
quiet environments,at the human scale,

321
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:31,674
and they want access to a house.

322
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:34,760
And on the other hand we have the contemporary households

323
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,459
who value mobility by public transport,

324
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,131
proximity and the compactness of the city

325
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:43,601
and its urban bustle,

326
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:44,791
its social diversity

327
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:47,171
and, in terms of objects,

328
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:48,299
they will valorize

329
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,617
the old building,

330
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:51,270
or the contemporary one.

331
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:54,289
To schedule and plan the contemporary city,

332
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:56,737
one must understand the views of users,

333
00:12:56,737 --> 00:12:58,612
their practices, their lifestyles,

334
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,179
their appropriation of different spaces.

335
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:04,233
The detailed understanding of lifestyles,

336
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,653
of what the residents do and want,

337
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,939
can anticipate the programming

338
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,581
and planning of cities.

339
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:12,564
Now how can one move

340
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:14,104
from the theory,

341
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:15,301
that I presented to you,

342
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:16,607
to practice?

343
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:19,362
It is important that public authorities

344
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:22,172
reflect on the proactive housing policies

345
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,354
and not suffered.

346
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:26,009
We thereby suggest, for almost five years,

347
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,571
many public and local authorities

348
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:31,543
to implement a proactive housing policy.

349
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:33,770
We work very often,

350
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:34,800
upstream,

351
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,320
under what is known as :

352
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,411
Urban Programming

353
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:42,727
Until now, communities underwent territory development.

354
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:45,198
It is time to reverse the trend

355
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:47,508
in order to influence future developments

356
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:49,646
and to think in terms of target audience,

357
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:52,173
both in terms of income and household type,

358
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:53,565
than of lifestyle.

359
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,232
When we support communities,

360
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:58,460
we often have three steps

361
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:01,078
for the definition of housing policy.

362
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:03,303
First: define the target audience.

363
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:05,383
The second: divide the target audience.

364
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:09,436
And the third: build for the chosen target audience.

365
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,864
To define the target audience,

366
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:13,303
we are using

367
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:15,396
the three variables presented earlier.

368
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:18,459
Do we want to attract rather conventional household?

369
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:20,049
or contemporary?

370
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,502
Do I want to draw rather solos households?

371
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:24,930
Couples ? Families ?

372
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,272
And what level of income

373
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:29,337
will we focus on in the new urban operation

374
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:30,619
or in the town ?

375
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:32,275
Social diversity of income?

376
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:34,582
Rather the middle class? Rather the upper class?

377
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,117
Where are we going to focus

378
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:38,595
less affluent households of the population?

379
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:39,801
With these three criteria,

380
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,283
income, household type and lifestyle,

381
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:45,572
we can define the target audience for a future town

382
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:46,678
or a neighborhood.

383
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:50,025
Once we defined the target audience,

384
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,598
we need to divide them.

385
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:54,365
Indeed, all lands, or all situations

386
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,508
do not always have the same home-potential

387
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:58,568
for all groups of the population.

388
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:01,210
For each field, finally, what are the targets

389
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,711
naturally attracted?

390
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:03,941
Whatever I do,

391
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:05,851
This town center will be very attractive

392
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:07,509
for contemporary households.

393
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,688
Which are the naturally excluded targets?

394
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:11,438
This urban center will exclude,

395
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:12,938
perhaps naturally

396
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:14,121
the classics.

397
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,873
Or what the potential targets

398
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,850
depending on the project that I will develop?

399
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,426
I develop public transport

400
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:20,896
I have a flat topography,

401
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,451
I have adapted housing

402
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:25,851
and I will surely be able to attract senior citizens in this neighborhood.

403
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:26,951
Each site

404
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:31,618
or each place of the territory has a varied potential home

405
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:33,309
for different target audiences.

406
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:35,654
Let's take an example :

407
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:38,791
considering the agglomerations of Lausanne and Bern

408
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:41,200
we are in the village of

409
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:43,143
Vufflens-la-Ville,

410
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,670
at the top left.

411
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:47,168
In fifteen minutes on foot or by public transport,

412
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:49,015
we can barely get out of town.

413
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:50,774
In twenty-five minutes,

414
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,082
you get to meet

415
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:53,656
the nearest town.

416
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:56,176
This means that for contemporary households

417
00:15:56,176 --> 00:15:58,449
who value the proximity of public transport

418
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:00,724
in the case of the agglomeration of Lausanne,

419
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:04,186
we can live in very urban places like Renan,

420
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,602
or in the center of Lausanne.

421
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,687
If we now consider the town of Bern,

422
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:13,389
in the upper right, we are in the village of Moosseedorf,

423
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,899
a peri town,

424
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:17,923
we see that in fifteen minutes by public transport,

425
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,360
we can reach

426
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:20,948
the village,

427
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:23,592
but also all the neighboring villages

428
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,673
and also the center city of Bern.

429
00:16:26,357 --> 00:16:27,522
The same thing

430
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:28,917
for places

431
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,958
available in twenty-five minutes.

432
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:33,298
What does that mean ?

433
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:35,728
This means that if one has a contemporary household

434
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:37,626
for which the valuation

435
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:40,400
of public transit trips are very important

436
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,368
in Bern,

437
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,511
we can live

438
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:46,384
both in the center and in the surrounding area.

439
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:48,479
This will not be the case in Lausanne.

440
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:53,583
Thus, each place of the territory, has a varied potential home

441
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,223
for different groups of the population.

442
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,390
Based on these characteristics

443
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,010
intrinsic, functional, social and sensitive,

444
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,073
the territory will attract

445
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:05,261
a target audience.

446
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:08,433
Once we have defined the target audience,

447
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,312
that we have described the potential attractiveness of places

448
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:14,343
for the implementation of the housing policy,

449
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:18,019
neighborhoods suitable to target audiences must be developed

450
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,148
Two examples:

451
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:22,039
on the left, we are in the town of Zurich.

452
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,259
The city of Zurich has set up, for twenty years,

453
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:28,715
a proactive policy to attract families in the city center.

454
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,498
So it built

455
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:33,500
over 10 000 homes for families

456
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:36,708
and adapted its family policy

457
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,958
in order to keep families in town.

458
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,115
If we stand on another scale,

459
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:42,565
on the architecture scale.

460
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,725
The right picture is the result

461
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:48,878
of an architectural competition which involved sociologists and architects.

462
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:51,866
There are three types of buildings

463
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,811
which correspond to three lifestyles.

464
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,211
In each of its buildings

465
00:17:55,211 --> 00:17:57,226
there is a housing size diversity

466
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,130
and a variety of available rents.

467
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,066
In the building of Kodak,

468
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:03,504
a cooperative, nurturing living together,

469
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,948
the buildings were drawn

470
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:07,643
with alleyways,

471
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,700
a majority of meeting places,

472
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,953
public spaces,

473
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:14,012
laundriy rooms where people will meet.

474
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:16,759
The Kings Cooperative building

475
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:21,250
was drawn based more on an individualistic lifestyle.

476
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:23,689
You can access the parking,

477
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:27,319
then ascend directly into one's apartment through the lift

478
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,830
without necessarily crossing all one's neighbors.

479
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:33,364
Here we see the translation directly to an architectural project

480
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:35,454
based on people's lifestyles.

481
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:37,287
Is the living together valorized ?

482
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,887
And do we want an architecture favoring this setting?

483
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,841
The opening, proximity, link and meeting with the neighbors?

484
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:48,758
Or, on the contrary, do we want a more individualistic lifestyle,

485
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:51,809
and we will have an architecture that fits this lifestyle.

486
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,023
Another example to the housing ladder.

487
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,215
If we want to design

488
00:18:57,215 --> 00:18:59,895
two types of housing for middle class families

489
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:01,833
we see that on the left,

490
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:05,180
this accommodation will be more suitable for conventional families

491
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,610
that will enhance privacy, individuality,

492
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,312
so the children's game will take place, rather,

493
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:13,752
on the terrace of the accommodation

494
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,838
the same for the barbecue

495
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:19,083
where we will invite friends that were chosen to our grills

496
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,479
with ourselves in our garden.

497
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,712
The photo on the right

498
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:24,621
is a type of property or operation rather adapted

499
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,497
for contemporary families.

500
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:30,224
The children's game will take place rather collectively

501
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:32,390
in vegetable gardens,

502
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,763
and we will grill all together with neighbors.

503
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:38,974
So we see that for an equivalent type of household,

504
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:40,627
an equivalent income

505
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:43,545
we can have urban architectural responses

506
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,210
completely different!

507
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:48,747
For years, the architectural determinism dominated.

508
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:51,103
By a stroke of a pen, planners

509
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:52,892
had the power to determine

510
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,260
how people would live their housing

511
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,847
or meet in a neighborhood

512
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:57,649
or in a building.

513
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,331
Now,

514
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,498
with urban planning lifestyles,

515
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:03,686
this is the reverse process

516
00:20:03,686 --> 00:20:05,806
and from the lifestyles of the people,

517
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:08,700
or ways of living of the inhabitants, we draw a district.

518
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:12,422
One can thus act with a policy of attractive housing,

519
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:15,389
by prices, housing size, moods

520
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:17,323
programming area.

521
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:20,459
To attract a particular group of the population,

522
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:21,769
the housing type,

523
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:23,507
the deal, encourage as much

524
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:25,836
that public support policies

525
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:28,283
cultural, social, family.

526
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:30,392
It may not thus

527
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:32,257
not only attract families

528
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:34,348
with a nice house, four rooms,

529
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:35,512
affordable,

530
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:36,568
but also

531
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,515
with childcare, pre and after-school.

532
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:43,595
To conclude the course on residential choices of households

533
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:47,749
we can come back to three observations.

534
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:50,702
We have seen that for an equivalent income and an equivalent type of household,

535
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:52,680
households may have lifestyles

536
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,662
and residential choices that are completely different.

537
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,502
We also saw that the contexts

538
00:20:57,502 --> 00:21:00,065
present differentiated potentials of reception

539
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:01,583
for the different groups.

540
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,121
Depending on the site,

541
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:05,712
we will be able to attract or exclude certain groups.

542
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:07,734
Finally,

543
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,052
to think residential choices of households,

544
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:10,993
urban planning,

545
00:21:10,993 --> 00:21:13,301
it is necessary to rethink the planning

546
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:16,297
so to go from the regulatory planning

547
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:18,073
to urbanism project planning

548
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:20,524
and thus think of city

549
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:22,247
based on lifestyles.
