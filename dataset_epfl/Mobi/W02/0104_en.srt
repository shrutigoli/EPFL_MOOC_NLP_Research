1
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:09,847
1960: the pedestrian is not king, far from it!

2
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,240
He has to survive in an urban jungle

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,774
where predators have four wheels and formidable exhausts

4
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:17,390
Walking, biking,

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,993
have been trying to rebuild a place in our cities

6
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:21,789
We call that :

7
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,936
soft mobility.

8
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:32,002
The trips are short in our urban societies.

9
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:34,885
Many trips are within 3 km

10
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:41,725
It is a common interest that a maximum of person

11
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:44,299
go walk or bike to free up space,

12
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:46,272
to avoid congestion of roads

13
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:48,938
<I> ... the phenomenon is unfortunate because instead of allowing the passage </ i>

14
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:51,928
<I> of 25 or 30 cars during the green time, only </ i>

15
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:53,641
<I> 15 or 20  can pass</ i>

16
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:59,011
In the 1950s, while developing major road plans

17
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,050
there was the idea that the car is a step forward,

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,191
that the car is free of the constraints of public transportation,

19
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:09,931
that the car will enable a new quality of life

20
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:13,090
The car, it's part of man as a jacket

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,948
as a pair of shoes.

22
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:17,924
And so we will build large ring roads,

23
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:21,761
sometimes demolishing urban neighborhoods for passing expressways.

24
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:26,851
By the 1960s, the car starts to be a problem in a number

25
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:31,794
of central districts because they are absolutely everywhere

26
00:01:31,794 --> 00:01:36,043
and ultimately, it limits the attractiveness of town centers

27
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:40,091
And so fairly quickly, since the late 1960s

28
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:44,752
one begins to think about the pedestrianization of city centers

29
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:48,029
<I> The authorities and residents work together to make the center </ i>

30
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:50,215
<I> a place where it feels good to live. </ I>

31
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:54,269
The idea initially is not to remove the car, but simply

32
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,502
to ensure that the automobile is not bothersome.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,313
It's the same with the slab districts that were built

34
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:04,414
in the 60s throughout Europe.

35
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:07,966
These are areas where the flow is separated:

36
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:12,693
so that pedestrians are not hindered by car traffic, we dedicate them their

37
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:15,996
spaces, pedestrian malls, paths.

38
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:36,020
There are, especially in northern Europe, a series of experiments

39
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,463
of car-free neighborhoods.

40
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:42,463
The idea is that the new inhabitants or the inhabitants of this area agree

41
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:46,038
to have no private vehicle when they move in

42
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:52,541
and mobility is organized around the other means of transport available

43
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:58,023
Driving is considered increasingly stressful

44
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:01,331
due to the conditions of traffic or parking.

45
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,838
Using public transportation is also

46
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:08,668
for issues related to scheduling or load vehicles.

47
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,382
Walking is, somehow, breaking free of these constraints.
