Hello everyone !

2
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:09,645
This video offers to introduce the issue of transformations,

3
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:13,968
both spatial and temporal, of the lifestyles in European societies

4
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:16,938
for forty years and the implications

5
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,489
these transformations have on the field of mobility.

6
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:27,152
Why focus on lifestyles in a course on mobility and urban planning?

7
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:31,768
Well for one reason ultimately very simple: it is that now,

8
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:37,924
lifestyles act fully as a social differentiation.

9
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:43,751
Indeed lifestyles are not anymore, in contemporary European societies,

10
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,749
a derivative of sociodemographic variables

11
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:50,979
such as income, education or household composition.

12
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:55,718
Social success models have diversified and with them,

13
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:59,671
new models of lifestyles emerged.

14
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:04,529
In terms of housing and transport, with phenomena such as dependency to

15
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:09,128
the automobile and to suburbanization, transportation

16
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:13,399
and more generally mobility issues have become central

17
00:01:13,427 --> 00:01:16,667
in the construction of lifestyles.

18
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:21,705
We define lifestyle as composition in time and space

19
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:27,393
of daily activities and experiences that give meaning to the life of a person.

20
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:32,164
For us, lifestyle has three central dimensions:

21
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:38,717
a functional dimension, a significant dimension and a social dimension.

22
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:43,008
I now suggest that we look together

23
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:46,298
at each of these dimensions one after the other.

24
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,889
Let's start with the functional dimension.

25
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:54,828
The functional quality is what makes every day practical.

26
00:01:54,828 --> 00:02:00,934
This therefore refers to the built environment, the types of infrastructure

27
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:06,486
and equipment available in one place, in a city, in a territory

28
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:12,813
as well as service and accessibility by various means of transport.

29
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:18,257
Regarding this functional dimension everyone has preferences,

30
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:22,652
transport mode preferences, and is characterized by an anchor,

31
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:28,042
in daily activities, more or less related to proximity.

32
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:33,216
The sensitive dimension, second dimension,

33
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:36,331
refers to what promotes our wellbeing.

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,006
In the characteristics of the built environment,

35
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:43,196
it refers to the morphology of the built environment:

36
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:47,233
the fact whether or not they are green spaces, the quality of facilities

37
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,902
but also the morphology of the frame and, of course,

38
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:53,876
all the aesthetic features.

39
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:56,054
Compared to this sensitive dimension,

40
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:58,994
each has a sensitivity and preferences,

41
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:01,884
feels good in certain environments

42
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,641
rather than others.

43
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:06,574
This is called "sensitive quality"

44
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:09,597
the second dimension lifestyles.

45
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:13,731
The third dimension: social quality.

46
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:18,761
Social quality is what promotes social relations.

47
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:24,867
In regards to the built environment, it is linked to public spaces

48
00:03:25,194 --> 00:03:26,934
with the possibility to meet,

49
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:29,382
with the presence of a number of facilities

50
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:32,652
with the presence of intermediate spaces,

51
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:41,588
of thresholds spaces, with the possibility of articulating the public / private division.

52
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:45,598
Compared to this dimension, we all design

53
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:49,908
specific relation to each other and of the social anchor:

54
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,920
the community life, the neighborly friendliness, the reputation,

55
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:59,486
the animation of a neighborhood, all are dimensions that return

56
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,766
to the social quality of a space

57
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:06,415
and for which each has specific expectations.

58
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:09,085
What has changed in the last forty years

59
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:11,222
regarding the three dimensions,

60
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,810
is that we have a diversification of yearning models.

61
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:20,709
If, thirty years ago, the expectations of a population

62
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,611
were relatively similar, nowadays we have aspirations

63
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:29,911
highly diversified in terms of three dimensions just mentioned.

64
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:34,714
Thus one can no longer speak of quality of life

65
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:37,264
but of living qualities, plural.

66
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:42,077
This is reflected in particular by the fact that for an equivalent income

67
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:47,109
in the European urban population is observed

68
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:49,392
very different lifestyles.

69
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:53,082
In this transformation of lifestyles at work

70
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:56,919
for the last forty years, one can also see that the use

71
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,569
of transport means is a central indicator of lifestyles

72
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:03,478
and of their diversity.

73
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,369
Means of transport, means of travel,

74
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:10,289
are a way to introduce ourselves, are a way to build

75
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,159
one's relationship to time and a way to build one's relationship with space,

76
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:19,079
and that iss why it iss important, when we look

77
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:22,451
at mobility issues related to urban planning,

78
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,714
to ask ourselves about lifestyles.

79
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,466
On this mapping, you can see the GPS track

80
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:33,516
of a person who has been living in the center of Lausanne for ten days.

81
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:36,763
So here, all the travels and places

82
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:39,973
that person has attended for ten days are represented.

83
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:42,860
The stars represent the busiest places

84
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,500
and the lines represent the paths taken.

85
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:49,315
The bigger the star, the more frequented the place was.

86
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,755
The thicker the path is, the more used it has been.

87
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,974
As for them, the colors represent

88
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:57,124
the different means of transport used.

89
00:05:57,268 --> 00:06:01,508
This is an example of the representation of the lifestyle of a person

90
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:04,276
who lives in the center of Lausanne.

91
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,841
We arrived at the end of this video

92
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:10,021
which aimed to present a general and theoretical perspective

93
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:12,953
of the question of the transformation of lifestyles.

94
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:15,824
We saw that in particular lifestyles

95
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:18,152
have greatly diversified

96
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,640
and that it is now impossible to identify them

97
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:24,179
using the classic sociodemographic variables

98
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:28,129
such as income, education or household composition.

99
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:31,457
We also have seen that the use

100
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,146
of different means of transport is a central element

101
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:36,859
of these lifestyles and, in other words,

102
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:39,176
the use of certain means of transport, rather than other

103
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:42,984
fundamentally refers to ways of living and organizing

104
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:48,277
one's daily life and not just simply choices of means of transport.

105
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,602
Thank you for your attention.
