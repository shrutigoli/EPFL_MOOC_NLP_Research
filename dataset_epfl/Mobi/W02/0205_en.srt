00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:05,428
Hello.

2
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:08,464
This video offers an overview

3
00:00:08,464 --> 00:00:11,560
of the different techniques of measuring mobility.

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,325
We have grouped them into two big families.

5
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:19,913
Quantitative methods and qualitative methods.

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,228
Among the many methods available,

7
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:27,789
we have chosen to present the most used techniques

8
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:32,928
and to focus on the measurement of the mobility of everyday life.

9
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:35,788
I wish you a good video.

10
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:41,925
<I> We'll start with the quantitative survey techniques, </ i>

11
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:45,260
<I> we'll sweep in a series, </ i>

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,256
<I> and the first one is the so-called investigations generators. </ I>

13
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:56,117
<I> The idea is to focus on an equipment, </ i>

14
00:00:56,117 --> 00:01:00,529
<I> an airport, a shopping center, an urban center, </ i>

15
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:06,433
<I> and to finally interest ourselves
in what this pole, that this place </ i>

16
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,561
<I> generates as mobility. </ I>

17
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:15,980
<I> This is a technique that takes a
place to be interested in all streams </ i>

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:21,377
<I> this place has for destination or origin. </ I>

19
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:26,631
<I> These are techniques that concern all transport means, </ i>

20
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:29,904
<I> surveys that concern any means of transport in general. </ I>

21
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:34,600
<I> To give an example, I think that business travel plans </ i>

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,169
<I> are an excellent example of these generators investigations. </ I>

23
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:42,936
<I> For example, the corporate travel plan </ i>

24
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:47,028
<I> or PDE of the airport of Geneva Cointrin, </ i>

25
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:51,028
<I> which provides a telephone survey every two to three years, </ i>

26
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,532
<I> within a representative sample of employees, </ i>

27
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:57,944
<I> that can measure movements made </ i>

28
00:01:57,944 --> 00:02:01,020
<I> by the people working at the airport, </ i>

29
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,260
<I> and their evolution over time, particularly in terms </ i>

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,569
<I> of kilometer performance and of mode of transport used. </ I>

31
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:14,125
<I> The second type of quantitative survey: </ i>

32
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:20,613
<I> the investigations mobility of people in </ i>
<i> the space of the street, so the street. </ I>

33
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:23,694
<I> There, it is like for generators investigations, </ i>

34
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:28,397
<I> we will look at a space, </ i>
<i> for example, a street or a street portion, </ i>

35
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:31,779
<I> and we will look at all trips </ i>

36
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:34,349
<I> which are formed in this space. </ I>

37
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:37,946
<I> The purpose of these surveys is in general </ i>

38
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:41,458
<I> urban planning or road sharing. </ I>

39
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:46,370
<I> He finally comes to quantifying flows
through transportation means </ i>

40
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,674
<I> on a given area in order to
predict and imagine its development. </ I>

41
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,177
<I> Third type of quantitative survey: </ i>

42
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:58,782
<I> a type which is very developed in public transport, </ i>

43
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:02,973
<I> it's customer surveys and customer satisfaction. </ I>

44
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:08,090
<I> The purpose of these surveys is to measure </ i>

45
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,786
<I> user satisfaction of a means of transport </ i>

46
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:16,787
<I> and measure customer satisfaction in time, </ i>

47
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:20,526
<I> that is to say, to see if it has
changed positively or negatively </ i>

48
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,976
<I> according to a number of criteria. </ I>

49
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:26,558
<I> So this is somehow dashboard investigations </ i>

50
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,918
<I> for operators. </ I>

51
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:33,790
<I> To give an example, SBB, the Swiss Railways </ i>

52
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:40,002
<I> is conducting an ongoing survey
in passenger traffic since 1983, </ i>

53
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:45,125
<I> thus they investigate 2,000 people per month, per phone </ i>

54
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:49,722
<I> and it allows them to have a
highly accurate customer tracking </ i>

55
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:53,949
<I> it allows them to measure passenger satisfaction </ i>

56
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:58,354
<I> towards the railway service in Switzerland. </ I>

57
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:03,093
<I> Fourth type of quantitative survey: traffic counts, </ i>

58
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:06,567
<I> that can be either automatic or manual. </ I>

59
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,429
<I> When automatic, </ i>

60
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:14,785
<I> it's just a filament inserted into the pavement </ i>

61
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:18,290
<I> that allows to count the wheels passing over, </ i>

62
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,426
<I> and when it is manual, is an investigator on the sidewalk </ i>

63
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:28,074
<I> that counts passing vehicles and and their types. </ I>

64
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:33,417
<I> So, the type of information collected by these traffic counts, </ i>

65
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:39,158
<I> is obviously a measure of traffic, possibly by vehicle class, </ i>

66
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:41,114
<I> possibly by origin. </ I>

67
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,710
<I> It also allows, for example in crossroads, </ i>

68
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,482
<I> to measure the flow volume in different directions. </ I>

69
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:58,022
<I> Traffic counts are therefore either automatic or manual. </ I>

70
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:00,549
<I> With regard to the automatic counting, </ i>

71
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:04,753
<I> you have before you a map of Switzerland with all </ i>

72
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:08,386
<I> automated counting points of traffic. </ I>

73
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:14,727
<I> This type of points exist in almost all European countries. </ I>

74
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:16,690
<I> So this is the example of Switzerland, </ i>

75
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,057
<I> but we could have taken other examples. </ I>

76
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:25,449
<I> The road counts tend to have developed around the video </ i>

77
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,382
<I> for a number of years. </ I>

78
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:32,502
<I> The video analysis presents the advantage of being cheaper </ i>

79
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:36,705
<I> than manual counting or automated counting, </ i>

80
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:42,926
<I> especially when the traffic is very low or extremely dense, </ i>

81
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,853
<I> and then another advantage, it helps to highlight </ i>

82
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:50,877
<I> conflicts between different types of vehicles, </ i>

83
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:55,586
<I> or between transport modes on a given road. </ I>

84
00:05:55,953 --> 00:05:58,861
<I> So this is a technique that is slightly emerging, </ i>

85
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:01,901
<I> which tends to grow in the recent years, </ i>

86
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:04,726
<I> at the expense of conventional traffic counts, </ i>

87
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:07,225
<I> whether automated or manual. </ I>

88
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:12,102
<I> Other technique of quantitative survey, the surveys cords. </ I>

89
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:18,215
<I> Here, the idea is to measure the flow of vehicles </ i>

90
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:20,873
<I> into or out of an area. </ I>

91
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:23,786
<I> The idea is to collect, for example, </ i>

92
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:25,714
<I> at the output of a city or agglomeration, </ i>

93
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:28,942
<I> where cars are coming out from, </ i>

94
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:30,450
<I> where they are going. </ I>

95
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,194
<I> And in the same way, those who enter, </ i>
<i> where do they come from, </ i>

96
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,346
<I> Where did they go inside the town, </ i>

97
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:42,817
<I> What are the reasons for moving of these people, </ i>

98
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:45,222
<I> and then there is also the case of freight traffic, </ i>

99
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:49,915
<I> what goods enter or leave </ i>

100
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:53,069
<I> the agglomeration or the considered city. </ I>

101
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:57,890
<I> The surveys cords are quite heavy to carry because in fact, </ i>

102
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:03,053
<I> in general, the most common technique is to stop vehicles </ i>

103
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:08,421
<I> and to distribute questionnaires to circulating people, </ i>

104
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:11,262
<I> so it generates traffic congestion, </ i>

105
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:16,161
<I> and therefore the acceptability of this type of survey is not always obvious. </ I>

106
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:20,845
<I> This is a type of investigation that tends not to develop too much. </ I>

107
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:27,850
<I> Here you have a methodological example of surveys cords. </ I>

108
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,685
<I> This is the cord-survey of the Lille metropolitan era, </ i>

109
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:38,793
<I> where you actually see the areas that are considered by the survey. </ I>

110
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:47,133
<I> So, in blue, you have the cord from Lille, the Lille area, </ i>

111
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,937
<I> in brown, you have the Bethune cord </ i>

112
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:55,948
<I> and then in green, the cord of the agglomeration of Lens. </ I>

113
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:01,580
<I> The idea of ​​these surveys cords, is to have each time an idea </ i>

114
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,508
<I> finally of the force of mobility exchanges </ i>

115
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:08,504
<I> between these different parts of town, </ i>

116
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:10,959
<I> between Lille, Bethune and Lens, </ i>

117
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,525
<I> and between the Lille metropolitan area and its environment, </ i>

118
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:20,400
<I> that is to say Belgium, if one thinks of the national border, </ i>

119
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,172
<I> and other French regions located nearby. </ I>

120
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,640
<I> Also in the quantitative surveys, </ i>

121
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,335
<I> it is a whole family of surveys that are related </ i>

122
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:39,472
<I> to the behavior of people on the move. </ I>

123
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:43,367
<I> So it is the major surveys of mobility. </ I>

124
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:50,932
<I> Almost in every European country, such surveys are conducted. </ I>

125
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:55,372
<I> In Switzerland, it is the micro-census transport and mobility, </ i>

126
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:59,480
<I> in France, on the scale of urban areas, </ i>

127
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,407
<I> it comes to household travel surveys, or EMD. </ I>

128
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:09,339
<I> At the national level, it is the national transportation survey. </ I>

129
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,539
<I> In Canada, the same type of survey </ i>
<i> is called the origin-destination surveys </ i>

130
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:18,596
<I> and then, one could multiply examples. </ I>

131
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:22,770
<I> The surveys also exist in Belgium, they exist in Germany, </ i>

132
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,457
<I> they exist in Britain, in Italy. </ I>

133
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:30,276
<I> Every time, the objective is the same: </ i>

134
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:33,894
<I> it is to describe the movements </ i>

135
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:39,840
<I> of a representative sample of the population in one day. </ I>

136
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:45,301
<I> This is therefore to collect a number of items on these movements. </ I>

137
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:48,596
<I> The measurement of the behavior of the population </ i>

138
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:52,372
<I> on travel is not done only by large surveys. </ I>

139
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:57,640
<I> There are also ad-hoc specific surveys which are conducted, </ i>

140
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,699
<I> for example on leisure mobility or major mobility. </ I>

141
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:08,464
<I> These are phenomena that can not be captured </ i>

142
00:10:08,464 --> 00:10:10,364
<I> by large national surveys, </ i>

143
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:13,947
<I> which are inherently somewhat general and generalistic. </ I>

144
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:20,936
<I> And so, these ad-hoc specific surveys </ i>
<i> are complementary to major investigations. </ I>

145
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:26,072
<I> I now propose to be a little </ i>
<i> more specific on these major surveys </ i>

146
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:31,712
<I> detailing a bit more about their
methodologies and their ambitions. </ I>

147
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:35,840
<I> I suggest you start with the micro-census transport and mobility </ i>

148
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,632
<I> which is the major survey that is conducted in Switzerland every five years, </ i>

149
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:45,744
<I> So this is a national survey, conducted since the mid-70s. </ I>

150
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:49,216
<I> It is carried out over a year, that is to say that every day, </ i>

151
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:52,440
<I> there are a number of people who are surveyed. </ I>

152
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,241
<I> Every day of the year. </ I>

153
00:10:55,241 --> 00:11:01,616
<I> The survey focuses on the permanent resident population aged 6 years and older. </ I>

154
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:07,028
<I> This is a telephone survey </ i>

155
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:10,552
<I> which covers all days of the year, </ i>

156
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:15,192
<I> so including holiday periods and including the weekend. </ I>

157
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:19,405
<I> In the survey content, </ i>

158
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:22,417
<I> in micro-census transport </ i>

159
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:26,961
<I> there are a number of socio-demographic data that are taken. </ I>

160
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:30,061
<I> A all section on vehicle ownership, </ i>

161
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:32,717
<I> of driving licenses and subscriptions. </ I>

162
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:40,005
<I> There's the daily mobility, usually the day before the survey </ i>

163
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,049
<I> and then there are a series of additional questions </ i>

164
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:49,058
<I> on the occasional mobility, especially on the weekend mobility, </ i>

165
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:51,022
<I> on vacation. </ I>

166
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:52,487
<I> Questions were also raised </ i>

167
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:59,270
<I> on the use of walking and cycling, exercising, </ i>

168
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:04,753
<I> and there is also a section devoted to issues of opinions </ i>

169
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:07,439
<I> on transport policy. </ I>

170
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:13,718
<I> Note an important point since the 2005 survey, </ i>

171
00:12:13,718 --> 00:12:17,653
<I> there is a geo-coding of places of residence </ i>

172
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:22,362
<I> from the start to the late stages of travels, </ i>

173
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:29,190
<I> So this basis the micro-census transport really allows </ i>

174
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,662
<I> to have a very accurate assessment of movements in space </ i>

175
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:37,174
<I> and time in everyday life. </ I>

176
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,834
<I> We have seen very briefly the methodology of the Swiss investigations, </ i>

177
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:45,414
<I> and so the micro-census transport. </ I>

178
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:47,415
<I> I now propose that we stop </ i>

179
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:49,823
<I> a little bit on the French investigations. </ I>

180
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:53,963
<I> So we will start with EMD, moving household survey. </ I>

181
00:12:53,963 --> 00:13:00,751
<I> So they are investigations conducted on the scale of an urban area. </ I>

182
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:05,391
<I> They also conducted on a key date </ i>

183
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:07,607
<I> like the micro-census transportation, </ i>

184
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:10,559
<I> but there is still a difference with the micro-census transportation </ i>

185
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,002
<I> that is this reference date is a weekday, </ i>

186
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,107
<I> so excluding the weekend. </ I>

187
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:22,896
<I> The mobility measured, is the mobility from Monday to Friday. </ I>

188
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:28,588
<I> Another feature of these surveys are conducted face to face, </ i>

189
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:36,240
<I> so there is an investigator moving from people's homes. </ I>

190
00:13:36,968 --> 00:13:41,292
<I> So we are not on a telephone methodology </ i>

191
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:45,380
<I> so we have high quality data. </ I>

192
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:50,709
<I> It should also be noted that the methodology of EMD </ i>

193
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:58,216
<I> has not changed since the 70s, which is exceptional. </ I>

194
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:03,188
<I> In most European countries, methods of data collection </ i>

195
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:07,229
<I> have evolved over time </ i>

196
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:13,132
<I> and here, we can really have exceptional time series with the EMD, </ i>

197
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,044
<I> which is also making its wealth. </ I>

198
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:20,337
<I> In addition to the EMD, there is the National Transport Survey </ i>

199
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:25,493
<I> which is conducted every ten years using a methodology similar </ i>

200
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:29,680
<I> and that can complete on a national scale </ i>

201
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,393
<I> household travel surveys that relate only to urban areas. </ I>

202
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:44,501
<I> That's so we came around the methods </ i>
<i> of major quantitative survey. </ I>

203
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:48,284
<I> Maybe just before going to methods known as qualitative, </ i>

204
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:53,017
<I> I would like to emphasize that these methods return </ i>

205
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:59,141
<I> to technics of passation which are very diversified. </ I>

206
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:01,808
<I> So there is the face to face, which we just talked about, </ i>

207
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:04,773
<I> about the French household surveys, </ i>

208
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:09,048
<I> where there is an investigator who is particularly suitable </ i>

209
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:10,696
<I> to long questionnaires. </ I>

210
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:13,561
<I> It provides very good reliability of responses </ i>

211
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:16,184
<I> but it's often difficult to reach people, </ i>

212
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:17,829
<I> appointments are hard to take, </ i>

213
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:22,533
<I> and then corollary of the fact that
there is an investigator who is moving from home to home, </ i>

214
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:25,972
<I> it is usually surveys with a very high cost. </ I>

215
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:30,110
<I> There are also surveys that are conducted by telephone. </ I>

216
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,828
<I> So, telephone surveys, </ i>

217
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:37,197
<I> this is for example the case of the micro-census Swiss transport. </ I>

218
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:40,832
<I> The transfer is much faster. It costs less. </ I>

219
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:45,409
<I> But the duration of the poll is more limited than face to face. </ I>

220
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,725
<I> The reliability of control, even if  progress has been made, </ i>

221
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:53,744
<I> is lower as well as at the face-to-face </ i>

222
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:58,293
<I> and then we have the sample selection problems </ i>

223
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:01,789
<I> since there are more and more people </ i>
<i> that are either out of the directory </ i>

224
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:05,749
<I> or which have no fixed telephone equipment, </ i>

225
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:08,217
<I> so we have representativeness problems </ i>

226
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,653
<I> with telephone surveys. </ I>

227
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:14,208
<I> Third type of survey, the surveys said epistolary </ i>

228
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:18,749
<I> where we send a questionnaire to the home of a sample of the population </ i>

229
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:21,544
<I> then asked them to fill them </ i>

230
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:24,458
<I> and to send them back. </ I>

231
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:28,688
<I> The questionnaires can be long, the survey is inexpensive, </ i>

232
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,369
<I> but the problem of this type of survey, </ i>

233
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:36,808
<I> is that the non-response rates are extremely high, </ i>

234
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:42,193
<I> and then, there is no possible exchange between an interviewer and an interviewee, </ i>

235
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:44,876
<I> as for example in a telephone survey </ i>

236
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:47,073
<I> or an inquiry face to face. </ I>

237
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,853
<I> That can sometimes lead to misunderstandings </ i>

238
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:52,796
<I> or misunderstandings of certain questions. </ I>

239
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,952
<I> And then finally, the last type of investigation at the handover, </ i>

240
00:16:56,952 --> 00:16:59,112
<I> the internet surveys, </ i>

241
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:04,692
<I> they tend to grow a lot in recent years. </ I>

242
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:07,124
<I> They allow quick returns </ i>

243
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:11,101
<I> but they have problems of representativeness, </ i>

244
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:13,551
<I> they have average response rates. </ I>

245
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:16,788
<I> It is very difficult to ensure that a person </ i>

246
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:21,237
<I> did not respond repeatedly to the same survey, </ i>

247
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:26,704
<I> so it is clear that the costs are low </ i>

248
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:32,932
<I> but the quality is sometimes a little limited </ i>

249
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:40,213
<I> if you did not quite elaborate devices of control and plausibility. </ I>

250
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,429
<I> We have seen in detail the quantitative surveys. </ I>

251
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:49,589
<I> I now propose to speak about qualitative surveys. </ I>

252
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:53,384
<I> This is the second large family of investigations. </ I>

253
00:17:53,384 --> 00:18:00,747
<I> They are not intended to count but they are aimed more to understand. </ I>

254
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:08,027
<I> As such, there is a precision that immediately must be made, </ i>

255
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:12,224
<I> it is that sometimes we have the feeling that quantitative surveys </ i>

256
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,672
<I> are - quotations marks - "more scientific" because there are numbers, </ i>

257
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:19,370
<I> because they give results that can be quantified. </ I>

258
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,952
<I> I would like to stress that qualitative surveys </ i>

259
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:25,451
<I> are no less scientific, simply, they have another aim. </ I>

260
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:30,187
<I> Here, the aim is not to quantify behaviors but to understand them. </ I>

261
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:36,873
<I> So this is really to understand the springs travels, </ i>

262
00:18:36,873 --> 00:18:40,371
<I> to understand the how and why. </ I>

263
00:18:40,932 --> 00:18:45,916
<I> There are a number of these qualitative surveys, </ i>

264
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,436
<I> of these qualitative survey techniques. </ I>

265
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:52,028
<I> The most common is that the interviews are carried </ i>

266
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:57,560
<I> to measure the mobility of comprehensive surveys, </ i>

267
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,004
<I> face to face or in a group, </ i>

268
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:02,432
<I> it can be more or less structured interviews, </ i>

269
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,284
<I> so it can be quite directive in order to understand really </ i>

270
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:09,164
<I> a given behavior in a given situation. </ I>

271
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:12,704
<I> So we will ask questions in relation to this specific situation, </ i>

272
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:14,584
<I> it can be much less directive, </ i>

273
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:19,464
<I> like for example surveys using methodologies </ i>

274
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:21,376
<I> like life stories </ i>

275
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:26,116
<I> where we try to understand the youth of certain behaviors, </ i>

276
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:30,377
<I> eg automobile related matters </ i>

277
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:34,016
<I> related to the life story of the person concerned. </ I>

278
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:38,585
<I> Qualitative surveys can also be comments, </ i>

279
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:41,544
<I> field observations, </ i>

280
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:45,448
<I> comments that may be participating or not participating. </ I>

281
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:51,112
<I> So, for example, an observation by an investigator </ i>

282
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:58,056
<I> on a crossroad of the cohabitation of all road users, </ i>

283
00:19:58,056 --> 00:20:01,944
<I> it can be a non-participant observation </ i>

284
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:04,484
<I> in that it does not intervene, </ i>

285
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:08,176
<I> simply, it measures, it notes a number of behaviors, </ i>

286
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:11,016
<I> of conflicts of use. </ I>

287
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:14,347
<I> But the observation can also be participating, </ i>

288
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:20,188
<I> in the sense that the investigator may intervene </ i>
<i> in the observation </ i>

289
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:22,584
<I> to ask additional questions </ i>

290
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:26,144
<I> to be sure he understands what he saw. </ I>

291
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:28,705
<I> More and more observation techniques </ i>

292
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:32,352
<I> call for video and photo, </ i>

293
00:20:32,352 --> 00:20:36,905
<I> which obviously helps to have a look perhaps more precise. </ I>

294
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:41,376
<I> It can also be video or photo, a nice backing </ i>

295
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:46,144
<I> to make interviewees talk </ i>

296
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,544
<I> that we might have observed on their practices. </ I>

297
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:53,516
<I> Last type of qualitative survey, </ i>

298
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:56,344
<I> which is used in the field of mobility, </ i>

299
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:58,921
<I> the monographs, these are surveys </ i>

300
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:03,532
<I> that address a community, a territory or a family. </ I>

301
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:04,952
<I> This is often quite lengthy investigations </ i>

302
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:09,936
<I> or at least taking into account the long time. </ I>

303
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:14,592
<I> To give an example, monographs could be made </ i>

304
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:20,276
<I> of Defence Associations of road users </ i>

305
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:22,701
<I> or promotion of public transport. </ I>

306
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:28,336
<I> So there it would describe the youth of these associations, </ i>

307
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:32,752
<I> the way they acted, their motivations, </ i>

308
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:35,352
<I> how they have evolved over time. </ I>

309
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:39,316
<I> This is valid for a very large number of players, </ i>

310
00:21:39,316 --> 00:21:45,220
<I> who can be finally considered in that way, </ i>

311
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,544
<I> whether they are public bodies or private actors </ i>

312
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,224
<I> or associative actors. </ I>

313
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:56,150
<I> The monograph, it can also be practiced on territory </ i>

314
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,660
<I> to make a monograph of the transport
policy in a given agglomeration </ i>

315
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:07,440
<I> and remake the history of decisions
that those decisions produced. </ I>

316
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,352
<I> This is also a qualitative monographic approach </ i>

317
00:22:11,352 --> 00:22:16,656
<I> which provides information on
transport and mobility policies. </ I>

318
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,385
<I> To end the qualitative surveys, </ i>
<i> I still wanted to emphasize their roles </ i>

319
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:27,255
<I> to finally impress to what they can be used for </ i>

320
00:22:27,255 --> 00:22:30,644
<I> compared to quantitative surveys </ i>

321
00:22:30,644 --> 00:22:35,548
<I> which are largely dominant in the field of mobility. </ I>

322
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:41,985
<I> The qualitative surveys enable truly comprehension. </ I>

323
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:46,272
<I> When we make a number of quantitative findings, </ i>

324
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,384
<I> for example the explosion of long-distance commuting, </ i>

325
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:51,492
<I> to give this example, </ i>

326
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:55,144
<I> or the development of dual residence. </ I>

327
00:22:55,144 --> 00:23:00,540
<I> We can measure it, we can say here, it evolves, it grows, </ i>

328
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,677
<I> it generates a number of traveled kilometers </ i>

329
00:23:02,677 --> 00:23:04,916
<I> by various means of transport </ i>

330
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,009
<I> but it does not give us the keys to understanding, </ i>

331
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:10,336
<I> we know how to quantify with a quantitative survey, </ i>

332
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,448
<I> but you may not understand what's behind it, </ i>

333
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:16,980
<I> finally, the phenomenon in question. </ I>

334
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:23,008
<I> This is what the qualitative surveys allow, </ i>

335
00:23:23,008 --> 00:23:27,384
<I> to understand why we commute on a long distance </ i>

336
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:30,684
<I> instead of ... why we are not moving, </ i>

337
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:35,984
<I> why we accept two </ i>
<i> hours of travel to work, </ i>

338
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:38,233
<I> why we do not move closer to our place of work. </ I>

339
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:42,265
<I> That is a qualitative survey that allows you to answer </ i>

340
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:44,552
<I> to a question of this type. </ I>

341
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:49,476
<I> The qualitative surveys, in this way, are extremely useful </ i>

342
00:23:49,476 --> 00:23:53,592
<I> to specify quantitative survey results </ i>

343
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:57,049
<I> and thus in combination with quantitative methods. </ I>

344
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:59,792
<I> In the area of ​​mobility, </ i>

345
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:03,356
<I> mixed surveys, quantitative qualitative </ i>

346
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:07,084
<I> probably have a great future because they allow exactly </ i>

347
00:24:07,084 --> 00:24:10,685
<I> both the quantized description of phenomena </ i>

348
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:17,553
<I> and the understanding of these phenomena in very fine terms. </ I>

349
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:21,404
<I> Qualitative methods and quantitative methods </ i>

350
00:24:21,404 --> 00:24:23,773
<I> are actually quite largely complementary, </ i>

351
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:29,204
<I> As you can see on this slide, </ i>
<i> which resumes </ i>

352
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:34,417
<I> the main features of these two great techniques. </ I>

353
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,814
We arrive at the end of this overview

354
00:24:37,814 --> 00:24:40,272
of measurement techniques of mobility.

355
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:42,664
Hope it has not stunned you too much.

356
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:47,095
You have seen the great diversity of techniques

357
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:50,292
that are available to measure daily mobility.

358
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:54,793
This diversity is truly a toolbox

359
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,357
in which we will draw the technique or combination of techniques

360
00:24:58,357 --> 00:24:59,945
which is the most appropriate

361
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:02,644
to answer the question that arises.

362
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:08,473
This is the message that we wanted to pass you in this video,

363
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:14,101
to each question its combination of measurement techniques.

364
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:16,445
Thank you for your attention.
