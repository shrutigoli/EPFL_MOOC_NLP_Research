<I> (voice speaking in different languages) </ i>

2
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:23,721
I will speak today about the barbecue effect.

3
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:26,931
The barbecue effect, in fact, means a research track

4
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,170
highlighted by some researchers.

5
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:32,637
A line of research that seeks to question

6
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:37,457
virtues that are frequently attributed
to the dense city in terms of mobility.

7
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:41,005
So what has led these researchers to formulate

8
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,275
this line of research?

9
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,415
What is it, this effect barbecue?

10
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:46,581
And what questions raises it ?

11
00:00:46,637 --> 00:00:49,366
It's a bit the three questions that will structure

12
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,507
my talk today.

13
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:04,347
The barbecue effect is born of three observations.

14
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,833
The first observation is that the urban form interacts

15
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,599
heavily on the behaviors of individual mobilities.

16
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:18,077
There are a lot of studies that show
that dense habitat, town centers

17
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:22,089
are associated with frequent use of public transport,

18
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:27,350
walking, cycling, while the plated areas, peri-urban areas

19
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,188
less dense, are associated with frequent use

20
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:34,353
of the automotive and also significant distances

21
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:35,944
for daily commuting.

22
00:01:35,944 --> 00:01:40,200
This link between urban form, in particular the density and mobility

23
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:45,324
is quickly associated with the
more or less durable nature of this mobility

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,649
since we know that the car generates much more nuisance

25
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,930
than other modes of transport, including an energy consumption

26
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,450
far more important.

27
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:55,918
It appeared that the dense city

28
00:01:55,918 --> 00:02:00,873
became the most urban form
capable of generating a mobility

29
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:01,744
more sustainable.

30
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:05,068
This link between urban form and type of mobility generated was

31
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:09,370
particularly highlighted by two Australian researchers,

32
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,068
Newman and Kenworthy, who have linked urban density

33
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:16,078
and energy consumption related to travel.

34
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:19,595
And so on a sample of more than 30 cities worldwide,

35
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:23,966
they highlight that the more dense a city is, the less important

36
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:26,326
the energy-related travel consumption is.

37
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:30,840
In contrast, the more it is spread over,
the more massive the consumption is.

38
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:34,630
So despite criticism towards their study, the curve

39
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,679
the Newman and Kenworthy curve highlighting this link

40
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:43,425
has greatly impressed people, including town planners, who today advocate

41
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:48,586
the compact city to promote the
emergence of a more sustainable mobility.

42
00:02:55,557 --> 00:03:00,734
Second observation: a whole lot of studies
that are based, in particular that of

43
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:04,766
Newman and Kenworthy, on the relationship
between urban form and mobility,

44
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:09,921
consider only the routine mobility, mobility conducted

45
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,510
during the week.

46
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,414
It is studies that do not take
into consideration the leisure traffic,

47
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:19,467
the mobility that is more occasional,
less constraint, and thus

48
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:22,049
more elusive.

49
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:32,141
Third observation: this leisure traffic today

50
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,732
is particularly important.

51
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:37,318
It must be said that leisure
occupies an essential place

52
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,733
of our lifestyles.

53
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:41,643
We still have more and more free time.

54
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:45,351
Today, leisure mobility, in many countries,

55
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:49,628
even constitutes the main
reason for population travel,

56
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:53,638
and this both in number of trips
but also in distance.

57
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:56,088
In Switzerland, for example, leisure mobility

58
00:03:56,088 --> 00:04:00,337
represent 37% of trips
against only 23% for work

59
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:01,862
and 22% for purchases.

60
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:04,777
In addition, these leisure trips, which are numerous,

61
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:08,206
are frequently made with high
consumer of energy transport:

62
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,608
the car, and especially the plane.

63
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:14,905
So from these three findings
was born the following question:

64
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:18,946
is this link between urban form
and mobility they often

65
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:22,189
highlighted, the same when we take into account

66
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:24,787
all mobility achieved by urban people,

67
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:28,455
including leisure mobility,
including mobility realized

68
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:30,635
on a long distance by plane?

69
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:39,340
One of the answers given to this question,

70
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,457
it is the barbecue effect.

71
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:42,997
The barbecue effect was stated at the beginning of the 2000s

72
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:46,239
by two French researchers,
Jean-Pierre and Daniel Orfeuil Soleyret

73
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:50,142
who were interested in the
interactions between local

74
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:53,084
short distance mobility and long distance mobility,

75
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,705
on weekdays and during weekends in France.

76
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,279
In their study, they demonstrate
that inhabitants of central areas,

77
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:03,949
of dense areas, of inner cities,
travel more frequently

78
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,298
for leisure than people from
more sprawling suburban areas.

79
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:13,505
And this difference is explained by them that suburban,

80
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:19,065
residents of suburban
housing have a residential environment

81
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:23,481
more favorable to spend
their free time, including a garden

82
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:25,769
or have forests nearby.

83
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,709
In contrast, city center dwellers should offset

84
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:33,569
this lack of green or environmental nature

85
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,925
in their everyday environment
and move more frequently

86
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:38,489
to enjoy it.

87
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:41,453
So the two researchers call this effect "barbecue"

88
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:47,075
named frim this traditional activity,
easily achievable in the outskirts,

89
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:49,862
and less practical in the city center.

90
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:54,228
In addition, they highlight the fact that these leisure travel,

91
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,359
as they are made by plane and over very long distances,

92
00:05:57,359 --> 00:06:02,942
are able to squarely challenge
the very clear relationship we

93
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:06,858
highlighted so far
between urban form and mobility.

94
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:11,049
So, according to them, we would have,
if we took into account that leisure traffic,

95
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:13,355
a curve that would have a different look.

96
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:18,015
The higher the density, the more
the movements comsume energy.

97
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:22,759
Eventually, this work led to question the urban density

98
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,747
and its virtues.

99
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:28,354
Is this density so beneficial that if, ultimately, drives

100
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:33,587
urban people to flee the city and to
seek opportunities they do not have

101
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:37,028
by plane and consume a lot of energy for this?

102
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,837
In my view, the barbecue effect raises three issues that are

103
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:43,931
so much interesting research paths.

104
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:57,439
First of all, the mechanisms of influence.

105
00:06:57,672 --> 00:07:01,266
The researchers demonstrated
statistical connections, but ultimately,

106
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:05,170
what pushes the inner city
to travel frequently and

107
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,632
over long distances?

108
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:10,685
Compared to the barbecue effect, I hypothesize

109
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:14,467
thaht the inner city have lifestyles that include

110
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,611
long-distance travel.

111
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:19,874
But these long-distance trips
are not all of the same type.

112
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:23,245
Some of these movements are related, actually,

113
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:27,560
with the search for nature, fresh air, pleasant environments

114
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,438
they do not have every day.

115
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,521
These movements can be called compensatory

116
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:35,849
as they will compensate a residential environment

117
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:39,382
they do not daily have elsewhere.

118
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:43,519
But there are other types of leisure trips also very important.

119
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,072
These are movements to find a city elsewhere,

120
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:49,647
to seek urban opportunities elsewhere.

121
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:53,068
Examples are all the weekends that are made by urban people

122
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:55,618
in other cities, particularly through the development

123
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:58,380
of low-cost airlines.

124
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,787
So the barbecue effect highlighted by Jean-Pierre Orfeuil

125
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:06,429
and Soleyret, would affect only a part of these movements.

126
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:08,498
That's an assumption I do.

127
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:17,833
Second question and second line of research,

128
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,656
the magnitude of this barbecue effect.

129
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:22,698
Is it really capable of challenging the virtues

130
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:23,702
of the dense city?

131
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:26,635
If one is interested only in a certain kind of movement,

132
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:30,409
compensatory movements precisely, it can be assumed that

133
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:35,060
based on certain characteristics of cities, including their size

134
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,881
and accessibility by public transport with the hinterland

135
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:40,921
of the urban area in question, the compensatory movements

136
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,381
can be achieved over shorter distances

137
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:46,115
and also with other means of transport than the car.

138
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:48,464
And in this case, these compensatory movements

139
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:51,077
would have an energy balance, environmental impact

140
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:52,067
that would be weaker.

141
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:56,265
So it may be that the city centers of the same density, depending oo

142
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:59,940
these criteria, do not generate similar compensating movements

143
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,477
and in some cases, these compensatory movements

144
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,107
do not reverse the curve of Newman and Kenworthy

145
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:09,350
and the dense city keeps all its advantages

146
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,997
in regards to mobility.

147
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,807
Again, an open question.

148
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,066
And then, the last line of research, can we finally act on the city,

149
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:27,366
build the city differently to generate less

150
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:31,442
compensatory movements to reduce this barbecue effect ?

151
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:35,248
The question is, what would look like

152
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:39,856
urban life enrionments who have both virtues of dense city,

153
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:43,514
and also, that would present interesting opportunities

154
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:47,219
for leisure, for residents of town centers, so they won't

155
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,362
spend a lot of energy to move a lot

156
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:53,605
to join the opportunities they do not have close by ?

157
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,848
And in this field, a question also essential:

158
00:09:56,848 --> 00:10:00,190
Is that, really, possible to act on leisure mobility

159
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,880
knowing that, in this area, the displacement is something

160
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:06,288
that permeates many performances.

161
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:09,896
For many, in fact, the holidays
are just synonymous to departure,

162
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:12,666
to mobility, and this very strong association

163
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,859
is completely independent from
residential contexts, eventually.

164
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:20,351
So it would ultimately be futile
to challenge the dense city

165
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:24,086
to act on these trips, which we would have

166
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:25,527
an incompressible balance.

167
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:29,780
So there, too, is an open question that should be explored.

168
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:33,390
These are the three trailss of research
around the barbecue effect

169
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,162
that I strive to continue in my PhD research

170
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:39,845
which covers the cities of Geneva and Zurich,

171
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:44,089
so a research that combines
quantitative and qualitative method,

172
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:46,682
and of which I might soon,
I hope, present to you

173
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:48,316
the main conclusions.

174
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:51,858
<I> (voice speaking in different languages) </ i>

175
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:57,683
<I> (voice speaking in different languages) </ i>
