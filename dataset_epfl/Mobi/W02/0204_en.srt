1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,239
The rapid development of public transport

2
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:09,489
has radically changed the lives of Roman Swiss

3
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:12,455
You will see now how a railway timetable

4
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:16,425
changed a city, and why it took just 330 meters of rails

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:18,425
to reshape the entire region.

6
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:24,915
(Journalist) If there is one thing the Swiss revere,

7
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:26,101
it is their trains.

8
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:31,144
The train is part of the landscape and almost of the DNA of the homo helveticus.

9
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:33,654
(Christophe) I received my first electric train,

10
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:35,284
I was about 8 years old,

11
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:39,714
and then it is a passion that has
grown like that ever since then.

12
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:43,714
I like working on my little trains in the evening,

13
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:44,894
it relaxes me.

14
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:50,633
(Journalist) Christophe Beuret defines himself as a railfan,

15
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,273
an addict of the world of railways,

16
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,719
when not playing with his toy trains,

17
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,685
he watches the new models to photograph them.

18
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:02,871
On his website, thousands of his pictures of trains,

19
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:05,691
of stations, and of his paintings

20
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,271
of trains, of course.

21
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,630
Christophe's life is on track,

22
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,750
he obviously takes the daily train to work.

23
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,060
(Christophe) So in general, I look out

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,674
and then on most lines

25
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:23,564
I look when such and such bifurcations come

26
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:27,734
or in such a station I know I can ... usually see this type of train, etc.

27
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:30,844
(Reporter) And guess where he works.

28
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:35,264
At the Federal Office of Transport, where he is responsible for rail traffic.

29
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:38,730
Today, more than 9,000 trains per day circulate in Switzerland

30
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,220
providing 80,000 connections,

31
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,600
and carrying more than one million people per day.

32
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,705
And the best is that the train ballet is repeated identically

33
00:01:48,705 --> 00:01:53,145
throughout the day, it is called the interval timetable.

34
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:55,755
(Christophe) An interval timetable is a schedule

35
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:59,015
that is repeated every hour in the same manner.

36
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:01,292
That is to say that if there is a train

37
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:05,292
going from one place from one city to another at a certain time,

38
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,534
one hour later,

39
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:10,756
we will have the same train that goes from the same city to this other city.

40
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,400
(Journalist) -What is the advantage for the user?

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,546
-For the user, it is extremely simple to know the schedule and know

42
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:21,966
that if he missed his train, an hour or half an hour later

43
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:25,126
it depends on the lines, he will have the same connection.

44
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:28,715
In Switzerland the first drafts of interval timetables

45
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,995
were in the Zurich region,

46
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:34,601
then the interval timetable for the all network

47
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:38,027
was introduced in the summer-hour of 1982.

48
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,797
(Journalist) To assess the path taken,

49
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:44,097
imagine an employee who lives in Freiburg,

50
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,837
but works in Bern.

51
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:50,835
In 1964, between six and ten o'clock,

52
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:55,235
there were eight trains at disposal but only four where direct

53
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:56,961
and if he missed the one at six hours

54
00:02:56,961 --> 00:03:00,587
he had to wait 1 hour and 4i minutes for the next direct one.

55
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:03,697
As for the schedule, they were so irregular

56
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:06,303
that they were almost impossible to memorize.

57
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:11,775
In 1982, our employee had twelve trains between six and ten o'clock.

58
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:15,725
There are six direct, two more than in 1964

59
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:17,771
and above all the interval timetable was set,

60
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,447
and wasmuch easier to remember.

61
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,923
Today, after the great rail reform of 2000

62
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:27,153
there are twenty Freiburg-Berne trains between six and ten o'clock

63
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:31,159
including twelve direct and, above all, all trains are clocked,

64
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,005
there is no need to look at one's watch.

65
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:35,188
It did look like much,

66
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:37,828
but this rail mutation has much more transformed

67
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:40,548
the face of Switzerland that many political reforms.

68
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,985
Take Yverdon.

69
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:47,444
Until the 80s, the capital of Northern Vaud was known

70
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,904
for its thermal waters and its industries.

71
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:54,598
The workshops SBB, the company famous Paillard

72
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,078
that manufactured typewriters and cameras,

73
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:59,568
or the Leclanché plant.

74
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:01,728
It's been ages since we stopped making

75
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:03,608
batteries at Leclanché.

76
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:06,628
Like others, the factory closed, the premises now house

77
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:08,318
artists and artisans.

78
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:13,491
André Jaccoud spent here nearly a half century,

79
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:18,591
he joined Leclanché at the age of 20 in 1964.

80
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,265
(André) The majority of people came to work

81
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:26,484
by walk and much more by cycling.

82
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:30,426
And then, there was no motor vehicles

83
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:32,836
except the vehicles of the company.

84
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,486
There was the car of the boss who had the right to come in,

85
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:38,456
but otherwise no other vehicle.

86
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:44,403
At that time, companies like SBB, Paillard and Leclanché

87
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:46,183
all came out at the same time,

88
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:48,303
the end of the workday was all at the same time,

89
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:50,963
then downtown there was suddenly everything

90
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:52,883
bicycle flood was coming in.

91
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:55,099
(Journalist) -There were traffic jams, then?

92
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:57,349
-This was not quite as in China,

93
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:00,604
but there were still some problems

94
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:04,464
and in any case there was every day a traffic officer to ensure

95
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:07,824
people to come out, even if there were few vehicles.

96
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:09,453
-For Bikes? -For Bikes.

97
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:16,037
(Reporter) The geographer Pierre Dessemontet lives in Yverdon,

98
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:18,837
He is a specialist in mobility,

99
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:24,051
he was very interested in the life of Yverdon of the 50s and 60s.

100
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:27,277
(Pierre) These lives really are focused at the local level

101
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:28,376
because transport

102
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:31,129
is much more painful and difficult than today.

103
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,534
There are few cars, relatively few trains,

104
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,564
it is quite expensive.

105
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:37,881
Same for the holiday, people move once a year

106
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:40,038
to go camping or to go to the seaside

107
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:41,438
or in another canton

108
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:43,277
but otherwise lives are very local.

109
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:47,117
Local companies are very active and in fact all social life is moving

110
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:50,577
around the same point: the city where you live for about two kilometers.

111
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:52,178
In a city like Yverdon

112
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:55,388
people get into the factory at 16, come out to 64, and in-between

113
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,088
they kept their jobs for 40, 45 years.

114
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:00,179
And so it allows you to organize all life

115
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:02,629
around this focal point that is the workplace.

116
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,619
We live nearby,

117
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,387
our social life is nearby.

118
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:08,787
(Journalist) Things are starting to move in the 80

119
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:11,997
and the train will take part in the metamorphosis of the city.

120
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:16,225
On May the 28th 1989, Yverdon is connected

121
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:17,781
to the network of intercity trains.

122
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:22,683
Lausanne is 22 minutes away, Geneva 46, and the syndicate is delighted

123
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,502
to place himself the signpost.

124
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:31,093
Cycling workers frome once were gradually replaced

125
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:34,074
by a new population : the commuters.

126
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:38,768
(Radio) It's 7:00, information ...

127
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:42,679
(Journalist) Sophie Recordon attacks her breakfast

128
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:45,379
and reads her mail.

129
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:48,399
The day begins, it will be long,

130
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,729
because Sophie works in Geneva.

131
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,709
Several times a week she finds at the station

132
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:58,368
the little people of commuters from Yverdon.

133
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:01,766
(Sophie) It is the platform of people who go to Geneva

134
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,886
the "Geneva Pendulum," and in front are the commuters

135
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:06,330
who go to Lausanne,

136
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,869
so on a three, four minutes intervall we see each other and say hi

137
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:11,306
from the dock for here.

138
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:18,457
(Journalist) Today in Switzerland, 2.7 million people depart daily

139
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:22,095
to work in another municipality than where they live.

140
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,579
(Sophie) There is a pretty special atmosphere,

141
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,191
that is to say that it is a very quiet atmosphere,

142
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,630
people are in a kind of meditation

143
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,983
before the excitement of the office.

144
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:40,465
During the trip I began to prepare answers to my emails and then yeah

145
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:43,187
I just started working, I work really.

146
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:45,450
-So It's not wasted time for you?

147
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,679
No, not at all, no no, it allows me to do, I would say,

148
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:50,919
the bridge between the office and home.

149
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,483
(Journalist) Living in Yverdon despite an office located

150
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:58,092
almost 100 kilometers away, it is Sophie's choice.

151
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:04,734
I grew up in a small village not far from here there, in the Jura,

152
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:09,559
and I did my gym in Yverdon, so after my studies in Geneva

153
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:10,787
after working 8 years in Geneva

154
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:13,675
it's true that I needed to come back a little to the roots.

155
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:16,311
(Journalist) 46 minutes after the departure,

156
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:19,633
the intercity from Yverdon enters Cornavin Station.

157
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:26,155
Sophie Recordon completes a trip she will redo tonight in reverse.

158
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:29,933
So here the bus number nine just came in

159
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:34,543
and then I have about 20 minutes to cross

160
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:37,243
the Mont Blanc bridge to get to my workplace.

161
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:39,152
-Yeah it is a sacred journey.
-Yeah.

162
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,064
-I Think it's there.
-Yeah, thank you goodbye.

163
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,666
-Good bye have a good day.
-Thank you.

164
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:46,066
(Journalist) In Switzerland 10% of commuters

165
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:49,354
as Sophie put over an hour to go to work

166
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:53,140
In addition to the train, highways opened in the 2000s

167
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,335
from Berne to Yverdon and Neuchâtel, boosted mobility.

168
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:03,460
In 1980, there were only 20% of Yverdon who took work

169
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,352
out of town and there were only20% of jobs in Yverdon

170
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:11,498
that were occupied by people from the outside.

171
00:09:12,282 --> 00:09:17,254
In 2012, 60% of Yverdon were working elsewhere

172
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:22,107
and 65% of Yverdon workstations are occupied by outsiders.

173
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:26,069
In a few years, it is a radical change.

174
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:30,946
It has enabled a new population to considered that Yverdon could be

175
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,926
a place where one could live while keeping jobs

176
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:34,956
in the Lake Geneva area.

177
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:37,910
-And the population here increases.
-It Increases strongly.

178
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,290
Yverdon-les-Bains has remained at around 20 000 inhabitants for a long time,

179
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,225
between the 60s and the 2000s,

180
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:46,075
but in the recent years there is a strong growth

181
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:48,645
of the population, so much that curently

182
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:49,805
it approches 30 000 inhabitants.

183
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,553
It is over 29 000 in 2013.

184
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:55,807
(Reporter) It also happens sometimes that an average transportation transforms,

185
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:58,727
not just a city, but downright an entire region.

186
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:02,743
Take the example of the LEB, the Lausanne-Echallens-Bercher

187
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:09,200
A venerable small local train that as run for 141 years

188
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,850
23 kilometers of the Vaud countryside.

189
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,149
Initially, the wheelbarrow, as it is nicknamed,

190
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,089
was mainly used for transporting area farmers

191
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,024
and their products that would sell in the capital markets in Lausanne.

192
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:27,031
Cristophe Jemelin is a geographer, he worked at TL

193
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:30,694
the Lausanne transport, on which the LEB depends.

194
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,440
At first, why Bercher?

195
00:10:34,897 --> 00:10:38,397
The line starts there for industrial reasons.

196
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,695
At the end of the nineteenth century there was a very large factory

197
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:47,386
of Nestle who was here and which justified that until 1912

198
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:49,842
most of the traffic was a freight traffic.

199
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:52,686
(Journalist) For years,

200
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:55,054
the barrow has carted tons of milk.

201
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:03,105
In 1971, the LEB relinquishes freight transport

202
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:05,570
for the only benefit of travelers.

203
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:11,709
In 1995, a milestone year, we finally demolish the old terminal,

204
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:17,220
the old station of the purest provisional western style since 1873.

205
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:23,644
But it was in 2000 that the LEB destiny will really tumble.

206
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:28,120
The line is extended to 330 meters of tunnel

207
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,423
from Chauderon up to the Flon station in the heart of Lausanne.

208
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:36,663
The venerable Lausanne-Echallens-Bercher is found just in front

209
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,803
the new Lausanne metro.

210
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:39,957
And that changes everything.

211
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,864
The LEB has been connected, somewhere, to the national grid,

212
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:44,348
Flon station is considered

213
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:46,694
as a nearly national network station.

214
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:50,979
There are tens of thousands of passengers transiting each day

215
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:55,056
between the M2 and the LEB, and in one minute of M" we are connected

216
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:57,819
to the Lausanne station so it has really opened

217
00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:00,670
all the majority of the Vaud canton to the national rail network.

218
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:05,642
(Journalist) 330 small meters more of rail

219
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:10,269
and since the constructions follow one another throughout the course.

220
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,132
Just between Cheseaux and Romanel is expected in the coming years

221
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:18,155
an increase in population equivalent to the city of Morges.

222
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:22,982
Just up the pastoral station of Ripes.

223
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:25,845
Here you will have several hundred people

224
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,738
in this cornfield.

225
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:32,627
Here probably you will have a public transport interface with the post bus.

226
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:34,438
This is one of many areas

227
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:37,779
that will know this very strong growth,

228
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,977
are expected several hundred new residents

229
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:44,696
along each of the stops of the LEB.

230
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,899
(Journalist) At 15 kilometers of Lausanne, Echallens.

231
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:54,428
2,000 inhabitants in 1977, 5500 and today it is not done.

232
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:56,804
Here too, sites are increasing.

233
00:12:57,144 --> 00:13:00,839
With the LEB, Echallens is only 28 minutes away from Flon.

234
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:03,799
If I tell you that Echallens is a suburb of Lausanne,

235
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,199
do I upset you?

236
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,370
-If you say a suburb of Lausanne, yes. (Laughs)

237
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:13,373
Nah, you did not really vexed me, but that does not correspond to reality

238
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:16,423
and I would say that Echallens is, of course,

239
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:18,263
in the basin of influence ...

240
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:19,746
-Of Lausanne.
-Of the capital.

241
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:23,535
And by developing a center, we took it in consideration.

242
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:26,655
-So this is not the suburbs, but that is still really

243
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,123
near Lausanne in fact.

244
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:30,340
-Absolutely, But so is the entire area.

245
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:34,213
(Reporter) And when the population increases,

246
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:37,234
the attendance of the LEB follows.

247
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:39,354
It carried one million passengers

248
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:47,078
per year in 1960, 3.2 million in 2013, and 12 million are planned for 2020.

249
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:50,899
That means 4 times more than today, with longer trains,

250
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,237
cadences every 10 minutes if not every 7 ½ minutes,

251
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:55,575
if not every 5 minutes,

252
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:57,699
there are several scenarios underway.

253
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:01,071
(Reporter) The LEB is embedded in the same rat race

254
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:03,421
as other public transport.

255
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:06,170
The more the supply grows, the more the demand increases.

256
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,502
In your opinion, how far can we go?

257
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:10,612
Is that in 20 years we will have cadancies

258
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:13,103
every 5 minutes, a train every 5 minutes?

259
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,270
I do not hope we will move that far to need

260
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,150
a train every 5 minutes.

261
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,827
Currently, the rate per hour, the half hour rate

262
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:26,507
on the mainline network is already huge.

263
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:28,419
The question we should ask is:

264
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:30,693
do we really have to move so much?
