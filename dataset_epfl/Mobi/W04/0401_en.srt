00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,524
Hello.

2
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:11,174
This week, in this video, I will talk about the concept of motility.

3
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:15,862
So the concept of motility is an analytical concept,

4
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:20,700
allowing addressing mobility in a new light

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,063
from people's skills,

6
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:26,137
and more generally from actors',

7
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:30,670
which allows then to overcome the limitations which have been identified

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:36,231
to the concept of mobility in the past week.

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,637
Then, during last week's the lesson,

10
00:00:40,637 --> 00:00:45,528
we discussed the limitations of the concept of mobility,

11
00:00:45,528 --> 00:00:49,286
as it is used in research in particular

12
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:53,341
and we also have identified a number of points

13
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:56,742
that are important to work on mobility.

14
00:00:57,115 --> 00:01:01,813
So I would start from three of these points this week

15
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:05,115
to introduce you to the concept of motility.

16
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:11,484
So these things first, there is the question that

17
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:14,940
mobility ultimately depends on the possibilities

18
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,407
offered by a given context.

19
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:23,907
Mobility, in other words, is situated.

20
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:28,472
If you live in Lausanne, or if you live Abidjan

21
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:29,939
or if you live in New York,

22
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,178
you do not have the same opportunities to move in space

23
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:37,355
or to move within the social space.

24
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:41,863
Thus the mobility is defined as a phenomenon which is located,

25
00:01:41,863 --> 00:01:44,289
it is something that is absolutely essential

26
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:48,893
especially when we want to develop a urban planning policy

27
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:50,694
that accounts for this phenomenon.

28
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:54,212
So that's the first point I would like to emphasize.

29
00:01:55,332 --> 00:02:00,003
Secondly we also saw last week,

30
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:05,414
that mobility depends on the skill of the actors.

31
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:10,563
That is something that may seem to be banal,

32
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,435
but I think is extremely important.

33
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:16,368
Driving without a license is difficult.

34
00:02:17,463 --> 00:02:21,500
That may be the simplest thing in relation to these skills,

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,200
this is the most immediate example that comes to mind

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,833
but say, here, to move, to be mobile,

37
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,832
it supposes to have a number of skills,

38
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:42,200
it presupposes a series of skills that it is important to go exploring.

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,593
So that's the second point I want to stress on.

40
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,870
And the third point I want to emphasize,

41
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,975
is that mobility is partially activated as a form of travel.

42
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:59,152
That is also something that is absolutely essential.

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,685
Too often in the analyzes on mobility,

44
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,915
we had seen the last week

45
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:10,158
finally, we are interested in trips made

46
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:15,128
and we are less interested in travels which could have been achieved

47
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:20,892
but were not achieved and that ultimately remained in the potential state.

48
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:26,347
So from the critics we saw last week,

49
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:31,184
from these aspects that I have just recalled,

50
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:39,280
I propose three aspects to understand mobility,

51
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:43,861
three aspects which actually refer to methodological considerations.

52
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:47,781
So the first aspect,

53
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:51,738
is to understand mobility as a social phenomenon.

54
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:54,750
So social phenomenon, what does that mean?

55
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,978
This is a concept that has been defined by Marcel Mauss,

56
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:05,394
it simply means that through the prism of mobility,

57
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:08,654
calls itself a company as a whole.

58
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:12,327
That is to say that it can be read from mobility,

59
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:16,635
or in other words, that mobility is a social developer

60
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,887
seen through the analysis of mobility,

61
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:25,065
power relations within a society and thus ultimately

62
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:29,208
mobility provides information on the company as a whole.

63
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:33,474
So that's the first methodological proposal

64
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:36,258
to address mobility.

65
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:38,986
Second methodological proposal,

66
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:42,695
we propose to consider mobility

67
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:47,390
as a spatial and temporal social assembly.

68
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:50,659
We saw that in the end, the analysis of mobility

69
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,827
was often very focused on the spatial aspects

70
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:57,482
but the temporal aspects, the temporality of mobility

71
00:04:57,482 --> 00:05:02,292
are absolutely essential and so is the social dimension.

72
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:07,432
The space, the relationship to space, travels in space

73
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:14,565
are ultimately a dimension of social mobility that may be wider

74
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:20,406
or in other words, space as we understand it in this course,

75
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:24,414
is one of the dimensions of the company and therefore, by definition,

76
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:28,237
mobility is also social.

77
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,643
That is the second proposal.

78
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:36,903
Third proposal, we propose to analyze mobility

79
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,414
from the potential of every actor

80
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:44,707
and this is where the concept of motility comes,

81
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:50,311
which eventually is particullary the subject of the present video.

82
00:05:52,106 --> 00:06:00,545
From these methodological principles, I propose to deal concretely

83
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:06,512
mobility ultimately concerned with three levels of analysis that must

84
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:13,832
be considered to deal with the mobility completely.

85
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,314
So, the first dimension which falls within the territory,

86
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:20,851
this is what could be called the catch

87
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:25,238
or the potential home of territory for mobility.

88
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:32,564
Finally, each country has a number of amenities,

89
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:35,271
a number of transport systems

90
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,703
which offer special accessibility,

91
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,331
that are accessible on certain conditions,

92
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,095
including financially,

93
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:46,770
and this is obviously a contextual aspect in the broad sense

94
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,417
which is absolutely essential to work on mobility.

95
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:54,464
So this is the first of three dimensions that are proposed

96
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:56,271
to grasp mobility.

97
00:06:56,271 --> 00:07:00,912
The second dimension is that of motility.

98
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:05,933
So what is the dimension of the capacity of actors to move,

99
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:08,033
of their skills

100
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:11,998
So this is something that is unique to people

101
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,739
or to collective actors.

102
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:21,430
We all have more or less good capacity to organize ourselves,

103
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,119
to project ourselves into space.

104
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,597
We like or not to move, we are gifted or not to drive,

105
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:33,957
we are very familiar with the network of public transport,

106
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:41,595
we like to do physical exercise through the use of bicycles etc.

107
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:45,196
All these things refer to skills

108
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:48,955
which define a personal level, in terms of the person

109
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:52,079
but can also be defined more collectively,

110
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:58,225
so this is motility, so this is the second level of analysis.

111
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:03,191
And then the third level of analysis is called activation,

112
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,596
it is finally displacement carried out.

113
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:13,579
Finally, motility, our ability to move,

114
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:17,390
remains partly in a potential state,

115
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,188
So suddenly, it is very important to focus

116
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:25,019
on the trips that are made, of course,

117
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,078
but also to all those we do not realize.

118
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:30,191
And therefore, this dimension of activation,

119
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:33,356
what is activated under the form of travel,

120
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:35,047
what remains in the state of potential,

121
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:39,385
it is a third level of analysis that is absolutely essential.

122
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:45,915
<I> If we try to schematize these considerations, </ i>

123
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:52,016
<I> what we propose to do beyond these levels, </ i>

124
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:55,141
<I> catches, motility and activation, </ i>

125
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:58,226
<I> it's finally going from the motility </ i>

126
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:02,551
<I> of people to analyze or actors to analyze mobility, </ i>

127
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:07,580
<I> that is to say to consider the genesis of mobility </ i>

128
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,611
<I> in the minds of people or in the minds of actors, to put it differently. </ I>

129
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:17,263
<I> So this motility is composed of ... </ i>

130
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:20,803
<I> we all have access to a number of means of transport, </ i>

131
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:24,906
<I> acces to these means of transport is subject to certain conditions. </ I>

132
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:30,210
<I> There is also a range of skills that can be mobilized </ i>

133
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,304
<I> to be mobile and then, </ i>

134
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:35,340
<I> there is a third dimension which is essential </ i>

135
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,045
<I> that can be called appropriation, </ i>

136
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:40,111
<I> you could also call the project, projects, </ i>

137
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:45,018
<I> we like or not to travel, we like to be somewhere else, </ i>

138
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:50,476
<I> we appreciate the relationship to otherness or not </ i>

139
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:55,203
<I> and this is the third dimension finally </ i>
<i> important of mobility. </ I>

140
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:59,990
<I> These three dimensions, and that's why we put small arrows </ i>

141
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,266
<I> between the three dimensions in both directions, </ i>

142
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,590
<I> finally, these three dimensions, </ i>

143
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,281
<I> they are quite widely in interaction. </ I>

144
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:12,457
<I> And so these three dimensions form motility, </ i>

145
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:17,430
<I> that is to say the ability to move a person or an actor. </ I>

146
00:10:18,057 --> 00:10:22,494
<I> So that's a bit what is proposed as a basic approach, </ i>

147
00:10:22,494 --> 00:10:26,589
<I> as a basic level to address the issue of mobility, </ i>

148
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:31,297
<I> to start from these skills to move. </ I>

149
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:36,277
<I> The ability to move then turns into trips. </ I>

150
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:40,993
<I> So, that's the dimension of activation. </ I>

151
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,170
<I> They become movements </ i>

152
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,493
<I> but remain partly into potential state. </ I>

153
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:51,307
<I> In general, exceptions put aside, </ i>

154
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:55,767
<I> all our motility does not turn into trips. </ I>

155
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,589
<I> Especially compared to trips </ i>

156
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:03,731
<I> from the perspective that we have chosen to address, </ i>

157
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:07,589
<I> movement may be different in nature. </ I>

158
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:10,830
<I> Trips, are the movements in everyday life, </ i>

159
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,930
<I> it can be residential mobility, </ i>
<i> it could be travel, </ i>

160
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:21,874
<I> we came out of a vision, where eventually </ i>
<i> daily mobility was on one side, </ i>

161
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:25,784
<I> residential mobility, travel, </ i>

162
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:29,635
<I> and everything would overlap according to specific spatio-temporal logic. </ I>

163
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:34,121
<I> No! Here, the idea is ultimately to say, from motility, </ i>

164
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:37,359
<I> that is to say, from the ability to move, </ i>

165
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:39,799
<I> well, finally, we move, </ i>

166
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,907
<I> we do crafts on travel, </ i>

167
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:47,147
<I> that articulate the different forms of travel </ i>

168
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:51,362
<I> spatially, temporally and socially. </ I>

169
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,426
<I> And the third element, </ i>

170
00:11:55,426 --> 00:12:00,088
<I> you see that we have included the term mobility, </ i>

171
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:02,122
<I> as encompassing, </ i>

172
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,996
<I> well finally, it will be considered in this approach, </ i>

173
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:08,942
<I> that mobility, that's all. </ I>

174
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:11,331
<I> This is finally the result. </ I>

175
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:16,930
<I> That is to say, it's motility, it is the ability to move, </ i>

176
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:22,607
<I> it's obviously also all journeys that are made </ i>

177
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:29,045
<I> and those that are not made and remain in the state of latency </ i>

178
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:31,807
<I> or the potential sleeping in motility. </ I>

179
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:35,370
<I> It could be added for completeness </ i>

180
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:42,091
<I> that mobility in this context is located, </ i>

181
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:47,338
<I> that is to say actually that offered opportunities </ i>

182
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:49,982
<I> are not the same across regions of the world, </ i>

183
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:55,919
<I> following even same regions of a country, and therefore, this mobility, </ i>

184
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:02,400
<I> it is dependent on the potential home </ i>
<i> it met in a given context. </ I>

185
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:08,210
<I> Mobility, as we just saw it, </ i>

186
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,209
<I> has the advantage of being a two-dimensional concept. </ I>

187
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,852
<I> I was saying just now, </ i>

188
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:24,885
<I> mobility must be considered, that is what is proposed in any case, </ i>

189
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:28,126
<I> as a total social phenomenon, </ i>

190
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:32,420
<I> that is to say, a phenomenon from which </ i>

191
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,704
<I> it is possible to read the power relations of a society, relationships with space, </ i>

192
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:46,367
<I> the relations of domination, how to build lifestyles etc </ i>

193
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,149
<I> This is finally a phenomenon that provides information on all of a society, </ i>

194
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:55,839
<I> it's finally a way to read a society. </ I>

195
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:02,118
<I> Then, mobility, in regards to this, is two-dimensional, </ i>

196
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,667
<I> that is to say, we found, </ i>

197
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:08,435
<I> through the motility of indicators that we could build, </ i>

198
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:11,796
<I> for the needs of different empirical research </ i>

199
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:16,058
<I> motility has a vertical dimension, </ i>

200
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:20,873
<I> that is to say, we can be much or little endowed with it. </ I>

201
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:25,361
<I> It is found in the population of people who have a very strong motility, </ i>

202
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:28,120
<I> which are highly mobile, which have large capacity to move, </ i>

203
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,648
<I> and others who have much less the ability to move. </ I>

204
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:36,365
<I> So that's the vertical dimension. </ I>

205
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:40,733
<I> But mobility also has another dimension, </ i>

206
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:44,167
<I> which is a horizontal dimension, </ i>

207
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:47,764
<I> and the horizontal dimension is that in the end, </ i>

208
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:50,698
<I> seen through the analysis we have done, </ i>

209
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:54,246
<I> mobility, can be provided in different ways. </ I>

210
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:58,991
<I> Some people have a greater aptitude, for example </ i>

211
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:01,523
<I> to move in everyday life </ i>

212
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:05,403
<I> and are not afraid to spend much time in transport, </ i>

213
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:07,815
<I> are able to deal in these means of transport, </ i>

214
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:11,653
<I> while others have little of this ability, </ i>
<i> to give an example, </ i>

215
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:16,828
<I> but on the other hand have a great aptitude </ i>
<i> to uproot themselves from a place where they live </ i>

216
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:20,520
<I> to go take root elsewhere, through a move. </ I>

217
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:26,183
<I> So there, we indeed are in horizontality, </ i>
<i> that is to say that it is difficult to say </ i>

218
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:30,490
<I> who between a person who likes to move a lot </ i>

219
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,296
<I> during the day, and that obviously has a lot of skills for that </ i>

220
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:38,309
<I> versus another person who has little these skills </ i>

221
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:41,795
<I> but on the contrary, many skills, </ i>

222
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:45,889
<I> and appreciate to move, to uproot and take root elsewhere </ i>

223
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:50,699
<I> has an ability to get in touch, </ i>
<i> to rebuild social networks elsewhere, </ i>

224
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,648
<I> it's hard to say which of these two has the most motility. </ I>

225
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:57,433
<I> In fact, it's different motilities </ i>

226
00:15:57,433 --> 00:16:01,067
<I> and probably can not be quantified. </ I>

227
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:05,872
<I> What can we say, and that is the horizontal dimension of motility, </ i>

228
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:11,560
<I> is that eventually these people have different abilities to move. </ I>

229
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:16,807
<I> So the value of this concept, </ i>

230
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:20,225
<I> with respect to the verticality and horizontality, </ i>

231
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:22,226
<I> is that from a theoretical point of view, </ i>

232
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:28,663
<I> it is possible to talk of the approaches of the company </ i>

233
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:34,308
<I> who would rather be post-modern or post-structuralist, </ i>

234
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:37,567
<I> that tell us that contemporary societies </ i>

235
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:40,403
<I> are especially built from horizontality, </ i>

236
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:43,067
<I> from differences in lifestyles, </ i>

237
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:47,936
<I> differences in social, spatial mobility </ i>

238
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:54,779
<I> and to communicate these approaches with more structuralist approaches, </ i>

239
00:16:55,225 --> 00:17:00,162
<I> where finally, the idea is that a society </ i>

240
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:03,585
<I> is built first from reporting relationships, </ i>

241
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,029
<I> of vertical relationships, </ i>

242
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:11,567
<I> and that it is therefore first from these vertical relationships </ i>

243
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:17,067
<I> that it is possible to read and understand a society. </ I>

244
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,496
<I> So you see there that, </ i>

245
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:25,967
<I> by this verticality and horizontality of the concept of motility, </ i>

246
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,733
<I> it is possible to work on both levels, </ i>

247
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:31,290
<I> and consider spatial mobility </ i>

248
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,260
<I> as belonging to a structuralist approach, </ i>

249
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:42,725
<I> that is to say under ... logic within social categories, </ i>

250
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:47,819
<I> of income levels, education levels </ i>

251
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:50,947
<I> and these considerations, </ i>

252
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:54,757
<I> finally return to the vertical structure of a company, </ i>

253
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:59,542
<I> but also of the horizontal dimension, </ i>

254
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:02,787
<I> that is to say, the differences between people in terms </ i>

255
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:06,631
<I> of styles of life or lifestyle or relationship to space, </ i>

256
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:12,725
<I> that are not directly related to the question of hierarchy. </ I>

257
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,041
<I> So, a notion as motility, </ i>

258
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,340
<I> and then more generally, an approach </ i>

259
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,435
<I> as the one I have just presented, </ i>

260
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:26,435
<I> it only makes sense if it allows you to see new things. </ I>

261
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:30,401
<I> So, I'd maybe just, </ i>

262
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:37,198
<I> to complete this video, open, lift a little bit the veil, </ i>

263
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:41,599
<I> on empirical explorations that we could do, </ i>

264
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,980
<I> with the concept of mobility, </ i>

265
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,068
<I> and more generally with the approach to mobility that I have just presented. </ I>

266
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:58,761
<I> There's a result that is very strong, and that is quite striking, </ i>

267
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:02,859
<I> and is probably very useful for territory planning, </ i>

268
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:05,725
<I> and this result is that, in the end, </ i>

269
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:09,195
<I> a lot of people, and probably more, </ i>

270
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:14,871
<I> are looking for a reversibility of mobility. </ I>

271
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:18,922
<I> What is meant by that? </ I>

272
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:22,449
<I> Well, it's just that many people use </ i>

273
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:26,193
<I> the possibilities offered to them by transport systems </ i>

274
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,413
<I> and remote communication systems, </ i>

275
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:32,599
<I> which have grown substantially in recent years </ i>

276
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:39,386
<I> to finally make the move as reversible as possible. </ I>

277
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:43,032
<I> That is to say, to ensure that these trips </ i>

278
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:46,067
<I> have the least impact on their lives </ i>

279
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:49,359
<I> even if they have to go far in their daily lives, for example. </ I>

280
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:52,966
<I> This is something we see a lot with the development </ i>

281
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:55,934
<I> of the long-distance commuting. </ I>

282
00:19:55,934 --> 00:20:00,296
<I> In a number of countries in Europe, </ i>

283
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:04,469
<I> when you find a job 100 kilometers away or even sometimes more </ i>

284
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,526
<I> from your home, well you don't not move anymore </ i>

285
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:09,568
<I> but you make daily round trips, </ i>

286
00:20:09,568 --> 00:20:17,131
<I> by car on the motorway or by using the train, </ i>

287
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:21,328
<I> and therefore, that's typical of this logic of reversibility. </ I>

288
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:26,261
<I> This is the idea that in the end, we will try to ensure </ i>

289
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:30,227
<I> that mobility has the least possible impact on our life, </ i>

290
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:31,969
<I> So we will avoid to move, </ i>

291
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:35,893
<I> what would be rather an irreversible movement, </ i>

292
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:40,502
<I> to instead focus on reversible travel solutions, </ i>

293
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:45,959
<I> that is to say, back and forth throughout the day or week. </ I>

294
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:49,391
<I> So we will have much opportunity in the course </ i>

295
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:52,338
<I> to address that issue, </ i>

296
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:57,630
<I> which is undoubtedly a trend of the recent evolution of mobility. </ I>

297
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:03,227
<I> I wanted to talk immediately, saying in effect, </ i>

298
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:07,182
<I> it is the concept of motility allowing truly </ i>

299
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:12,381
<I> to take the measure of this phenomenon and to actually update it. </ I>
