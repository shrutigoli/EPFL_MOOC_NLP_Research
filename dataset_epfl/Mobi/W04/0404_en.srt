1
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:06,597
Hello.

2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:09,730
Research work on unemployment shows

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,829
that the mobility of people in space,

4
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:13,714
or at least their capacity to be

5
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,929
is a quality that can be critical to finding a job.

6
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:19,517
This injunction to mobility may be important

7
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:22,036
in some areas of highly specialized activities.

8
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:25,654
It is sometimes necessary to resort to significant daily trips

9
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:29,062
or a move to reconcile private and professional life.

10
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,021
Thus, in bi-active couples,

11
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,533
it can be difficult to find a spatial consensus

12
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,102
to minimize the distance home to work for both people.

13
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:41,553
In this session, we focus on these intensive mobilities

14
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:44,034
work related that are mainly covering

15
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:48,621
long-term commuting and frequent absences from the main home

16
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:52,037
from traveling for business or weekly roundtrips

17
00:00:52,037 --> 00:00:54,447
between the main house and a pied-a-terre close

18
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:56,247
from workplace.

19
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:58,203
This phenomenon is not anecdotal.

20
00:00:58,203 --> 00:01:00,902
One in two is concerned with a situation like this

21
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:02,799
at some point in his career.

22
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,075
The purpose of this presentation is to know

23
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:08,566
if the use of a motility measure is relevant and useful

24
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:10,089
for a better understanding

25
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:12,682
of the issue of large job-related mobilities.

26
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:14,897
This presentation is based on a survey conducted

27
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:16,243
in four countries:

28
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,396
Germany, Spain, France and Switzerland.

29
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:20,826
They are panel data

30
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:23,951
that is to say that the same people were surveyed for the first time in 2007,

31
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,951
then again in 2011.

32
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:29,075
Qualitative interviews were also carried out in France,

33
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:31,192
with a large mobile population.

34
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,412
French and Swiss parts of the second survey wave

35
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:36,761
were funded by the mobile lives forum.

36
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:39,041
To illustrate the results that I will present,

37
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,411
I used drawings from a cartoon

38
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,052
called Slices of Mobile Life,

39
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:46,124
that we published with Stephanie Geslin Vincent and Vincent Kaufmann.

40
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:48,764
These drawings are presented with the courtesy

41
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:51,560
of the designer Jean Leveugle and the publishers.

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,384
In accordance with what was presented to you

43
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,696
in the more theoretical sessions on motility,

44
00:01:55,696 --> 00:02:00,055
we sought to characterize the access, skills and projects

45
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:01,916
in connection with the great mobility.

46
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,080
We start here by access.

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,692
Contextual said access were characterized in our research

48
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:11,588
by the proximity of a highway, a regional train line,

49
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:14,416
a large railway and airport.

50
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,557
Thus, 9 out of 10

51
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:20,177
have a highway or a regional train line less than 20 minutes.

52
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:23,783
60% of people on average have an airport less than 45 minutes away

53
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:27,005
and a large railway less than 20 minutes away.

54
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:31,317
The presence of railway infrastructure is even more important since we know that

55
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,147
more than the distances are large,

56
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:36,052
more the use of the train increases

57
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:38,208
mainly because the transport time

58
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,641
can be upgraded more easily than by car,

59
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:43,400
for example by working or resting.

60
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,107
Beyond these contextual access,

61
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:48,906
it is necessary to discuss personal access

62
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:52,198
starting with the car or other motorized modes

63
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:53,946
like the two-wheeled motors type,

64
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:57,034
which can be useful for managing loaded activity programs

65
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,006
like those of the major mobile.

66
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:02,530
Access to various information and communications technology

67
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,134
is also seen in our work.

68
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:09,874
You will notice here that Martin with me is holding a cell phone

69
00:03:09,874 --> 00:03:11,359
in his right hand.

70
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:16,646
Tics play an effective role in the appropriation

71
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,366
of transport times.

72
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:22,245
They can afford to stay in touch with relatives, sometimes distant,

73
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:25,263
or can participate in creating a familiarity bubble

74
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:26,863
avoiding interactions.

75
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:30,065
They also facilitate access to transport networks,

76
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:33,506
schedules, locations, the ticketing, etc.

77
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:39,342
For mobility, various skills can be very useful.

78
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:42,633
Mastering foreign languages ​​especially English,

79
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,302
is thus part of the ongoing development

80
00:03:45,302 --> 00:03:47,076
of an European labor market.

81
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:50,819
English is also helpful since the person is brought

82
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,510
to make business trips abroad.

83
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:56,826
In addition, we considered the ability of people

84
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:59,115
to read a map and orientate oneself in space

85
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:02,491
but also skills such as the ability to consider

86
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:06,006
the opportunities of moving to a new region.

87
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,827
The way people are able

88
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:12,298
to appropriate transportation time to value,

89
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:14,730
as does Martin, always by my side,

90
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,426
Another point of useful skills for mobility.

91
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,510
The projects on mobility vary widely among individuals.

92
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:27,911
To consider them, we questioned the disposition of these people

93
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:31,341
to move to another region, overseas,

94
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:34,165
to commute more than a two-hour round trip,

95
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:36,112
to make frequent trips to their work,

96
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:39,281
or to take a pied-a-terre and doing a round-trip

97
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:42,408
every week between here and the main housing.

98
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:47,144
37% of people on average say they would commute

99
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:50,170
against 18% for moving abroad.

100
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,020
Based on all of these elements,

101
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,770
we have been able, through

102
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,241
statistical analysis

103
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:58,904
of factor analysis type and hierarchical classification,

104
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:02,992
to construct a typology of motility in connection with the mobility.

105
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:07,221
We got six groups we offer now

106
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:10,110
to describe in pairs of opposites.

107
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,187
The first of these pairs of opposites returns

108
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,946
to an ordinal reading of motility, that is to say to have more or less of it.

109
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:19,203
Low mobile on one side,

110
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:23,440
are people who combine low access, low skills,

111
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,699
with no project for mobility.

112
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:30,067
Conversely, highly mobile people have good access,

113
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:32,258
their skills are more developed

114
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:34,179
and they say they are ready to move

115
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:37,315
and ready for most forms of mobility.

116
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:42,572
Note that people with higher levels of education and income

117
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:47,097
are found in greater proportion in the highly mobile group.

118
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:52,817
The second pair of opposition concerns reversible and non-reversible.

119
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:56,160
It allows to highlight the opposition in projects

120
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,224
between people who are willing to relocate

121
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:01,731
but not wishing to commute, and those who think the opposite,

122
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:04,025
that is to say they do not want to move,

123
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:07,132
but are ready for intensive commuting.

124
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:10,527
This returns to questions of anchoring at residence.

125
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:13,416
This anchoring can be linked with being the owner,

126
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:17,864
but also a residential location close to relatives or friends,

127
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:19,957
or even an attachment to places

128
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:22,132
in which routines were implemented.

129
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,293
This opposition is also that of a vision of what

130
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,693
the quality of life for people

131
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:28,295
who do not wish to be forced

132
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:31,832
to spend several hours daily in transportation.

133
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:36,400
We can clearly see that there is no group more mobile than the other.

134
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,088
Reversible nor non-reversible are more gifted than the other.

135
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:46,032
The approach of mobility allows especially here to highlight

136
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:48,530
lifestyles that are different.

137
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,657
To simplify the reading of the last couple of opposition

138
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:54,429
we propose to combine the access and skills

139
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:57,784
in what might be called power, being great mobile,

140
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,452
while projects concerned the will to be great mobile.

141
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:07,232
Thus, those reluctant to move far can move, but do not want to.

142
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:09,767
Indeed, skills and access are good,

143
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,700
compared to the rest of the population,

144
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,389
but they do not want to move or use

145
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,124
forms of mobility.

146
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:20,760
Conversely, those willing to move cannot move a lot, but want to a lot.

147
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,756
It means that despite the skills and low access,

148
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:28,507
they declare themselves ready to move to commute or travel frequently.

149
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:31,201
Those reluctant to move are more people

150
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,860
which are in the second part of their careers,

151
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,660
their level of education is high overall,

152
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,663
their income level also is.

153
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:40,856
These are usually more Germans or Swiss

154
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:42,824
than French or Spanish.

155
00:07:42,824 --> 00:07:45,588
Those ready to move are younger,

156
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:48,551
their levels of income and education are low overall,

157
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,856
and they are rather French mostly Spanish.

158
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:57,432
The economic crisis that plagued specifically in Spain,

159
00:07:57,432 --> 00:08:00,104
and in lesser measures in France

160
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:05,336
seems directly linked to the growth of this group from 2007 to 2011.

161
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,989
The analysis of mobility of people and its evolution in time

162
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,606
iquire about what determines the use

163
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:14,830
of high mobility practices related to work.

164
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,763
Thus, the great mobile finds its justification in the complex articulation

165
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:22,639
between private and professional spheres,

166
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,898
in consideration of a supply of transport and travel.

167
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:29,234
From the perspective of motility, we found in our analysis,

168
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:33,170
how projects could evolve between 2007 and 2011,

169
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,322
with a number of events.

170
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,623
From a personal point of view, first,

171
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:40,219
when couples merge or separate,

172
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,743
or upon the arrival of a child,

173
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:44,255
arbitrages on residential location

174
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:47,755
and on the possible use of mobility are redesigned.

175
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:50,863
Note also that when there are children in a couple,

176
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,812
projects related to mobility

177
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:56,563
concern more often men than women.

178
00:08:56,563 --> 00:08:58,922
These, by their role

179
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:02,159
often in household are often unable

180
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,815
to articulate mobility and family life with children.

181
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:10,963
Professionally now, high mobility projects prove

182
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:14,055
to be dependent on the economic context of the living territory.

183
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:17,256
On this graph it is observed that in the regions

184
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:21,523
where unemployment rose sharply between 2007 and 2011,

185
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:23,695
especially due to the economic crisis,

186
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:26,472
the provisions, ie, projects,

187
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:30,723
of people are greater vis-a-vis the use of mobility.

188
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,540
It is particularly striking to observe that this concerns both

189
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,639
people who have low access and low skills than the reverse.

190
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,715
It is here of a setting mobility

191
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:48,139
to avoid unemployment or leave in question.

192
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,895
This greater willingness to be mobile to find work

193
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,474
can have positive effects on access to employment.

194
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:58,551
On this map, you can compare the size of territories

195
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:01,639
in which a person with low provisions

196
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,171
to high mobility can find a job, here,

197
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:09,047
which then is ready to long term commuting

198
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:12,699
and the last, who stands ready to move,

199
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:16,023
although they are not ready to move anywhere.

200
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:18,187
Our analyzes show that people

201
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:21,392
with lower provisions for mobility in 2007

202
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:24,151
find themselves in an economic and employment situation

203
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:27,347
more unfavorable in 2011 than others.

204
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,528
However, the approach by mobility also allows to put in balance,

205
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:36,769
these projects with power, that is to say the access and skills,

206
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,736
highly variable between individuals.

207
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:41,751
The group of those willing to move is enlightening to this view.

208
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:44,600
Or, and this is often underestimated,

209
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,889
the experience of mobility is much less rosy

210
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:50,111
for those whose skills and access are low.

211
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:54,456
The costs of mobility in terms of health, fatigue, stress,

212
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:56,248
or equilibrium of couples,

213
00:10:56,248 --> 00:11:00,177
will also depend on the conditions of exercise of this mobility.

214
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:02,884
This work on mobility finally allows to question

215
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:06,628
for all people, not just for those who move,

216
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:10,424
the place high mobility holds in daily life.

217
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:12,621
We have been able to enter

218
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:16,272
in the complexity arbitrations between work and family.

219
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:20,297
It was possible also to address the variability

220
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:23,468
of individual situations, opening the door for reflection

221
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:25,536
on interindividual inequalities

222
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:28,524
with an approach that is not based on actual practice,

223
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:30,824
but the access and skills,

224
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:34,208
that is to say, the power, and the way projects, unintentionally,

225
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:38,239
are guided by the social norm and the pressure of access to employment.

226
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,983
Mobility finally allowed us to pinpoint

227
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:45,671
on very strong economic and social issues.

228
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:49,580
So do we have to help so that the most possible people

229
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,752
is adapted to the largest mobile lifestyle,

230
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,365
or should we fight against the generalization of an injunction to mobility ?

231
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:58,132
Let us leave this question open for now

232
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:01,627
but keep in mind the high level of fatigue of mobile people.

233
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,303
<I> Thank you and good night. </ I>
