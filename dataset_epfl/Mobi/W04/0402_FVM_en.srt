2
00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:21,632
Santiago in Chile and its new bus system with high level of service

3
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:24,457
I would like to discuss change in travel habits

4
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,926
and mobility patterns in the city of Santiago in Chile,

5
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:30,984
and specifically how and why user behavior has changed

6
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:35,022
since the introduction of a transportation system completely new in this city.

7
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:39,102
Why Santiago? This is an interesting case study

8
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:42,992
considering the significant transformation that the city has known

9
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:44,417
for transport over the past decade.

10
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:49,520
Before 2007, the city was characterized by the coexistence of two parallel systems

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,612
and totally independent of one another.

12
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:53,732
On one side, a few lines of uncrowded subways,

13
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:55,652
consequences of not very expanded network

14
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:59,618
and of relatively high tariffs.

15
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:02,872
On the other, a mode of organization typical of many cities

16
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:05,306
of developing countries and emerging economies:

17
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:09,403
a bus system without any regulation, with a glut of private operators

18
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:14,223
offering services with private bus.

19
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:17,939
A chaotic service at the origin of many accidents,

20
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,939
of noise and pollution,

21
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,647
but which also had advantages for users.

22
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:27,732
They had only to leave home to hop on a bus

23
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:30,564
at the place of their choice, since there was no fixed stops.

24
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:32,904
Free to them to cross the whole city on the same bus,

25
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:36,080
by paying an only trip, without having to change buses

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,001
or go from the bus to the subway.

27
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:43,118
Complete modernization of the system

28
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,709
However, noting the noise, pollution and the frequency of accidents,

29
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,423
but also the fact that a growing share of the motorized population

30
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:54,826
avoided this chaotic system by moving by car,

31
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:59,520
the government has decided to modernize the existing system

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,256
by launching a system of "Bus Rapid Level" (BRT)

33
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,192
This term refers to a system where buses

34
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:10,199
circulate only on a own site like metro or tram.

35
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,769
There are articulated buses of big capacity, very comfortable,

36
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:16,810
that can carry many passengers.

37
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,459
Normally, a BRT network also includes,

38
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,437
like the subway, a special ticket booth

39
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:25,084
and a sophisticated passenger information.

40
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:28,637
It was also planned to link the system called Transantiago

41
00:02:28,637 --> 00:02:32,667
to the ublic metro to propose a common tariff

42
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:37,937
and allow users to take both means of transport with

43
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,271
only one ticket issued by the electronic ticketing system.

44
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:42,922
This very ambitious and sophisticated system was put into operation

45
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:45,533
in Santiago in February 2007.

46
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:49,931
It is not surprising that its beginnings were catastrophic.

47
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:53,689
Users were completely lost because change

48
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,439
was simply too radical and too brutal.

49
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,009
Several reasons can be advanced.

50
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,726
On one hand, many technical malfunctions were observed,

51
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:02,619
related to initial network design problems, to the insufficient number of buses,

52
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:06,030
to corridors still in construction after commissioning, etc.

53
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,049
But the initial difficulties were also due

54
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,676
the total disorientation of users,

55
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:12,676
who did not know how to use the new system.

56
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:14,809
This was the starting point of my research.

57
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:20,376
The "captive users" with good access to the car

58
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,109
I wanted to know exactly what were

59
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:24,766
the problems encountered by users

60
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:29,261
and their impact on the way they move in the city,

61
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:34,929
the composition of on their daily life and the overall organization

62
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:37,536
of everyday activities.

63
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:42,296
I selected five of the 37 districts of the city, which are very different

64
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:44,689
according to income height

65
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:49,784
and access to transport.

66
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:53,865
Some neighborhoods are served by the subway, and others not,

67
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,515
some are totally dependent on the bus.

68
00:03:55,517 --> 00:04:00,177
Equally important point, it is primarily the rich neighborhoods

69
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:02,891
that access to the car, while the modest neighborhoods

70
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:05,198
especially those in the periphery are generally

71
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:07,732
entirely dependent on public transport.

72
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:09,327
We are talking about "captive users"

73
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:11,487
to express the fact that they have no choice:

74
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:13,480
the public transport is their only alternative.

75
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,658
A large correlation between car ownership and high incomes

76
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:23,827
Obviously, these difficulties have not had the same impact on everyone.

77
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:27,869
As I said, the level of dependence of users

78
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:30,773
in respect of transport is decisive.

79
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,490
I prepared four cards

80
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,601
displaying the 37 districts of the metropolitan area.

81
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:38,380
Green always indicates a low value

82
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,676
and red a high value.

83
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:45,613
We see two things first, we see a strong correlation

84
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:47,457
between the average income

85
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:49,937
and owning a car,

86
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:53,600
and the number of daily trips by private transport,

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,940
on the other hand, we see that all people with high incomes

88
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,762
are concentrated in a sector the "cone of wealth" from the east of the city,

89
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:02,520
in red on the map,

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,702
This shows that social segregation is important in Santiago.

91
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:12,998
The people of this district are favored for two reasons.

92
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:16,626
They have easy access to the car and are not dependent

93
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:19,347
on public transport, their mobility is thus important.

94
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:24,640
They live in an area where many shops are concentrated,

95
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,698
workplaces, leisure and relaxation,

96
00:05:28,698 --> 00:05:30,839
and therefore do not have much distance to travel

97
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,829
even if they are more mobile than others.

98
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,584
Technical problems with motility

99
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,205
Transantiago's problems are twofold:

100
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:48,565
on the one hand the technical problems previously mentioned of the network,

101
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:51,910
lines and bus stops, etc.

102
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,550
Obviously the plan did not work very well at first,

103
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,370
but the solutions are simple,

104
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,973
even if they are costly in time and money.

105
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:02,717
The majority of the necessary improvements have been made

106
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:05,720
in the three years following the set of the Transantiago service.

107
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,227
Add to this a whole range of issues

108
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:09,807
to the users' skills

109
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:12,795
to their ease, their habits and preferences regarding movement.

110
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:16,874
This second type of problems proved more persistent

111
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:22,264
and difficult to solve than the authorities had first envisaged.

112
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:29,001
From the D system to a more sophisticated traveler information

113
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:33,068
Take an example on the skills of travelers on travel:

114
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:35,520
Access to transportation information available.

115
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,699
Before, in the era of unregulated system

116
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,500
the inhabitants were accustomed to coping,

117
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,678
to learn informally.

118
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:45,150
They asked their relatives or directly to the bus driver,

119
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,020
to determine the route that would take them from one point to another.

120
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,623
Now, with the Transantiago, the system is much more complex:

121
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:54,217
it is based on an information system for travelers worthy of the name,

122
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:58,887
that integrates network maps, an internet platform, a call center, etc.

123
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:03,415
As shown in this graph, the less educated users continue

124
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:07,128
to rely on informal sources of information, even with the Transantiago,

125
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:12,357
which is much harder than the days of unregulated system.

126
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:17,202
Only the most educated groups actually use the internet platform,

127
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:18,602
network plans, etc.

128
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:20,972
By the same logic, we see on the second graph

129
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:24,662
that travelers declare on their own having more or less ease

130
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:27,002
or difficulty to use the Transantiago.

131
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:33,652
The least educated people consider the Transantiago very complicated,

132
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:38,004
while the more educated groups generally do not have problems,

133
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:41,279
realization that however is relative in relation to their low attendance

134
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,329
of public transport; they are not dependent on it

135
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,093
which facilitates the task.

136
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,999
It is only an example of issues linked to skills of

137
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:59,089
travel-related users. I could mention many more.

138
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,242
In summary, the problems are mainly related to the need

139
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:04,958
to plan the trip upstream:

140
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,719
the need to recharge their electronic ticket before boarding the bus,

141
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:14,992
to find the best path to get to the right stop and then to have changes.

142
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:17,012
Matches are a universal phenomenon:

143
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:21,394
nobody particularly like to change transport.

144
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:26,856
Here too, in Europe, we prefer to stay longer on board of the same mode of

145
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:30,241
transportation to avoid a change rather than a short ride

146
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,841
which involves one or two connexions.

147
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:38,627
Captives travelers travel less and avoid motorized transport.

148
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:42,731
So here's an overview of problems. I want to follow the impact

149
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:46,860
of this problematic transport system on the lives of users.

150
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,980
In my survey, about 12% of respondents

151
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:55,381
say explicitly they have changed routes and travel habits

152
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,666
after encountering problems with Transantiago.

153
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,991
Again, they were largely

154
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:01,631
"captive travelers" who are essentially

155
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:04,142
people with low incomes, who do not own cars,

156
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:06,222
the elderly as well as many women,

157
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:10,012
including a significant number still has not a licence in Santiago.

158
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:14,078
With the new system, they travel less,

159
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:16,028
especially for leisure;

160
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:18,348
they renounce to many trips

161
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:20,831
they used to do with an unregulated system

162
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:22,954
and prefer to stay at home.

163
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:25,190
They make shorter trips.

164
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,190
and therefore remain closer to their place of residence

165
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,872
where they can get around on foot or bicycle,

166
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:31,871
so as to avoid motorized transport.

167
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,052
The private car is gaining ground

168
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:42,715
Third, the respective shares of different means of transport

169
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,791
Santiago used to show that the use of the private car

170
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,791
has increased significantly.

171
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,114
While the bus has given a lot of ground to the subway,

172
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,660
whose network expanded

173
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,554
and access has been democratized through common tariffs,

174
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:02,806
but also for the benefit of private cars and taxis.

175
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:07,214
This development is problematic from an environmental and social perspective.

176
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,755
The change should not be too brutal

177
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,973
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize three key points.

178
00:10:17,973 --> 00:10:21,821
First, regarding the movement of skills,

179
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,433
it is important to stress the need, in areas

180
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:27,060
or areas with a major reorganization of transport,

181
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,143
to train people to use the new system.

182
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:33,433
A too sudden or a too radical change is never desirable.

183
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,693
Users should familiarize themselves gradually with the new system,

184
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:39,064
otherwise they will fail to appropriate it.

185
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:44,719
For captive travelers, social life goes through public transport

186
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,866
Secondly, about the changes in frequency and length of trips,

187
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:55,729
transportation is a determining factor - can not be the main

188
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:59,907
but nevertheless decisive - of the ability to lead a social life.

189
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:02,621
With a lack of mobility, people can not enjoy their leisure,

190
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,101
work, study, etc.

191
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,996
it shows the importance of public transport,

192
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:10,754
particularly for captive travelers who have no other means than the bus

193
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,947
or subway to get around.

194
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:18,757
The car, still a determinant key of social status

195
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:23,821
Last observation, not least related to the previous point.

196
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:27,651
Today, many people prefer the car to the bus,

197
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:30,491
while one of the ambitions of Transantiago

198
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:34,506
was to attract motorists to make them passengers.

199
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:39,824
Of course, there can be no question of providing each citizen a car

200
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,087
on behalf of transport for all.

201
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:46,667
The non-driving phenomenon of the entire population is an opportunity

202
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,847
and can therefore be analyzed in positive terms.

203
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:53,654
The need to use public transport can help

204
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:56,806
developing a more sustainable urban transport system.

205
00:11:56,806 --> 00:12:03,177
But the implementation of public transport systems more developed

206
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:07,876
or more efficient is not enough;

207
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:10,345
we must still consider the place of the car and of the correlative behavior.

208
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:12,285
We can of course expect a disadvantage of the car,

209
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:14,585
related to its cost and implementation restrictions,

210
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:17,236
but it is also to question the image of the car.

211
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,973
In Santiago, as elsewhere I think,

212
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,973
the car is still an important status symbol

213
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:28,104
of independence, privacy, traveling comfort, optimal mobility.

214
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:31,316
And as long as people do not become aware of problems

215
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,308
related to its extensive use

216
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:35,413
-traffic jams, pollution, space consumption, etc.-

217
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:38,052
they will not be willing to shift to another mode

218
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:40,572
of travel such as public transport.

219
