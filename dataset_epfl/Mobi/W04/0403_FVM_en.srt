(Superposition of voices in different languages)

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,490
We will talk a little about seduction.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,830
While this may seem a little odd since in fact it is engineering.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,870
So let me explain.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,869
For the last thirty years we have had more and more opportunities

8
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:38,119
to move and live using different means.

9
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:43,807
If we think for example of a person with whom you would like to get in touch,

10
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:47,254
you can call him, you can send an SMS,

11
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:50,574
you can make an appointment with him, you can write to him,

12
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:52,564
you can go to his home.

13
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:55,214
So there are many possibilities.

14
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:59,214
This is just one example finally, one could multiply examples,

15
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:03,844
we all have spatial relationships and the use of these various means

16
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:07,844
that are available to us, that are very extensive

17
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:10,694
and therefore are used in everyday life.

18
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:14,694
So with all these choices, ultimately we each create

19
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:18,694
a lifestyle in connection with these techniques.

20
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:21,734
So it has a lot of implications for engineering,

21
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:30,014
including engineering of movements because there are a lot of alternative choices.

22
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:32,591
The residents of a neighborhood,

23
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:35,571
it can be seen in many research,

24
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:41,071
can finally use very different means to move,

25
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:45,086
to grow their businesses, and ultimately it is not uncommon

26
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:48,366
that they attend very different places at different times.

27
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:52,846
This is not because we live in the same
neighborhood that we necessarily see each other.

28
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:58,575
It's a bit a feature of modern life, or rather of contemporary life.

29
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:08,335
Where I wanted to go, from seduction,

30
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:11,605
is that in a system where we have many choices,

31
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:16,405
for a technical solution that is introduced to be successful,

32
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,905
it must be attractive.

33
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:23,715
It must resonates with what people want to do,

34
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:26,063
their aspirations and then also their constraints,

35
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:30,063
because we do not live in a world free of constraints.

36
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:35,304
So it implies a certain cultural revolution, one might say,

37
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:39,304
in the world of engineering, where we did not have the habit

38
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:43,304
until now to think of tenders including transport deals

39
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:45,474
according to these parameters.

40
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:49,476
Often when we think an offer,

41
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:54,001
we just think to make it publicly available

42
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:58,881
asking ourselves quite a few questions on
the fact that it will meet this public.

43
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,951
As it is a bit abstract, perhaps the simplest way

44
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:13,081
is to take an example, this example is an example that

45
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:18,866
we had the opportunity to work on at the EPFL
it is the network reorganization

46
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,906
of the Genevan tram that took place in 2011.

47
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:28,086
For twenty years, as in many European cities,

48
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:32,795
the decision was made to redeploy the Geneva tramway.

49
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:40,430
It was done in stages, with successive sections put in service.

50
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:47,216
In 2010-2011, there was a network that consisted of seven lines,

51
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:52,076
which had been built like this in 10 years by adding sections.

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,100
It was characteristic for this network, a feature that was highly appreciated,

53
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:04,440
that on each axis, on each line, there were several destinations.

54
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,810
In other words there were several lines,

55
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,610
ie from a stop, we could take trams that were going

56
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,250
in several different directions, thus avoiding having to change

57
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,250
tram in the city center and multiplied the direct paths

58
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,210
throughout the city.

59
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:29,844
This network, from a technical point of view, was quite difficult to exploit,

60
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:33,844
so in December 2011 they decided to change

61
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:39,564
their operating concept and say "these double lines are suppressed

62
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:42,619
and on each axis we will keep one. "

63
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:46,619
That means, in different tram stops when you arrived

64
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,619
at a stop to take a tram, you have one line available

65
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:54,019
whereas before you had two or even three.

66
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:59,769
So that means there's a lot more changes on the network

67
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:02,839
especially downtown.

68
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,839
<I> This network was very badly perceived by the population, </ i>

69
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,329
<I> there was a lot of criticism for it, </ i>

70
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:13,779
<I> Geneva's public transport have lost users because of this. </ I>

71
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:18,309
It has caused some misunderstanding on the part of public authorities,

72
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:23,471
saying, "It's amazing, we took the decision to simplify the network

73
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:25,651
to improve the offer. "

74
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:29,651
With this new network, certainly, were eliminated direct connections

75
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:33,651
but a best speed can be offered, and more trams are offered

76
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:35,601
meaning that there are more, more often.

77
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:39,111
There is only one line, but there is one every three minutes,

78
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:42,461
whereas before there were two or three lines, but there were

79
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:45,201
only one every five minutes, let's say.

80
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,140
When we begin to deepen why the network was poorly received,

81
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:01,530
we fall back on this issue of seduction and logic of the user.

82
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:05,536
The user, what he seeks above all in Geneva, for various reasons,

83
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:11,486
is direct trops and comfortable journeys for downtown, public spaces

84
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:17,553
are relatively little developped and there is a motor traffic

85
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:22,053
which is quite large, so it's quite unpleasant to change line.

86
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:25,653
Therefore, even if there was an improvement in speed, and even if there has been

87
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:29,163
improved headways in the end, the new network

88
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:33,175
was not considered by the public as better than the old.

89
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:37,198
This example, I think, perfectly illustrates this terms

90
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:39,678
on engineering by seduction.

91
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:45,218
That is, if we want to think a network to expand the use

92
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:50,354
of public transport, so we have to really look

93
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:56,874
at the sensitivity of the population at different rates.

94
00:06:56,893 --> 00:07:00,893
If we want to attract new users, it must attract, and seduce

95
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:04,893
it must consider their expectations, and in this case there expectations

96
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:08,643
were not to go faster or get a better rate,

97
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:11,503
but it was first to have direct paths.

98
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:21,073
This example of the tram network

99
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:25,933
illustrates what I wanted to show about engineering through seduction,

100
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:28,513
but one could develop many other examples.

101
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:32,063
In fact, what is important is not the example as such,

102
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:34,833
but that's what it says on perhaps the right way

103
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:41,513
to develop an engineering which can act on the practice.

104
00:07:41,514 --> 00:07:44,654
For that, it is absolutely essential to develop deals

105
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:49,587
which are ultimately resonating with the public expectations.

106
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:54,659
What we talked about the tram network, we could also discuss it

107
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:58,125
about rail services, we could discuss it

108
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,925
for a range of urban services, even outside of transportation systems,

109
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:09,351
issues of habitat are eventually connected to this general problem.

110
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:12,942
I think you need to remember that there must be much more

111
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:19,872
dialog perhaps in engineering, between the technical world, which search

112
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:23,872
a good technical solution, such as with this case

113
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:27,872
of the Geneva tram network, the new network is technically certainly

114
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:31,872
much more efficient than the old, but it is not the only dimension,

115
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:34,902
there is also the human dimension, the request dimension,

116
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:41,182
and we must succeed in reconciling the two and work together

117
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:44,114
much further.

118
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:48,114
The good technical solution, if it is a bad solution

119
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:49,624
from the point of view of the user,

120
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:53,624
then we must conclude that this is a bad engineering solution.

121
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:56,314
That's the cultural revolution that must be carried on.
