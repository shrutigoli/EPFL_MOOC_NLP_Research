1
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:05,333
Hello.

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:06,522
My name Yafiza Zorro

3
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:07,597
I am an architect

4
00:00:07,597 --> 00:00:12,698
and Doctor at the Urban Sociology Science Laboratory EPFL

5
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:16,816
For this occasion, as part of the course on urban mobility

6
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:19,523
I will present a comparative analysis

7
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:22,518
between three subjects that have become key for analysis

8
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:25,390
and for the development of contemporary global cities.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,596
The first is urban mobility.

10
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:30,143
Then urban fragmentation.

11
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:32,640
And the third is the public space.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,774
So it is from this theoretical triad

13
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:38,766
that I will develop this presentation

14
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,855
trying to describe each subject,

15
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:45,530
to bring them together and seize their impact on urban areas.

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,320
Then, to better visualize the impact on the territory

17
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:53,993
I will present the results of the study which was applied

18
00:00:53,993 --> 00:00:55,854
on the capital city of Colombia.

19
00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:57,191
Bogotá.

20
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:01,654
This presentation will be structured as follows:

21
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:05,762
First, I will present the theoretical case that supported this study;

22
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:08,984
then it will be followed by the description of the case study;

23
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:11,875
and I will finalize by the presentation of results

24
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,185
of analyzes applied on the ground.

25
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:16,488
Let's start then by mobility.

26
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:20,292
As you have already been able to see in previous courses,

27
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:23,794
urban mobility has gained importance in recent years

28
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:27,191
becoming unavoidable by urban studies.

29
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:30,011
Today, the city is built by a company

30
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:31,860
which has become increasingly mobile

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,871
and when territories are transformed

32
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:36,952
from mutations driven by mobility.

33
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:39,958
Therefore arises a first very general question.

34
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,660
What is mobility in the city?

35
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,254
Moreover, in the current context,

36
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:47,587
we are faced with fragmented cities

37
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:51,255
that is to say, a city whose territory exploded,

38
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:53,594
a city that is less and less in unit

39
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:55,549
and which is divided and fragmented.

40
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,698
These fragments lose their cohesion by becoming a source of segregation,

41
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:02,704
inequality and social polarization,

42
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:06,372
that is to say a town subjected to fragmentation events.

43
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:10,094
In response, the mobility may be profiled

44
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:13,724
as an opportunity to mend the pieces of the city

45
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:18,826
thus make the fragments communicate and create a new social cohesion.

46
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:23,194
However, if despite this mobility, the city continues to be fragmented

47
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:27,834
isn't it that in some cases, mobility would not strengthen

48
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:29,883
these phenomena of fragmentation?

49
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,364
To address this dynamic marked by mobility

50
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:35,160
and urban fragmentation in the city,

51
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,088
we will study them in space

52
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,659
where they reveal themselves and materialize best:

53
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,893
in the specific area of ​​the city.

54
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:43,776
Ie in the public space.

55
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:46,089
But public space is defined not only

56
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:48,403
from a physical construction of the city

57
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:51,062
but also from a social construction.

58
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:54,712
Ie an urban space that becomes public

59
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:58,905
from experiences and socialization of citizens.

60
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:02,933
The city we have chosen to observe these dynamics in

61
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,842
was the city of Bogotá.

62
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:07,966
First, because it is in the emerging cities

63
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:12,483
where these fragments are even deeper and more identifiable.

64
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,190
Then, because Bogotá,

65
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,286
in the late 1990s and early 2000s

66
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:20,761
experienced a series of urban transformation,

67
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,137
both physically and in the social plan

68
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:27,082
which highlighted the three theoretical themes mentioned above.

69
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:31,029
First to understand why we found

70
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:33,240
that Bogotá is a fragmented city

71
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,831
we analyzed its urban evolution.

72
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:38,164
In the first half of the twentieth century,

73
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:42,110
the growth of Bogotá was a trend towards intensification.

74
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,146
From there, the original intentions and efforts to impose

75
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:48,962
urban planning appeared.

76
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:53,709
Moreover, Bogotá, at that time, served as urban exploration laboratory

77
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,874
where various European and North American urban strategies

78
00:03:57,874 --> 00:04:00,406
were exported in its territory.

79
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,709
We can mention here the Austrian city planner Karl Bruner

80
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,166
which used the quarters as growth unit.

81
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:13,243
As the Swiss architect Le Corbusier and the Catalan Jose Luis Sert

82
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:17,205
which outweighed the principles of architecture and modern urbanism

83
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:21,422
bytransforming the growth of the traditional urban fabric

84
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:25,730
from the closed island type to the urban bar.

85
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,229
Here is Bogotá at the end of 1950.

86
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,842
At that time the Colombian government seeking consolidation of Bogotá

87
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:38,177
as the capital city of Colombia, supported the move to annex

88
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,652
six small settlements surrounding the city.

89
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:46,123
Therefore, at this time, the surface of the city has tripled.

90
00:04:46,123 --> 00:04:49,505
and signed a defined urban planning strategy.

91
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:53,035
The type of growth that followed the annexation was urban sprawl,

92
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:56,971
leaving a vast area to fragmentation.

93
00:04:56,971 --> 00:05:00,264
Once this growth by spreading the fabric

94
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:02,190
arrived in the city limits

95
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,357
a process of redensification of the territory began

96
00:05:05,586 --> 00:05:09,433
these redensification dynamics have led to saturation

97
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:12,383
of networks of various public services in the city.

98
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:18,418
The lack of coherent planning especially from the 1970s

99
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,891
has given way to a strong growth

100
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:24,021
of real estate markets and fleet.

101
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:28,499
While the management of public transport for example was entirely monopolized

102
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:29,911
by the private sector.

103
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:34,387
Similarly, the lack of organized public transport system encouraged

104
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:38,136
the use of the car as the preferred mode of travel.

105
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:41,971
This mismanagement of transport from the city administration,

106
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:44,584
involved not only the entire population

107
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:47,073
but especially the most vulnerable.

108
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:50,749
Access to the poorest neighborhoods, located mainly in the outskirts

109
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:53,418
was physically very complicated.

110
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:56,095
Therefore, an access that was very expensive.

111
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,388
Thus Bogota happens in the early 1990s

112
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:03,187
with an urban crisis at all levels:

113
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:05,696
housing, public spaces, etc.

114
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:08,032
but what is watched and shared

115
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:10,527
in the daily life of all citizens

116
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:12,457
through the problem of transport.

117
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:15,311
Getting around the city of Bogotá

118
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:18,043
at that time had become a nightmare.

119
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:21,550
To deal with this crisis, the Colombian capital lived

120
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,213
a series of physical changes

121
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:25,611
in the first decade of the 2000s.

122
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:29,480
These changes have been structured by mobility policies.

123
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,751
Indeed, the option taken to meet the challenge of mobility warranty

124
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:35,315
in Bogotá

125
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:39,245
was the establishment of a transport system called 'TransMilenio.'

126
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:42,166
This system had the initial goal

127
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,652
to organize the [inaudible] of local transport.

128
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:47,118
transport policy 'TransMilenio'

129
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:50,443
in addition to offering a new transport infrastructure in the city,

130
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,344
has become also an opportunity to provide

131
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,833
a new form of public space.

132
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,820
This alliance made between transport and public spaces becomes

133
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,538
an attractive urban strategy for production

134
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,074
of concrete, quick and visual results.

135
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:09,635
So two devices characterize the impact of the system TransMilenio

136
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:11,518
on the physical territory of the city.

137
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:14,842
The first is the creation of exclusive unique tracks

138
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:16,830
for bus of the transmilenio system.

139
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,759
The second device concerns infrastructure projects of public spaces

140
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,444
developed around the system needing to access it.

141
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:29,473
So we are talking about creating stations, footbridges,

142
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:32,326
squares, sidewalks, etc.

143
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,586
To better observe the territorial dynamics of this city

144
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:39,638
we decided to move from a macro scale agglomeration

145
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:41,333
to a more local level.

146
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:46,448
Today the urban area of ​​Bogotá's intention to decentralization

147
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:51,058
is divided into 19 administrative units called villages.

148
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:54,539
However, these units continue to depend entirely

149
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,252
of the central government.

150
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:59,747
They are just following policy defined by it.

151
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:03,313
Most of these policies respond to urban studies

152
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:05,778
that do not exceed the scale of the agglomeration

153
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:10,668
they thus give a more local approach and more effective planning.

154
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:13,830
For this reason, we decided to apply our analyzes

155
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,163
in one of the 19 localities of Bogota:

156
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,328
the locality of Suba.

157
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:20,113
Our choice is based on two conditions.

158
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:23,340
First, because it is one of the six cities

159
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,371
which were annexed in 1956 and for us

160
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:31,712
it was interesting to see the evolution of one of such units.

161
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:36,446
The second condition relates to the fact that we find in this territory

162
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:38,926
all socioeconomic classes in the city.

163
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:43,349
This favors the comparison between socioeconomic classes

164
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,177
made in our analyzes.

165
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:48,128
Thus we have defined three groups.

166
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:53,480
Disadvantaged classes represented here in blue,

167
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,256
the middle classes represented in this map, in green,

168
00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:02,515
and the upper classes represented here in the map, in red.

169
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:05,348
To answer our original question:

170
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:08,217
what mobility does to the fragmented city?

171
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:12,392
We made a series of tests that are grouped and organized

172
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,429
in four studies.

173
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,677
The first analysis was to study

174
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:19,414
the movements of the inhabitants of the locality of Suba.

175
00:09:19,414 --> 00:09:23,779
The aim here was to identify the impact of transport modes

176
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:26,713
and particularly that of the transmilenio system.

177
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:29,602
Then determine access inequality,

178
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:33,058
identify anchor levels at the local territory

179
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:34,816
and agglomeration

180
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:39,781
and determine the level of social diversity in the territory.

181
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:43,889
On this occasion we used the Bogotá mobility surveys

182
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:47,225
of 2005 and 2011.

183
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:51,917
The second analysis concerned the observation of displacement spaces.

184
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:56,262
Note that the intention to develop an infrastructure system

185
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,730
of public spaces around the TransMilenio

186
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,170
also sought to include the disadvantaged.

187
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,252
However we have not observed a direct impact of the project TransMilenio

188
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:09,319
on this population.

189
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:12,129
We'll see some examples.

190
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:16,233
These images correspond to the lower classes of neighborhoods

191
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:20,549
So we see the lack of public space infrastructure

192
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,888
around these displacement spaces.

193
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,967
By cons, here, for the middle class

194
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:29,935
we notice the presence and influence of the treatment of the public space

195
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:33,050
deployed around the TransMilenio system

196
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,629
and the appropriation of these spaces by the residents.

197
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:39,868
In this image of a neighborhood of upper class,

198
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:44,233
we find it prefers direct access to the system.

199
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:48,165
Therefore, it also favors the public space system

200
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,619
deployed by the TransMilenio system.

201
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:54,720
However we observed during our fieldwork

202
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,158
empty spaces, poorly attended, therefore less suitable for its inhabitants.

203
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:04,905
We can diagnose underutilized infrastructure

204
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:06,717
of this public space.

205
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:10,717
Another finding of the impact of infrastructure of the TransMilenio

206
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:13,049
as a cut on the urban fabric.

207
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:17,873
In the case of Suba, although the way of the TransMilenio system is developed

208
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:21,789
on the old main access road to the resort,

209
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:24,420
the dimensions of the TransMilenio's profile

210
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,030
added to the conditions necessary to create an exclusive track

211
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,410
accentuated the divide already imposed by the old road.

212
00:11:31,643 --> 00:11:35,578
To visualize this, here's an example.

213
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:38,897
This part of the Suba district is well attended

214
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:41,843
thanks to the presence of these two shopping centers.

215
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:46,890
At the time the Suba Avenue crossed the middle of these two shopping centers.

216
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,442
However small crosswalks

217
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:57,575
ensured fluidity between the north and south of the district.

218
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:01,312
With the construction of the track for transmilenio

219
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:03,643
this fluidity has been jeopardized.

220
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:06,943
because the only way road cut all pedestrian crossings.

221
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:10,607
In addition, the TransMilenio stations have been installed

222
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,555
far from the two shopping centers

223
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:18,290
To access from that point here at the station,

224
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:24,887
the course has been highly extended.

225
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:27,310
This example is important because not only

226
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,954
we highlight the cutting of the fabric locally

227
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:34,152
but we want to emphasize that transport statistics

228
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:38,516
concerning the improvement of travel time takes account of the journey

229
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:43,284
that the vehicle does from the starting station to the end station,

230
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:46,551
but these statistics will not consider the time

231
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:51,322
that the locals use to access the vehicle or stations.

232
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:53,982
The third analysis is the perception,

233
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:57,118
the lens or the main purpose of this approach

234
00:12:57,118 --> 00:13:01,252
was to identify the importance the inhabitants gives the public space.

235
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:04,883
To do this, we asked people the question:

236
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:06,969
what is public space?

237
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:11,166
To complete the responses, we wanted to get the opinion

238
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:15,785
on the quality, quantity, safety and responsibility.

239
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:18,323
To do this, we conducted a survey

240
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:21,006
with three groups of people in Suba.

241
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:25,291
A fourth analysis was exploration.

242
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:30,050
The purpose of this exploration was to recognize

243
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,715
how the activities or functions of the city

244
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:36,590
and their architectural typology

245
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,777
build and give value to public space.

246
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:45,458
These activities are considered as points of tension or attraction

247
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,045
for enabling urban spaces

248
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:51,602
promoting socialization of citizens.

249
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:53,548
Also, we seek to identify

250
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:56,299
the fragmentation phenomena across the district.

251
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,891
produced by forms of typology

252
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:01,486
and types of use of urban spaces.

253
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:04,537
Our data source was exploratory walks,

254
00:14:04,537 --> 00:14:09,296
non-participant observations, photographs, reports and sketches.

255
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:13,508
Here are summaries of this exploration.

256
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:16,875
In our exploration we have observed and concluded

257
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,454
how the city is built on the basis of a defensive architecture

258
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:25,473
or by the type or by the form or arrangement of the urban built.

259
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:29,314
To illustrate this, we have identified three typologies

260
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:31,651
in residential areas.

261
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:35,841
These three types are found in three socioeconomic groups

262
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:42,615
with perhaps a materiality and a few details that make the difference.

263
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:47,410
For us these typologies, show us the evolution of the construction

264
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,151
of an architecture of fear.

265
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:52,084
An architecture that protects against urban violence.

266
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:56,742
The first type, the open block, corresponds to the first constructions

267
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:58,479
conducted in the locality.

268
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:03,572
In this typology, the island is made up of rows of houses or buildings

269
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:09,261
which their facades and their access are exposed directly on the street.

270
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:13,624
Therefore, the transition zone between the city and the housing

271
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:15,538
was the space of the neighborhood.

272
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:19,887
So the locals here are invited to live the neighborhood

273
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:22,860
as a space that is both personal and collective

274
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:25,727
generating stronger social dynamics.

275
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:29,329
Faced with violence, this typology plays a dual role.

276
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:35,821
For example if the territory is violent, this type exposes the intimate space,

277
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,318
ie the private area directly to this violence.

278
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,982
But if this type of home holds business,

279
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:52,252
various uses that make the street a busy place

280
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:56,144
we can identify the areas protected by these activities.

281
00:15:56,144 --> 00:16:00,172
By cons, this natural protection option

282
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:04,523
deal with urban violence disappears in our other two types.

283
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:07,451
In conclusion, to continue,

284
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:10,508
I will present the answers to the assumptions

285
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:13,280
we proposed around the issue

286
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,187
What does that mobility to the fragmented city?

287
00:16:16,314 --> 00:16:18,020
Our first hypothesis:

288
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,644
public policies aiming to improve

289
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:24,230
the mobility system and public spaces

290
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,745
favored the spatial and social fragmentation of the city

291
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:31,495
limiting the accessibility of a significant part of the population

292
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:35,102
to the new mode of transport and to the new public spaces.

293
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:39,152
We want to emphasize here that the operation TransMilenio

294
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:41,175
was justified by the public authorities

295
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:45,006
as a means of reducing inequalities in the territories

296
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:48,594
promoting accessibility to all citizens.

297
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:53,533
However, in our analysis of travel, we found

298
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:56,616
that the part of the most fragile population

299
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,242
who most need this offer

300
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:03,242
is the one that finally has the most difficulty accessing the system.

301
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:07,386
Our analyzes of dtravel in Suba confirmed this hypothesis

302
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:11,673
insofar urban policy TransMilenio eventually promoted

303
00:17:11,673 --> 00:17:15,986
segregation and thus strengthen territorial fragmentation.

304
00:17:15,986 --> 00:17:21,793
To understand, we must mention that for physical access

305
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:25,246
to the TransMilenio system there are three possibilities:

306
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:29,645
The first is direct access by stations

307
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:33,206
just by crossing a crosswalk or gateway.

308
00:17:33,206 --> 00:17:39,687
This map of the town of Suba shows the location of the system's stations.

309
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:44,161
We can see it mostly affects the middle class identified

310
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:49,607
here in green and affluent class identified here in red.

311
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:54,854
The second option is to access the system through the <i> portals </ i>.

312
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:56,928
The <i> portals </ i> are major interchanges poles

313
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:59,130
located at the end of each line.

314
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,083
The <i> portals </ i> are the points of departure and arrival of buses.

315
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,872
These are interchanges poles between buses of the main lines

316
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:08,965
and shuttles called <i> alimentadores </ i>.

317
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:14,508
These shuttles or <i> alimentadores </ i> are the third possibility to access the system.

318
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:17,552
This is the possibility that brings the most constraints

319
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:22,165
by the multiplication of changes that must be achieved on every trip.

320
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:24,706
These shuttles belong to the system

321
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:27,505
but do not move on an exclusive way.

322
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,739
The aim of this is to offer alternative

323
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:32,987
access to the system TransMilenio

324
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,371
for the people who live far away or work away

325
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:38,801
from these stations and interchanges.

326
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:44,481
In this map, the red line identifies the course of these shuttles.

327
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:49,558
We can see that they will serve mainly the least favored population

328
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:51,698
identified here in blue.

329
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:54,457
According to our movement analysis, only

330
00:18:54,457 --> 00:19:00,106
0.3% of the population of the least favored class of the locality of Suba

331
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:03,054
has direct access to the TransMilenio system.

332
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:09,587
8% of the population using the system TransMilenio

333
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:12,872
must use the services shuttles to access the system.

334
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:16,527
This puts these people at a disadvantage

335
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:19,593
to those who have direct access to the system.

336
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:23,424
So instead of offering better conditions for mobility

337
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:29,134
to those who most need to get out of the enclave of their territory

338
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,121
these systems generate for them obstacles

339
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:35,368
with the old transportation system they did not know.

340
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:38,944
Therefore, our results confirm strong segregation

341
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,878
for the less privileged classes

342
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:44,996
compared to the middle class and upper class.

343
00:19:44,996 --> 00:19:48,081
Then, at the time of mapping the movements

344
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,910
we see that the lower classes will stay

345
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,894
near their place of residence.

346
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:56,324
On the contrary the middle class spreads over its movements

347
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:59,344
in a representative part of the city.

348
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:03,374
Finally, the upper class remains anchored to its territory.

349
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:06,924
This territory is ultimately the best endowed in

350
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:09,591
infrastructure and activities.

351
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:12,438
This is our second hypothesis.

352
00:20:12,438 --> 00:20:16,312
Mobility systems seeking cohesion across the city

353
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:19,589
can generate two types of fractures locally.

354
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,069
First, the tracks of the new systems

355
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:24,758
of ,obility break the urban fabric

356
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:28,830
creating a spatial fracture and also a social divide.

357
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,920
And secondly when the new mobility system allows

358
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,511
easier travel throughout the city,

359
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:39,722
finally staying in local places is becoming less attractive for the individual.

360
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:44,272
Spatially, local cuts are obvious.

361
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:47,987
Transport policies, seeking to promote mobility

362
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:50,697
at the citywide are fracturing local territories.

363
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,915
These fractures can be identified from satellite images

364
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:56,381
and the observations made on the ground.

365
00:20:56,381 --> 00:21:00,893
Obviously this kind of transport policy must be accompanied

366
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:05,161
of public space projects that can sew this type of urban fabric.

367
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:09,596
Such building projects of public spaces should

368
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:13,013
obviously not be limited only to constructing sidewalks

369
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:16,700
or bridges to cross these axes.

370
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,553
No !

371
00:21:17,553 --> 00:21:20,992
The public space also concers the activities and functions

372
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:24,068
which are offered around these spaces.

373
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:29,281
In this sense, it is necessary to identify where to locate the points of activities

374
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:31,312
strategically

375
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:34,429
seeking reactivation of neighborhood dynamics

376
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:38,763
through functional diversity by favoring short trips.

377
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,871
This is our third hypothesis.

378
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:45,730
The public space and architecture are fundamental

379
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,313
for the development of the shape of the city

380
00:21:48,313 --> 00:21:50,519
and the definition of urbanity.

381
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,567
Thus the intervention process involving mobility

382
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:57,117
on the territory are always accompanied

383
00:21:57,117 --> 00:22:01,144
by architectural interventions and transformation of the public space

384
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:05,554
which help to consolidate the process of spatial and social cohesion

385
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:08,957
or to weaken it but then are never neutral.

386
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:13,080
For the people of Suba the perceptions of public space are diverse

387
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,489
and opinions expressed sharply divided.

388
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:19,151
The socioeconomic class the less favored simply assigns

389
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:22,243
a function of place of passage, so transit,

390
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:25,537
while the richer classes give it characteristics

391
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:28,441
such as location sharing, community and freedom.

392
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:32,039
The middle classes are positioned between these two opinions.

393
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,056
Perhaps this difference is also a reflection of dissatisfaction

394
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:39,660
and inequality that the working classes are feeling.

395
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,434
In this perception of the public space it is impossible

396
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:45,412
not to speak of urban violence.

397
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:48,118
All socioeconomic strata having mentioned it

398
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,954
as the main problem and

399
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:54,087
indeed, the figures on urban violence after a significant drop

400
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:57,731
in Bogotá in the early 2000s

401
00:22:57,731 --> 00:23:00,638
then only increased.

402
00:23:00,638 --> 00:23:03,811
Therefore further contributes to encourage a society of fear.

403
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:07,516
Besides public spaces where residents feel safer

404
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:10,548
continue to be the shopping centers.

405
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:14,106
So far we wanted to show how mobility issues

406
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:17,716
have a strong influence on the urban dynamic of contemporary cities.

407
00:23:17,716 --> 00:23:21,061
Its relationship with the social and physical issues of the territory.

408
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:24,331
Mobility has an impact on the formation of territories

409
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:27,251
both physically and socially.

410
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:30,919
We have seen that the fragmentation of contemporary territory

411
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,118
can be processed from solutions of mobility

412
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:37,377
also taking into account its influence on public space

413
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,932
which ultimately proves to be the geographical area of ​​mobility.

414
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:43,278
Thank you. See you later.
