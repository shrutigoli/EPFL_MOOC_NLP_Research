00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,180
Hello.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,670
After exploring the theoretical notion of adhesion of a mode of transport

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,780
to the territory, I propose in this video

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,830
to explore together the adhesion of the Algiers tramway.

5
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:18,791
This is part of the results of a thesis

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,421
directed at the Catholic University of Louvain

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:25,141
under the direction of Professor Bernard DeclÃ¨ve.

8
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:27,741
In the previous video, we explored

9
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:30,151
the various aspects of adhesion,

10
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:33,011
which are the spatial adhesion,

11
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:36,231
adhesion in terms of uses and practices

12
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:39,671
and adhesion in terms of organizational processes

13
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:41,051
and actors games.

14
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:44,925
From these three points we will in this video

15
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:47,855
assess the adhesion of the Algiers tramway.

16
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:52,315
The tram is, at least we can say, a trend.

17
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:55,475
It reappeared in many cities around the world

18
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,765
after an absence of half a century in favor of the car.

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,870
Algerian cities, and Algiers in particular,

20
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,340
are not far behind.

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,285
Indeed, Algiers has a first tramway line in 2011.

22
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:11,976
It is at the center of the Bay of Algiers,

23
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:14,146
as you can see here on the representation

24
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:15,566
of municipal boundaries,

25
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:17,786
within the wilaya of Algiers,

26
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:21,166
which is the first administrative division of the country.

27
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:25,936
The Algiers tramway was thought to decongest traffic

28
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:29,936
and move the population to live and habitat to the east

29
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:32,246
to workplaces in the center.

30
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,630
The first line in operation spans 16.2 km

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,950
and includes 28 stations which essentially connect

32
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,440
neighborhoods on the outskirts of the east of Algiers.

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,460
The line has been extended to the east of the city

34
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,460
and it is expected to be the subject of a further extension to the west.

35
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:55,013
In its path, the line crosses diverse neighborhoods

36
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:58,153
from different periods of development of the city.

37
00:01:58,153 --> 00:02:00,533
These are various urban configurations,

38
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,993
involving urban morphology diversity,

39
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:06,993
configuration of urban space and actors involved

40
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,693
in production planning.

41
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:12,311
One of the problems encountered during the project analysis

42
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:15,321
is that it comes through these urban forms

43
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:18,351
following a unique model of double track on site

44
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:21,841
without worrying about the specifics of each urban area,

45
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,231
or the template of the size of the road.

46
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,099
The tram has come to transform the road it occupies

47
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,449
by redesigning the public space throughout its grip

48
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,749
without considering what happens

49
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:36,739
on either side of the line.

50
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:40,618
This is a kind of tube which passes through the town

51
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,468
being isolated from its territory.

52
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:47,027
Therefore, the tram does not contribute to any eventual tranformation

53
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:48,547
of the crossed districts

54
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:51,747
and does not constitute an urban renewal engine

55
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:54,617
as is the case for most rail projects

56
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:56,057
in other cities.

57
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:59,306
It can be seen well in this photograph

58
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:00,816
of the slaughterhouse district,

59
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:02,456
which is the most extreme case

60
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:06,456
and where fences were installed to isolate brownfields

61
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:10,456
pending a possible urban renewal project.

62
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,428
Of having been designed as a single line

63
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,588
occupying the road it crosses,

64
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:20,758
tram sometimes helps to divide the districts into two.

65
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:24,105
It is in some places an impenetrable barrier

66
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:28,105
because of the security device of the site.

67
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:32,847
It is therefore in these disconnected from the parts of territory it crosses.

68
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:37,609
Therefore, the evaluation of the tramway grip makes sense.

69
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:42,281
It is relevant to assess the project and its link to neighborhoods

70
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,601
and urban forms crossed.

71
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:47,811
But also, to assess the practices it generates,

72
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,731
as well as games of actors that revolve around him.

73
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,393
We'll start with the adhesion in terms of organizational process

74
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:56,763
and actors games.

75
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,498
The following diagram shows the various actors

76
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:03,828
that are or not involved in the process of realization of the Algiers tramway

77
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:07,828
which is represented by the vertical green arrow in the center of the image.

78
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:12,325
The process is divided horizontally into three phases:

79
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:16,255
the design, implementation

80
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,185
and exploitation.

81
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,060
From left to right, there are different types of players:

82
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,440
the public sector,

83
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,580
the private sector

84
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,490
and those of civil society.

85
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:31,762
It is clearly seen through analysis

86
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:33,902
that the actors involved in the process

87
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:37,262
of realization of the tram are essentially actors

88
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:38,492
from the public sector.

89
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:43,285
It is the Ministry of Transport that initiates the project,

90
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:47,219
which was then co-driven by a series of public actors.

91
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:52,776
It is basically centralized actors.

92
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:56,126
Local authorities had an advisory role.

93
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:59,386
They had no power to take decisions in the process

94
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,296
of manufacturing the tram.

95
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:06,438
The wilaya of Algiers, for example, had a simple role

96
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:08,088
in the steering committee.

97
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:11,328
Its proposals have not all been taken into account.

98
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:15,728
This is particularly true of the line extension proposal to the airport,

99
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:18,898
which was strongly defended by the wilaya of Algiers.

100
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,420
It is quite relevant because there is not yet

101
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,950
a common transport connection from the airport,

102
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,040
apart from a few taxis and some private buses.

103
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,030
The proposal is relevant because it connects directly

104
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,030
to the airport and it also connects to the university

105
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,630
and the line of commuter trains.

106
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:44,755
This proposal has so far not been considered.

107
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:49,081
The municipalities, in turn, had an advisory role.

108
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:52,441
They had no power of decision or proposal.

109
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:56,216
However, some of them have joined the process

110
00:05:56,216 --> 00:06:00,216
in more or less informal or rather marginal way.

111
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,216
They have begun arrangements that attempt to

112
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:06,166
a certain continuity between the public spaces

113
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,636
equipped with the arrival of the tram and the streets perpendicular to the line

114
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,186
or the abandoned areas near the tramway.

115
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:19,395
In terms of private sector actors and civil society,

116
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:22,805
there was very little implications outside of realization companies

117
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,355
and exploitation.

118
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:27,835
These actors were completely excluded from the process.

119
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:31,568
However, some of them joined it through the conflict.

120
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:36,087
This is the case of traders and residents who joined

121
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:40,087
the project when they found out about its realization.

122
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:43,785
Traders demanded compensation

123
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:46,315
for damage caused and have achieved.

124
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:50,751
The people on the other, including those of Ben Redouane neighborhood

125
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,611
at the est extension,

126
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:55,311
have demonstrated to get a nearby station

127
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:57,191
from their homes.

128
00:06:58,216 --> 00:07:01,686
They blocked the site claiming their right

129
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:03,856
to have a nearby station.

130
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:07,204
They set up banners containing the following slogan:

131
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:09,314
"No stop! No tram! "

132
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:12,092
Their claims have been supported

133
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:14,702
after completion of the extension of the line.

134
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:17,945
Today, a new station is being installed

135
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:19,625
to meet their needs.

136
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,760
However, a consideration of the expectations of people

137
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,040
and all other stakeholders early in the process

138
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,580
would have avoided conflicts and additional costs

139
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,880
caused by the delay of works by a new study

140
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,230
and by changing the line in full operation.

141
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,760
From this analysis, we can say that the tram was in-adherent

142
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,070
in terms of organizational processes and actors games.

143
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,350
It ruled out a number of key players in the production

144
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,880
of the Algerian territory.

145
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:54,615
Now come to the adhesion in terms of practices and uses.

146
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:56,852
Accordingly to official figures,

147
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,482
the tram would have recorded 18 million passengers

148
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:01,732
the first two years of operation.

149
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:05,497
This represents half of the project forecasts

150
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:08,297
and much less than its actual transport capacity.

151
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:11,702
The data is based on ticket sales

152
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:12,872
and validation.

153
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:17,371
But in reality, we could observe through field surveys

154
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,391
that the tram is full at any time of the day

155
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,391
and all the days of the week.

156
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:26,379
Interviews with controllers, ticket sellers,

157
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:30,379
drivers and users have shown that the majority of travelers

158
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,379
do not buy their tickets or never validated it.

159
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:37,474
This is due to lack of control on the one hand

160
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:40,144
and degradation of the composting machines

161
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,104
at some stations on the other.

162
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:47,596
Also, even though the price is higher than other modes of transport,

163
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:50,766
the tram is widely used because of the lack of control

164
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:52,456
and therefore it is free.

165
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:55,467
The analysis of the quality of service, accessibility

166
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:59,467
and the security apparatus and the use of the tram

167
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:03,067
show that it is fully adherent in terms of practice.

168
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:06,097
However, adhesion might be improving

169
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:08,597
if a single pricing is in place

170
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,717
for all transport modes

171
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,537
and that the network is reorganized to converge

172
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:18,007
other modes of transport, including buses, to the tram,

173
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:21,527
or it could deteriorate if more controls

174
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,327
and a rate increase with a decrease

175
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:26,077
of state subsidies.

176
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:30,469
Finally, just to present the spatial grip of the Algiers tramway.

177
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,107
First at the metropolitan level.

178
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:35,048
We can see on the picture,

179
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:36,838
at the scale of the wilaya of Algiers,

180
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:39,298
there is currently three important lines

181
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:40,728
of transport.

182
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:43,798
There is the tram, metro and train.

183
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:47,874
The three are interconnected and will serve for now

184
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:51,174
only a part of the center and the outskirts of Algiers.

185
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,230
To be adherent at the metropolitan level,

186
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,230
tram must shift from one mode of transport to another

187
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,340
and serve through intermodal throughout the territory of the city.

188
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,690
Beyond these three modes of transport on rails,

189
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,230
the public transport network of Algiers is basically bus lines.

190
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,459
Part is public,

191
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,619
the other is made of a multiplicity of individual carriers.

192
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,860
The problem

193
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,190
is that the bus network has been reorganized

194
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,070
with the arrival of the tram and the metro.

195
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:28,304
Some lines run parallel to the tram.

196
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:31,084
They are competing, especially in terms of price,

197
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:34,004
travel time and stops flexibility

198
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,144
when it comes to private carriers.

199
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:39,784
These carriers stop at any point of the street

200
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,234
depending on the application.

201
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:45,704
These buses do not allow a drawdown on the tram,

202
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:49,704
which has very little intermodal stations.

203
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:52,939
It is therefore not possible to reach all points

204
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:56,519
of the metropolitan territory from the tramway.

205
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,459
It is therefore in-adherent at the metropolitan level.

206
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,859
What about locally?

207
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:05,309
As part of research on the tram,

208
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:07,819
we conducted sample analysis

209
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:10,279
at different scales throughout the tram.

210
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:15,333
Adherence is analyzed from eight frames of one square kilometer

211
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,723
representing a distance of comfortable walking movement

212
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:21,283
500 meters from both sides of the line.

213
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:26,116
In these frames, we identified the different characteristic elements

214
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:28,856
of the territory based and story filled

215
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:32,486
on elements defined by Kevin Lynch <i> The city Image </ i>.

216
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,650
These are nodes and centralities,

217
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,210
cue points and routes,

218
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,990
limits, sub-districts,

219
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,680
mobility elements,

220
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,680
equipment and public spaces.

221
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,230
Next, we analyzed the relationship of the tram

222
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,860
with these components

223
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,720
having the hiking metric reference.

224
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:59,231
The job was to see if it is possible from a station

225
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:02,471
within walking distance of all the elements of the territory,

226
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:06,471
to cross boundaries, to join a public space and so on ...

227
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:11,996
It was possible for each element to identify five possible configurations

228
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:15,306
ranking from less adherent to the more adherent.

229
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,380
This is nonadherent configurations,

230
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,450
non-adherent configurations but with a grip potential,

231
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,650
adherent configurations by the pedestrian link,

232
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,200
adherent configurations proximity

233
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,450
and adherent configurations by juxtaposition of the elements.

234
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:38,865
To better understand,

235
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:41,495
it is interesting to illustrate some configurations

236
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,255
by concrete evidence.

237
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:47,255
Here we find the Bab Ezzouar University City station.

238
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:52,955
You can see a close proximity of the station with buildings

239
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:56,955
of the University City Bab Ezzouar 1.

240
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:59,762
There was almost a superposition of elements

241
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:03,762
and therefore a very good adhesion of the tram to this equipment.

242
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,201
It is in this configuration.

243
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:09,251
In the same place, you can see bus shelters

244
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,511
on the same platform as the tram.

245
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:16,473
Here too, there is a very good adhesion of the tram mobility system

246
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:19,453
through a juxtaposition of elements.

247
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:22,833
The tram station is the same as the bus station.

248
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:27,126
Always from the Bab Ezzouar University City station,

249
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:31,476
if you look across to the city of accommodation of 8 May 1945

250
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:35,476
one can see a fence separating the tram of the city.

251
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:38,084
It was installed with the arrival of the tram,

252
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,864
therefore creating a new limit.

253
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:43,161
Although the tramway merges with that limit,

254
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:46,751
it has a binding potential because it would be enough to open

255
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:50,751
some access to the city to create new connections

256
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:55,131
and improve adhesion of the tram to the city for housing.

257
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,020
Entering inside the city of 8 May 1945

258
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,020
we can see a range of facilities including the school,

259
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,270
which is isolated by a fence, and an easy walk

260
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,950
is strewn with obstacles.

261
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:13,046
It also includes the market in the heart of the city housing

262
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:15,416
occupying public roads.

263
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:19,554
The problem is that these items are less than 500 meters

264
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:22,844
fron the previous station but access is not easy

265
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:26,844
because public space is furnished and is strewn with obstacles.

266
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,630
The people complain in particular of the mud in winter

267
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,010
and insecurity for children crossing

268
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,600
through these barriers.

269
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:36,547
The connections are absent and space is abandoned.

270
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:40,171
The tram is in-adherent to these facilities.

271
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,989
If we sum up all configurations encountered

272
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:46,309
for each district and each element,

273
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:48,549
we find the following table.

274
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:52,733
It was made clear that in most areas analyzed

275
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:55,633
configurations are in-adherent.

276
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,790
However, in four of the seven elements analyzed,

277
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,200
there is a majority of in-adherent configurations

278
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,450
but which have binding potential.

279
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:06,833
You can see the orange in the table.

280
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:11,404
Sometimes just small actions are needed to improve adhesion of the tram

281
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:13,274
to the territory through which it passes,

282
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:15,694
as we saw with the fence

283
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:18,474
separating the tram of the city housing,

284
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:21,134
where we just need to open access.

285
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:26,642
The question now is how to improve

286
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:28,622
the adhesion of the tram

287
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:32,622
and how to use the grip not as a simple analysis tool

288
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:34,782
but also as a project tool.

289
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:38,072
The following picture shows a project outline

290
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:40,862
which served as part of doctoral research

291
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:44,862
to establish discussions with stakeholders of the Algerian territory

292
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:48,862
in order to converge their concerns about the tramway.

293
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,700
The following picture shows a project outline

294
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,410
which served as part of doctoral research

295
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,200
to establish discussions with stakeholders of the Algerian territory

296
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,130
in order to converge their concerns about the tramway.

297
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:06,491
The idea is to strengthen the adhesion of the tram

298
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:09,251
by improving connections between stations

299
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:13,251
and the various elements of the territory that we have identified.

300
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:19,676
Priority development axes are available in red on the map

301
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:24,536
and continue the development already achieved in the tramway

302
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:28,416
and who will go  connect devices

303
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,126
or characteristic elements of the territory

304
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:35,126
and then cross the boundaries to connect parts of the city.

305
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:38,423
Most of these facilities are facilities

306
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,983
to improve the existing road

307
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:43,363
to promote pedestrian movement.

308
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:47,504
Others are new connections made from the grind

309
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:49,354
of large land surfaces

310
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:52,964
or opening of access to certain public facilities

311
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:54,594
as can be seen here.

312
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:59,538
We also propose in this project to prioritize the use of land

313
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:02,068
favoring the use of potential land

314
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:05,248
lying along the designated public spaces,

315
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:07,448
which can be seen here in grey.

316
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,170
Future programs that will be installed

317
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,100
will receive a good adhesion of the tram

318
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,160
and therefore a good transport links.

319
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:19,412
We also offer, in certain configurations,

320
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:22,622
to divert bus lines or move stops

321
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:26,622
to bring them closer to the tram station.

322
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:31,896
In this video, we explored all the analytical potential

323
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:33,796
of this notion of grip.

324
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:36,553
We saw that the Algiers tramway

325
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:40,283
although it is adherent in terms of practices and uses,

326
00:17:40,283 --> 00:17:42,993
is completely in-adherent in spatial terms

327
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:46,993
and in terms of organizational processes and actors games.

328
00:17:47,723 --> 00:17:50,323
We have also seen that this notion of adhesion

329
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:52,183
can serve as a project tool.

330
