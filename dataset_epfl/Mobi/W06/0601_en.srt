00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,220
Hello

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:08,790
Thank you for accompanying us for the seventh module of the course

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,500
Mobility planning

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:15,178
Today we propose to reflect on what links

5
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:19,251
the organization of movement in the city and the hardware manufacturing

6
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:22,851
of tissues and public spaces

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,280
We will try to show how the coordination structure

8
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:31,005
of the territory by the networks and the production of built-up densities

9
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:35,135
and land uses represent a collective action issue.

10
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,913
To understand what is at stake, we offer

11
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:43,023
resorting to theatrical metaphor.

12
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:48,698
As in the theater, in fact, urban production stages actors,

13
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:52,708
it obeys different scenarios that take place in a setting

14
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:56,024
and in specific performance conditions.

15
00:00:56,978 --> 00:01:00,308
The course plan will build on this metaphor.

16
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:03,451
We will first present the plot

17
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:07,791
and describe the roles played by the main categories of actors

18
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,647
We will then describe

19
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,867
some articulation scenarios of mobility scenarios

20
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:17,257
highlighting the issues associated with it

21
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:22,954
Finally, we will discuss two paradoxes that distract players

22
00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:25,287
from the common goals they might have

23
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:27,297
in the plot that binds them:

24
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,914
the paradox of the specialization of space

25
00:01:29,914 --> 00:01:32,504
and that of its fragmentation

26
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,199
The plot of the drama consists of two major components:

27
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:39,510
the structuring of the territory by networks

28
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,840
and the construction of the built fabric and urban public spaces

29
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,037
These are two complementary dynamics

30
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,965
but also partially competing

31
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:51,675
and which do not mobilize the same systems of actors

32
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,936
The first structure the manufacturing of the city

33
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:58,176
from viaires infrastructure

34
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:04,601
The prospect is that in a second time, building lots

35
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:08,040
will come to connect this structure.

36
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:12,986
The second dynamic is centered on the production of these areas to build

37
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:17,302
In order to enhance the habitat for economic activities,

38
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:20,785
for business or for community service

39
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:24,085
Understandably, if there is no road, the urban fabric

40
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:27,654
will not have a structure but the materialization of accommodating rail route

41
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:30,160
isn't sufficient either to make the city

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,299
The plot of the drama thus consists of

43
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:35,029
the organization of the relationship between these two logics

44
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,755
We use generic terms but let us remember

45
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:42,940
the term road is applicable to a wide variety of objects:

46
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,751
roads, highways, streets,

47
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:47,701
boulevards, country roads, railways

48
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:52,340
Each of these objects has a specific technology and let us remind us too

49
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,335
that the technology associated with the production of infrastructures

50
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:58,065
is intimately linked to that of the movement of vehicles

51
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:02,440
A transmission line in this perspective, it is an association

52
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,590
between the technology of a physical layout and that of a range of mobile objects

53
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:11,500
The structuring of the territory by road networks

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,420
is generally provided by operators called "first level"

55
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,907
They part lines in the area to connect

56
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:22,547
origins and destinations

57
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,935
At the nodes of the networks they trace and at more or less regular intervals

58
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:30,437
on these lines, they shall adjust a series of gates

59
00:03:30,437 --> 00:03:35,137
that open the network on the territory or to other networks

60
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:40,009
To these doors are often associated service areas

61
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:44,779
for maintenance or for the storage of moving vehicles.

62
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:48,885
Then come the second level operators

63
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:52,172
These are economic actors and public operators

64
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:55,834
that rely on the first level of infrastructure to connect it

65
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:59,234
to housing, factories, schools, shops, administrations

66
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,160
educational and cultural facilities etc.

67
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:07,836
They produce tissues and density built around nodes,

68
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:14,983
along the lines or within the mesh of the network

69
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:20,674
Finally, there is the third level of operators

70
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:23,664
It's you, it's me, all urban households using

71
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,743
the facilities of the two categories of previous actors

72
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:29,552
to create their own network territory

73
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:33,318
They contribute to the co-production of the system by uses

74
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:35,758
and the consumptions they make in

75
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:40,970
The first level of operators usually have for service project

76
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,236
to develop an isotropic space, ie providing total accessibility

77
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,576
to all and for all

78
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:52,198
The implementation of this service project has three major dimensions:

79
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:55,687
First action on physical structures, ie production

80
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:58,917
and hardware maintenance of lines, nodes and doors

81
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,955
Then the organizational dimension regarding modes

82
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:06,235
of limitation of use of lines and nodes: signage,

83
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,425
the action on the temporality of uses

84
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:13,395
And finally, the dimension of governance and service management

85
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:16,559
which includes the issue of coordination between operators

86
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:20,953
In the contemporary city, this means the need to organize

87
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,643
the multi-speed network cohabitation

88
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:27,182
The networks that cross our cities correspond indeed

89
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:33,552
to technologies, metrics, speed tolerances

90
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,170
and often very different management and safety requirements

91
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:43,422
Regulating the coexistence of these speeds is a major

92
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:45,923
problematic of urban planning of networks

93
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:49,179
Second-level operators rely on road networks

94
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,999
to connect production and service networks

95
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:54,636
including the urban economy needs

96
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:58,533
Their action has a decisive effect on the intensity of trade in the city,

97
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,903
and the system of centralities

98
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:04,751
They do not choose their location at random, but accordingly

99
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:08,971
to accessibility offers produced by the first-level actors;

100
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:13,176
dependingly also on the attractiveness of the sites, felt needs

101
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:15,536
and land opportunities

102
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,854
Land use by activities is accompanied

103
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:22,078
by property developments that generate both

104
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:26,108
built-up densities and an offer on public spaces

105
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:28,907
Each activity generates flow:

106
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:33,297
flows of people, flows of goods entering or leaving

107
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:36,627
the institution that houses it: it is the staff,

108
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:40,080
the suppliers or different types of public to receive, or

109
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,950
raw materials, equipment or work products

110
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,860
Each stream corresponds to usage pf transmission means

111
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:52,287
Their representation determines

112
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,587
what is called "the mobility profile of an activity"

113
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:58,946
The change in land use for different activities

114
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:00,994
naturally leads to a diversification

115
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,914
of mobility profiles

116
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:08,017
It can generate new demand for mobility vis-à-vis operators

117
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:11,737
on first level and may force them to review

118
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:13,568
their accessibility offers

119
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:16,377
Nothing is fixed once and for all

120
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:20,504
Let us return to the question of the location of public facilities

121
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:22,444
by the second-level actors

122
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,010
Since these facilities are open to the public, criterion

123
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:30,113
important of location is the right distance to the population

124
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:31,733
covered by the service offered

125
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:35,275
If we observe what happens in dense cities listed

126
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:39,010
in a polycentric territorial structure, we see that the townspeople

127
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,225
willing to travel four to ten kilometers to reach

128
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:46,131
metropolitan facilities such as a stadium, a cathedral,

129
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:49,721
a city hotel or a great place for a show or concert

130
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:55,058
They agree to do two to six kilometers to go

131
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,148
to a multi-sport infrastructure or library

132
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,740
Knowing that for a multisport center in full operation,

133
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,770
requires a population of 25 000 to 40 000 inhabitants which is perhaps

134
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,810
not always the case in small towns in question

135
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:15,272
A work program is necessary in each case that requires

136
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:19,422
a critical reflection device adapted to the specific context

137
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:24,364
At this stage we can nevertheless retain a thing: interdependence

138
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:28,245
between the location of public facilities and the shape

139
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:30,885
of the large territory in which they operate

140
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:34,635
We will discuss this issue in more detail in the next course

141
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:38,639
Today, facilities like hospitals, stadiums,

142
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,344
shopping centers, activity areas are demanding undivided areas

143
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:47,833
of large size and usually they do not find in the dense city

144
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:51,993
available and capable lands to meet their needs

145
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,392
They depart therefore to settle outside of the city

146
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:59,154
First, they connect on open roads

147
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:04,417
of average speed in periphery and they contribute to both the urban sprawl

148
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:08,447
and the transformation of its internal system of centrality

149
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:12,696
They also impose often, a one-way transformation

150
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:17,602
and impose on the landscape metrics of self-mobility

151
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:22,102
In a second scenario, they try to connect to the device

152
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:25,205
of high speed motor located away from the city:

153
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:28,659
the highway or a bypass defining a second

154
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,489
or a third peripheral ring

155
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,270
In a third scenario, they settled in the fields

156
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:39,411
Instead of connecting directly to an existing road network

157
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:43,696
they force the viaire or rail network to extend to them

158
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:50,696
Whatever the scenario, the equipment polarizes space but it helps

159
00:09:50,696 --> 00:09:53,516
at the same time at its fragmentation

160
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:57,144
And all major facilities follow the same strategy:

161
00:09:57,162 --> 00:10:00,834
they rarely seek to form the tissue or public space

162
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,004
that would connect them to other equipment

163
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:07,982
They want to remain customized, visible and spaced

164
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:12,384
in a landscape governed by self-mobility and market laws

165
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:16,991
This dynamic often generates carriers places of urbanity

166
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:21,893
If we return to the area of ​​roads, the same phenomenon

167
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:23,604
of fragmentation is observed

168
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:27,152
The issue of sharing of the public space between the flow puts in pressure

169
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:31,180
two antagonistic approaches: on one side is a logical

170
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,420
specialization that gives each flow a technology line

171
00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:39,541
specifically governed by the laws of hydraulic engineering and giving

172
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:44,471
place in a depersonalized space controlled by a public operator

173
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:50,434
This refers to the right through a multitude of marking and signals

174
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:53,904
which often destroys the very idea of ​​public space

175
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:58,322
And on the other hand, we have what we call "a logic of place" based

176
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:02,287
on culture and how interpersonal urbanity

177
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,292
are occurring in space

178
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:07,554
Behaviors comply here with the general rules of civility

179
00:11:07,554 --> 00:11:11,407
or politeness and it is through interpersonal eye contact

180
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:13,677
that are granted priorities

181
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,060
The logic of place requires the multifunctionality of public space

182
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:21,485
while the logic of the specialization is to postulate

183
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:24,757
a separation of flows for the effective management

184
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:29,257
All we have seen shows how to establish the interaction system

185
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:33,146
between traffic networks governed by the first-level actors

186
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:36,956
and economic networks governed by those of the second level

187
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:40,019
Let us not forget that other networks contribute

188
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,992
to the structuring of the territory

189
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:46,457
Let us remember that basically any territorial matrix depends

190
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:49,649
closely on the morphology of river systems

191
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:52,445
that structured reliefs and valleys in history

192
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:56,745
and with which trafficking networks must always dial

193
00:11:57,575 --> 00:12:01,813
Moreover, the mobility in the city is not just about humans

194
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,043
but also the fauna and flora

195
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:08,457
Green networks ensure biodiversity and ecological

196
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:11,263
continuities and are also important structural levers

197
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,863
of space as an ecosystem.

198
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:17,887
The spatial organization is the product of the joint work

199
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:20,427
of these four layers of networks

200
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:24,785
The key issue of governance of an integrated territorial system

201
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,120
consists in cooperation situation of different cultures

202
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:32,635
that led to the writing of lines, dots and mesh

203
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:35,345
materializing the different layers

204
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:39,415
After this brief overview, we note two points:

205
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:43,351
Planning network involves three types of operators

206
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:47,441
none of which has the power to ensure alone efficient flow management,

207
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:51,441
production densities and quality of public spaces

208
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:55,346
This is definitely a coproduction

209
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,722
Secondly, the installation of new lines triggers both

210
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:02,966
a systemic process of destructuring

211
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:06,076
and space restructuring.

212
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,492
Speed ​​plays a key role in this process

213
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:15,183
We live in territories of multiple speeds but let us remember

214
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:18,685
that every journey always begins and ends by foot

215
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:21,947
This is the pedestrian metric that should set the research quality

216
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:27,367
of public space and the  organization of space intermodal devices

217
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:31,164
In this lesson, we described the system dynamics

218
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,160
of articulation at the local level and with particular emphasis on the issue

219
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:39,583
of the articulation between the tier-one operators and two level

220
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:43,147
In the next lesson, we will return in more detail

221
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:46,987
on the contribution of networks to structure the territory

222
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:51,869
Thank you for your attention and good luck
