Adhesion Mobility and Planning

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:06,233
Hello, in this video,

3
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:08,355
I'll talk about the concept of adhesion

4
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:10,482
of transport systems to territories.

5
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:13,731
We will discuss about exploring a way among others

6
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:16,459
of thinking the transport and mobility

7
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:18,009
related to urban planning,

8
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:20,076
essentially in spatial terms

9
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:23,431
but also in terms of practices, uses, actors games

10
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:25,770
and organizational processes.

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,490
As you could see through the week courses

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,795
and the videos of my colleagues

13
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:34,042
the thought on transport and mobility is experiencing a revival

14
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:37,303
which is due not only to the emergence of new practices

15
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:41,456
but also to an awareness that the logic of transportation engineering

16
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:45,471
sometimes helped to deconstruct the urban fabric.

17
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:49,450
Indeed, production of transport in general

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,656
and public transport in particular has long been thought and realized

19
00:00:53,656 --> 00:00:57,655
in a logic of movement from point A to point B

20
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:01,149
regardless of what happens in between.

21
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:06,292
This logic is that of the modern city shaped by the division of labor

22
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:09,763
and distribution activities following zonings

23
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:13,032
which must be linked together in the most effective way.

24
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,785
This vision of transport as a link between point A and point B

25
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:24,596
both considered as inventory and therefore space-times

26
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:27,006
considers the same connection between the two points

27
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:29,889
as out of space-time, as a non-place.

28
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,096
It would be a void that must be cut

29
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:35,412
by growing increasingly speed

30
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:37,735
and reducing travel time,

31
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:41,384
or occupying a distraction or any activity.

32
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:43,996
Considered in this way, transport is

33
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:47,156
increasingly designed and produced on site

34
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:52,420
to minimize external interference and move faster and faster.

35
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:56,054
They are therefore increasingly isolated from the city

36
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:58,884
and what it refers to as social,

37
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:02,744
economic activities and urban intensities.

38
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,519
Faced with this situation, many authors and professionals

39
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:10,278
propose to rethink mobility and transport systems

40
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:13,073
by integrating in the reflection on the city.

41
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:17,506
They defend the idea that any kind of transport modes

42
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:19,845
and especially public transport,

43
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:21,603
participates in a city project

44
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:24,163
and in the improvment of the quality of urban space,

45
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:27,928
it must participate in building or construction

46
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:31,446
of the anchor of the mobility system to the territory of the city.

47
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:35,311
This anchoring happens through better adherence to the territory.

48
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:38,394
According to Jacques Lévy,

49
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:41,973
the adhesion of a metric is the possibility for the traveler

50
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:44,780
to cover all points of the route.

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,208
It is the ratio between the length of the network in a given unit of measure

52
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,254
and the number of breakpoints.

53
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,887
This includes the idea that multiple breakpoints for a transit

54
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:57,860
strengthen its grip.

55
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,849
The more stations there would be, the more metric would cling to the territory

56
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:03,966
and the more it would stick.

57
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:07,061
The adhesion is measured on a scale,

58
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,260
from the least to the most acceding member

59
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,374
or from the discontinuous terminal adhesion to the continuous longitudinal adhesion.

60
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:19,234
We find in a first extreme the air transport.

61
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:23,792
Completely offline places, it takes off from point A to point B.

62
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:26,625
It is completely disconnected.

63
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:30,000
In the other extreme, we find walking

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,655
completely continuous and fully adheres to the territory.

65
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:37,934
It provides access to all these parties.

66
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:41,762
Next, in descending order of adhesion we find

67
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:46,309
bike, car, bus, tram, train

68
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,901
perhaps the boat and finally the plane.

69
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:54,971
George Amar proposes to classify the different types of movements

70
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,289
according to their relation to the city

71
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:00,649
by positioning them from the more discontinuous to the more continuous.

72
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:05,784
To the spread and the general city territory correspond less adherent modes

73
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:09,172
that increase the speed and reduce the anchor points.

74
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:13,748
In contrast, the wealth of the urban fabric correspond

75
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:16,330
to more adherent modes that allow access

76
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,329
to a maximum of places as a kind of small points of sewing.

77
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,627
Furthermore, the less a motion is adherent to the territory,

78
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:28,754
the more its own content both in terms of activity and in terms of space

79
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:32,219
is itself abroad to places and activities it connects.

80
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:35,027
Conversely, the more the movement is adherent

81
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:37,871
the more points that determine the adhesion are linked

82
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:40,874
with the environment and determines the movement itself.

83
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:45,047
The occupation of travel time has become more and more important

84
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:48,943
with the emergence of new communication technologies.

85
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:51,897
It is now possible to send an email,

86
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:54,122
calling to schedule a meeting

87
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:56,754
or just to play while moving.

88
00:04:57,802 --> 00:05:01,252
The idea of ​​combining the thought of the city and its urban forms

89
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,199
with the mobility and transport

90
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,024
implies the idea of ​​thinking these as a system

91
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:11,126
where adherence to the territories is a positive value.

92
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:17,580
The more discontinuous is a mode, the more it should be completed

93
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,959
by continuous modes to enhance the adhesion of the system.

94
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,559
Therefore, think intermodality as a system

95
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:28,234
which allows to go from discontinuity to continuity.

96
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,744
If we take the example of a TGV

97
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:36,530
that connects to the city to a single point

98
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,100
which is a big train station

99
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:43,529
that must connect to a subway or streetcar or commuter train

100
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:47,891
attached via an intermodal item.

101
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:52,129
This subway is slightly stickier than the TGV

102
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:56,926
which in turn connects to a bus line

103
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:59,625
or for example a tram

104
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,052
that it is much more adherent to the territory

105
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:05,524
and multiplying the anchor points.

106
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:08,603
It connects to other modes

107
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:13,689
from intermodal nodes.

108
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:17,413
The most adherent metric is the pedestrian metric,

109
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:21,380
this system should promote interaction between mechanized transport

110
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,613
and especially public transport on the one hand

111
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:27,320
and pedestrian movement on the other.

112
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:32,015
Therefore, we would have from these points

113
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:36,609
a mesh networking of pedestrian paths.

114
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,596
If we limit ourselves to the definitions given so far,

115
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:49,869
adherence remains attached to the linearity of course.

116
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,752
It does not support the thickness of territory

117
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:54,721
including around each metric

118
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:58,006
neither the report of continuity with hiking metric.

119
00:06:58,006 --> 00:07:02,335
The proliferation of anchorage points of a public transport line

120
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:05,531
does not necessarily guarantee the link to the online environment.

121
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:09,703
The anchors do not necessarily guarantee a good walking relay.

122
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,461
If the route on foot is poorly designed or strewn with obstacles

123
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,967
the adhesion of the system is undermined.

124
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:20,435
If residents or pedestrians do not have access to the metric

125
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:22,008
for one reason or another

126
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:26,672
the adhesion of this transport is weakening despite the large number of stops.

127
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:31,244
Thus, the notion of adherence involves a much broader understanding

128
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:35,078
that is important to redefine or rather complete.

129
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,071
If we take the definition of adhesion

130
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:41,304
as the state of a thing that physically adheres to another

131
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:46,228
in the case of urban space the adhesion becomes the own of urban items

132
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:51,558
that promote contact among themselves and with the different parts of the territory.

133
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:56,193
An adherent transportation mode is not only a fashion

134
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:58,058
which multiplies anchor points

135
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:02,965
but also a mode that connects these points to different objects

136
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:05,229
constitutive of that territory.

137
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:09,030
Thus, it seems clear that in the scale of the city,

138
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,758
the transport system must adhere differently

139
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:15,191
based on scales of territory, the centrality

140
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:18,002
and the radiation from objects it connects.

141
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:23,730
If we take for example public facilities and their radius of influence

142
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,571
as shown in this diagram by Richard Rogers

143
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:31,041
some metropolitan facilities need to be connected

144
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,709
following the logic of the great distances and large areas.

145
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:39,210
It can be a hospital, university or government.

146
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,695
Their corresponding patterns are discontinuous modes

147
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:45,273
connecting centralities between themselves.

148
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:48,701
The more facilities are close to the small scale,

149
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:51,646
the more metrics must be continuous.

150
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:57,648
They must multiply the anchors to cling to small distances.

151
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:04,884
At the local neighborhoods and neighborhood scale,

152
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:07,133
when the distances are shorter

153
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,745
it is the pedestrian metric that ensures adhesion.

154
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:14,226
The various stops of a tram or a bus, for example

155
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:17,351
must allow continuity of the pedestrian traffic

156
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:20,290
from the interior of these modes outwardly.

157
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,572
At each station, it should be possible to join

158
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:26,799
within a walking comfort distance, all the elements

159
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,090
constituting the surrounding territory within a certain thickness

160
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:32,933
on either side of the line

161
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,031
as shown in this drawing.

162
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,653
It should also be possible to cross

163
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:45,720
natural or artificial boundaries with special facilities.

164
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,859
This would strengthen the contact

165
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,925
between different metrics and the territory of the city

166
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,589
via the pedestrian metric.

167
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:58,015
In this context, the public space is of considerable importance

168
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,891
because it is the support of pedestrian travels.

169
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,619
If the other metrics are, when they have a good grip,

170
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:08,088
small scale seams, as stated by Georges Amar,

171
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:10,632
hiking metric through the public space is

172
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:13,998
more like a weave on the whole territory.

173
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:18,372
Seen in this way, the effectiveness of a mobility system and adhesion

174
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:23,243
not only fall within the passage of the discontinuous mode to continuous modes

175
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:26,753
but also weave through the public space.

176
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:30,759
What we have just seen, identifies a problem

177
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,922
we might call the adhesion paradox.

178
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:37,556
Indeed, adherence to metropolitan areas and regions

179
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:42,261
must allow transport efficiency in terms of journey times.

180
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:46,756
In contrast, adherence to local scales must allow a serving

181
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:52,154
of a multitude of locations and activities in proximity to each other.

182
00:10:52,154 --> 00:10:57,283
Because of this tension between levels of scale and service planning,

183
00:10:57,283 --> 00:11:00,556
the question of adhesion inevitably raises the problem

184
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:05,369
of the articulation and balance between the commercial speed metrics

185
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:10,112
and the finesse of the service and therefore the spacing of stations.

186
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:14,639
A same metric can sometimes require speed at some places

187
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,411
and slow and strong adhesion to others,

188
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:21,232
especially near living areas and urban intensity.

189
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:24,759
The difficulty is to identify accurately

190
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,194
places of adhesion and places of non-adhesion.

191
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:32,134
This is a problem that can not be answered, only case by case.

192
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:35,059
By working fine and simultaneously,

193
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:38,065
on urban morphology, distribution

194
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,940
and the concentration of activities and places of living

195
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,200
and much more technical aspects related to transport and mobility.

196
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,007
After traveling this notion of adhesion

197
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:53,071
and what it implies in planning mobility relationship

198
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:55,146
I propose now to enrich

199
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:58,037
the definitions we have explored so far.

200
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:01,658
I propose to break the adhesion on three levels.

201
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:06,399
First, the spatial grip we have explored before.

202
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:10,888
By having public space and pedestrian metric as a reference,

203
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:14,249
it is possible to define the adhesion of a mode of transport

204
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:17,405
as its ability to increase contacts

205
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:22,024
with the territory and it crosses with the objects that make up this territory.

206
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:25,576
This adhesion is assured by multiplying

207
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:28,889
anchor points or stops on one hand

208
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,914
and the establishment of links and contacts

209
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:34,656
in the thickness of the other territory.

210
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:37,331
This is done through connection to other lines

211
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:39,295
when it comes to large-scale

212
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,310
and through the public space when it comes to the local level.

213
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:48,642
To ensure a certain urban quality at the neighborhood,

214
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:53,629
any urban object must provide some comfort access to pedestrian movement.

215
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:57,509
It is the relationship of the various objects in the pedestrian metric

216
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:00,351
which ensures adherence to the territory.

217
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:03,514
Therefore the adhesion becomes

218
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,175
one of the conditions of the construction of an urban space

219
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,104
that would provide a certain quality of life in cities.

220
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:13,712
Viewed this way, adhesion becomes the means to ensure continuity

221
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:16,765
between the mobility space as a public space

222
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,842
as understood by Isaac Joseph

223
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:24,276
and urban public space built by streets, squares, parks, etc.

224
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,903
The other two types of adhesion are:

225
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:31,308
adhesion in terms of uses and practices;

226
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:35,686
and adhesion in terms of organizational processes and actors games.

227
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:39,938
It seems important to extend the concept of adherence to the territories

228
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:42,622
with all its components.

229
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:46,261
The adhesion is no longer the exclusive physical contact

230
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:49,143
but also becomes the characteristic of a metric

231
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:52,554
compared to some individual or collective behavior.

232
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,677
The behavior and the dynamics of the actors that produce the city

233
00:13:56,677 --> 00:14:00,093
and people who use the metric in question become

234
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:03,810
additional criteria to characterize adhesion.

235
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,992
The adhesion in terms of uses and practices

236
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:10,481
implies the idea that citizens accept at first

237
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:12,434
the mode that is offered.

238
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,255
Secondly, this implies the fact

239
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:16,772
that they use it and they have access to it.

240
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,092
To do so would require that the mode of transportation offer them

241
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:25,056
some adhesion which is materialized in a first step by its efficiency,

242
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:27,177
its quality and its comfort.

243
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:32,771
A transport system that for example wastes users' time

244
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,414
relative to another mode of motion,

245
00:14:35,414 --> 00:14:38,625
including the car or that involves many changes

246
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,396
can discourage travelers from using it.

247
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:44,899
It is in this case, what you observed

248
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,466
through the case of the Geneva tram

249
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:50,726
presented by Vincent Kaufman in previous lessons.

250
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:56,254
The second point of adhesion in terms of uses and practices

251
00:14:56,254 --> 00:14:58,253
is accessibility.

252
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:03,516
For a mode to be used, it would have to offer

253
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:06,149
simply some accessibility

254
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:08,144
which is materialized by two points.

255
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:11,793
First spatial configurations.

256
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:16,356
This refers initially to spatial configurations

257
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,674
to be near living places, jobs,

258
00:15:19,674 --> 00:15:23,433
to be unobstructed and to the efficiency of the mesh.

259
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:27,025
This also refers to the care of the elderly

260
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:28,777
and the disabled

261
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,778
requiring specific facilities.

262
00:15:31,937 --> 00:15:34,869
The second aspect of accessibility is financial.

263
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:39,760
It is defined in relation to fares

264
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,282
and the ability to access for a large number of citizens

265
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:46,173
from different social backgrounds.

266
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:51,074
This is especially important as the production of public transport

267
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:54,947
is often marked by social prism or even socio-economic

268
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:57,620
which aims to link neighborhoods together

269
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,351
and to create diversity by bringing jobs to people.

270
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:06,076
So that citizens can use the offer

271
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:08,428
they should simply be able to

272
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:11,544
afford to buy a ticket.

273
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:15,029
The last point concerns security.

274
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,260
It goes through a series of technical devices but also human

275
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,042
for citizens to use public transport offered

276
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:26,216
they should have above all a sense of security

277
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:29,365
which allows them to borrow this transport without fear.

278
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:35,760
This involves safety of users compared to physical attacks,

279
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,001
thefts and accidents.

280
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:42,024
It can go through a series of devices

281
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:46,085
who are lighting stations or the installation of safety barriers,

282
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,859
awareness,

283
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:51,700
conflict mediation, control of ticket

284
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,771
or extreme police repression.

285
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:58,456
The adhesion in terms of organizational processes

286
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:00,164
and sets of actors in turn

287
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:04,940
involves initially the idea that territorial producers actors

288
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:07,731
adhere to the proposed transportation project

289
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:11,679
and integrate the processes and dynamics at work or in the future.

290
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,570
Secondly, this implies that the project itself

291
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:20,775
integrates the dynamics of various actors in its own process.

292
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:24,891
As dynamic participating in the manufacture of the city,

293
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,462
the creation, the management

294
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,606
or the reorganization of a system or mode of transport

295
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:32,040
systematically creates an interaction

296
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,736
with other city productive dynamics.

297
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:38,144
It highlights interaction of public sector actors

298
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,202
private sector actors

299
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:42,441
and civil society.

300
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:44,198
It also uses interaction

301
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:46,737
between different territorial scales levels

302
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:51,192
that correspond to a variety of actors and systems of organizations

303
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:55,544
and territorial production processes just as different.

304
00:17:56,261 --> 00:18:00,271
The adherence of this level of transport is its ability to hold

305
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:02,767
the processes at work in the territory

306
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:06,358
and integrate the demands and plans of the various actors.

307
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:11,020
It is also its ability to adhere to different territorial levels

308
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,325
and integrate into the overall process the processed that involve each scale.

309
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:19,925
This adherence of organizational processes

310
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:22,822
and territorial actors is not only concerned

311
00:18:22,822 --> 00:18:25,617
by the duration of the project until its completion.

312
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:27,065
The city changes.

313
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,894
It is constantly changing.

314
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:32,425
Its games of actors and production dynamics are

315
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:35,427
in perpetual motion and reconfiguration.

316
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:39,268
The transport system should allow new projects

317
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:42,220
to new players or new needs

318
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,859
to graft to its own dynamics.

319
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:48,450
Adhesion should not stop with the ending of works.

320
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,331
It must continue and allow the modification of a line,

321
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,550
its deviation, its extension

322
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,280
or the increase in its capacity accordingly to the needs.

323
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,006
It must also allow other actors to, for example,

324
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,476
create additional intermodal nodes

325
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,670
new centers and new developments.

326
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:10,335
As we have seen in this video,

327
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:14,153
the notion of adherence seems to help us reconcile

328
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,075
a thought about the city and its urban forms

329
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:20,464
with a thought on transport and mobility.

330
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:25,406
In the next video, I suggest to come back to this notion of adherence

331
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:29,723
exploring its analytical potential on the one hand and its potential

332
00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:34,994
as a tool for urban project on the other hand through a concrete case.
