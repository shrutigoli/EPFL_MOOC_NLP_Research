Hello
Thank you for accompanying us for the seventh module of the course
Mobility planning
Today we propose to reflect on what links the organization of movement in the city and the hardware manufacturing of tissues and public spaces
We will try to show how the coordination structure of the territory by the networks and the production of built-up densities and land uses represent a collective action issue.
To understand what is at stake, we offer resorting to theatrical metaphor.
As in the theater, in fact, urban production stages actors, it obeys different scenarios that take place in a setting and in specific performance conditions.
The course plan will build on this metaphor.
We will first present the plot and describe the roles played by the main categories of actors
We will then describe some articulation scenarios of mobility scenarios highlighting the issues associated with it
Finally, we will discuss two paradoxes that distract players from the common goals they might have in the plot that binds them: the paradox of the specialization of space and that of its fragmentation
The plot of the drama consists of two major components: the structuring of the territory by networks and the construction of the built fabric and urban public spaces
These are two complementary dynamics but also partially competing and which do not mobilize the same systems of actors
The first structure the manufacturing of the city from viaires infrastructure
The prospect is that in a second time, building lots will come to connect this structure.
The second dynamic is centered on the production of these areas to build
In order to enhance the habitat for economic activities, for business or for community service
Understandably, if there is no road, the urban fabric will not have a structure but the materialization of accommodating rail route isn't sufficient either to make the city
The plot of the drama thus consists of the organization of the relationship between these two logics
We use generic terms but let us remember the term road is applicable to a wide variety of objects: roads, highways, streets, boulevards, country roads, railways
Each of these objects has a specific technology and let us remind us too that the technology associated with the production of infrastructures is intimately linked to that of the movement of vehicles
A transmission line in this perspective, it is an association between the technology of a physical layout and that of a range of mobile objects
The structuring of the territory by road networks is generally provided by operators called "first level"
They part lines in the area to connect origins and destinations
At the nodes of the networks they trace and at more or less regular intervals on these lines, they shall adjust a series of gates that open the network on the territory or to other networks
To these doors are often associated service areas for maintenance or for the storage of moving vehicles.
Then come the second level operators
These are economic actors and public operators that rely on the first level of infrastructure to connect it to housing, factories, schools, shops, administrations educational and cultural facilities etc.
They produce tissues and density built around nodes, along the lines or within the mesh of the network
Finally, there is the third level of operators
It's you, it's me, all urban households using the facilities of the two categories of previous actors to create their own network territory
They contribute to the co-production of the system by uses and the consumptions they make in
The first level of operators usually have for service project to develop an isotropic space, ie providing total accessibility to all and for all
The implementation of this service project has three major dimensions:
First action on physical structures, ie production and hardware maintenance of lines, nodes and doors
Then the organizational dimension regarding modes of limitation of use of lines and nodes: signage, the action on the temporality of uses
And finally, the dimension of governance and service management which includes the issue of coordination between operators
In the contemporary city, this means the need to organize the multi-speed network cohabitation
The networks that cross our cities correspond indeed to technologies, metrics, speed tolerances and often very different management and safety requirements
Regulating the coexistence of these speeds is a major problematic of urban planning of networks
Second-level operators rely on road networks to connect production and service networks including the urban economy needs
Their action has a decisive effect on the intensity of trade in the city, and the system of centralities
They do not choose their location at random, but accordingly to accessibility offers produced by the first-level actors; dependingly also on the attractiveness of the sites, felt needs and land opportunities
Land use by activities is accompanied by property developments that generate both built-up densities and an offer on public spaces
Each activity generates flow: flows of people, flows of goods entering or leaving the institution that houses it: it is the staff, the suppliers or different types of public to receive, or raw materials, equipment or work products
Each stream corresponds to usage pf transmission means
Their representation determines what is called "the mobility profile of an activity"
The change in land use for different activities naturally leads to a diversification of mobility profiles
It can generate new demand for mobility vis-Ã -vis operators on first level and may force them to review their accessibility offers
Nothing is fixed once and for all
Let us return to the question of the location of public facilities by the second-level actors
Since these facilities are open to the public, criterion important of location is the right distance to the population covered by the service offered
If we observe what happens in dense cities listed in a polycentric territorial structure, we see that the townspeople willing to travel four to ten kilometers to reach metropolitan facilities such as a stadium, a cathedral, a city hotel or a great place for a show or concert
They agree to do two to six kilometers to go to a multi-sport infrastructure or library
Knowing that for a multisport center in full operation, requires a population of 25 000 to 40 000 inhabitants which is perhaps not always the case in small towns in question
A work program is necessary in each case that requires a critical reflection device adapted to the specific context
At this stage we can nevertheless retain a thing: interdependence between the location of public facilities and the shape of the large territory in which they operate
We will discuss this issue in more detail in the next course
Today, facilities like hospitals, stadiums, shopping centers, activity areas are demanding undivided areas of large size and usually they do not find in the dense city available and capable lands to meet their needs
They depart therefore to settle outside of the city
First, they connect on open roads of average speed in periphery and they contribute to both the urban sprawl and the transformation of its internal system of centrality
They also impose often, a one-way transformation and impose on the landscape metrics of self-mobility
In a second scenario, they try to connect to the device of high speed motor located away from the city: the highway or a bypass defining a second or a third peripheral ring
In a third scenario, they settled in the fields
Instead of connecting directly to an existing road network they force the viaire or rail network to extend to them
Whatever the scenario, the equipment polarizes space but it helps at the same time at its fragmentation
And all major facilities follow the same strategy: they rarely seek to form the tissue or public space that would connect them to other equipment
They want to remain customized, visible and spaced in a landscape governed by self-mobility and market laws
This dynamic often generates carriers places of urbanity
If we return to the area of â€‹â€‹roads, the same phenomenon of fragmentation is observed
The issue of sharing of the public space between the flow puts in pressure two antagonistic approaches: on one side is a logical specialization that gives each flow a technology line specifically governed by the laws of hydraulic engineering and giving place in a depersonalized space controlled by a public operator
This refers to the right through a multitude of marking and signals which often destroys the very idea of â€‹â€‹public space
And on the other hand, we have what we call "a logic of place" based on culture and how interpersonal urbanity are occurring in space
Behaviors comply here with the general rules of civility or politeness and it is through interpersonal eye contact that are granted priorities
The logic of place requires the multifunctionality of public space while the logic of the specialization is to postulate a separation of flows for the effective management
All we have seen shows how to establish the interaction system between traffic networks governed by the first-level actors and economic networks governed by those of the second level
Let us not forget that other networks contribute to the structuring of the territory
Let us remember that basically any territorial matrix depends closely on the morphology of river systems that structured reliefs and valleys in history and with which trafficking networks must always dial
Moreover, the mobility in the city is not just about humans but also the fauna and flora
Green networks ensure biodiversity and ecological continuities and are also important structural levers of space as an ecosystem.
The spatial organization is the product of the joint work of these four layers of networks
The key issue of governance of an integrated territorial system consists in cooperation situation of different cultures that led to the writing of lines, dots and mesh materializing the different layers
After this brief overview, we note two points:
Planning network involves three types of operators none of which has the power to ensure alone efficient flow management, production densities and quality of public spaces
This is definitely a coproduction
Secondly, the installation of new lines triggers both a systemic process of destructuring and space restructuring.
Speed â€‹â€‹plays a key role in this process
We live in territories of multiple speeds but let us remember that every journey always begins and ends by foot
This is the pedestrian metric that should set the research quality of public space and the  organization of space intermodal devices
In this lesson, we described the system dynamics of articulation at the local level and with particular emphasis on the issue of the articulation between the tier-one operators and two level
In the next lesson, we will return in more detail on the contribution of networks to structure the territory
Thank you for your attention and good luck
