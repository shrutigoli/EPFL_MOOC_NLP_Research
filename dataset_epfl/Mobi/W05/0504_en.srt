00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:14,714
Can enlarging highways allow to remove the traffic jams?

2
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:17,045
This is Vincent Kaufmann EPFL that answers us

3
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:19,434
for the energy-environment platform today.

4
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:21,914
Take a highway connecting two cities

5
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:25,184
randomly the one linking Lausanne and Geneva, in Switzerland,

6
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:27,752
two tracks on each side, and over the years

7
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:29,184
the population has increased

8
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,601
the car has been democratized, the highway was clogged.

9
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:36,767
Building a third way could actually improve traffic flow.

10
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:38,381
It's simple physics

11
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:40,753
but not necessarily in the long run.

12
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:44,050
Various experiments have been conducted worldwide.

13
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:45,258
Take London.

14
00:00:45,418 --> 00:00:48,049
The N25, called the "London Orbital",

15
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:51,542
is a highway which is practically all around the British capital.

16
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:57,295
This new track was built between 1975 and 1986 to improve traffic flow.

17
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:01,393
Three years after the end of its construction it was already clogged.

18
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:04,409
Adding other channels did not help.

19
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:05,390
But why ?

20
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:07,941
First is the "pull factor" effect.

21
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,396
Whenever new channels are built

22
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:13,878
new drivers, no longer taking the highway to move

23
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:15,151
because of traffic jams

24
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:17,700
thought they could take it again.

25
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:19,495
So there are more cars.

26
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:22,717
Then there is what is called "Zahavi's conjecture".

27
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,956
It's a theory that when a means of transport allows to go faster

28
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:29,224
we tend to use it to go further

29
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:31,879
rather than spending less time traveling.

30
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:34,896
This means that new infrastructures

31
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:38,127
simply allow people to go live further,

32
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:39,691
to live by example in the Jura

33
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:42,629
and work no longer in NeuchÃ¢tel but in Freiburg.

34
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:46,151
Not to mention that today people are willing to spend more time

35
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:47,632
in transport than before.

36
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:51,785
In Switzerland 20 years ago people traveled an average of 70 minutes a day

37
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:54,420
today it is 85. So what now?

38
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,310
We understood, larger highways does not reduce the traffic jams

39
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:01,725
but alternatives exist, that they please, or not.

40
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:03,763
Charge entrance into cities,

41
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:06,803
and thus affect the wallets of road users

42
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:11,141
or reduce speed on motorways to make it both more fluid

43
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:12,586
and less attractive.

44
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,190
My grandmother said:

45
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,043
"If you want to blow the traffic jams, wait for the new year my dear!"
