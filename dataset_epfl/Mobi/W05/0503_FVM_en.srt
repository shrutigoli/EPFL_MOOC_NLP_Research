3
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:20,493
Moving forward.

4
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:23,320
The car has become

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,049
the dominant mode of transport in the twentieth century,

6
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:27,763
in contemporary societies.

7
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:31,830
And in fact the development of the car was accompanied by a series

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,749
of adverse effects such as congestion,

9
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:36,449
space consumption,

10
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:40,713
pollution problems and in general environment problem.

11
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:42,097
And so,

12
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:44,647
because of these negative elements,

13
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,115
appeared

14
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:47,695
very rapidly in fact,

15
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:51,807
the obligation, the need to master the use of the automobile.

16
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:54,984
And evidently to control these automotive uses,

17
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:58,684
it is important to know how users

18
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,141
will make their choice

19
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:01,909
on travel mode.

20
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:05,168
So it's a little the matter I wish to address today.

21
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:08,325
It is to try to think about how people

22
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:11,048
can appropriate other modes of travel

23
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:12,437
than the private car.

24
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:15,936
So these other modes of travel I have called: altermobilities.

25
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:17,210
In these altermobilities,

26
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:19,997
I especially worked on

27
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:22,682
public transport, cycling and car pooling

28
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:26,108
with sometimes combinations between these different modes,

29
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:28,133
for example people who will use

30
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:31,174
the bike to go to a station and then the train

31
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,964
to go to their workplace

32
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,844
and thinking about

33
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,393
these modes of appropriation of altermobilities was conducted

34
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:41,407
on the home-work trip.

35
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:44,116
So data which has been used

36
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:45,700
to produce these results,

37
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:48,558
these are qualitative survey data by interviews.

38
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:51,708
So these are interviews with the life story method

39
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,349
which was made in France,

40
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,650
so I made around fifty interviews,

41
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:59,787
with an altermobilistic population on the home-travel trip.

42
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:03,096
Why using this method of life stories?

43
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:06,029
Because it allowed people to tell

44
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:07,293
their life,

45
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,954
and the various modes of travel

46
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,631
they had used during their life.

47
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,580
And it allows reconstruction

48
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:16,248
the time of permanence, of change,

49
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:18,230
and the elements that influenced

50
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:21,792
the various changes in travel patterns during the life.

51
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:31,612
Compared to these lifecycle elements, there are

52
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,105
two great structuring periods

53
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:37,214
we can identify in the life course.

54
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:39,032
So this is, firstly,

55
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:40,319
the youth phase.

56
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,052
So the youth phase is: childhood, adolescence,

57
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:47,258
and then the period when eventually we studie or not

58
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:48,281
but anyway,

59
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:50,957
this period where things are not yet fully

60
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:52,774
structured in the lives of individuals.

61
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:54,795
And this phase of youth

62
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:56,481
is characterized by

63
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:58,083
experiments,

64
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,430
and trials and errors,

65
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,304
and therefore we find these experiments

66
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:03,202
in the uses of travel modes.

67
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:05,342
So it will be, for example, a period

68
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:07,058
when we will experiment

69
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:08,569
the train,

70
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:11,004
different uses of public transport

71
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:12,581
when we will practice hitchhiking,

72
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:15,072
when we will eventually borrow cars

73
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,604
and use them more,

74
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:18,975
when we will be free bicycles, etc.

75
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:21,051
This is a bit the system of resourcefulness,

76
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:24,376
it is also linked to youth economic constraints

77
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,473
which have not either necessarily

78
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,087
money to buy a vehicle and move with it.

79
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,219
And so we have like that

80
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:34,398
a period which may be called a modal trial and error period.

81
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,481
At the time

82
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:46,303
of what sociologists call the passage from the entrance into adulthood,

83
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:49,343
we will have, in fact, a sort of

84
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:50,815
stabilization

85
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,135
in uses

86
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:53,711
of modes of travel.

87
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,314
So this time of entry into adulthood

88
00:03:56,314 --> 00:03:58,206
is characterized, in any case,

89
00:03:58,206 --> 00:03:59,918
by stabilization,

90
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:02,325
which is both professional

91
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:04,073
that is to say it will be the moment

92
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:06,724
when one finishes his studies and whene one will find a job

93
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:08,999
and then it is also characterized

94
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,020
by stabilization of marriage and family perspective.

95
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:15,996
And we find this idea of ​​stabilization

96
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:18,498
also, in the uses of travel modes

97
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:21,769
with crystallization of these uses

98
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,395
which will be in two main modalities.

99
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:34,642
So the first is from my point of view,

100
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:36,750
the most obvious,

101
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,751
it will be for the car

102
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,268
that is to say that from the moment

103
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:42,702
people will have

104
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,517
obtained their driving license,

105
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,010
then will have

106
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,497
gained their first vehicle,

107
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:52,450
it really will be a complete surrender

108
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:55,352
of all modes of travel that were previously used

109
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:58,594
in favor of the exclusive use of the car.

110
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:00,547
It is finally,

111
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:03,656
the first method of stabilization of uses

112
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:05,653
at the time of entry into adulthood.

113
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:08,876
Obviously this stabilization for the car,

114
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:12,244
it is particularly visible in the generations

115
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:14,415
who have become adults

116
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:17,450
in the 60, 70, 80.

117
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:26,772
And then there is another modality

118
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:31,317
that will be more in favor of altermobilties

119
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:33,516
therefore uses that will turn

120
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,440
completely towards altermobilistic uses

121
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,930
upon entering adulthood.

122
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,620
I must say that when I made this empirical investigation,

123
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,264
I did not expect at all to find this result!

124
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:45,962
In fact, we see that there are people

125
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:47,070
who,

126
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,291
when their professional and domestic stabilization

127
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,062
will adopt alternative modes

128
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,640
whether public transport,

129
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:57,938
cycling or carpooling.

130
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,143
How can we explain that?

131
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:02,780
So there are several elements which come into play

132
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,186
obviously, it's related to residential territory

133
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:06,261
in particular

134
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,229
when these people live

135
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:10,325
in areas

136
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:12,205
that are urban

137
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,003
and dense,

138
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,927
also

139
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:17,724
of belonging effects

140
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:19,090
to social groups.

141
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,708
We see it very well, for example,

142
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,568
among bicycle users

143
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:25,305
which are often invested

144
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:26,836
in associations

145
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:29,372
or in some alternative groups and citizens

146
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:32,310
in which cycling is highly valued

147
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,903
So suddenly, they will engage in these practices.

148
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:39,648
And it is also linked to learning effects,

149
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:43,650
So these learning effects, it will be an example

150
00:06:43,908 --> 00:06:46,246
a strong example of that field,

151
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:50,574
this was a person who came from a large family,

152
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:53,472
whose parents did not have a driving license,

153
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:56,411
and was the first in his family to pass the driving license,

154
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:59,834
and so she really learned to drive on this collective mode

155
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,141
since it was she who was left

156
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:03,092
in the first line

157
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:04,739
to be able to accompany

158
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,281
the family,

159
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:07,881
to go shopping,

160
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:09,641
to move,

161
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:12,625
and therefore for her, in fact, the use of the car was

162
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,590
necessarily linked to a collective use

163
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,584
she then, in fact, perpetuated throughout his life.

164
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:28,425
And so we will now look into these processes of change

165
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,762
which are relatively complex processes,

166
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:34,826
that I analyzed on the home-work trip.

167
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,406
So they are relatively complex because they involve

168
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:41,716
three element types.

169
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:44,649
First it will be provisions.

170
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:49,569
That is to say, a state of mind which places them in the disposion

171
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,258
to change their mode of travel.

172
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,303
Then there will be

173
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:55,973
the importance of a biographical context

174
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,802
that is favorable to change.

175
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:01,231
And finally, the third type of elements, it will be the triggers.

176
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,556
So I will take each of these elements.

177
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,866
First of all the provisions.

178
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:14,331
They are of different orders, these provisions.

179
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,909
there will be negative provisions

180
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,147
with respect to the car.

181
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:21,259
So it's going to be people who are tired of using the car

182
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,965
who face daily

183
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:26,258
congestion problems, parking difficulties,

184
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:28,659
possibly accidents on the road, etc.

185
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:30,362
And, suddenly,

186
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,912
it will place them in a negative provision vis-à-vis of the car

187
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:38,193
and who will say : I wish I could move otherwise!

188
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:40,988
Then we will have provisions which are positive

189
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:43,105
in respect of other modes of travel.

190
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,666
We find it particularly in promoting cycling

191
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:48,606
where it'll be, for example, people who say:

192
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:50,473
me, in my daily schedule

193
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:52,475
between my work and my family

194
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:54,887
I am unable to find time for sports

195
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:55,607
and

196
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:58,998
I would like to use this travel time I

197
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:00,876
mandatory have to go to work

198
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:03,042
to use the bike, and suddenly,

199
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,361
it would also be a way to practice a sport.

200
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:09,269
There is a third type of provision,

201
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:11,022
which falls more,

202
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:15,005
of a form of reflective analysis that people have on

203
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:16,666
their travel purposes,

204
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,846
and which will be linked to the consideration

205
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:21,232
of issues and values

206
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:22,879
environmental and ecological

207
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,630
that is to say that these people are thinking that

208
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,680
the use their car every day, is not very good for the environment,

209
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,375
is not very good for the planet,

210
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:33,995
and they say that ideally, they would love to do otherwise.

211
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,441
Then you should know that

212
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,778
these changes,

213
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,572
they work systematically,

214
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:48,737
in biographical contexts that are favorable to change,

215
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,407
that is to say, it will already be a biographical context

216
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,134
where there are

217
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:55,705
kinds of breaks.

218
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,246
These ruptures can be very different from each other,

219
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:01,810
and which suddenly

220
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:03,384
will

221
00:10:04,548 --> 00:10:05,456
allow

222
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:08,485
a transformation of habits and routines,

223
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:11,436
it can be very strong biographical breaks such as

224
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,642
the spouse's death,

225
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:16,237
that will completely reconfigure, of course,

226
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:19,364
the person's daily organization.

227
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:23,217
It may also be disruptions linked

228
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:25,338
to steps in lifestyle

229
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:27,230
for example, the arrival of a child,

230
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:28,552
a couple formation,

231
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:30,708
a separation,

232
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,072
children leaving the family home, etc.

233
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,834
And,

234
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:36,256
we also have events,

235
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:38,987
much more

236
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:40,227
simple

237
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:43,384
such as a move or a job change

238
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:45,442
that will, again, reorganize, of course,

239
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:49,587
the organization of the home-work trip.

240
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:59,918
And for that, really, to happen,

241
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:02,555
a change as such.

242
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:06,002
there must be triggers of that change.

243
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:08,117
So these triggers

244
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,118
they are,

245
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:10,879
here also very different in nature.

246
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,744
The first of them is what I called:

247
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:15,589
the sudden or unexpected hardship.

248
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,599
Which means

249
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:22,043
people will find themselves

250
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:25,386
dealing with a broken leg that prevents them from driving

251
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:28,214
facing an immobilized vehicle because

252
00:11:28,214 --> 00:11:30,629
it is down, it was rough, etc.

253
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:35,178
So, they will be forced to find an alternative

254
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:37,600
to get to their workplace.

255
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:40,394
And so these alternatives, it will be, for example,

256
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,355
to find a colleague who can carpool us

257
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,235
or to use public transport,

258
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:47,963
but the idea is that really

259
00:11:47,963 --> 00:11:50,570
compared to this sudden and unexpected constraint

260
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,693
we must reconfigure, we have to find another solution.

261
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,136
The second type of triggers,

262
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:58,979
that's what I called: commitment.

263
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,662
So here it is rather on the alter-Mobilist profiles

264
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:03,820
who will be activists

265
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:06,472
that is to say it's going to be people who

266
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:10,121
go through this mode change of movements

267
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:13,086
in alignment to their thinking

268
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,767
and the way they do,

269
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,668
that is to say it's going to be people

270
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,057
for whom

271
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:20,437
ecological and citizens values are very important

272
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:24,454
and therefore they feel obliged to change their travel patterns

273
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,957
to bring them into line with their values.

274
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:29,742
And the third type of triggers,

275
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,272
it will be: the opportunity.

276
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:34,027
The opportunity is the idea

277
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:36,483
that these people will change their modes of travel

278
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:38,653
because they will "meet"

279
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,959
an alternative to the car on their home-work trip.

280
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:44,848
I deliberately use the term "meet"

281
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:45,887
because

282
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:49,098
a part of these triggers

283
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,169
opportinistic

284
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:53,084
will be a meeting with a car-pooler, for example,

285
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,190
it will be the meeting with

286
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,472
a public transport alternative,

287
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:59,405
For example, following the establishment

288
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,002
of a new transport infrastructure

289
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:02,823
or a new transport service.

290
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:07,623
And so the meeting with this new possibility

291
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:11,045
will trigger the change of modes of travel.

292
00:13:11,336 --> 00:13:13,874
What to say about this item, also,

293
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:15,440
of opportunity,

294
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:16,521
is that

295
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,909
it really is the pattern we find

296
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:21,508
in changes of travel modes

297
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:22,352
taking place

298
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:25,356
following the establishment of mobility plan in enterprises

299
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:27,821
where there really is a communication effort also

300
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:30,029
on the various alternatives

301
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:31,863
and suddenly, people

302
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:37,086
will find available

303
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:40,647
a correct alternative

304
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:43,200
to their need to travel to get to work.

305
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:51,780
The question we might ask

306
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,737
once we understood how was the change happening

307
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:57,386
particularly when bound to a sudden and unexpected stress,

308
00:13:57,478 --> 00:14:00,364
that is to say why people will continue?

309
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,336
Because, once

310
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:04,231
a broken leg is repaired,

311
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,784
once I have recovered my vehicle

312
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,877
which was being repaired,

313
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:11,431
I'll take my car, as before,

314
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:12,359
and that's it !

315
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,836
I would have put aside alter mobility

316
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:16,994
which did not for last very long

317
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,146
and in fact it goes not quite like that,

318
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:22,600
at least not in the people I met,

319
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,617
they were alter mobilists on the long term,

320
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:30,965
and the sustainability of altermobiles practices

321
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,876
is played on several elements.

322
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:42,220
The first of them,

323
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,677
is that the people using these alternative

324
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:50,330
will realize that the journey time

325
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:52,100
gives them something

326
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,397
they had not

327
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:54,790
when they were traveling by car.

328
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:56,395
That is to say that they felt there

329
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,040
that they were wasting their time when they were driving

330
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,785
they will, however, have the feel of a time

331
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:04,256
gained, a time that is additional

332
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,971
in their journey to work

333
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:10,000
whether it is elsewhere in the use of car pooling

334
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,009
public transport and cycling.

335
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:16,307
So it'll be a time that they are going to use

336
00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:17,598
to relax

337
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,201
to discuss with others

338
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,141
to meet other people

339
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,581
for reading, etc.

340
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:28,557
If one is interested, in particular, in car-pooling,

341
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:30,859
be aware that this element is fundamental here,

342
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:32,427
it is that very often

343
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:35,632
before car-pooling, people tell us:

344
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:38,787
"For me, one of the attractive elements of carpooling,

345
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:41,277
is the fact of sharing my trips costs "

346
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,858
and when questioned people who practice car pooling,

347
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,710
this element here, it is almost forgotten

348
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:49,814
the benefit of usability

349
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,738
that is played while driving

350
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:53,924
which are shared with other people;

351
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:56,784
and it's really on this convivial element

352
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,869
that is sustained the use of carpooling.

353
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,266
The second element,

354
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:09,604
which is important

355
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:11,048
to understand how

356
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:13,354
these practices there can last over time,

357
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:16,505
it is the question of their legitimacy.

358
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:18,817
The idea, in fact, is that

359
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:21,392
we need to legitimize necessarily

360
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:24,234
things that we daily make

361
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,844
and especially when they are new practices,

362
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:30,085
then these alter mobility practices

363
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:33,761
they are globally legitimized by the fact

364
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:36,518
that they refer to ecological values

365
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:39,515
which are widely shared among the population,

366
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:40,992
but sometimes,

367
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:42,522
there is also the need to find

368
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:45,703
other instances of legitimation, that is to say, other people

369
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:46,548
other places,

370
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,486
other spaces in which we will legitimize these practices

371
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,409
particularly for the use of bicycles,

372
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:56,153
because there are still ten years from now,

373
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,321
cycling suffered from a relatively poor image

374
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:01,459
in the population,

375
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,743
wholesale cycling was a mode of transport for the poor

376
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:08,155
or the Greens a little crazy

377
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:10,814
and so people who used the bike

378
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:12,925
really needed to feel

379
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:16,284
they were not at the margins of society

380
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:19,745
but really to legitimize this practice.

381
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,773
To that end they will address associations

382
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:23,913
of cyclists

383
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,690
in which they will be able to share their experiences

384
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,625
and thus legitimize their practices.

385
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,441
And then the last element

386
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:39,954
playing on the sustainability of these uses,

387
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:42,788
is of course the creation of habits and routines,

388
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:44,604
because the more you practice something

389
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,570
and the more we become expert in this practice,

390
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,792
we know the operation,

391
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:49,840
we know how it works,

392
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,131
we no longer need to ask thousands of questions,

393
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:54,700
and suddenly it becomes easier

394
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,224
and you no longer want, either, to find

395
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:01,229
the energy to start to change in favor of something else.

396
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,269
Taking

397
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,998
a little height in relation to these changes

398
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:14,421
in displacement modes,

399
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,017
there are still

400
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:17,421
two issues that remain,

401
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:20,886
ultimately what is of other trip purposes?

402
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:23,472
Because the journey to work is not

403
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:25,214
all the trips that are made.

404
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,822
So when we look, there is a great diversity

405
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:31,356
also in

406
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,803
these alter mobilities uses

407
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:36,425
for other trip purposes than work,

408
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:38,607
and this is true, in particular,

409
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:41,127
when people have a subscription

410
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:42,791
to public transport

411
00:18:44,346 --> 00:18:48,188
which is also valid for travel in the weekend.

412
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,989
The second question is ...

413
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:59,733
it is the question of the object "car", as such.

414
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:03,637
Finally, I no longer use it on the home-work trip ?

415
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:06,145
Do I still need to keep it or not?

416
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:08,192
And here too there is an element

417
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:11,329
which is very interesting and surprising,

418
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:14,668
it is that most of these alter Mobilists I met

419
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:16,278
keep their vehicle

420
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:20,543
because it is a kind of safety net for them,

421
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,267
which means

422
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:26,156
retaining their vehicle, which is available

423
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:28,931
they are always in the mood to say:

424
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:31,625
if I use something other than my car,

425
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:33,396
it's because I made the choice

426
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:34,359
to use it

427
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,522
this is by no means because I am captive

428
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:38,862
of these other modes of travel

429
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,267
and therefore in case ...

430
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:42,823
I always have my car available

431
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:46,535
and therefore somehow the fact to keep a vehicle

432
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:47,854
is also involved

433
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,069
in the longevity, in time,

434
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:52,036
of these new travel practices.

435
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,337
So in conclusion we can say

436
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:56,392
that there is no binary opposition between the alter mobility

437
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:57,827
and self-mobility,

438
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:00,472
but that alter mobility is really an enlargement

439
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:02,977
of the field of possibilities regarding the use of movement,

440
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:05,031
and there really is a complementarity

441
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:08,534
between these different uses in everyday life.
