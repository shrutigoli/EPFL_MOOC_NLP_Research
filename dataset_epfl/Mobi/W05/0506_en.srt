1
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:08,067
An ordinary morning on the highway.

2
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:12,775
A large, high, overwhelming majority of the seats are empty.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,658
A car, a person. A car, a person.

4
00:00:18,658 --> 00:00:19,977
A car, a person.

5
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:21,973
Is this reasonable?

6
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:31,410
The issue of public transport, is major.

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,757
We know that to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases,

8
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:36,978
We must act on transport, we must act on habitat

9
00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:38,361
and then on industries.

10
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:40,968
In transport, there is a range of possible measures,

11
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:43,135
including the use of public transport

12
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:46,118
or better use of existing vehicles.

13
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:50,561
So it has several small scratches, so that, is a car that lives.

14
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:54,492
Rental of vehicles between individuals, one can imagine Mr. X,

15
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:56,605
who has a car. He said that

16
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,042
he does not use it so often, and then he would

17
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:00,615
the return on it a little better.

18
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:04,450
So he goes to rent it, for example on an internet platform

19
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,392
from other users.

20
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:09,696
And generally, against remuneration.

21
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,893
In fact, we are a family. We live in downtown

22
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:14,648
and it was realized that we had everything we needed

23
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:17,393
in public transit. Therefore, using a little the car

24
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:20,865
for shopping big or for the weekend, for some travel,

25
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:23,718
but we almost decided not to buy another

26
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:28,650
once she is out of service. We said so make it a benefit

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,789
to others around us.

28
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:34,966
Day to day, having a car is not necessary,

29
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:36,686
at least for me. It costs a little expensive.

30
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,534
To park it, it is a complicated etc.

31
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:42,408
So I know that for many people, it is also a social status,

32
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:43,886
something like that, but for me,

33
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,852
it really is a means of transportation.

34
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:53,443
Car pooling enters the collective private transports.

35
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:57,600
Here, we are in the case where a vehicle which has an owner is filled

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,053
by several people. So with carpooling,

37
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,038
one manages to increas the density of occupants per vehicle.

38
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:06,522
There must be common schedules with people going

39
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:08,645
about the same place.

40
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:16,600
Okay, so this is where there is the key to the car.

41
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:21,006
Take the example of car sharing in particular.

42
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:25,701
One can imagine some households buying a whole vehicle.

43
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:29,533
It means that these people have mobility needs in relation to the vehicle

44
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:33,040
relatively light, because if everyone uses it every day,

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,565
it's impossible.

46
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:37,552
There, in fact, they will use this vehicle at defined times,

47
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:39,063
they will work out among themselves.

48
00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:41,283
Of course the costs will be divided

49
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:43,696
between the number of families and the number of households.

50
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:48,200
If we thought about all the objects we use an hour a week

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,035
or one hour a month, we can say that these objects,

52
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:53,450
could be pooled. So this is the example

53
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,805
of the mower, for example.

54
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:56,737
One might lend it between neighbors.

55
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:59,055
We could set this up for many things,

56
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:02,148
against payment or against the exchange of another service

57
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,468
or other property.

58
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:06,746
And that is growing tremendously and I think this is one of the forms

59
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:10,572
of the assets in the future, which will grow more and more.
