<I> (journalist) Do you have traffic jams every morning? </ I>

153
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,670
Oh yes, then ... (laughs)

154
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,630
<I> (journalist) - Is it bearable </ i> - No.

155
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,560
Oh my God it's a disaster!

156
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,340
<I> (journalist) - How do you bear ? </ i> - Badlyl. I get very nervous at night.

157
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,250
<I> (narrator) Faced with this onslaught of cars, </ i>

158
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,010
<I> the city is on the verge of suffocation. </ I>

159
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,930
<I> And one begins to regret the virtues of good old tram. </ I>

160
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,560
♪ <i> The tram 12 arrived  ... </ i> ♪

161
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,700
After being deleted, Geneva begins in the late 80s

162
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,740
to recreat tram lines.

163
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,730
<I> (narrator) And yes! In 1987 the rails reappear. </ I>

164
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,590
<I> And often on the same routes as the old lines. </ I>

165
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,760
We put the rails where they had been removed some years before.

166
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,110
So the error that was of tajing them off, putting them is repairing the error.

167
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,060
<I> (narrator) Between 1995 and today, eleven new lines </ i>

168
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,460
<I> emerged in the township, and there are projects until 2020. </ I>

169
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,490
<I> Attitudes have so changed, the population of the city as well. </ I>

170
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,740
<I> In the district of St. John, we are in the Gonzenbach family. </ I>

(Sound of cutlery)

<I> Every morning, Lila, 10, goes alone to school, </ i>

173
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,200
<I> as a big girl, by foot. The building is two steps away. </ I>

174
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,520
<I> As for Victor, his little brother 7 years old, his mom accompanies him, </ i>

175
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,240
<I> before going herself to work by bike or bus. </ I>

176
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,430
<I> (man) It really is a choice of lifestyle. </ I>

177
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,120
<I> We chose to live in the city to not be dependent </ i>

178
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,410
<I> of a single car, </ i>

179
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,460
contrary to the possibility of living in the countryside away from it all

180
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,010
where we would have needed to have, if not one car, maybe two

181
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,310
or a motorcycle or scooter, a dependency we did not want.

182
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,580
<I> (narrator) Martin works in Lausanne. </ I>

183
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,980
<I> he has his little folding bike to go down to the station. </ I>

184
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,490
<I> A bike he will take with him on the train. </ I>

185
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,840
<I> Because obviously, Martin has the General rail pass. </ I>

186
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,310
<I> (Martin) We never owned our own car, </ i>

187
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,330
we are members of a cooperative of carsharing, Mobility,

188
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,180
allowing us to have a car when we need it, where we need it,

189
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,530
with the choice of vehicle if required too.

190
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,510
<I> (narrator) Fleet car sharing as Mobility, carpooling, </ i>

191
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,870
<I> trips from booking via mobile phone, </ i>

192
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,400
<I> all these systems have the wind in their sails. </ I>

193
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,650
<I> Not really need to have one's own car. </ I>

194
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,180
<I> (Martin) We are in a trend where the dream of the car </ i>

195
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,130
<I> as social prestige object is history. </ I>

196
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,500
Somewhere it is a freedom not to have one.

197
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,380
To not have worries, the financial burden, the moral burden

198
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,150
and bulk to be oneself a car owner.

199
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,760
<I> To me it was obvious that in the city center </ i>

200
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,640
<I> everyone comes here, we are no longer pioneers. </ I>

201
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,430
<I> (narrator) Admittedly, at first glance, traffic seems chaotic in Geneva. </ I>

202
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,110
<I> Still, a small silent revolution is on. </ I>

203
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,880
<I> Today, over 40% of the inhabitants of downtown Geneva </ i>

204
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,140
<I> simply have no more individual car. </ I>

205
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,140
<I> Half of young people between 18 and 25 years do not have a driver license, </ i>

206
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,140
<I> and even if it is not seen with the naked eye, in the city center, </ i>

207
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,140
<I> the number of cars fell by nearly 20% since 2000. </ I>
