00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:05,969
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:12,507
In this video, we will discuss the reasons that are causing

3
00:00:12,507 --> 00:00:16,507
the choice of means of transport in daily life.

4
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:22,029
This video will introduce the theoretical aspects,

5
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:28,999
it will be supplemented by another video given by my colleague Sebastian Monafo

6
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:32,289
who will then present an example.

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,660
Many research work is conducted on the choice

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,660
of means of transport in daily life.

9
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:45,961
This work shows three important things.

10
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:49,007
The first of these things is that unlike

11
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,127
to what one might think,

12
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:55,957
the springs from the use of different means of transport

13
00:00:55,957 --> 00:01:01,497
are not confined to the comparison of travel time and prices.

14
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:06,314
In many cases, we are faced with more complex logics.

15
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:11,032
The second important thing that say such research,

16
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:15,032
is that the provisions in respect of the use

17
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:20,782
of different means of transport are very diverse in the population.

18
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:26,728
There are very different reasons to use a means of transport

19
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,728
over another or a combination of means of transport.

20
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:35,857
The third important thing that emerges from the literature,

21
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:39,857
from scientific work on the choice of means of transport,

22
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:43,667
is that the provisions in respect of the use

23
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:47,237
of different means of transport are segmented.

24
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:52,875
It means we can identify groups of people

25
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:57,865
who base their choice on different reasons.

26
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,250
If now we go look at that in a bit more detail,

27
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,880
we can say that there are three logics of action

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,200
which are causing different modal choices,

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,050
from a theoretical point of view.

30
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:18,481
I propose now that we wane them

31
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:20,211
one after the other.

32
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:26,687
The first of these three logics of action is what might be called,

33
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:29,547
with Max Weber, the instrumental action.

34
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:34,463
Applied to the field of modal choice,

35
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:38,793
it consists in comparing available alternatives

36
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:41,403
of the various means of transport

37
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:46,863
and choose either the fastest option,

38
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:52,313
or the least expensive option, or a combination of these two parameters.

39
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:59,302
So the idea here is that the choice is based on an individual interest

40
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:05,022
based on minimizing the cost and minimizing the travel time.

41
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,519
You're looking at the table coming from a research

42
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,279
covering six cities: Bern, Besançon, Geneva, Grenoble,

43
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,859
Lausanne and Toulouse and which aimed in particular

44
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:24,319
to try to see how users are rational

45
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,499
depending on the comparison of travel times

46
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:31,379
when using different modes of transport.

47
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:35,499
You see very clearly when looking at this line

48
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:37,269
regarding the automotive,

49
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:41,949
that when the car is faster to go to work

50
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:45,949
than public transport, well, it is used.

51
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:49,307
For example, in 70% of cases.

52
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,620
This is what you see here.

53
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,070
While public transport is faster,

54
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,120
still regarding the case of Bern,

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,020
you see that the car is only used in 17% of cases.

56
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:05,121
You see also, still in this table,

57
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:08,171
that in the other five cities studied,

58
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:12,751
that is to say, Besançon, Geneva, Grenoble, Toulouse and Lausanne,

59
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:17,741
there is also a relationship between the compared time

60
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:21,741
and the means of transport chosen to work.

61
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:26,678
But you see that this relationship is not exactly the same as in Berne.

62
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:31,125
When the car is faster to go to work,

63
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:37,005
it is still used by 52% of respondents in these agglomerations

64
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:40,515
and when the car is faster, it is actually used

65
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:42,505
in 84% of cases.

66
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,135
What basically shows these results

67
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:54,325
is that users are rational in terms of travel time

68
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:57,635
but that rational approach based on the travel time

69
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:01,635
it is not enough to understand modal choices

70
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,455
and obviously there are other variables acting.

71
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:09,635
I want in particular as proof that in this table

72
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:15,575
in particular, there are 52% of people who use the car

73
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:17,965
while public transport is faster

74
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:19,595
to go to work.

75
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:25,194
And even 71% of the population is using the car

76
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:27,824
to go to work while the travel time

77
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:32,414
for work are comparable in a 10 minute interval

78
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:36,034
between public transport and car.

79
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:42,234
The reason of the heart, which is the second logical action,

80
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:46,234
still drawing on the work of Max Weber,

81
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:51,944
is to use, or to turn to means of transport

82
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:55,944
according to their preferences, but independently

83
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:59,944
of the comparative effectiveness or comparative prices

84
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,874
of these means of transport.

85
00:06:02,522 --> 00:06:06,522
There you have under the eyes, in two columns,

86
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:11,312
a body of adjectives cited by people who were interviewed

87
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:14,502
as part of the research which resulted also

88
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:18,502
in the Table I introduced you in the previous <i> slide </ i>.

89
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:23,558
And in fact, these adjectives show that in the background

90
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:26,448
the automobile is preferred to public transport,

91
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:30,158
in this studied population,

92
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:37,098
and can be identified through the words cited

93
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:40,568
and which show a connotation, or provision

94
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:44,568
of use of more or less favorable transportation.

95
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,580
If we have in the head the image of an automobile

96
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,100
that is fast, comfortable and makes us autonomous,

97
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,550
do we not have already a little made our choice,

98
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,550
there is a preference to collective transport

99
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,900
that is perceived as slow, as binding

100
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,900
in terms of lines and schedules and as promoting promiscuity

101
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,320
because you have to travel with others.

102
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:12,023
So that's the idea of ​​this second logical action,

103
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:13,453
the reason of the heart.

104
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:18,116
The third action logic is that of habits.

105
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:22,836
If we take the vocabulary of Max Weber,

106
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:26,836
he also speaks of traditional rationality.

107
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,270
So the idea that finally always doing the same thing,

108
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:38,380
or having habits or routines, is also a way of being,

109
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,820
a way of acting.

110
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:45,568
Seen in transport habits, and much research shows,

111
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,878
that modal choices,

112
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:50,568
therefore the use of different means of transport,

113
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:54,228
also respond and sometimes in an extremely massive way

114
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:55,988
to a logic of habit.

115
00:07:56,237 --> 00:08:00,237
This is particularly the case for a number of motorists

116
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:05,507
who just do not plan to use other means of transport.

117
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:10,195
I just briefly introduced the three logics of action

118
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:12,705
underlying modal choices.

119
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:17,847
To account for the segmentation of the three logics of action

120
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:23,007
in the population, we conducted a typology.

121
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:26,636
And this typology allows to identify

122
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:31,806
eight specific provisions on the use of means of transport.

123
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:36,801
This typology is based on three dimensions.

124
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,939
First the size of the patterns that differentiate individuals

125
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,089
using several means of transport

126
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,109
of those who do use only one.

127
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:55,208
Secondly, this typology is based on a dimension

128
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:59,208
of values ​​that differentiates people who have a vision

129
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,378
of means of transport and transport supply

130
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:05,748
first accordingly to their individual interest,

131
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:10,458
for example the comparison of prices and travel times,

132
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:15,138
or rather people who qualify transport supply

133
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,938
based on a common interest,

134
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:20,388
such as their ecological footprint.

135
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:25,807
Finally, the typology is based on a third dimension,

136
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:30,167
which is the dimension of attitudes that distinguishes respondents

137
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:35,797
according to their preferences of use or their attitude towards

138
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:38,587
different means of transport.

139
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:44,651
Typology, as I just said, allows to identify

140
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:48,651
eight population groups, eight groups that correspond

141
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:53,731
eight customary provisions in respect of different means of transport.

142
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:58,985
Then firstly there are three groups that are characterized

143
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:02,595
by a strong anchor of habits

144
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:08,235
and by the use of only one transport system.

145
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:13,211
These three types have exclusive motorists convinced

146
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,911
that is to say, people that in their daily lives

147
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:21,781
only use the car to move daily

148
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:25,781
and have a very bad image of all other means of transport.

149
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,079
There secondly are the open exclusive motorists

150
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,599
that is to say people who only use the car to move

151
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,259
in their daily lives

152
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:43,859
but do not specifically look badly

153
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:47,859
at alternatives that are possible, such as public transport

154
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:48,959
or cycling.

155
00:10:49,469 --> 00:10:54,599
There is finally the third type that is based on the use

156
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,609
of only certain means of transport,

157
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:02,519
this third type are the exclusive alternative modes,

158
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,009
that is, people who do not use the car at all

159
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:11,699
as a driver, but use in their daily life

160
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:15,699
public transport, cycling or go on foot.

161
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:22,186
Among the eight customary conditions highlighted,

162
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:28,816
there are two others in which the comparison or preferences

163
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,676
are dominant.

164
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:34,582
Multimodal comparators,

165
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:39,062
is a group of people who are highly sensitive

166
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:42,442
to the prices of different options to move

167
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:46,052
but also in comparison of travel times.

168
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:51,069
So these are people who initially have an instrumental logic

169
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:52,829
in their modal choices.

170
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:58,299
A group was also identified, called civic environmentalists,

171
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:03,329
where the logic of the heart is dominant,

172
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,869
that is to say they are people who have convictions,

173
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:10,689
namely respect for the environment,

174
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:15,609
and are trying in their practice of everyday mobility

175
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:19,899
to get as close as possible to this ideal

176
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:25,169
which is to try not to use means of transport

177
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,749
that would be too polluting.

178
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:29,069
So you see the first five types,

179
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:31,159
the first three that I presented to you,

180
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,719
we see that there is a dominant of habits.

181
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:38,227
Here, with these two types, there is first a dominant

182
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:42,227
of the instrumental logic for multimodal comparators

183
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:46,027
and then a dominant of the reason of the heart or of values

184
00:12:46,027 --> 00:12:48,607
for the civic environmentalists.

185
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:54,358
The last three types that refer to three other provisions

186
00:12:54,358 --> 00:13:01,118
of use of different means of transport are characterized by the fact

187
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:05,118
that in any of the types people can not do exactly

188
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,718
what they would like.

189
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:10,813
In fact, in these three types, there is a constraint

190
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:13,313
which is that we use transport means

191
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:16,073
that we do not necessarily want to use.

192
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:20,063
The first of these types, named motorists

193
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:24,543
"forced" to use public transport,

194
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:29,883
these are people who prefer to use the car in their daily lives

195
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:32,003
but for some of their trips

196
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,383
are forced to use public transports,

197
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:37,723
or feel they are forced to use public transport,

198
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:40,933
because there is a constraint on the use of the car.

199
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:45,113
This constraint is generally the traffic conditions,

200
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:47,723
traffic jams in particular

201
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:51,723
or conditions of parking.

202
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:57,409
Second type of constraint that we could identify with this type

203
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:01,409
so-called susceptible to alternative modes.

204
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:06,952
These are people who prefer to use in their daily lives

205
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,272
other means of transport that the car

206
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:13,272
but for some trips are still obliged

207
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:16,152
to use the car,

208
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:19,042
because in particular there are no offers

209
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:24,942
or easy opportunities to go cycling or go by public transport

210
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,932
for some of their trips.

211
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:31,289
And last of these types a bit forced,

212
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:35,569
the people we qualified as anchored in proximity,

213
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,939
who are people who do not like to use

214
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,159
motorized or mechanized transport.

215
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:47,089
It is often people who are afraid to use these means of transport.

216
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,839
This is often an elderly population or people

217
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,439
who have experienced trauma in the use of means of transport

218
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:02,559
be it an accident or an event such as an assault

219
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,219
which means that eventually they fear.

220
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:08,669
But eventually these people too, those anchored in the vicinity,

221
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:12,669
they try to limit the use of motorized transport

222
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:16,669
but there are still obliged to a number

223
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,889
of their movements.

224
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:23,636
Here we come to the end of this video,

225
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,466
a somewhat theoretical video.

226
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:31,357
And I just wanted to come back maybe to a point that seems essential to me.

227
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:36,157
What I wanted to show you through this video,

228
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:40,307
is that ultimately the choice of one or more conveyances

229
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,517
in daily life,

230
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:46,517
cannot be reduced simply by looking for minimization

231
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:50,857
of travel time and/or minimization of cost.

232
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:55,637
The choice of means of transport are more complex.

233
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:59,356
They refer to provisions which are multiple,

234
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:03,356
which also refer to habits, preferences,

235
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:06,496
and it is essential to take it into account

236
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:10,496
if we want to influence the modal practices.
