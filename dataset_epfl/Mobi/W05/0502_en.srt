00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,329
Hello,

2
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:08,426
My name is Sébastien Munafö.

3
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:10,818
I am research assistant

4
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:14,578
in the laboratory of urban sociology at EPFL.

5
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:17,635
Today I'll talk about modal choice,

6
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:19,865
about the choice of means of transport in town,

7
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:22,019
and especially its evolution

8
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:25,403
an evolution which has been observed in the last two decades,

9
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:29,505
in three cities: Geneva, Lausanne and Bern

10
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:33,295
from a study we conducted in LaSUR

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,000
and that specifically addresses this issue.

12
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:40,205
Here is the layout of my presentation today.

13
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:45,031
Firstly to talk to you about the context and the objective of this study

14
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:48,293
then discuss the main results

15
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:50,613
of the investigation we conducted.

16
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:53,508
First, the image of transport.

17
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,843
Then the use, the frequency of use

18
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:58,583
of these same means of transport.

19
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,723
And from these first two elements,

20
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:04,828
the typology of users or of the logical modal choice

21
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:06,728
we could highlight.

22
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:09,095
Then in the third part,

23
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:12,271
I will talk about lessons that can be derived,

24
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:16,647
from this survey: operational lessons,

25
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:20,697
but also more macro-sociological teachings.

26
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:24,482
The contexts and objectives:

27
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:27,273
our study was to understand the modal choice.

28
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:29,502
Why ? Because today,

29
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:32,096
modal choice is a crucial issue in the city.

30
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:36,128
Today, the majority of urban policies,

31
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:38,503
the planning policies of the territory

32
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:42,953
in cities, aim to a modal shift from car

33
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:46,141
to public transport and sustainable mobility.

34
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,503
Why ? Because these transport means

35
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:52,673
are less generators of nuisance than the automobile.

36
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:57,677
Nuisances such as congestion, accidents, noise, etc.

37
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:00,680
To encourage modal shift,

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,424
to encourage citizens to use other means of transport than the car

39
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:10,296
suppose to understand how these townspeople think this modal choice

40
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,346
how they choose between a transport means and another.

41
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:18,882
As Koffman Vincent well reported in the previous course,

42
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:22,773
There are on modal choice a multiple of rationalities.

43
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:26,944
The modal choice is summed up a little or not at all,

44
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:32,844
to a desire to reduce travel time or costs of the trip.

45
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:36,430
These multiple rationalities must be taken into account.

46
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,070
These predispositions, reflexes, habits, anchors

47
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,760
in the lifestyles of different means of transport

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,599
we have at disposal.

49
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,999
The objective of this study was

50
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,791
to identify these multiple rationalities

51
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,310
according to two main bodies of results:

52
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:59,112
representations, the image of transport

53
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:03,506
and their use, the effective ownership by citizens.

54
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,787
Our study focused on three Swiss cities:

55
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:10,328
Geneva, Lausanne and Bern.

56
00:03:10,328 --> 00:03:14,150
agglommérations which have specific profiles

57
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,464
on planning policy

58
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:18,624
and transport policy.

59
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:21,523
Cities that were also discussed

60
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:26,669
in 1994, as part of the doctoral work of Vincent Koffman

61
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:32,491
which highlighted in these cities the multiplicity of rationalities

62
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:34,658
the various logics of modal choice

63
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:36,768
that I mentioned in the introduction.

64
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:41,188
The idea was to repeat with the same methodology,

65
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,455
the study in 2011 to understand

66
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:48,330
the logic in terms of changes in mode choice

67
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,170
and especially to try to identify the impacts, the attendances

68
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,500
of the great changes that took place between these two years,

69
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,717
including massive investments

70
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:03,268
that have been made in terms of public transport infrastructure,

71
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:05,768
but also in railway, Switzerland.

72
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,000
The study focused on a specific target in 1994 and in 2011.

73
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:16,811
It was question of urban people, people who live in cities

74
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:22,026
or in the nearby suburban crown, well served by public transport,

75
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:26,581
assets, people who have to travel every day or almost

76
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:27,875
to work.

77
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:32,205
And people in theoretical situation of modal choice.

78
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:35,907
I.e. people who have a car

79
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:40,091
in their household, but are well served

80
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:44,644
by their residential location, with efficient public transport.

81
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:49,859
This study was funded by various institutional partners

82
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:52,549
such as the Canton of Geneva or Vaud,

83
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:57,033
but also transport operators such as TPG in Geneva

84
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,814
or Lausanne public transport

85
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:00,024
in Lausanne.

86
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:03,964
Partners who were interested in understanding the logic of modal choice

87
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,301
in the cities of Geneva and Lausanne.

88
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,736
Why these cities are interesting?

89
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:13,689
Well, because they have specific paths

90
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:17,989
on policy of transport and territory planning.

91
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:21,454
Geneva is a city that has long been turned

92
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,764
to the car but had to, due to economic growth

93
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:30,709
and significant population growth, had to change of paradigm,

94
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,567
and had to end the all-car.

95
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,817
A paradigm shift has been reflected in

96
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:42,136
by political measures aimed at restricting

97
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:45,377
access to the center, including a policy

98
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:47,677
of more rigorous parking

99
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:51,917
but also by the infrastructure that reduced the ease

100
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,085
of city traffic.

101
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:58,454
In parallel, a public transport offer was redeployed

102
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:00,504
including the tram network.

103
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:03,696
Lausanne is a city a little different,

104
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,484
smaller, but which also experienced in those years,

105
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:09,274
a strong economic and population growth,

106
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:11,744
growth that has been synonymous

107
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:15,462
of a transport demand even more important

108
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,632
that Lausanne has faced.

109
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:19,772
To cope with this demand,

110
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:24,419
Lausanne has invested notably in a major offer in

111
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,464
public transport, the metro M2, an automatic metro

112
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,408
that you see here in the picture.

113
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:34,148
A massive investment was commissioned in 2008,

114
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:36,234
and therefore, it was very interesting

115
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:40,534
to see if this very important investment had consequences

116
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:44,474
on the composition of the demand for modal choice.

117
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:48,071
Finally, Bern, the third city studied,

118
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:50,755
was already considered, in the 90s,

119
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:52,086
as an example,

120
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:56,203
an example in coordinating transport and urban planning,

121
00:06:56,203 --> 00:07:02,003
a city that already recorded at the time of the first study, in 1994,

122
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,020
very important modal shares

123
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,647
for public transport, soft mobility,

124
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:09,527
ie walking and cycling.

125
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:11,768
So it was particularly interesting

126
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:13,841
to see how these three cities

127
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:16,791
have evolved over the 17 years,

128
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:20,787
and see if the two French cities, Geneva and Lausanne,

129
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:23,137
had in 2011, in a way,

130
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:25,277
caught the Bernese model.

131
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,160
Now for the main results of the investigation.

132
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:32,731
As I mentioned in the introduction,

133
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:37,342
a cornerstone to understanding the mode choice

134
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,484
notes some predispositions,

135
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:44,834
representations of individuals confronted with different means of transport.

136
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,597
To identify these representations,

137
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:51,397
well, we invited respondents

138
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:54,058
to name three spontaneous adjectives

139
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:58,218
to qualify the car, public transport and cycling.

140
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:03,958
By bringing together key adjectives given in large aggregated categories,

141
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:06,512
positive, negative or neutral,

142
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:08,768
we get this picture.

143
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:12,569
Here you have the picture of the car

144
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,254
in the three cities and during the two years of investigation.

145
00:08:18,072 --> 00:08:22,282
Here we have the picture regarding the car.

146
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:24,212
As we see,

147
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:27,815
the image among respondents is overwhelmingly positive.

148
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,242
This is not a surprise

149
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,764
since these are people surveyed

150
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:36,493
who have a car at disposaé, and have therefore made an investment

151
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:37,743
in this direction.

152
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,494
What is interesting,

153
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:44,544
is that the image between the two survey components

154
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:47,242
has significantly deteriorated

155
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:49,282
in both cities studied.

156
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:52,725
thus going from a positive side 80%

157
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:56,965
in 94 in Geneva, to a coastline of 71%.

158
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:02,612
In Lausanne, the coast of 85% goes to 76%.

159
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,551
In Berne, the overall positive picture

160
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:12,751
in 94 remains roughly similar in 2011.

161
00:09:13,305 --> 00:09:16,235
So a picture, finally, quite positive.

162
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:20,429
If this image has deteriorated in Geneva and Lausanne is particularly

163
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:25,205
due to congestion issues, circulation difficulties,

164
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:28,053
but also an ecological awareness

165
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,363
related to pollutants aspects of the car.

166
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,354
This means that even people

167
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:36,604
that have this means of transport available, are aware

168
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,461
of a certain harmful appearance

169
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:42,281
for the community of this means of transport.

170
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:47,349
Here are the results of the image for public transport.

171
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,609
We note out of hand

172
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:52,879
that this image is largely negative

173
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:55,636
among respondents in the three cities.

174
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,454
But the trend observed between the two surveys is reversed,

175
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:01,864
ie that there is a jump

176
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:07,614
to the positive side, which saves a great leap from 39 to 52%,

177
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:12,255
in Geneva, but a more dramatic jump in Lausanne

178
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:16,425
passing from 30 to 61% on the  positive side.

179
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:22,387
One item that already reflected in attitudes of great influence,

180
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:27,678
the great impact of investments that have been made and which were

181
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:30,618
translated by the automatic metro commissioning

182
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:33,343
that I spoke of to you just now.

183
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:37,222
In Berne, an image that was already very positive in 94

184
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:40,797
you see that it is more positive than in Geneva in 2011,

185
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:45,427
Well, this picture has continued to improve since motorists

186
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:49,814
of his agglomeration quoted adjectives

187
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:53,572
that are, for 77% of them, positive.

188
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,719
Third result regarding the image of transport:

189
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,856
that concerning cycling.

190
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:02,374
Cycling, unfortunately,

191
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:04,280
has not been investigated in 1994

192
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,890
but it seemed interesting to do in 2011.

193
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:11,681
That's why you only have here the graph of the situation in 2011.

194
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,848
This element teaches still an interesting element,

195
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:20,731
in so far as the image of the bicycle, in the three agglomerations,

196
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:25,531
among city dwellers, in theoretical situation of modal choice is very positive,

197
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:31,386
with a slightly negative image in Lausanne, mainly because,

198
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:33,976
topographically, a city that is very steep

199
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:37,220
and where making use of this means of transport

200
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,610
is more difficult.

201
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:42,603
An element, therefore, shows that in general,

202
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:45,115
on all the images we just discussed,

203
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:46,985
until now, public transport,

204
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,696
car or bike,

205
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:53,746
finally, in 2011, even if you have a car available,

206
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:57,338
one  is generally open to using other modes,

207
00:11:57,707 --> 00:12:01,957
and this is already a very interesting result of the survey.

208
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,223
Second set of results:

209
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:06,786
the use of means of transport.

210
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:08,866
In addition to image issues

211
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,836
we were interested in whether these urban people

212
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,950
finally had a frenquency of use of these means of transport

213
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,800
which had evolved.

214
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:22,337
Here you have the graph regarding the frequency of use

215
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:24,798
of the car as a driver in the three cities

216
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:26,558
and for the two surveys.

217
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:32,024
It is noted that this type of transportation is still very widely used,

218
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:35,495
This is not a surprise, insofar as all people

219
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:38,605
we interviewed have a car available.

220
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,272
We also find that the frequency of use

221
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:44,682
has still very clearly evolved.

222
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:49,479
A use which reduces very clearly, for example,

223
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:54,589
in Geneva, which goes from 60% to 38% of daily use.

224
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:58,658
In Lausanne, the share of 70%

225
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,780
of daily users goes to 53%.

226
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:08,133
In Berne, the trend is the same, 45 to 34%.

227
00:13:09,464 --> 00:13:11,245
What does that mean ?

228
00:13:11,245 --> 00:13:14,832
Well, it means that we have not abandoned the car

229
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:18,482
but we reconsidered its frequency of use

230
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:21,764
during the period between the two surveys.

231
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:24,203
So we have, for some journeys,

232
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,513
city ​​dwellers who use other means of transport.

233
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:30,749
Here you have the same graph

234
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:32,715
for public transport.

235
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:35,029
The public transport usage frequency

236
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:38,209
has clearly increased between the two surveys.

237
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,183
The daily use frequency,

238
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:45,933
as you see, goes from 15%, in 94, in Geneva, to 29%.

239
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,919
Said unit from 16 to 27 in Lausanne.

240
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:57,835
And the part that was already very high in Bern, 33% goes to 39%.

241
00:13:58,501 --> 00:13:59,676
On another side,

242
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:02,045
what we observe is that public transport

243
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:04,065
entered the habits of these citizens,

244
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,011
it is especially seen through the share of these urban people

245
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:11,131
who say they never use public transport.

246
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,349
It is only 9% in 2011, in Geneva.

247
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:18,298
It is 10% in Lausanne

248
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:22,281
and it is only 3% in Bern.

249
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:24,889
What about the bike?

250
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:29,459
Well, here we see the image of the bicycle use frequency

251
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,782
in the three cities, only in 2011

252
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:36,042
because, unfortunately, this question was not asked in 94.

253
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:40,151
We observe that the bicycle is a means of transport

254
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:42,672
widely used by these city dwellers

255
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:44,891
in theoretical situation modal choice

256
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:46,538
that we interviewed.

257
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:48,565
14% of them say

258
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:50,745
using the bike every day, almost.

259
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,845
This share reached 26% in Bern.

260
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,070
In Lausanne, it is less, it was mentioned, in particular because of

261
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,143
the topography of the city.

262
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:03,501
So we finally have townsmen

263
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,852
that not only are open to using

264
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:07,553
different means of transportation,

265
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:09,472
but use them very clearly,

266
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:11,752
whose use has become customary.

267
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:15,444
From indications concerning the image

268
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:17,808
and those related to the use,

269
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:20,298
so we highlighted

270
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:22,992
this typology of logics of modal choice,

271
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:25,812
or this type of users.

272
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:28,643
This typology has been presented to you

273
00:15:28,643 --> 00:15:31,283
during the previous course by Vincent Koffman.

274
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,974
Here we have six types which are:

275
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:40,357
Exclusive motorists that group in the case of this study

276
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,567
exclusive motorists open and confident,

277
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:46,131
in the typology presented by Vincent;

278
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:49,476
motorists forced to use other modes;

279
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,909
those predisposed to alternative modes;

280
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,394
civic environmentalists;

281
00:15:55,712 --> 00:15:57,227
multimodal people

282
00:15:57,227 --> 00:16:00,637
and finally, individuals anchored in the vicinity.

283
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:05,583
What image gives this typology, in 94 and in 2011?

284
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,383
What improvements can be observed in this area?

285
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:11,886
When we apply this typology

286
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:13,391
of two branches of investigation,

287
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:15,021
we get this picture.

288
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:19,857
We see very clearly that in the three cities of study,

289
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:21,937
there are convergent logics,

290
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:26,808
including a clear decrease in the share of

291
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:29,215
proprietary drivers,

292
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,490
which rose from 21% to Geneva in 94, to 9%.

293
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:39,835
They go from 20, Lausanne, to 10, in 2011.

294
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:42,448
This share is extremely low in Bern,

295
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:46,738
of 3% in 2011.

296
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:50,818
Faced with this clear decrease of exclusive logic,

297
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:56,001
related to the daily use, unique, of the automotive,

298
00:16:56,223 --> 00:17:00,711
in parallel, a significant growth has been observed

299
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:02,992
of predisposed alternatives.

300
00:17:02,992 --> 00:17:07,242
It goes from 4 to 11% in Geneva

301
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:11,862
from 4 to 9% in Lausanne

302
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:15,932
and from 3 to 10% in Bern.

303
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:22,041
Above all there is a very significant growth of multimodal.

304
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:27,922
A relatively reduced growth in Geneva, from 29 to 32%,

305
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:33,782
but very consistent in Lausanne from 22 to 42%.

306
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:40,337
In Berne, the jump is spectacular because goes from 40 to 59%.

307
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,602
In 2011, therefore, we in Berne have a majority of the sample

308
00:17:46,602 --> 00:17:48,753
that falls within this multimodal logic,

309
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:50,182
open to all modes,

310
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:53,342
a category that juggles between different means of transport.

311
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:56,262
Finally, these three cities,

312
00:17:56,262 --> 00:17:57,865
in our different results,

313
00:17:57,865 --> 00:17:59,685
have specific profiles,

314
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:04,331
in Geneva, the largest decrease was finally registered

315
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:06,721
about the frequency of use of the car.

316
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:11,222
It is in this city where the modal shift was the most net

317
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:13,652
and most visible in the field.

318
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:16,818
In parallel, the use of public transport is observed

319
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:19,311
which is relatively constrained.

320
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:22,511
The share of forced motorists is consistent.

321
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,778
So we have people who use public transport,

322
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:28,018
but this is not necessarily the project.

323
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,900
In Lausanne, the picture is different,

324
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,572
we have a spectacular image gain,

325
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,417
caused notably by renewing the offer of public transports

326
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,827
translated by setting the M2 metro service.

327
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,216
But this very important image gain

328
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:45,614
was not completely reflected in use, frequency of use

329
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:48,674
of the car, where finally, the car is used

330
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,884
in Geneva or Berne.

331
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,144
And in Bern, yet another profile

332
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:58,764
where the virtuous circle already in place in the 90s, continued

333
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,927
to take effect, with today

334
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:04,409
an excellent picture of all means of transport

335
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,745
and public transport usage frequency and soft modes

336
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:09,592
quite considerable.

337
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:15,061
In the end, a logic of multimodal modal choice that dominates among urban people

338
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:16,721
of this agglomeration.

339
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:21,674
From these three cities and their trajectory,

340
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,384
we can emphasize three fairly caricatured models

341
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:28,104
but interesting in terms of modal shifts.

342
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:32,997
We first observe a Geneva model which ultimately

343
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,354
from the cross-reading of our results,

344
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:39,934
we understand that the most powerful element

345
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:41,359
for modal shift

346
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,688
remains the gridlock

347
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:47,768
and constraints that exist in terms of traffic.

348
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,791
It is primarily because motorists

349
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:56,031
have a hard life, face a number of obstacles

350
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,791
that there was a large modal shift.

351
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:03,582
Of course, this modal shift has been possible thanks to the extension

352
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,351
and the provision

353
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,498
of an interesting alternative offer,

354
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,488
including trams in Geneva.

355
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:12,519
In Lausanne, we have another model.

356
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:16,147
A model where seduction and image

357
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,020
of means of transport played an important role,

358
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,970
promoted, stimulated, the modal shift,

359
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:24,908
with precisely the great image gain

360
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:26,908
caused by M2.

361
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:29,677
Finally, in Bern, we have a model

362
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:33,478
where consistency is the key word,

363
00:20:33,478 --> 00:20:35,390
where this consistency over time,

364
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,981
but also in the space,

365
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:40,841
acts as the main lever at work, in terms of modal shift.

366
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:43,487
Finally, at the operational level

367
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:45,803
we understand, through these three models,

368
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,260
that there is a recipe

369
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,653
which finally combines these three elements

370
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:52,233
to encourage modal shift in town.

371
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:57,937
A recipe that involves playing on the efficiency of the automotive system

372
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,077
with ultimately an efficiency that must be seen to the downside,

373
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:06,517
in some way, or in any case which should not be improved.

374
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:10,132
In response, an attractive offer,

375
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:13,279
Attractive alternative offer, attractive,

376
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,968
which makes gain users

377
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:18,988
by a more positive representation

378
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:21,848
of predispositions, more open on the subject.

379
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:26,727
Finally, a model that has to focus on a coherence in time,

380
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,347
be pursued in time

381
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:29,490
as well as in space,

382
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,820
ie, that must involve the entire metropolitan area,

383
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,420
as is the case in Bern.

384
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:39,746
Finally, what are the main sociological teachings

385
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:42,256
that can be learned from this study?

386
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:46,277
First, I think it should be emphasized that, behind these results is hiding

387
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:49,267
the emergence of new lifestyles.

388
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:52,865
lifestyles among urban motorized assets

389
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,638
that is the target of our study

390
00:21:54,638 --> 00:21:58,593
which is largely focused on multimodality.

391
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:00,624
One is not exclusive to a single mode,

392
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:02,715
but juggles between these modes

393
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:05,006
according to one's constraints, timetable,

394
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:08,956
constraints at the destination, constraints at the origin, etc.

395
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,546
Lifestyles among urban people

396
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:13,660
using different means of transportation,

397
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,850
which are translating changes in values ​​and attitudes

398
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,757
that we have been able to demonstrate,

399
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:20,547
through the questions of images.

400
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,729
Representations have changed, attitudes have changed,

401
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:26,725
we took into account the harmful sides

402
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:30,205
of the car and we upgraded the public transport and soft modes

403
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:31,892
as a means of transport

404
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,631
attractive in a city.

405
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:35,648
In the emergence of these lifestyles

406
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:38,288
and the observed change in mentality,

407
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:43,513
policy measures were essential and quite decisive.

408
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:48,079
It's because we implemented a policy aimed at reducing

409
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,027
the place of the car in the city

410
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:53,229
and in parallel, increasing the attractiveness

411
00:22:53,229 --> 00:22:57,489
of alternative accessibility, soft modes and public transport.

412
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:01,546
It is through and by implementing this recipe

413
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,879
that we could get a real modal shift.

414
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:09,289
We ultimately could direct demand towards means of transport

415
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,390
less harmful to the community

416
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,700
and for the city.

417
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:15,094
Finally, these elements give

418
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,774
an optimistic note about the possibility

419
00:23:17,774 --> 00:23:19,554
to act on mobility.

420
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:22,914
Demand changes: we can direct this request.

421
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:24,412
This is what we observed

422
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:26,742
in the three cities studied.

423
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:28,549
This request is malleable

424
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:32,013
and therefore, by implementing policy measures,

425
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:34,053
courageous investments

426
00:23:34,054 --> 00:23:35,223
in some areas,

427
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:37,142
well, we can act on this mobility

428
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:39,702
and direct it to behaviors

429
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:43,040
which are synonymous with a better quality of life in cities.
