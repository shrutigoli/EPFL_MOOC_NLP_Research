00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,777
What is the "turn of mobility"?

3
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:24,404
As part of my academic activities,

4
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:27,234
I am often required to travel to attend conferences

5
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:33,750
and exciting seminars, give lectures, visit exhibitions,

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,015
forge collaborations, and even co-writing books

7
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:41,479
on topics such as mobile life.

8
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:51,221
However, these practices do not make me a special case, and for a good reason:

9
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:54,940
it seems that the whole world is moving.

10
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,488
Young retirees, students exchange programs, terrorists,

11
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:02,958
diasporas, vacationers, business men and women,

12
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:06,726
top athletes, asylum seekers, refugees ...

13
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:11,906
All these groups, and many others, seem to be everywhere at home

14
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,238
by choice or necessity.

15
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:18,318
Travelling the globe has become the modus operandi of these groups of individuals,

16
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:23,106
very numerous, intersecting on occasion in transport hubs

17
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:25,093
and communications, time to question

18
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:28,242
electronic databases in search of their next car,

19
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:33,915
post, air, truck, texting, train, bus, coach,

20
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:37,182
car, website, etc.

21
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:41,917
The trip, a modern phenomenon .

22
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:46,665
The scale of the phenomenon is considerable.

23
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:52,515
Each year, one billion travelers cross borders legally,

24
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:55,303
against 25 million in 1950.

25
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,748
Four million people fly every day.

26
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:04,531
At any time of day or night, 300 000 to 400 000 people

27
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:11,102
overfly US territory, the equivalent of a city aboard.

28
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:17,026
Each year, refugees and citizens of the modern world travel

29
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:19,057
23 billion kilometers.

30
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:22,717
At this rate and with fewer physical restrictions,

31
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:29,997
this figure is expected to more than quadruple in forty years to reach

32
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:35,102
106 billion by 2050.

33
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:38,377
If people do not necessarily spend more time traveling,

34
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:40,177
they move rather more quickly.

35
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:46,043
On average, the time spent in transport is about

36
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:53,216
constant in the world: about an hour a day.

37
00:02:53,216 --> 00:03:03,032
At first, people do not move more often but use

38
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:07,287
more efficient transport means, which allow them to travel

39
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,547
greater distances.

40
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:15,907
Transport and tourism is the first industry in the world,

41
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:20,621
both in terms of the employed population

42
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:25,588
and regarding the global wealth produced.

43
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:33,768
This dynamic fast movement seem to be generalized

44
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:40,171
as shown by the statistics available on no less than 200 countries.

45
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:47,137
In addition, large flows of inbound and outbound travelers is observed.

46
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:51,822
The world, "department store" of modern times

47
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:56,455
The view of the German writer and researcher Wolfgang Schivelbusch

48
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:58,560
is interesting.

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,065
He notes that "for the 20th century traveler, the world has become

50
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:08,249
a huge store of cities and countryside ", leaving aside

51
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:12,747
of course considerable differences between different groups of individuals,

52
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:16,697
which have not always free or regular access to the offer

53
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:17,811
of this department store.

54
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:23,648
This mobility chosen, mostly at least,

55
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:27,347
is the peaceful form of cross-border movement

56
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:29,157
the largest in history.

57
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:36,464
Beyond significant hiatus, this trend had

58
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:41,324
not until recently waned significantly.

59
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:44,554
Around the world, physical mobility

60
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:47,408
has become a "way of life" for the rich and for some

61
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:50,024
amongst the poorest.

62
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:56,660
Now, who says movement of people also says

63
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,144
movement of goods transported often by

64
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:04,300
these same individuals moving, either in an open way,

65
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,041
accidental or illegal.

66
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,464
We should also mention international supply chains

67
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:11,519
of the manufacturing industry,

68
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,949
that rely on just-time deliveries

69
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,048
around the world.

70
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:24,390
These forms of convergence of mobility are transforming economic and social life

71
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,639
in many respects, that becomes in a sense "in motion"

72
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,382
or "eccentred from home."

73
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:35,400
In this mobile world, many are the interconnections, complex ones,

74
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,425
between physical movement and communication.

75
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,341
These connections are the source of new practices of fluidity

76
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:47,977
often difficult to identify and stabilize.

77
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:54,326
Some describe the interconnections "dematerializing" insofar

78
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:58,808
where humans, machines, pictures, information, power, money, ideas

79
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:02,320
and, in fact, risks, are "on the move" and create

80
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,224
and recreate new connections around the world,

81
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:07,044
often at breakneck speed

82
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:11,329
The rise of the "turning of mobility"

83
00:06:13,532 --> 00:06:18,327
The issue of moving, too rare for some,

84
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:25,087
insufficient or inappropriate or inconvenient for others

85
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:28,738
now registers at the heart of the existence of many

86
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:32,863
people and  organizations performance,

87
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:35,166
whether small or large, public, private

88
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:37,749
or non-governmental.

89
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:41,976
Now this problem related to mobility, has become

90
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:45,903
a central issue.

91
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:52,326
With this evolution, more and more authors invoke a new field,

92
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:56,582
the "turn of mobility", a reading and analyzing key

93
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:04,141
of these processes allowing to decipher the nature of economic relations,

94
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:06,395
social and political relations, in the contemporary world.

95
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,602
The idea of ​​the turning to mobility, which makes its way

96
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:14,004
in and by the social sciences, calls into question the analyzes

97
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:19,474
based on fixed concepts, static and "social structures"

98
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:21,884
mainly a-spatial.

99
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:26,844
This turn is under post-disciplinary

100
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:29,980
where it is beyond the scope of different disciplines

101
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:35,761
to address the multiple forms of economic, social and political life

102
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:40,694
and study how it is organized in time and through

103
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,048
many complex spaces.

104
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:46,757
The analysis of the complex ways in which social relations

105
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:50,935
are "stretching" across the globe generates theories, studies

106
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:55,937
and methods to "mobilize" or federate analysis

107
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:59,900
of the social order, which is in part accomplished by movement

108
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,701
and contingently.

109
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:08,534
Overall, the mobilities are black box figures for the social sciences,

110
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:13,562
which often reduce them to a set of neutral technologies,

111
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:18,174
of simple aids the economic, social and political life

112
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:22,961
which must be explained by more powerful determinants.

113
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:29,597
And when transport and communications are the subject of studies, they are often

114
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:34,521
considered in separate categories, low permeable to trade

115
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:36,588
with other spheres of social sciences.

116
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:40,317
Take a vacation, walk, drive a car, call:

117
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:44,521
as many activities that social sciences

118
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:47,718
simply ignored, although these daily facts

119
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:50,489
are clearly important.

120
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:56,429
And in fact, the life of every day, social institutions like

121
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:00,249
social practices presuppose complex patterns

122
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:04,273
of space-time travel.

123
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,009
Mobilities depending on systems

124
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:16,075
Without a "system", indispensable conditions of travel, there is no mobility.

125
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:22,850
With these systems, it is predicted that the trip will indeed take place,

126
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,121
that the message will be issued and the package delivered,

127
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:29,891
that family members will gather.

128
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:37,534
They allow to anticipate the repetition of movement, relatively risk-free.

129
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,268
Ticketing, supply of gasoline, addresses, security protocols,

130
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:44,481
websites, money transfer systems,

131
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:49,011
tours, etc., are all systems

132
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:53,211
that populate the modern world.

133
00:09:53,709 --> 00:10:01,428
Repetitive and guarantors of repetition, they give us the impression

134
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:07,894
it is natural to travel to find one's family or friends.

135
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,529
For individuals, the ability to move and move objects

136
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:20,328
depends on their access to relatively safe systems, regulated

137
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,776
and devoided of risks.

138
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:29,070
A number of systems have played a key role

139
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,177
and experienced an impressive growth in the 1840s,

140
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:40,989
era of the construction of the first railway in England.

141
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,482
These include, in 1841, the first "tour"

142
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:51,548
the first national postal service,

143
00:10:51,548 --> 00:10:56,088
the invention of photography in France and England,

144
00:10:56,088 --> 00:11:05,688
the construction of the first railway hotel, and the first crossing

145
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:09,027
of the Atlantic with a steamer:

146
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:13,166
many innovations that appeared in the space of one or two years.

147
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,785
In no time,

148
00:11:14,785 --> 00:11:18,453
an extraordinary series of mobility systems emerged.

149
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:23,330
And of course, the 20th century brought its new systems:

150
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:31,968
car, telephone, airplane, high-speed rail, electricity,

151
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:36,943
modern urban networks, mobile phones, etc.

152
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:41,610
The fragility of a system

153
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:46,960
The 21st century systems are distinguished by

154
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,008
a number of common characteristics:

155
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:54,808
gaining in complexity, they consist of many elements

156
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:59,620
and are based on know-how often sharp.

157
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:05,407
Their interdependence going crescendo, the organization of an individual trip

158
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,817
now requires the use of a whole

159
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:12,588
coherent and interconnected systems.

160
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:18,069
Furthermore, since about the 1970s, these systems are increasingly

161
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:25,108
dependent on IT and specialized software in particular.

162
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:29,968
Finally, and this is not without a problem, many of these systems,

163
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:34,248
because of the very fact of their interdependence, are exposed to what is customarily

164
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:38,687
called "normal accidents" that may occur

165
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:43,485
from time to time, given the close integration

166
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:47,422
of this set of systems.

167
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:55,017
So while lifestyles stand out, stand out

168
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:58,713
from each other, they are paradoxically

169
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:04,231
increasingly dependent on the operation of these systems.

170
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:11,039
Because of their dispersion in space, meeting others - parents,

171
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:19,299
friends or colleagues - involves a still greater coordination

172
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:26,189
and to navigate between these different systems.

173
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,419
Systems that need to be deployed, operated,

174
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:37,088
and on which we can rely to anticipate.

175
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:44,020
In a word, individualization and dependence towards relation systems

176
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,779
are two sides of the turn of mobility.
