00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:17,293
Mobility, between movement, meaning and practices

5
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,763
What is the purpose of research on mobility?

6
00:00:27,472 --> 00:00:32,703
The essential idea of ​​research on mobility goes far beyond

7
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:38,006
simply moving from A to B. And this is true of all travel modes:

8
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:42,265
whether it is a journey made on foot, car, plane, or train, you can,

9
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:45,569
in all cases, imagine a line drawn on a map

10
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:49,897
connecting a start point to a destination at the other end.

11
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:55,025
But research on mobility wonders what happens on this line, what

12
00:00:55,025 --> 00:01:01,178
gives it meaning, social significance, beyond being a measurable distance.

13
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:07,564
it can be thought of by analogy to the relationship between a place and, for example,

14
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:11,465
where we are now in Paris; we could give someone

15
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:15,664
geographic coordinates: latitude and longitude, defining a situation, a place.

16
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:18,477
Once we know that this is Paris, you also know

17
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:22,214
a lot of other things about it. You know this is the City of Light,

18
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:26,495
the city of love, that it is related to the
French Revolution and its history.

19
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:30,755
Thus, a geographic position, a single point on a map,

20
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:38,094
is enriched by a range of significant ideas in addition to this location,

21
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:41,433
this architecture and landscapes that make up Paris.

22
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:44,055
The same approach can be applied to travel.

23
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:47,290
If we imagine the movement as a line drawn on a map,

24
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,977
as well as a place corresponds to a point on the map, our role

25
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:57,195
is to discover what makes this more interesting than a simple trace;

26
00:01:57,195 --> 00:02:03,912
can we put it into meaningful relationship with mobility, travel,

27
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:05,820
exploration, commuting?

28
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,805
All these forms of movements can be mapped,

29
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:14,312
quantized, be put into statistics but are also full of history;

30
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:17,638
they enrich the meaning of the various practices which

31
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:22,256
they are used for and are policies of all kinds of ways.

32
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:26,989
They are part of the stories on favorable terms.

33
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:31,258
So I think that research on mobility concerns all

34
00:02:31,258 --> 00:02:35,646
these issues rather than simply moving from point A to point B,

35
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:37,694
and that's what interests me.

36
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,852
The three dimensions that make the richness of this line.

37
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:48,919
How the line becomes meaningful, socially important and interesting?

38
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,897
I will stop on three dimensions that make the richness of this line.

39
00:02:53,897 --> 00:03:06,071
There is, firstly the movement, then the meaning, and finally the practice.

40
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:10,651
How is this line active, how do we build,

41
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:13,646
how we will move there and make some experience?

42
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:16,236
I'll pass these aspects reviewed in turn.

43
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:20,491
First dimension: movement.

44
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:25,389
The first dimension of mobility is movement.

45
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:28,705
By movement, I mean simply to move in space,

46
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:31,284
to leave a place to meet in another.

47
00:03:31,284 --> 00:03:34,692
This movement may correspond to a single line between two points,

48
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:37,852
or a circle in the case of someone moving in circles,

49
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:40,312
or any other conceivable type of graph.

50
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:44,736
The important thing is that this is something we can map theoretically,

51
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:48,706
one can calculate the distance, the traveling speed,

52
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:53,636
and do all sorts of statistical analysis on it.

53
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:59,211
This is often how planners address mobility.

54
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:04,478
Some social scientists are interested in the statistical aspects,

55
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,997
and quantitative aspects of mobility.

56
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:11,432
This is often how the government plans mobility issues:

57
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:15,058
how and where people move, why do they move here rather than there,

58
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:18,148
how many follow this path and how fast do they move?

59
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:22,604
Second dimension: the meaning.

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,098
The second dimension of mobility is the meaning.

61
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:31,643
Meaning is an important question that do not always take

62
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:34,682
into good account the authorities and planners,

63
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,994
with their thinking more technocratic.

64
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:40,382
It is usually more treated by social scientists.

65
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:44,342
The question here is: what does this movement mean for persons

66
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:49,982
who perform it as for those who are
around them and think about it?

67
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:57,564
Take the example of walking: what is its meaning?

68
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,229
It's an interesting question.

69
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:02,626
Walking had a particular set of meanings for example

70
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:08,379
for romantic poets who, in the late seventeenth and during the nineteenth century,

71
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:12,510
considered  walking as the activity of the solitary walker,

72
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,278
usually a man. It could also represent a way of being in touch

73
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:19,707
with nature. Thus walking gained moral value.

74
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:23,604
Whereas before this time, for people walking was mostly synonymous

75
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:27,056
with chore, work, activity which we preferred escape from:

76
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:30,637
we walked because we were forced to go to a place we did not necessarily want

77
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:34,587
to get to, or that we could reach only with great difficulty.

78
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:36,905
Walking thus had two meanings.

79
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:40,991
Later, it kept on having different meanings for different people:

80
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,846
and walk in Paris, in the case of artists, may involve wanting

81
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:50,377
to disrupt the mode of organization of the city, to go places

82
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:54,377
which are not designed to be walked there.

83
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:57,307
The artists reflect on ways to free walking

84
00:05:57,307 --> 00:06:00,667
and to challenge the designs of the powerful.

85
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:04,744
Walking has started to take a range of meanings of revolt.

86
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:08,361
Walking is charged with different meanings depending on location:

87
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:12,518
walking in Paris on a sunny day is one thing.

88
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:16,872
To an inhabitant of Mali who must travel eight kilometers to reach

89
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:20,691
the first water point from his village, walking takes a whole new meaning.

90
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:25,321
All these meanings are embedded in travel,

91
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:28,684
and we encounter the ideological, narratives and stories aspects,

92
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:32,425
so many dimensions that make so we can not reduce mobility

93
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,725
to the simple move from point A to point B.

94
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:37,975
Finally, mobility can be thought on a larger scale,

95
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:39,905
like migration.

96
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:42,535
Immigration is still a very controversial subject,

97
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,435
and mobility is central to it.

98
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:47,926
You can draw lines on a map, you can draw paths,

99
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:50,724
naming elements, do statistical analysis,

100
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:54,242
but we all know that immigration is accompanied by a large number

101
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:57,129
of meanings and stories associated with it.

102
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:01,000
In the UK, where historically we have longly debated on immigration,

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,162
we talk about it with "overflow" or "flood" terms

104
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:08,823
innocuous words and innocent in appearance, but which are in fact metaphors

105
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:11,627
carrying along a whole set of assumptions on the places

106
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:14,423
where immigrants manage to survive.

107
00:07:14,423 --> 00:07:22,811
Meanwhile, activists who fight against racism and xenophobia

108
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:26,483
may argue that immigration "feeds" the country,

109
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:30,563
here we have the lexical field of nutrition, injects "new blood" making

110
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:34,503
society more dynamic, more interesting and more cosmopolitan.

111
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:37,088
It is a phenomenon that must be encouraged.

112
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,848
Again, the meaning is very important.

113
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:43,338
Third dimension: practice.

114
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:49,878
The third aspect of mobility to which I am interested is the practice,

115
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:52,665
in other words, our modes of travel.

116
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:58,909
Our experience of the movement. Sometimes the way we move

117
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:03,167
and live our movement coincides with the stories and meanings.

118
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,312
Thus walking can it be seen as an act of freedom

119
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:10,136
or as a hard labor.

120
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:16,444
Driving a car can be experienced as a time of individualism,

121
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:21,049
a private space, or as something that increases our sex appeal,

122
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:23,758
if you believe advertising.

123
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:29,277
Or it can be a moment of tension, as we realize

124
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:32,477
we are being locked in a metal case propelled to 100 km / h

125
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:36,219
surrounded by other people. Or you can live on the guilt mode,

126
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:42,075
if we take seriously - which we should do - speech environmentalists.

127
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:45,567
So there are interactions between all these aspects: our practices

128
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,679
interact with stories, our experience of mobility is influenced

129
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,389
by stories and signifcations that surround it,

130
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:55,549
without being always a perfect match.

131
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:57,521
Sometimes discrepancies are observed

132
00:08:57,521 --> 00:09:02,748
Many philosophers, thinkers and artists have used these experiences

133
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:05,427
to transform mobility in different things.

134
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:09,404
We can conceive a walk in a garden in a particular way

135
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:12,735
that turns walking into a philosophical exercise,

136
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:15,249
walking and meditating becoming the same thing.

137
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:20,081
All these dimensions of mobility, movement, meaning and practices,

138
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:23,851
associate with each particular moment of mobility.

139
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:27,279
They also have a political dimension which is very important, given

140
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:30,099
that they are all taken in the phenomena of power.

141
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:32,289
It is the aspect that I will address now.

142
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:35,049
Mobility and policy.

143
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:43,391
A holistic approach to mobility involves entering its political dimension,

144
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:44,604
its relationship to power,

145
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:47,564
which envelopes it in so many ways.

146
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:53,845
This applies as a resource unevenly distributed: some have access to it, others not,

147
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:56,411
some have it under different forms.

148
00:09:56,411 --> 00:10:01,010
Thus the speed of movement of a person can be closely correlated

149
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,551
with the slowness of another;

150
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:06,821
or a person may have the ability to move because another is immobilized.

151
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:11,582
The significance of movement and its political implications.

152
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,987
Recent events provide an example that made the headlines,

153
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:21,572
particularly in the UK and the US: the peaks hours in schools.

154
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:29,179
These parents drop their children off to school

155
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:33,825
or go pick them up, generally in primary schools.

156
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:39,842
What usually happens is that parents arrive in cars,

157
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:44,347
that a number of accidents occur,

158
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:49,186
that children are overthrown by these big cars, so this raises

159
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:51,396
an atmosphere of panic in those moments.

160
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:55,254
It is women who are criticized because they drive big cars

161
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:59,016
while this is not necessary and that children should walk more

162
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:00,313
to prevent obesity.

163
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:03,298
All this is mixed with complex policy issues

164
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:08,010
with moral implications of obesity,

165
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:13,150
on the right and the need to drive big SUV in London.

166
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,534
And all these considerations are nested together.

167
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:23,284
These big cars are a danger to pedestrians.

168
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:29,014
Yet cars facilitate the very complicated lives of mothers,

169
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:33,294
allowing them to juggle time and space in a way previously impossible.

170
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:37,190
This is not a simple story, but it is a highly political story.

171
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:42,277
This is a story about power, movement, meanings

172
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:43,960
nested in the movement.

173
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,101
And these power relations existing in mobility refer to the three ideas

174
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:54,213
developed previously, the movement, the meaning and practice

175
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,764
are all three policies.

176
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:59,022
The move is political, which can be replaced ? Towards what destination?

177
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:01,198
How fast? At what frequency ?

178
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:04,781
These issues purely quantitative appearance, even scientific,

179
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:07,502
have a political dimension.

180
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:10,290
We often see maps in newspapers showing

181
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,338
some form of mobility, coupled with a disturbing news item.

182
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:18,888
The significance is political: who built the stories of mobility?

183
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:23,716
Who decides that mobility is synonymous with freedom, progress, modernity,

184
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:28,856
of citizenship? Who decides that mobility, overnight,

185
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:32,839
take the sense of transgression, threat, illness, flood?

186
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,259
All this is a political history, the question of who controls the senses

187
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,652
we give to the movement is a political challenge.

188
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:44,848
The practice of the movement and its political implications.

189
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:51,180
Then there is the political practice that comes to practice mobility

190
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,899
in the manner that is its?

191
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,954
The most striking example is the airport and the plane.

192
00:12:55,954 --> 00:12:59,774
A traveler in an airport will cross at full speed all the controls,

193
00:12:59,774 --> 00:13:03,164
he can be repressed at customs or immigration posts,

194
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:06,554
he can be stopped before he can even get on the plane,

195
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:11,703
if he does not obey a set of criteria that airport personnel

196
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:15,575
has selected as constituting good mobility as opposed to a bad one.

197
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,421
He finally boarded the plane, which,

198
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,834
of course is divided into first class, business class, and economic.

199
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:26,302
This is one of the few circumstances in life where you are assigned to a class,

200
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:30,046
a place to sit, where people sitting ahead have more air,

201
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:33,410
better food, more health, while people in the back

202
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,331
have a headache from lack of oxygen, fewer toilets at their disposal,

203
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,748
less space for their legs, less of everything.

204
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:43,543
How the experience and practice of mobility are differentiated

205
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:45,143
is here quite explicit.

206
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:47,813
And we could give many other examples.

207
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:50,863
These people are regularly checked by police

208
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,463
since September 11, in western cities,

209
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:56,692
or people from Middle Eastern countries are frequently

210
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:59,072
arrested under all sorts of pretexts.

211
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,992
An expression that has been said much,

212
00:14:00,992 --> 00:14:05,546
circulates in American cities: "driving wild black"

213
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:09,459
the idea being that a Black driving a car, especially if it is a model one

214
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:14,931
which seems quite expensive, is ten times more likely to be controlled than a White

215
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:21,447
because we suspect him of having stolen it or bought it with dirty money.

216
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:27,957
Movement, meaning and practice are part of political mobility,

217
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:32,823
the whole being crossed by issues of power, domination and oppression reports

218
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:36,203
but also by resistance, as people also use mobility

219
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:38,993
to resist these forms of power.

220
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:42,974
The constellations of mobility.

221
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:49,154
The last point I want to address here is the idea that all this consists in

222
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,947
what I call the "constellations of mobility."

223
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:55,933
A constellation of mobility is a more or less permanent structure,

224
00:14:55,933 --> 00:15:00,224
a more or less structured approach to the way in which the movements,

225
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:03,796
meanings, and practical are articulated with each other.

226
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:06,883
My thesis is that these constellations vary according to history

227
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:09,236
and geography. If we consider Europe

228
00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:16,412
in feudal times, we see that the mobility over long distances,

229
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:18,779
is the privilege of a small number of people.

230
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,329
The constellation of mobility in feudal times.

231
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:28,917
If one draws a map of the feudal mobility, we see that the great

232
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:32,737
majority of travels is in a sort of radius of 11 km

233
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,293
from the place of residence.

234
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:39,075
There are a few exceptions, that are always coming out in the order:

235
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:46,672
musicians, minstrels, crusaders, monks and vagabonds

236
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:50,664
began to emerge gradually, transforming the feudal representation

237
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:54,312
of mobility. It was primarily the responsibility of kings and lords,

238
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:58,660
accordance with structures of controls in European cultures

239
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,884
of the time. The power of control and regulation of mobility

240
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:07,888
was exclusively in the hands of a very small number of people;

241
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:11,289
the vast majority of people were subject to rules,

242
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:15,662
were carefully controlled and had no ability to travel great distances.

243
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:18,402
The constellation of mobility during the Renaissance.

244
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:25,708
During the period from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century,

245
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:31,172
there has been a gradual abandonment of this representation,

246
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:34,319
in parallel with changes in agriculture and laws.

247
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:37,148
We see the emergence of a category of persons,

248
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:39,552
vagabonds or homeless people,

249
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:45,398
that were not attached to any land and were freed from serfdom.

250
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:50,159
It became possible for the serf or peasant, to visit a city

251
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,801
of what is now Germany, to stay there for a year and a day,

252
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:57,862
and accordingly be released from his obligations as a peasant or a serf.

253
00:16:57,862 --> 00:17:01,021
Hence the expression "the city freed the men"

254
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,818
ideally, it made them free.

255
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:05,157
Mobility was closely linked to this idea.

256
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:09,011
When we started to see 10 or 20 or even 100 people settling

257
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:12,817
in a small town, say,in the late fourteenth or fifteenth century,

258
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:17,024
suddenly appeared a new perception of how

259
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:20,855
this phenomenon should be considered, which was presented as part of the nation,

260
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:22,655
the state or the local community.

261
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:27,446
They began to give people passes of different kinds.

262
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,966
The passport originated at that time, not national, as

263
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,930
we know it today, but as a kind of local passport.

264
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,181
In Bern, Switzerland, for example, people received the fifteenth century

265
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:44,361
passes to certify their belonging to this place.

266
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:48,776
In the absence of pass, you could be sent out of town

267
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,518
as a vagagabond or a beggar. If you went back there, you were caught and tried,

268
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:55,523
you could receive a stigma on the forehead shaped as a star.

269
00:17:55,523 --> 00:17:59,862
As a form of biometric control before the hour, with the idea that the body

270
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:03,785
maybe the identity of registration place and that mobility is controlled.

271
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:06,635
The constellation of mobility in modern times.

272
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:14,265
As you enter the modern era, the nation-state begins to become

273
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:18,809
the structure or the echelon at which is organized mobility.

274
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:23,748
The passport is a passport to cross borders, police

275
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:27,379
begins to control mobility as a national rather than a local issue.

276
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:31,602
And migratory movements begin

277
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:34,887
to manifest at a much larger scale,

278
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:37,854
both by the number of migrants and the speed of flow.

279
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:41,466
With the industrial revolution is taking place the railway infrastructure

280
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:46,365
and we see the beginnings of seasonal work. In the south of France,

281
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:50,145
people come from all over Europe to harvest grapes at some point,

282
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:53,626
before leaving. We begin to have a more marked image

283
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:56,150
of the presence of foreigners in the nation.

284
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,721
And we see the emergence of new ideas in science:

285
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,191
men no longer think they are the center of the universe.

286
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:07,369
The earth revolves around the sun now, transforming the representation

287
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:11,041
that men have of themselves. Physics starts to theorize,

288
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,378
modern law is developed, the citizen is defined as a person

289
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:18,206
which can move within the nation-state, cross borders

290
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:22,591
between two nation-states, as someone who belongs to a place;

291
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:25,716
about the "non-citizen", it is no longer considered a vagabond,

292
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:27,218
but as the other, the stranger.

293
00:19:27,218 --> 00:19:31,133
In the fourteenth century, a stranger is someone who lives more than 15 kilometers from home.

294
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:35,223
When is permanently settled the Nation-state in the nineteenth century,

295
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:38,851
there emerges the figure of the stranger as someone from another

296
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:42,626
Nation-state, and begins to surround it a sense of fear, moral fear.

297
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:47,022
We can study the constellation of mobility in feudal times wider,

298
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:50,803
then at the time of the Renaissance, and in modern times,

299
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:54,903
when mobility becomes an element of progress, with freedom,

300
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,782
with technological developments,

301
00:19:56,782 --> 00:20:00,231
with the railway, with the exaltation of the Italian Futurists before

302
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,227
the possibilities offered by speed and by the machines,

303
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,963
all these elements being nested into each other.

304
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:09,966
The constellation of modernity today.

305
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,330
So the question is in which constellation of mobility

306
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,322
we find ourselves today and which way it operates.

307
00:20:18,322 --> 00:20:22,690
What are the meanings, practices and movements

308
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,594
which articulate the twenty-first century?

309
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:27,427
We still do not know the answer to that question,

310
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,765
but we know that it escapes more and more to the capabilities

311
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:34,572
of control of Nation-states. So we find supranational organizations

312
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:37,645
like the United Nations, the Schengen area, the European Union,

313
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:41,806
various United Nations bodies, all of which are trying to regulate

314
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:45,912
refugee movements and other forms of mobility in new ways.

315
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:50,962
There are also more and more repressive measures of panic,

316
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:54,386
of threats. Mobility seems to be both vital

317
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:58,287
in the world we live in, and a virus,

318
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:01,694
it is represented as a virus, a constant threat of destruction

319
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,867
of this world, whether through immigration or epidemics such

320
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:08,622
as the severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, or swine flu.

321
00:21:08,622 --> 00:21:11,525
As soon as these epidemics burst, airports are paralyzed,

322
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:16,021
newspapers are covered with maps, panic

323
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:20,633
wins the planet, and all that relates to mobility. Hence where this phenomenon come from?

324
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:24,633
This is a question that challenges the real world.
