1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,205
(Superposed voice)

2
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:09,105
(alarm)

3
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,011
Major mobile I'll talk to you today

4
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:27,647
are people who travel frequently

5
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:29,144
recurrently

6
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:32,178
as part of the exercise of their employment.

7
00:00:32,178 --> 00:00:35,738
It's about long distance commuting,

8
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:38,534
round trips between home and work

9
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:41,505
and it also addresses bi-residentiality:

10
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:46,359
people who have a foothold in a city, for example,

11
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,253
next to which they have their jobs

12
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:51,030
and will return every week, every weekend

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,599
in the main home.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,668
The issue, ultimately, for these people

15
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:59,590
will be to combine the exercise of a professional activity

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,606
on one side and then the anchors, habits, preferences

17
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:05,484
of family side, on the other side.

18
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:07,724
Today, long-distance commuting

19
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:08,889
for professional reasons

20
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:10,297
tend to increase.

21
00:01:10,297 --> 00:01:13,340
This is seen, both in long distance commuting

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,680
than in the bi-residentiality.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,931
And so the question is why is it increasing?

24
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:32,346
The first reason we can invoke

25
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:35,782
is already, the improvment of the transport supply

26
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:38,366
with trains of high-speed lines,

27
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:41,740
a transport offer to the road level

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,788
which is also better

29
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:46,490
and of course, the low cost aviation

30
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,335
that can goto towns far enough quite regularly

31
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:53,305
for actually rather little costs and time.

32
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:55,423
Then we can look to each of the sides

33
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:57,207
of this movement we are talking about,

34
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:59,345
the housing side and the employment side.

35
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:08,726
The job market is becoming more specialized

36
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:10,859
both in terms of the nature of jobs

37
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:12,193
than of localizations

38
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:15,026
with areas where there are a lot of jobs,

39
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:17,829
other areas where there is little or not at all

40
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,789
This is the first point.

41
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:24,039
Second point, there is more and more fixed-term contracts.

42
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:26,216
That is to say that a lot of change.

43
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:28,984
You can work in one place for a period of time

44
00:02:28,984 --> 00:02:31,707
which can be relatively short and then having to change

45
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:33,725
your working location.

46
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:38,427
The third reason is obviously the unemployment and thus a difficulty

47
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:43,392
to find a job that will cause some people

48
00:02:43,392 --> 00:02:48,421
to have to look for jobs farther from home sometimes.

49
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:57,578
Long distance commuting or all of these mobilities

50
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,913
for professional reasons, if they increase,

51
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,681
it is not only because of work-related factors,

52
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:06,055
but it is also, at the other end of the chain, on the housing side,

53
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:10,322
for reasons related to anchorages.

54
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:15,481
To change housing, it is primarily changing all short

55
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:19,944
and to live in a place, is to develop there anchors

56
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:24,484
it is meeting people, having a social network, family, friends

57
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:29,639
having habits, appropriating ultimately these places.

58
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,099
There is therefore a certain inertia vis-a-vis of this change

59
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,815
of residential location.

60
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:42,075
The second point is that, obviously, a pair of dual-income will have to manage

61
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:45,334
two places of different professional activities, so there is not

62
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:48,847
a residential location which will be optimal or perfect,

63
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:55,497
which will help to minimize the travel time between home and work.

64
00:03:55,497 --> 00:04:00,006
If we return to these anchors developed

65
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:05,202
around the dwelling place, we can broadened a little this question

66
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:08,031
of anchorage to habits ....

67
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,346
This is related to the living comfort.

68
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:14,912
You will find in your choice of accommodation

69
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:20,004
a place where not only will you feel good

70
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,244
it can be declined by the inter-se

71
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,182
which is a preference that people have to live in places

72
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:30,762
where other people are like you,

73
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:33,710
from a cultural point of view, from a social point of view, etc ....

74
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,587
This is what created segregation.

75
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:40,051
Chosing a location is referring to anchors, habits we have.

76
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:43,216
Anchors that are social, family, but also anchors

77
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,383
which can be institutional or cultural.

78
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:49,553
We can give the example of people, borderers,

79
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:53,787
who are in a given country, who will want to stay in that said country

80
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:55,815
even if they have to make a long distance

81
00:04:55,815 --> 00:04:57,790
to work in another country.

82
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,685
On the other side of the border, sometimes these movements

83
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:04,251
can last an hour and a half, two hours, daily.

84
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:08,420
All this to finally ensure benchmarks and anchors

85
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,386
which are institutional or cultural

86
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:14,741
and that will eventually enable them to better live changes

87
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,677
that may be related to their situation.

88
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:20,447
We see that eventually this commuting, this bi-residentiality

89
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:22,694
is the result of a certain number of arrangements

90
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:24,090
that we will be required to make

91
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,356
to finally manage space and time.

92
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:37,367
If we want to try to ask the question of the reason

93
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:40,049
of the increase of the mobility,

94
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:43,414
of these great mobility for professional reasons

95
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:48,855
we can try to broaden somewhat the approach we have on the concept of mobility.

96
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:51,449
Mobility is not a movement in space.

97
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,728
We see that people will have preferences

98
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,853
which are of social or economic order

99
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:59,618
and which will intervene in their choice of residential location.

100
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:01,779
So to understand the bi-residentiality

101
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,574
we must also look at this.

102
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:08,746
Finally watching the elements and the social dimension

103
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:11,968
which is associated with spatial mobility.

104
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:15,158
If we synthese a little what we said earlier,

105
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:18,216
we realize that highly mobile people in space,

106
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:22,257
will be people who will sometimes be induced to make the choice refereed

107
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,921
in favor of a greater mobility for professional reasons

108
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:29,517
to ensure the anchors they have at the residential level.

109
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:33,283
Finally, spatially mobile people can be people

110
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,481
who are socially not very mobile.

111
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:39,613
who do not want change, who do not want to confront otherness,

112
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:41,020
to something different.

113
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,146
from what they know currently.

114
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:50,209
So that's what's interesting about this idea,

115
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,607
it is that major mobilities develop themselves,

116
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:55,402
but they do not develop at the expense of anchors.

117
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:57,997
Major mobile are sometimes great sedentary.

118
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,410
The high mobility increases but at the same time

119
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,943
sedentary lifestyle does not decrease.

120
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:05,652
Local anchors do not decrease.

121
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:16,144
Another point that goes in that direction is the idea that we will not be able

122
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,769
to change so fast in residential location as we will change jobs.

123
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:24,941
The more the labor market requires flexibility, the more high is unemployment,

124
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:29,975
the more great will be the difficulty to finding another job

125
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:35,180
so we will be required to lengthen the distance between home and work

126
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,615
and we will have a possible choice to be at the place of residence.

127
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:46,050
One imagines easily to accept long distances commuting

128
00:07:46,226 --> 00:07:52,227
if it is to make a career, to get a better paying job,

129
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:55,436
to finally have a better work situation

130
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:58,575
but we realize that increasingly, these large mobilities

131
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:01,520
for professional reasons are not related to an improvement

132
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,185
in the professional situation,

133
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:06,000
they are intended to prevent occupational downgrading,

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,194
this is to avoid unemployment that we will be led to sometimes

135
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:11,934
do these great mobilities.

136
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:16,755
To avoid unemployment and to ensure the other way a number of anchors

137
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:20,164
which are linked to a comfort life and which will enable the individual

138
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:22,920
or the person to find a personal balance.

139
00:08:29,304 --> 00:08:32,635
From that point, it begs the question

140
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,916
if the people which are great mobile

141
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,416
are people who live it well.

142
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:41,594
It begs the question of inequalities related to major mobilities.

143
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:46,039
Compared to this, the literature on inequality of mobility invites us

144
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,322
to watch not the differences between people

145
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:51,593
which are mobile and those that are not,

146
00:08:51,593 --> 00:08:55,079
but rather the differences between people who can be mobile

147
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:56,564
and those who are not.

148
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:59,238
We, what we have done in relation to that issue,

149
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,764
in research on professional mobilities

150
00:09:01,764 --> 00:09:03,769
a search called Job-Mob

151
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:08,729
we watched both the actual behavior of people:

152
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:10,490
are they mobile?

153
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,447
Are they great mobile or not?

154
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,118
Who are the people in each of these two situations?

155
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,615
Can people be great mobile or not?

156
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:19,946
Do people want to be great mobile or not?

157
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:22,759
This power, this will and do is ultimately associated

158
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,442
to this concept of motility, developed by Vincent Kaufman,

159
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:28,875
since power is approached on the basis of access and skills

160
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,823
so contextual access:

161
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:32,643
is there any rail lines,

162
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:34,786
Is there a nearby highway?

163
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:37,857
and personal access: does the person have a car?

164
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,971
Does the person have season tickets?

165
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:43,056
And skills to mobility.

166
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:52,644
What can it be as a skill,

167
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:57,625
it will be to have the ease to read maps, to orient oneself in space.

168
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,987
It will be the capacity to occupy one's time of transport,

169
00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:03,861
namely manage uncertainties or changes

170
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:09,078
for example when there are problems in transport

171
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:10,880
or traffic jams, etc.

172
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:15,538
Being able to organize time against these contingencies.

173
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:19,697
All this is a number of skills that we will look

174
00:10:19,697 --> 00:10:21,943
within the idea of ​​power.

175
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,975
Can we be more mobile?

176
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:31,045
All that, we looked at it on the basis of data that are panel data.

177
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:34,197
Panel data, is data that has been

178
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:35,716
collected

179
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:38,182
on two different dates for the same individuals.

180
00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:42,292
People were interviewed in 2007 and were re-interviewed in 2011.

181
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:45,469
One could thus study the changes.

182
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:49,247
The other characteristic of the database that was used

183
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:50,612
is that it is European.

184
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:53,475
So we looked at once what was going on in Spain

185
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:55,323
France, Switzerland and Germany.

186
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:03,767
If we look at the skills of mobility

187
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:06,073
or the possibility that people have to move

188
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:08,115
through the access and skills,

189
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:10,886
we note that there are differences on an economic level

190
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,141
between the wealthiest and the poorest.

191
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:18,146
Differences also at the social level between those who have levels

192
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:20,147
of training that are the best and the other

193
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,561
and differences between men and women.

194
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:24,389
On the other hand, what is more surprising,

195
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,062
people who have the most power,

196
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,640
who can be the most mobile

197
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,148
are not those which are the most mobile.

198
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:35,272
There is no link between the ability to move and the fact of moving.

199
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:45,347
On the contrary, what you notice is that

200
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:48,099
to have the best chance of moving

201
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:51,011
will be associated with a more comfortable mobility.

202
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,082
People who are mobile will live the best.

203
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:55,906
Note that through a number of questions

204
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:58,128
we asked about comfort and how

205
00:11:58,128 --> 00:12:01,099
people finally lived this move.

206
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:04,710
We can see that those who have the best capabilities, skills and access

207
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,584
live it better.

208
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:08,565
So it does not respond fully to the question of inequality.

209
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:14,639
If we look at actual behaviors, we have a very wide variety of profiles

210
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:19,057
among great mobile and what will allow us to speak of inequality

211
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:21,658
is when we're going to see, to watch speeches

212
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,177
that the people make of these great mobilities.

213
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,397
If asked whether they wish to be mobile, we will be able to cross

214
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:32,125
these elements with the capabilities of these people to be mobile or not.

215
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:37,113
What we noticed is that if one says to be ready to be mobile

216
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:40,813
one will in the short or medium term effectively, become one.

217
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,947
On the other hand, there is a decorrelation, an imbalance, a gap that is made,

218
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:54,421
between people that can and people who want.

219
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:57,867
We have different profiles of many people who can

220
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,843
and who want a lot.

221
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:01,459
of people who are very motile.

222
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,658
So with a mobility capital that is very high

223
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,290
and that will have facilities to move and will move.

224
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,778
There are also people who have a high potential

225
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:16,998
and a weak will: people who decide not to move

226
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:20,243
long distance while they have the capabilities or access.

227
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:24,584
Conversely, there are people who are ready for major mobile

228
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:27,998
but have a chance to do it that is very low.

229
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:32,338
This is the category of the population that interests us most

230
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:33,951
as regards of inequalities

231
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:36,967
since these are people who declare themselves ready to move,

232
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:40,699
but have low capacities and access

233
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:43,753
and so may ill-live it or that perhaps,

234
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:45,593
it begs the question at least,

235
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,624
are forced into these mobilities.

236
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:55,945
If we finally look at those people,

237
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:58,921
we realize that these are people who are either unemployed

238
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,110
or are in a position of being potentially unemployed

239
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,045
or have lived in unemployment shortly

240
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:09,047
although ultimately it seems unemployment will have a major impact

241
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:13,343
on the possibility of becoming major mobile.

242
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:15,923
This is something we spotted a lot in Spain

243
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:19,288
since you see that the investigation was made between 2007 and 2011,

244
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:21,381
in 2007 and 2011

245
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:24,222
so right before and after - after this is not very sur -

246
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:26,056
the economic crisis.

247
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:28,408
We realize that people's abilities

248
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:31,480
finally have changed relatively little in terms of access to skills

249
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,179
on the contrary, the will of the people to move exploded.

250
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:37,577
There are lots of people who declare their readiness

251
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,658
to long distance commuting or to be bi-resident

252
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:44,819
even while they are in social and economic situations

253
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,658
that are difficult.

254
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:55,433
Finally, the complexity of these arrangements in space

255
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:58,273
between home and workplace will lead to periods

256
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:02,331
during which people will be long-distance commuters

257
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:04,140
or will be major mobile.

258
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,270
Those periods can be short or long and again

259
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,356
what can be observed in the survey on these two dates,

260
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:14,691
is that people who wished not to remain mobile in 2007

261
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:16,494
sometimes still are.

262
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:22,209
Those who declared themselves quite willing to stay mobile

263
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:23,679
no longer are.

264
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,848
There is a shift being created between discourse and practice.

265
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:29,368
And this difference is interesting.

266
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:33,242
We realize that people who live the best mobility

267
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:35,599
who are in the most favorable situations

268
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:38,552
are the people who will have the most ease to stop,

269
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:40,962
to stop the situation of great mobility.

270
00:15:40,962 --> 00:15:42,849
Again, in the long term,

271
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:44,959
we see that there are major inequalities

272
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,536
in terms of management of these great mobilities.

273
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:59,312
What we can say with respect to these great mobilities,

274
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:02,291
is that there is a risk of developing today

275
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,790
a high mobility standard,

276
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,209
a need

277
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:10,564
a need to be great mobile to survive socially

278
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:13,050
or to live better socially.

279
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,588
This is probably against this need of mobility that we need to act.

280
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:21,372
It is obviously important to ensure the possibility of moving,

281
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,641
to work on the right to mobility

282
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:25,939
but through the results of our research,

283
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:28,921
we realize that it is very important to work

284
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,983
on the guarantee of a right to immobility,

285
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:34,082
ie to guarantee people the opportunity not to be

286
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:37,326
major mobile, if they do not wish to be great mobile.

287
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:40,692
This is something that is increasingly difficult in any case,

288
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:42,545
over the period of time that was analyzed

289
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:44,846
this is something that is strongly developed.

290
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:48,433
The mobility is not something that is good or bad in itself

291
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:51,069
something that must necessarily be defended against or

292
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:52,988
which must necessarily be fought

293
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:57,656
but it must guarantee everyone the opportunity to be mobile if desired

294
00:16:57,656 --> 00:16:59,812
and not be be if you do not want to

295
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:04,485
and then the guarantee to give people a way out

296
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,759
of the mobility situation if they wish for it

297
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,004
and to remain mobile if they wish.

298
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:13,345
Finally we see that there's a lot of different situations

299
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:17,637
for people and it is finally to all these profiles of people

300
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:23,216
that we need to focus on if we want to try to fight against inequality

301
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:25,112
related to mobility.

302
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:28,542
(Superposed voice)

303
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:32,794
(Superposed voice)
