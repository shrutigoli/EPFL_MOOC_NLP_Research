00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:06,128
Hello.

2
00:00:06,563 --> 00:00:10,563
In this video, I propose you a genealogy of the concept of mobility.

3
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:14,553
The purpose of this exercise is to adopt a definition

4
00:00:14,553 --> 00:00:17,533
both contemporary, rich and operational

5
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:18,803
of mobility.

6
00:00:19,046 --> 00:00:22,006
A concept which helps to describe and understand

7
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:25,526
how contemporary societies build themselves

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,416
in time and space.

9
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:30,714
Mobility as itself is mostly used

10
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:35,484
in contemporary social sciences characterized by a certain poverty.

11
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:39,911
So mobility is considered in many works

12
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:43,051
as a synonym for crossing space,

13
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,431
forgetting all the other dimensions, like time,

14
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:50,431
but also the social component of mobility.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,900
Mobility is <i> de facto </ i> a synonymous to transport.

16
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:59,259
Similarly, it is considered in numerous researches

17
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,679
as an activated phenomenon that can be measured,

18
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,679
without considering its potential dimension.

19
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:12,233
In short, mobility appears as a concept rather polysemous,

20
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:17,333
a portmanteau word, one word at fashion rather vague.

21
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:20,405
It is from this dissatisfaction that I want to start

22
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:22,895
the genealogy of mobility,

23
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:25,955
because the history of the term and its meanings

24
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:29,955
allows to restore accuracy, richness and thickness.

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,100
In dictionaries, the word mobility appears in the 18th century

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,530
to evoke a mental fitness,

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,700
the ability to juggle ideas in his head.

28
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:44,015
It was not until the 19th century that the word is used

29
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:47,655
to describe movements in geographical space

30
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:49,715
but in a rather ambivalent way.

31
00:01:50,103 --> 00:01:54,103
We then talk of mobility to discuss travel

32
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:57,543
of young English aristocrats, pioneers of tourism,

33
00:01:57,543 --> 00:02:02,103
but we also use the word to talk
about the wandering of the migrant,

34
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:04,503
a wandering that worries.

35
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:08,763
It was not until the early 20th century, in the 1920s,

36
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:11,863
that the word mobility entered in the research.

37
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:16,888
This is particularly the case with the work of Sorokin one hand

38
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:19,938
and of Chicago School on the other.

39
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:23,525
Around these authors were born Migration Studies,

40
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:26,645
the study of social and professional mobility

41
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:29,835
and the study of residential mobility in the city.

42
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:35,453
Parallel to this research, is developed independently,

43
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,133
also in the 1920s in the United States,

44
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:39,853
the science of traffic,

45
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:43,853
which is the study of flow and regulation of flows.

46
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:49,116
The work of Sorokin and the Chicago School are very creative

47
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:52,806
and will give rise to many conceptual reflections.

48
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:57,007
This is for example the case of the social mobility concept

49
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:59,987
and the notion of social mobility table,

50
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:02,357
such as the one you have before you

51
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:04,267
for France in 2003.

52
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:10,294
A social and professional mobility table measures the change

53
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:14,504
in socio-professional position, in social mobility,

54
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:16,764
between parents and children.

55
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:21,457
It is therefore a measure of the mobility in terms of change of position

56
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:25,277
and not in terms of crossing space.

57
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:28,507
Mobility is defined here as a change

58
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:32,507
without reference to the geographical area.

59
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:37,397
In a table of social mobility, one can distinguish three regions:

60
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:42,717
the diagonal, which is the region of intergenerational reproduction

61
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:45,140
of positions or of immobility;

62
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,510
the region of downward mobility, which is here;

63
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,870
and the region of upward mobility,

64
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,380
which is at the bottom of the table.

65
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,310
By the 1950s, pioneering works initiated since the 1920s

66
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,310
will gradually build up autonomous areas of research

67
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,960
having their own harems.

68
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:15,254
Thus the social and professional mobility,

69
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:18,564
the science of traffic and spatial mobility

70
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:22,274
become respectively the sociology of mobility,

71
00:04:22,274 --> 00:04:26,564
the <i> Transportation Studies </ i> and analysis of spatial mobility.

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,720
In the 1990s, however, the need for an inclusive approach

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,870
arises because the descriptive and comprehensive power of analysis

74
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,079
of mobility is blunting,

75
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,189
as shown in the development of an hybrid form of displacement

76
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:45,289
or changes in the way people use

77
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:46,789
their travel time.

78
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:51,731
The field of spatial mobility is structured into four sub-areas

79
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:56,011
of specialization are distinguished by the spatial range

80
00:04:56,011 --> 00:05:02,401
travel and movement type, origin, destination or return,

81
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:06,071
as shown in the table you have before you.

82
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,207
The study of mobility is now fragmented

83
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,897
in several highly autonomous research.

84
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:17,035
By the 1990s, however, the need for an inclusive approach

85
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:21,795
arises because the descriptive and comprehensive power analysis

86
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:23,945
of mobility is blunting,

87
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:27,515
as shown in the development of hybrid forms of displacement

88
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:30,675
or changes in the way in which people use

89
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:32,425
their travel time

90
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:36,425
that the fragmented approach of mobility understands difficultly.

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,770
First example: the hybrid mobility.

92
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:42,897
The long-distance commuting or bi-residence

93
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:45,507
also known as hybrid mobility,

94
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:48,607
whether work-related or for leisure,

95
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:53,737
is developed in recent years in a number of European countries.

96
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:57,977
These are phenomena that can hardly be grasped

97
00:05:57,977 --> 00:06:00,807
with the table you have before you

98
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:05,527
because these trips are located exactly at the border

99
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,987
of the different boxes.

100
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:11,522
The long-distance commuting in particular,

101
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:14,942
is a mobility of daily life but not internal

102
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,642
to the pool of life.

103
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:21,882
Similarly, the bi-residence is somehow

104
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,882
a residential mobility which takes place every week.

105
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:29,402
Second example: the conjecture of Zahavi.

106
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:35,172
Zahavi's conjecture posits that the movements of everyday life

107
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:38,162
are done all over the world in about an hour

108
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:40,382
and their spatial extent is a function

109
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:42,232
of the moving speed.

110
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:46,122
However, there is in many European cities and North America

111
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:49,732
a lengthening of commuting time budgets

112
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:52,882
since the 1990s.

113
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,939
More and more people take more than an hour

114
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,009
to move in their daily lives.

115
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:01,809
The Zahavi conjecture no longer works.

116
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:04,882
Among the factors that explain this change

117
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:08,882
there is the the shift in travel time.

118
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:12,379
Today, one can easily use their travel time

119
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:16,379
to deploy small activities with a tablet, a mobile phone

120
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,459
or a computer while one is moving.

121
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,110
Moreover, it is also an explanatory factor

122
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,670
of the disaffection of driving

123
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,380
among those under 30 years.

124
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,456
It is also a factor,

125
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,276
and this is why we speak of it,

126
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:34,846
that explains the fact that we have a need of an integrative approach

127
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:35,956
of mobility.

128
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:40,081
The partition of research areas begins to be perceived

129
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:42,501
as an obstacle to the advancement of knowledge,

130
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:44,821
as we have seen through the two examples

131
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:46,041
above.

132
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,444
Researchers develop inclusive approaches,

133
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:52,464
like John Urry or Tim Cresswell,

134
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:56,464
that you will enjoy discovering the thinking in other videos.

135
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,690
The need for new tools is very clearly felt

136
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,440
to grasp a changing reality.

137
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,870
Thus arise the so-called <i> mobilities studies </ i>

138
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,610
whose purpose is to grasp the relationship to space, time and change

139
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,390
in contemporary societies.

140
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:22,686
We arrive at the end of this video.

141
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:27,547
Through the genealogy of the uses of mobility over time,

142
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:30,357
we were able to capture the richness of this notion.

143
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:34,063
We also see clearly the need to discard

144
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:36,473
a sense of mobility that reduces

145
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:38,643
crossing space.

146
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:42,623
It is to regain the richness of the mobility analysis

147
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:47,303
and it is important to consider that this is naturally spatial

148
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:49,323
but it is also social,

149
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:52,193
that it is activated as movement

150
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:55,973
but also potentially and remains in the state of latency.

151
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:59,353
Finally, it can take different forms

152
00:08:59,353 --> 00:09:02,513
which combine themselves systemically.
