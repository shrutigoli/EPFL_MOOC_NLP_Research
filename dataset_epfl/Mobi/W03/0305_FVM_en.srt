1
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:06,307
(hubbub)

2
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:09,277
(alarm)

3
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:16,296
(hubbub)

4
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,481
So the question that will arise today,

5
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:28,171
that is to know if the travel time is a useful time or not.

6
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:32,137
So if we ask this question, it is because the journey time

7
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,456
has for long been given little attention

8
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:38,404
in the scientific field of transport

9
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:42,604
and which is becoming now a major issue in terms of mobility.

10
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:54,222
First, what is the traditional concept of travel time

11
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:56,652
in socio-economics of transport?

12
00:00:57,063 --> 00:01:02,013
Economic theory is most often considering time tranport

13
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:06,323
as a cost of access to destinations and activities

14
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:09,423
which will be performed via this route.

15
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:16,269
So it has for long attributed it an economic value, monetary value

16
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:22,559
which corresponds somehow to the price, in time of transport, of these activities.

17
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:28,515
So, to maximize its usefulness,

18
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:32,725
the individual must, in the paradigm of the rational actor,

19
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:36,934
minimize travel time, to maximize its utility

20
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:39,514
in the activities to be carried to its destination.

21
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:43,128
So the idea behind this conceptualization,

22
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:47,709
is that travel time ultimately has no value in itself.

23
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,281
It is a kind of time that is interstitial and empty,

24
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,641
and which therefore has no relevance as such.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,470
Of course, this design has direct implications

26
00:01:59,058 --> 00:02:04,078
on the choice of travel mode, since in theory thereof,

27
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:09,901
if individuals are simply looking to reduce their travel time,

28
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:13,867
it means that they will opt for the fastest modes of travel.

29
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:18,907
Then this model has been strongly questioned and criticized

30
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:22,557
both from a theoretical point of view, but also empirically.

31
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:36,072
First, from a theoretical point of view.

32
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:38,789
In the field of transport economics,

33
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:42,499
ever since the 90s, there is researches that questioned

34
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:47,867
clean utility, the primary utility of travel time

35
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:51,837
and have shown that the transportation time has a positive value.

36
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:55,527
Not only thanks to the activities that may be conducted

37
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,067
during the movement,

38
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,559
but also by the characteristics of these displacements.

39
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:06,298
This is an example of the fun we have to move, to observe the landscape, etc.

40
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:11,412
And then there are other disciplines, including sociology and geography,

41
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,470
who have also invested this question

42
00:03:15,883 --> 00:03:22,237
and which showed that travel time could be valued for itself

43
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:28,537
and even be transformed into a place of life in itself.

44
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,448
After, there are challenges to come over the empirical.

45
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:42,812
One of the reasons that made us increasingly interested

46
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,388
in the question of travel time,

47
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:52,278
it was the finding of an increase in daily travel time.

48
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,924
Analyses traditionally for travel time,

49
00:03:56,944 --> 00:04:00,544
are mainly based on the assumption of constancy

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,920
of what is called the "time budgets" of commuting,

51
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:10,273
that is to say the time spent by people on a daily basis to move.

52
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:15,083
And this time was considered to be stable in time and in space,

53
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:17,337
this is what is called the Zahavi conjecture.

54
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,958
There are several mobility surveys in Europe that have shown

55
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,042
there was an increase in time spent traveling,

56
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:30,460
we see that with the example in Great Britain, the Netherlands, France and Switzerland.

57
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,630
Faced with this increase in time spent traveling,

58
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,360
one can question the fact that the travel time is an empty or useless time.

59
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,106
It is therefore to know what is played during this travel time,

60
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:46,638
how we can qualify this time,

61
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:50,348
do people necessarily seek to reduce it to the maximum

62
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:55,630
and finally, what influence this travel time can have

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,710
on the choice of modes of travel in daily life.

64
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:07,954
First of all, the first question is:

65
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,984
What we do when we move?

66
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:13,485
Obviously, we move, but not only,

67
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:18,125
because while we are moving, we have also all kinds of activities

68
00:05:18,396 --> 00:05:22,416
that have been classified by a person called Michael Flame,

69
00:05:22,434 --> 00:05:27,424
into five logics: productivity, relaxation and transition,

70
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:31,977
sociability, escape and emotion.

71
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:36,204
The logic of productivity,  is found in other research,

72
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,629
including those that describe the journey time

73
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:43,385
as "rolling office" for some people,

74
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:46,219
so it'll be a time that we use to work,

75
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:49,661
whether in public transportation or in a car for that matter.

76
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:51,935
These activities show

77
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:55,055
it is not only

78
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:57,115
to appropriate the time of travel,

79
00:05:57,135 --> 00:06:00,615
but it is also to appropriate the movement spaces.

80
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,437
There are therefore travel spaces

81
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:06,737
which can be finally processed

82
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:10,007
and become a kind of extension of the domestic space,

83
00:06:10,197 --> 00:06:13,150
we see that very well in the great commuters, for example,

84
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,010
who settle in the train and finish their night

85
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,303
who begin to prepare themselves, who wear makeup,

86
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:23,089
who eat breakfast, who have dinner in the evening, etc.

87
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:26,719
and therefore, thus transform the space of displacement

88
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,390
in a domestic space.

89
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,070
Some of these logics sometimes come into conflict with each other.

90
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:34,773
For example,

91
00:06:36,117 --> 00:06:37,117
when moving,

92
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:39,795
one may want to work

93
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:42,013
and thenwill  cross a person he knows

94
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:45,773
and thus sociability logic will contradicts

95
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:48,713
productivity logic.

96
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,349
Or there will be contradictions

97
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:56,325
between rest and sociability

98
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:59,165
or rest and productivity, etc.

99
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:09,884
Describe the activities carried out during the journey,

100
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:13,434
it does not say all of this appropriation of travel times,

101
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:15,693
because we must also understand

102
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:19,473
how people live and perceive this travel time.

103
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:24,679
So, this perception can actually be described

104
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,769
in the form of a continuum

105
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:32,549
between, on one hand, a time that will be a time to kill

106
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,790
and, secondly, a time which can be enjoyed.

107
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,080
So between a very negative perception on one hand

108
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:41,939
and very positive on the other.

109
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,669
For example, we will have people telling us

110
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:50,524
"I expect only to arrive. "

111
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:54,894
and their travel time seems infinitely long

112
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:58,916
and they will, for example, occupy it through activities

113
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:01,505
who do not have special meaning for them,

114
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:05,035
that just aim to kill this time they do not use.

115
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:10,355
It will be, for example, playing with their smartphone or computer.

116
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:13,893
At the other extreme, we see have this very positive perception

117
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:15,294
of travel time

118
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:19,739
which will be seen as a time which is cleared daily

119
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,772
and will be taken in advantage of activities

120
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:27,180
that people would not have had the opportunity to realize

121
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,990
if they did not benefit from this travel time.

122
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:34,685
So, these activities will not either be extraordinary,

123
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:38,867
it can be simply read a book, listen to a radio show,

124
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:40,404
listen to music.

125
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,653
But this is simply the fact to say:

126
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:45,383
"This is a time that is offered me

127
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:46,879
in my daily life

128
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,009
I would not benefit if I did not have to move. "

129
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:52,914
Between these two extremes,

130
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:57,587
we will have a time to optimize

131
00:08:57,748 --> 00:09:01,978
that people will fill in trying to gain time

132
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,059
on the rest of their daily activities.

133
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:06,684
Thus, for example,

134
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,729
while eating,

135
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:12,047
while working.

136
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:22,487
If we try to systematize all the factors that influence

137
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:26,514
the appropriation of travel times from a literature review,

138
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:29,489
three main types of factors are identified.

139
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:39,917
The first of these includes the material conditions.

140
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:44,612
These physical conditions fall within the travel patterns as such,

141
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:47,822
it will be comfort, ergonomics of these travel modes,

142
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:52,526
it will be the equipment, the information we have on the way,

143
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:54,642
cost issues, also.

144
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:03,849
Then there will be personal conditions.

145
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:08,356
These personal circumstances are. here too, many and diverse.

146
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,970
For example, the knowledge that people have or not

147
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,060
of the network on which they move,

148
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:17,273
the fact whether they have or not motion sickness, for example,

149
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,122
all these elements also influence

150
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:22,042
how they will appropriate the transport time.

151
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,050
And third type of elements are the situational conditions,

152
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:35,792
that is to say the position in which the movement will take place.

153
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,089
If it's a rush hour or not,

154
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:42,185
if the trip conditions are good or not,

155
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,550
according to the people with the ride,

156
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,280
according to the objects that are also with the route,

157
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,320
ownership of these modes will be different.

158
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,283
What there is also to say,

159
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:55,756
is finally that we know yet little things

160
00:10:56,098 --> 00:10:58,688
systematically on these different elements

161
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,480
influencing the appropriation travel times.

162
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:04,603
If we analyze a little literature on the subject,

163
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:07,405
we realize that most studies

164
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:10,205
are interested in some modes especially

165
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:14,205
or situations in particular,

166
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:19,536
and especially on the modes that are questioned

167
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,929
on the issue of ownership of journey times,

168
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:26,721
we finally know little about the appropriation of drive time

169
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:31,767
and most studies focus on the appropriation of time to train.

170
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:35,231
Which ultimately provides a very limited vision

171
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,824
of the conditions of appropriation of these modes.

172
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:50,053
In my recent research, whether on alter-mobilities

173
00:11:50,063 --> 00:11:53,533
or on people who travel a lot every day,

174
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:55,997
we realize that this is a crucial element

175
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:58,352
in the choice of travel modes

176
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:02,022
and particularly in the choice of travel modes

177
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:03,944
alternative to the car.

178
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:09,058
These are identified through qualitative studies,

179
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:12,198
by observing people and asking them about their practices,

180
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:14,103
but we also notice it

181
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:17,794
in links that can be established quantitatively.

182
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,916
It will therefore be a tendency among these people,

183
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,538
to opt for public transport in particular

184
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,757
because it allows them to have the time available

185
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:29,866
to deploy other activities.

186
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:32,991
It will be people who will opt for travel time

187
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:36,611
that will be objectively longer

188
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:40,651
but subjectively they live in a much more pleasant way

189
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:44,652
or more optimal way in their daily schedules.

190
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,567
In conclusion,

191
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:57,635
if one draws some elements to conclude, the first thing to say,

192
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,265
is that travel time

193
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:04,326
is of course a value in itself, by itself,

194
00:13:04,346 --> 00:13:07,616
which argues for a better knowledge

195
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:13,153
of the elements involved in the ownership of these times,

196
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:18,935
not only in public transport, particularly rail,

197
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:22,231
but systematically on all modes of travel.

198
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:25,323
Then the travel time

199
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,169
do not systematically have to be considered

200
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:30,059
as a time which is useful

201
00:13:30,088 --> 00:13:33,438
in the sense that we will be able to deploy other activities,

202
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:36,382
but we must also address to how it is perceived

203
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:39,419
and the role played by these activities in the travel time.

204
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:44,359
If they come here just to feed a time perceived as useless and empty

205
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:49,929
or if they come here instead as an added value

206
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:51,449
to this travel time.

207
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:56,559
Travel time should not be designed simply as a useful time

208
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:59,218
because we are going to develop activities,

209
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:03,661
but it is also important to take into account the perception of people

210
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,751
in the fact of developing these activities.

211
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:08,241
Are they going to carry out activities

212
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:10,623
just to spend this time faster

213
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:14,843
because they have the perception that it is a useless and too long,

214
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,216
or if they truly enjoy this time,

215
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:21,969
if they find a form of satisfaction or pleasure.

216
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:27,621
This of course opens a range of opportunities for carriers

217
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:33,692
to know how they can attract and retain a clientele of users

218
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:38,587
so their travel time becomes quality time

219
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:40,529
they can fully enjoy.

220
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:43,774
