Hello everyone.

2
00:00:05,957 --> 00:00:11,792
In this video I talk about the tramway revival in France.

3
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:14,044
What are the strengths of the tram?

4
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:19,989
What it can promote in terms of use of means of transport

5
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:23,554
and the attractiveness of urban centers.

6
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:26,489
<I> Since the 1980s, </ i>

7
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,023
<I> new tram networks have flourished throughout Europe, </ i>

8
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:32,486
<I> over fifty of them. </ I>

9
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:35,432
<I> The trend was initially shy, </ i>

10
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:40,052
<I> then it has undergone a much faster pace since the 2000s, </ i>

11
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:44,554
<I> to the point that it is no exaggeration to speak of real fashion. </ I>

12
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:49,053
<I> It was in France that this phenomenon was born </ i>

13
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:52,358
<I> and tram networks have been developed the most </ i>

14
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:54,990
<I> over the past two decades, </ i>

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:00,294
<I> as the graph shows you on the screen. </ I>

16
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:04,626
<I> In 1983, there was in France only three tram networks left, </ i>

17
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,554
<I> or rather three tram lines, </ i>

18
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:09,753
<I> one in Lille, one in Marseille and one in Saint-Etienne. </ I>

19
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:14,680
<I> There was in 2012, 24 operated networks. </ I>

20
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:21,537
<I> The first network to have been achieved is the Nantes network, </ i>

21
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:24,818
<I> which was commissioned in 1985. </ I>

22
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:31,919
<I> It was followed by the Grenoble network in 1987, </ i>

23
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:39,748
<I> and the modern tramway, which was developed in Île-de-France in 1992, </ i>

24
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:46,851
<I> then in 1994, the Strasbourg network was born. </ I>

25
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:53,738
<I> It was the first tram networks that have been made in France again. </ I>

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,998
<I> I'm going to do again. </ I>

27
00:01:57,093 --> 00:02:02,559
<I> The first networks have been realized are the Nantes network in 1985, </ i>

28
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:05,195
<I> which you have on the screen, </ i>

29
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:11,320
<I> followed by the Grenoble monitoring network in 1987, of which you have an illustration. </ I>

30
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:16,785
<I> Then there was the tram back in Île-de-France in 1992, </ i>

31
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:23,791
<I> then in Strasbourg in 1994, and you have here an illustration. </ I>

32
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:28,323
<I> Why such enthusiasm for the tramway? </ I>

33
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:31,227
<I> The modern tram, as rebuilt </ i>

34
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:33,788
<I> in many European cities, </ i>

35
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:36,091
<I> is part of a double movement. </ I>

36
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:40,369
<I> The one that first aims to promote the use </ i>

37
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,113
<I> of other means of transport that the car </ i>

38
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:45,521
<I> as part of everyday life, </ i>

39
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:50,293
<I> but also on the other hand, the desire to reclassify urban centers </ i>

40
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:53,614
<I> to make them more attractive to frequent, </ i>

41
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:55,698
<I> as well as live in. </ I>

42
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:59,949
<I> Thus in most urban areas </ i>

43
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:03,732
<I> where it was reintroduced, the tram was accompanied </ i>

44
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:07,689
<I> by an important urban requalification in the city center </ i>

45
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:14,126
<I> and a sharing of the road favorable to </ i>
<i> other modes of transport than the car. </ I>

46
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:18,376
<I> Research on the introduction of a tram </ i>

47
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:20,656
<I> in a public transport network, </ i>

48
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:24,948
<I> show that it allows a growing number of users. </ I>

49
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:30,135
<I> Tram Assets are indeed many for the user: </ i>

50
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:43,416
<I> a much higher speed than the bus, </ i>

51
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:49,511
<I> high frequency shift during the day, evening and weekend, </ i>

52
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:54,417
<I> a smooth ride that allows to use one's travel time </ i>

53
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:58,594
<I> to deploy activities, provided that we have a seat, </ i>

54
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:04,447
<I> usually quality foot paths to go to stops </ i>

55
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:10,042
<I> because of efforts to improve the ergonomics of the public space, </ i>

56
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:15,376
<I> and finally, easier memorizing the path of the lines </ i>

57
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:20,072
<I> due to the materialization of the tramway in the public space </ i>

58
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:22,843
<I> via the rails. </ I>

59
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,853
<I> In France, in many cities </ i>

60
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:29,327
<I> that have reintroduced trams, </ i>

61
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:33,754
<I> there is also an increase in the </ i>
<i> number of inhabitants in the city centers. </ I>

62
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:39,449
<I> On the one hand, it appears that the tram favors </ i>

63
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,605
<I> real estate investments in the city, </ i>

64
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:45,138
<I> through the redevelopment of public spaces that accompanies it, </ i>

65
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:49,068
<I> on the other hand, there is also that the tram contributes </ i>

66
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:52,656
<I> to make more desirable to live in the city </ i>

67
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:57,576
<I> because the tram limits the dependence on cars </ i>

68
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:02,187
<I> by the quality of transport service it offers to residents. </ I>

69
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:06,256
<I> The effect of the introduction of the tram </ i>

70
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:10,815
<I> on the use of public transport is however very variable. </ I>

71
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:14,752
<I> Statistics on the use of public transport </ i>

72
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:17,187
<I> update consequent differences </ i>

73
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:19,980
<I> according to the considered cities, </ i>

74
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,471
<I> and in particular, these figures show that the increase </ i>

75
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:28,688
<I> of the number of users five years after commissioning </ i>

76
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:36,948
<I> of a tram overall a network varies for France between + 18% and + 50%. </ I>

77
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:41,948
<I> This is what you see for example for a number of cities </ i>

78
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:46,044
<I> in the table you have before you. </ I>

79
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:53,448
<I> This suggests that the use of the tram is not mechanical. </ I>

80
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:56,878
<I> That is to say it is not enough to introduce a tram </ i>

81
00:05:56,878 --> 00:06:01,074
<I> that it is used, </ i>
<i> even if in all agglomerations </ i>

82
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,509
<I> in which it was introduced in France, </ i>

83
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,668
<I> there is an increase in the use of public transport. </ I>

84
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,957
<I> How can we explain these differences in the use of public transport </ i>

85
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:18,241
<I> following the commissioning of a tram? </ I>

86
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:22,529
<I> There are a number of factors related to the offer </ i>

87
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,372
<I> and the interaction of the offer with the context </ i>

88
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:30,974
<I> and the provisions of the resident population in a city </ i>

89
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,152
<I> that explains these differences. </ I>

90
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:37,007
<I> In the offer, there is first of all the commercial speed, </ i>

91
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:40,388
<I> following that it is low, 14 to 16 km / h </ i>

92
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:42,182
<I> or higher, more than 20km / h, </ i>

93
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:48,160
<I> there are differences in the use of the tram network, </ i>

94
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,389
<I> and more generally of public transport. </ I>

95
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,973
<I> There are also differences depending on the frequency </ i>

96
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:59,597
<I> if the frequencies are quite low, </ i>
<i> from 8 to 10 minutes, or high, from 3 to 5 minutes. </ I>

97
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:04,344
<I> This is also a factor which has an influence on the use. </ I>

98
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:08,731
<I> The fact that the network is unified in its quality, </ i>

99
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:12,750
<I> that is to say, we offer almost the same frequencies, the same amplitude </ i>

100
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,406
<I> sideboards the evenings and weekends throughout the network, </ i>

101
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:19,166
<I> or only on the tram network, </ i>

102
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:23,416
<I> and that therefore there would be a public transport offer of two speeds, </ i>

103
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:28,572
<I> a high-quality service on tram lines, </ i>

104
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:32,199
<I> and a lower quality of service on the bus network, </ i>

105
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,598
<I> it also has an impact on the use of public transport. </ I>

106
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:42,510
<I> Another effect that has an impact on the use of trams: </ i>

107
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,344
<I> is that the lines are saturated </ i>

108
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:47,534
<I> or do they offer the comfort of a seat, </ i>

109
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,745
<I> This allows using one's time. </ I>

110
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:53,715
<I> This is particularly the case when using </ i>

111
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:55,819
<I> public transport during off-peak hours. </ I>

112
00:07:57,007 --> 00:08:02,592
<I> Finally, the link with urban planning and urban development, </ i>

113
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:05,422
<I> the question is also to know </ i>

114
00:08:05,422 --> 00:08:07,685
<I> if the tram lines that have been developed, </ i>

115
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:15,458
<I> serve the agglomeration in which the offer was extended, </ i>

116
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,460
<I> completely or only partially. </ I>

117
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,334
<I> Or in other words: how is made the joint </ i>

118
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:27,106
<I> between the public transport system and urbanization, </ i>

119
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:32,865
<I> Can we go anywhere with public transport, </ i>

120
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:34,259
<I> or otherwise, are only </ i>

121
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:37,950
<I> some parts of the metropolitan area available? </ I>

122
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:43,270
<I> That is also a factor that plays a central role </ i>

123
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,468
<I> in the greater or lesser use of public transport, </ i>

124
00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:51,295
<I> especially when there is introduction of a tram. </ I>

125
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,759
<I> And of course, last factor that plays a role: </ i>

126
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,092
<I> the issue of reliability. </ I>

127
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,104
<I> Does generaly, schedules are respected. </ I>

128
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:08,031
You understood through the examples I've shown you,

129
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:13,000
tram networks in France were often allowed to revalue cities

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,315
and it is even often their main function.

131
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:22,043
This is the case for example in Bordeaux, a city that is often considered

132
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:24,628
<I> as exemplary of this view. </ I>

133
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:30,003
<I> A high quality in the fields </ i>
<i> which have been cited in this video </ i>

134
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:33,533
<I> makes it possible for people to deploy its lifestyle </ i>

135
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:36,180
<I> using public transport </ i>

136
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,306
<I> and it makes attractive the attendance of urban spaces, </ i>

137
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:44,818
<I> whether recreational or for habitat. </ I>

138
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:49,148
In this sense, the redeployment of tramway networks in France

139
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:54,375
as much about the planning issues that of transportation issues,

140
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,805
although of course and as I noted in this video,

141
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:02,001
there is also an interest in the field of transport

142
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,001
to develop these infrastructures

143
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:08,005
since in all the cities where these networks have been redeployed,

144
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:12,866
there is an increase in the use of public transport.
