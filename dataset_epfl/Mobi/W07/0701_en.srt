00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:07,007
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:10,226
In the first course of the previous module

3
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:13,006
we described the hardware manufacturing machinery

4
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:15,216
of tissues and public spaces

5
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,826
under the action of first level operators,

6
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:19,806
and of second and third level operators.

7
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:22,835
We agreed that each urban technical network

8
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:26,225
corresponds to a specific technology.

9
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:30,666
This is both the technology of the line and the vehicles running through it.

10
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,823
A network also corresponds to a specific manner

11
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:35,623
to take mesure of the territory.

12
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:40,581
This lesson has allowed us to highlight two major themes

13
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:42,391
urbanism networks:

14
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:45,259
the issue of sharing of public space between lines

15
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:48,349
increasingly specialized and that of the action on the nodes.

16
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:49,944
In today's course,

17
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:52,594
we will insist on the systemic effect of these questions

18
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,024
and how they arise, not only locally,

19
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,704
one where the design of public spaces to think,

20
00:00:58,704 --> 00:01:01,174
but also and simultaneously at different scales

21
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:02,694
of large territories.

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,820
We will review different approaches

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,680
of networking cities in a territory

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,680
which is dominated by the regime of metropolization

25
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:18,296
but where, despite metropolisation, countries do not disappear

26
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:20,116
under the influence of urbanization.

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,310
Secondly, we show the impact

28
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,000
of speed and scale on the way

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,310
which these figures coexist in space and simultaneously restructure

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,470
as they deconstruct reality of territories.

31
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:40,096
The physical structuring process of large territories are multiple

32
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,866
and variable in time,

33
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:44,746
as also the reasons that presided over the birth

34
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:46,266
and the development of cities.

35
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:49,906
We need history to understand the evolution

36
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:52,216
of territorial regimes in the long term.

37
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,750
But in general, we can still trace the evolution time.

38
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,920
For various reasons,

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,860
a road crossing, the occupation of shores,

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,880
control of a ford across a river,

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,310
balancing the population, that whatnot ...

42
00:02:10,305 --> 00:02:11,985
For various reasons, therefore,

43
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:15,225
agglomerations of men and activity centers are formed in a place.

44
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:22,061
Soil occupations are defined, paths are traced,

45
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:25,171
projects of any order materialize in the landscape.

46
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:29,361
The grid and the center are the two regulatory figures

47
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:32,245
of this first stage of the territorial structure

48
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:33,565
wide place.

49
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:37,185
So it's roads or paths used by men walking

50
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:39,165
or animal-drawn vehicles.

51
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:41,925
The development of mobility fits into the landscape

52
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:45,925
and contributes to the complexity of the relationship between town and country

53
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:48,165
without destroying its continuity.

54
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:53,123
Over time, the town expands, becomes a city,

55
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:56,143
starts trading relationship with other places.

56
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,523
The facilities of the local mobility

57
00:02:58,523 --> 00:03:02,523
adds that the mobility required by exchanges

58
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:03,903
at greater distances.

59
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:08,213
So far as roads and paths used by men walking

60
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:10,353
or by animal-drawn vehicles ...

61
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,360
The establishment of this communication network

62
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,570
settled by the pedestrian metric helps cohabitation

63
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,910
of network figures in the territory.

64
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,430
Yet operators can follow very different strategies:

65
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,920
the search of political centralization, military control,

66
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,270
opening of markets, that whatnot.

67
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:40,267
The logic of centralization coexist with strategies

68
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:41,767
of isotropic distribution.

69
00:03:41,978 --> 00:03:45,498
And these strategies can vary with geography

70
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:47,198
and may vary in time.

71
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:52,204
Regionalisation is a complex process always changing.

72
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:55,437
The technology package that allowed the development

73
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:58,887
of ailway then of the combustion engine

74
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:02,387
has gradually given priority to railways and road

75
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:05,297
as supporting structures of territorial development.

76
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,149
Speed technologies allow to consider it

77
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:12,019
at other scales than the scale of the room.

78
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:14,258
They help reduce the distances

79
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,828
but also contribute to fragment space.

80
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:20,155
The first train lines were mostly

81
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:24,155
drawn away from cities and were connecting them by terminus stations

82
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:27,355
who are often also the engines of the city extension

83
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:29,525
and the creation of new districts.

84
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,832
Until the advent of high-speed lines

85
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:36,352
at the end of the 19th century, it is very rare that a city rips,

86
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:37,982
as we have seen do in Brussels,

87
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:41,452
to the junction between two stations and to create a central station.

88
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:45,304
This is the industrial growth of cities

89
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:48,724
who truly created the rupture of the urban-rural relationship.

90
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:54,522
In London, Berlin, Vienna or Paris, industrial development product

91
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:57,272
the expansion of cities and the emergence of big cities.

92
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,270
In Belgium, the fear of the big city leads the young government

93
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,580
to adopt quickly a policy of urbanization

94
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,660
distributed throughout the country.

95
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:09,124
In Belgium, in 1900, the railway reached

96
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:13,124
nearly 8,000 km, not counting some 5000 km

97
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:14,974
of local railway.

98
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:18,831
It was an extremely dense network, the densest in Europe.

99
00:05:19,164 --> 00:05:23,004
There was at that time almost 33 km of national railroad or vicinal

100
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:24,814
100 kmÂ² of territory.

101
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:28,619
And trains traveling at a maximum of 90 km / hour.

102
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:32,036
Much of this network was dismantled in Belgium

103
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:34,996
when the political decision is made to give priority

104
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:39,696
to individual car mobility and develop a comprehensive network of roads

105
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:41,836
of high speed: highways.

106
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,718
The high speed technology no longer allows the same grip,

107
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:48,058
or the same interactions with the territory.

108
00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:52,276
Highways pass as the train, usually away from cities

109
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:55,606
and lead the implementation of new connection devices

110
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,476
with knots, ring roads, interchanges,

111
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:02,736
which take a long time to negotiate as long to build.

112
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:05,563
These devices generate new fractures

113
00:06:05,563 --> 00:06:07,543
in the territorial matrix

114
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:11,543
and their structuring effect in the territory is far from proven.

115
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:14,853
The development of high-speed rail

116
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:18,283
took off after the 1974 oil crisis.

117
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:21,432
Faced with energy dependence of Europe and threats

118
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:23,662
which arose in terms of mobility,

119
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:26,222
several European countries plan to develop

120
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:31,022
a new rapid transportation and little greedy in fossil energy.

121
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:35,074
The first line is made in Italy in 1977.

122
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:38,325
The following follow in France in 1981.

123
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:41,353
Germany and Spain followed in the 1990s.

124
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:45,213
The system deployed on the territory of a new configuration scale

125
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:48,863
network which is this time continental scale

126
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:52,033
and whose logic follows that of Hubs and spokes model

127
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:55,513
applied to aeronautics and that is based on a few centers

128
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:57,403
servicing burden.

129
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,100
In 2010, 33 years after the start of the high-speed operation,

130
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,400
Europe has 6214 km of high speed lines

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
on which trains can travel at over 250 km / hour.

132
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:13,373
In some countries such as France or Spain,

133
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:15,753
which have a capital located in flat areas

134
00:07:15,753 --> 00:07:17,513
and more or less in the center,

135
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:20,793
and have placed major cities to national boundaries

136
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:24,973
and were further subjected to a territorial system rather centralized,

137
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:29,213
the network is configured naturally in a star-shape,

138
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:32,393
with a corollary weakness of inter-regional links.

139
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:35,567
The route selection in these countries gives rise to a debate

140
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,777
between firstly the economic rationality:

141
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:40,667
go to market, confirm the star network;

142
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,847
and secondly land:

143
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,017
provide a comparative advantage in marginalized areas.

144
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:49,787
In Germany, where the culture of governance is decentralized,

145
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:51,897
the network is organized differently.

146
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:54,424
There is no true central node

147
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:57,434
but a net whose nodes are cities of all sizes

148
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,584
themselves backed to rural, dense regions

149
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:00,994
and highly urbanized.

150
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:05,083
In Italy on the contrary, the development of high-speed rail

151
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,073
led until today to a linear network.

152
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,249
The result of these dynamics is a complex territory,

153
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:15,889
where each new restructuring company generates

154
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,889
new specializations and new hybrids.

155
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:24,952
It follows that we can not consider the play of interactions between scales

156
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:27,022
like a set of Russian dolls,

157
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:29,502
where scales fit into each other.

158
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,774
This is what we typically did.

159
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:36,204
Today, all the territory of scales can be near in one place

160
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:42,154
and we simultaneously need to analyze the work of a local output

161
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:43,714
at different scales.

162
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,720
I propose to retain the three elements of this lesson.

163
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,520
First, a mode of transport is not structured in itself.

164
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:56,563
The European example shows, moreover, that any restructuring

165
00:08:56,563 --> 00:09:01,533
of a new online technology drives both a destructuration

166
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:04,303
and a reconfiguration of space assets

167
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:05,873
defined at other levels.

168
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:10,568
Secondly, the speed is a factor of distances resorption

169
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:14,308
but it is also a territorial fragmentation factor.

170
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:19,013
And processes of metropolization the world are only accentuating.

171
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,378
For a network to become structuring in the long term,

172
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,598
it must meet multiple conditions.

173
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:28,193
They are economic, political, social.

174
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:32,358
The third conclusion is that the potential

175
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:38,278
of structuring of a network comes from the quality of the service offer

176
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,998
but especially of the close articulation

177
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:44,998
between mobility planning and land use planning.

178
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:48,010
We have seen that the support of governments,

179
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:53,110
the mutation of the crossed areas, the strength of the property market,

180
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,780
quality of service and ownership of the service

181
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,780
by users are all engines needed for production

182
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,780
of a dynamic of restructuring that is anyway to address

183
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,900
as a phenomenon and a systemic project.

184
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:10,848
I thank you and wish you a good result of course.
