00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:07,332
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:10,352
Today's session's main purpose

3
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:12,984
is to illustrate what has been said about on a theoretical tone

4
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:14,489
in previous lessons.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,721
Through some examples, I would like to illustrate

6
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:21,600
how occurs today the search for new equilibrium solutions

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,457
between isotropic of slowness , that of high speed

8
00:00:25,457 --> 00:00:27,253
and that of the average speed

9
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:32,874
through projects both urban and metropolitan.

10
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:36,726
Firstly,

11
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:40,307
we will discuss some great scenarios of contemporary urban projects

12
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:45,170
for action sometimes on the nodes and sometimes on network lines.

13
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:48,511
We will see a family of projects

14
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:52,838
for the organization of multimodality and multifunctionality

15
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:55,730
to the nodes of the high-speed networks,

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,131
and other family projects aimed for the reconfiguration of grounds

17
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:03,782
above railway or below the expressways.

18
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:06,682
In the second phase of the lesson,

19
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:09,010
we will describe and lay a critical look

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,978
on a movement that is emerging in many cities

21
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:16,354
for what we will call a new urbanism of slowness.

22
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,846
<I> I suggest you to start the session with the image of the Algiers waterfront. </ I>

23
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:25,873
<I> It illustrates very clearly the paradigm that we see at work </ i>

24
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:28,638
<I> in many contemporary urban projects. </ I>

25
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:34,186
<I> You will see a large urban composition giving its image to the city, </ i>

26
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,679
<I> at the same time providing an elegant solution </ i>

27
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:40,180
<I> on the relationship between the harbor and the ground of the city. </ I>

28
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:44,933
<I> The project manufactures both the harbor and its enclosure, </ i>

29
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:49,144
<I> while it reconfigures the bottom of the old town, the casba. </ I>

30
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:52,915
<I> This aerial photo of the Montparnasse station in Paris </ i>

31
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:56,420
<I> is a representative example of the old railway stations </ i>

32
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,816
<I> of which we explained the organizing principle </ i>

33
00:01:58,816 --> 00:01:59,991
<I> in the previous course. </ I>

34
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:03,960
<I> That is to say, a station designed as an online terminal, </ i>

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,808
<I> of a mono-functional line and clearly individualized </ i>

36
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:11,520
<I> compared to other communication networks. </ I>

37
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:16,805
<I> And as a train station, which is only one direction of communication. </ I>

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,052
<I> The major railway stations of today are no longer the last stop. </ I>

39
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:24,431
<I> They have become multifunctionsl </ i>
<i> nodes much more complex </ i>

40
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:28,077
<I> where intersect a wide variety of modes and movement scales. </ I>

41
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:32,800
<I> The complex Euralille, in France, is a founding reference, </ i>

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,111
<I> of a very large family of urban projects </ i>

43
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:38,264
<I> which is the reorganization of intermodal connections, </ i>

44
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:41,543
<I> with on one hand the proliferation of soils in the city, </ i>

45
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,506
<I> in interconnected layers </ i>

46
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:46,657
<I> and secondly, by creating an image around </ i>

47
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:48,537
<I> a major urban artifact </ i>

48
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:51,237
<I> mobilized as motor of metropolitan development. </ I>

49
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:56,574
<I> In Lille, the operation was an opportunity to upgrade a dormant site </ i>

50
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:59,213
<I> crossed by multiple infrastructures </ i>

51
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:03,030
<I> and to connect the city to the European network of high speed </ i>

52
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,433
<I> in a strategic node of intersections between Paris, Brussels and London. </ I>

53
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:13,045
<I> This view shot of the new configuration of the station Paris-Nord </ i>

54
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:16,005
<I> gives another example of this type of projects. </ I>

55
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:19,741
<I> It shows how multiple floors town </ i>

56
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,194
<I> is now a picture of urban density. </ I>

57
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,973
<I> In such projects, </ i>

58
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:28,241
<I> we see that the railway station is only one component among others, </ i>

59
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,501
<I> thereby creating a urban intensity, </ i>

60
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:35,538
<I> it is a programmatic formula that combines both </ i>

61
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:39,674
<I> layering and interconnection between </ i>
<i> the different layers of infrastructure, </ i>

62
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:42,953
<I> the concentration of programs and uses, </ i>

63
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:45,286
<I> and the quality of public space. </ I>

64
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,473
<I> Getting off underground also leaves still open </ i>

65
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:50,413
<I> the issue of the underground city </ i>

66
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:53,306
<I> and its relationship with public spaces surface. </ I>

67
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,581
<I> The new Antwerp Central Station </ i>

68
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:00,530
<I> shows a third example of this family of projects </ i>

69
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,217
<I> organized not anymore on a logical line, </ i>

70
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:06,217
<I> but on a logic of intermodality </ i>

71
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:09,606
<I> and where the station is no longer the terminus or the relay point of a line </ i>

72
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:12,105
<I> but a connector between soil, </ i>

73
00:04:12,105 --> 00:04:14,786
<I> of speeds and multiple scales of influence. </ I>

74
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:17,650
<I> In Antwerp, we dug under the city </ i>

75
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,109
<I> and under the monument of the old station </ i>

76
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:22,298
<I> for the passage of the TGV </ i>

77
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:25,515
<I> and contributing to the reinforcement of the great European speed. </ I>

78
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:29,817
<I> But you can also go in trains and local buses, </ i>

79
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:33,164
<I> coming to the station on foot, by tram or car, </ i>

80
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:36,099
<I> leave your car at the parking lot or go kiss and ride </ i>

81
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,968
<I> and even come to the station with no intention to take a train </ i>

82
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:41,224
<I> but with just the idea of ​​shopping. </ I>

83
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,067
<I> A second family of large urban projects </ i>

84
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:48,472
<I> is the reconfiguration of automotive mobility infrastructure systems. </ I>

85
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:53,035
<I> The aim here is to recreate continuity of tissues [inaudible] </ i>

86
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:57,131
<I> and enhance the rights to build on or around the plate of the way. </ I>

87
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:59,609
<I> It is again assuming </ i>

88
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:03,248
<I>that the multiplication of the city's soil appears both as the means </ i>

89
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:06,275
<I> to meet the requirements of the different movement speeds </ i>

90
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:08,900
<I> and as an opportunity to create </ i>

91
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,763
<I> a multiscale and metropolitan business line. </ I>

92
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:14,616
<I> At Boston, the burial of an expressway </ i>

93
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:17,815
<I> that was built as a viaduct in the 60 </ i>

94
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:21,963
<I> was the engine of a connection between the two parts of the city center </ i>

95
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:25,312
<I> and also the beginning of a major urban regeneration </ i>

96
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:28,536
<I> around a park created on the base of the old highway. </ I>

97
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:30,552
<I> This is one example among others. </ I>

98
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:33,487
<I> But it reflects dramatically </ i>

99
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:37,672
<I> the inversion paradigm at work in many contemporary projects. </ I>

100
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,508
<I> Then, in the second half of the 20th century, </ i>

101
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,487
<I> we saw many cities recompose their public spaces </ i>

102
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:46,084
<I> to suit the automotive requirements, </ i>

103
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:49,155
<I> Today we are witnessing the opposite phenomenon. </ I>

104
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:54,172
<I> We bury the car to upgrade the public space, green and walkable. </ I>

105
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:56,716
<I> First, it is a sign that public cultures of action </ i>

106
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:58,243
<I> are changing </ i>

107
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:01,192
<I> and the injunctions of sustainable development, </ i>

108
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:04,400
<I> we now hear for over 30 years, make their effect. </ I>

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,868
<I> And secondly, it is also a sign that the compact city, </ i>

110
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:11,048
<I> major operations, the green in </ i>
<i> the city and the quality of public space, </ i>

111
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:14,143
<I> are actually powerful economic values ​​</ i>

112
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:16,124
<I> and that in the current context, </ i>

113
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:19,487
<I> they attract both public operators and the private market. </ I>

114
00:06:20,073 --> 00:06:24,084
<I> In this perspective, I would like to quickly draw your attention </ i>

115
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,532
<I> on a third family of urban action </ i>

116
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:30,095
<I> this time concerning the reconfiguration of the soil </ i>

117
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:32,760
<I> but on old railways. </ I>

118
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,233
<I> This is for example the case of the High Line to the west of the island of Manhattan, </ i>

119
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,433
<I> in New York </ i>

120
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:41,358
<I> where a former railway viaduct, which was created </ i>

121
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:45,626
<I> to clutter the city freight trains which served the harbor, </ i>

122
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:48,954
<I> were recently recycled into a landscaped promenade </ i>

123
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,743
<I> that attracts tourists from around the world. </ I>

124
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:54,990
<I> As in the previous case, we intervened on a line </ i>

125
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,569
<I> once a suitable mode of transport </ i>

126
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:01,750
<I> to write down a public space for walking and slowness. </ I>

127
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:07,163
<I> The urban public space and the city make up for in quality and diversity. </ I>

128
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:10,999
<I> And the High Line is surely a pleasant and attractive place for tourists. </ I>

129
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,346
<I> But we may have to keep a critical mind </ i>

130
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:17,813
<I> vis-à-vis the physical and social restructuring process </ i>

131
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,702
<I> that accompanies the project throughout the district. </ I>

132
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:23,906
<I> In fact, this is an example that clearly shows </ i>

133
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:26,105
<I> how the term of nature in the city </ i>

134
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:30,005
<I> and the quality of public space and walking </ i>

135
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:33,326
<I> can be suitable both as an argument to a militant speech </ i>

136
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:37,827
<I> for car mobility, but also as an urban marketing argument. </ I>

137
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:41,478
<I> Even in its most ecological variations, </ i>

138
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:46,402
<I> the relationship between mobility and urbanism is </ i>
<i> always more complex than it seems. </ I>

139
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:49,638
<I> In the 20th century, urban space was governed </ i>

140
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:52,488
<I> with the paradigm of speed and car mobility. </ I>

141
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:55,397
<I> We see that a new culture is emerging today, </ i>

142
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:59,773
<I> more diverse, plural, more conscious of the environment, </ i>

143
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:03,717
<I> better technologically armed and actually calling into question </ i>

144
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:07,437
<I> the old balance of power in favor of multimodality. </ I>

145
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:10,714
<I> Everywhere we see connectors slow slotting </ i>

146
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:13,103
<I> in the gaps left between the lines </ i>

147
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,043
<I> or in the edge of the infrastructure of speed. </ I>

148
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:19,199
<I> Their development is such that we can really consider </ i>

<I> this slow network as a territorial subsystem itself, </ i>

<I> non-market exchange, cooperation or telecommuting. </ I>

155
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:47,059
<I> I would like to emphasize that this urban planning of slowness </ i>

156
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,839
<I> is not to be taken as a waiver of speed. </ I>

157
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,447
<I> In this respect also, it is not free </ i>
<i> of contradictions. </ I>

158
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:56,512
<I> In Belgium, for example, there is a very sensible move </ i>

159
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:59,511
<I> for cycling and cycle highways. </ I>

160
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:05,035
<I> The need for such highways, such bicycle routes </ i>

161
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:07,225
<I> is especially felt in a structure </ i>

162
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:08,871
<I> polycentric urban, </ i>

163
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:13,127
<I> if we want to create alternatives to the car, we must find ways </ i>

164
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:16,029
<I> to encourage commuters and schoolchildren </ i>

165
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:19,275
<I> to overcome the apprehensions regarding cycling </ i>

166
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:22,463
<I> for paths between 5 and 20 km. </ I>

167
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,675
<I> At this scale, the lanes, flat, </ i>

168
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:29,792
<I> with adequate services, and where one can drive fast, </ i>

169
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:32,879
<I> are responses to insecurity, fatigue or discomfort </ i>

170
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,580
<I> felt by users of the bike. </ I>

171
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,264
<I> Here's an example from Brussels, which returns relatively speaking </ i>

172
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:41,567
<I> in case of the High Line in New York. </ I>

173
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,792
<I> Again, a walk was arranged </ i>

174
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,788
<I> on an ancient way of disused railway. </ I>

175
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:49,235
<I> Connected to a multimodal core delta, </ i>

176
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:52,340
<I> it strengthens structurally slow mobility network, </ i>

177
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,975
<I> and supports a mutation of the highway into an urban boulevard. </ I>

178
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,855
<I> A bridge of 60 meters long </ i>

179
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:01,360
<I> put on round wooden stakes to eight meters above the floor </ i>

180
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,767
<I> affirms the new line in the landscape. </ I>

181
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:07,132
<I> The project modifies the template from the highway into town, </ i>

182
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:10,571
<I> and replaces the motorway by the vocabulary of public space, </ i>

183
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:13,567
<I> thus contributing to the reversal of the balance of power </ i>

184
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,663
<I> between the automobile metric and the pedestrian metric. </ I>

185
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:21,491
<I> The planning of the slowness is not to be taken as a rejection of the speed </ i>

186
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:23,828
<I> but I would also like to emphasize </ i>

187
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:26,971
<I> it is not to be seen as a refusal of technology. </ I>

188
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,559
<I> In Toledo, Spain, one can see for example </ i>

189
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,711
<I> a new transmission line by pedestrian escalator </ i>

190
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:35,796
<I> that was created to connect a parking for 400 cars </ i>

191
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:37,348
<I> placed at the bottom of the city </ i>

192
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:39,763
<I> and to allow to connect it to the upper town </ i>

193
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:43,620
<I> and release it from cars and make it more accessible to pedestrians. </ I>

194
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:46,129
<I> Access to stairs is through a passage </ i>

195
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,204
<I> under the foundations of the medieval wall </ i>

196
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:51,747
<I> which is thus becoming a new city gate. </ I>

197
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,604
<I> The planning of the slow pace also leaves open </ i>

198
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:58,092
<I> the question of sharing or specialization of public space. </ I>

199
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,217
<I> In Copenhagen, capital of Denmark, </ i>

200
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:02,656
<I> you can see a cycle point developed in two-way </ i>

201
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:05,796
<I> to 230 meters long, set broadly enough </ i>

202
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:07,712
<I> to host cargo bikes, </ i>

203
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:10,604
<I> and is in-plant on a very intense commercial zone </ i>

204
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,220
<I> and which hosts many pedestrians. </ I>

205
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:14,604
<I> The bridge separates the stream </ i>

206
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:17,179
<I> and make the traffic flow for all. </ I>

207
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:21,280
<I> The reversal of power between the car and the bike </ i>

208
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,180
<I> is more evident in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, </ i>

209
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,736
<I> where a monumental cycle air roundabout </ i>

210
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:31,117
<I> of 702 meters of diameter suspended in a tower of 700 meters high </ i>

211
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:34,353
<I> marks the entrance of the cities of Eindhoven and Meerhoven </ i>.

212
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:37,517
<I> It provides a solution both symbolic and functional </ i>

213
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:41,584
<I> on the difficult issue of the crossing of cars and bicycle streams </ i>

214
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,476
<I> on the passage of an important crossroads. </ I>

215
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:47,104
The small set of examples that we have just seen

216
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:50,036
and all case studies that have been proposed to you

217
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,836
throughout the course show that the joint

218
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,908
between the organization of mobility

219
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:57,380
and the manufacture of territories and city

220
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,533
is the collective action of a complex process, multi-scale and multi-player.

221
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:06,444
For my part, I have contributed only to highlight

222
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:08,404
most material dimension,

223
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:09,693
but throughout the course,

224
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,497
you may have noticed that this material component of the action

225
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:17,249
is closely dependent on the political, economic,

226
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,242
social and environmental components.

227
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:21,169
The process is complex

228
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:24,437
but we have also shown through the examples

229
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:27,722
that the joint prosecution of material production

230
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:30,026
between the spaces of the movement and the territory

231
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:33,778
is actually focused on two main issues:

232
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,798
action on the nodes and action on the lines.

233
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,637
For the rest, I hope we have convinced you a little

234
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,905
of the need to deepen the hypothesis

235
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:45,949
we tried to pass

236
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:48,697
and that values ​​research multimodality

237
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:50,645
and the quality of public space

238
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:54,225
as a way to live more humanely and with pleasure

239
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:57,294
the travel time into our territory with multiple speeds.

240
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:00,397
Thank you for your attention.
