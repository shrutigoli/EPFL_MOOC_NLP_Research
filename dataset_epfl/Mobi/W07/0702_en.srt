00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:06,494
Hello,

2
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:08,575
my name is Gordana Micic.

3
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,551
I am an engineer-architect

4
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:14,827
and researcher at the Catholic University of Louvain

5
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:20,436
and I will present the case of multimodal Schuman hub in Brussels.

6
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:22,123
Brussels,

7
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:25,383
a region made up of 19 municipalities,

8
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:27,828
is the capital of Belgium.

9
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:31,289
Belgium is a country made up of three regions:

10
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,219
the Flemish region, the Walloon region

11
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:37,659
and the Brussels Capital Region.

12
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,481
Being located in the central part of the country, and at the same time,

13
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:45,281
entirely in the Flemish region,

14
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:47,141
Brussels-Capital Region

15
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:49,632
proves to be an important point of articulation

16
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:54,932
of the rail network, and this both nationally and internationally.

17
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:57,320
As you can see,

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,490
this network, spider-shaped,

19
00:00:59,742 --> 00:01:02,392
is connecting the most important cities of the country,

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,230
and among others, the city of Luxembourg.

21
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:08,760
These lines are reinforced today

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,746
by high speed lines

23
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:15,135
which provide the link between France, Britain,

24
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:17,295
Germany and the Netherlands.

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,040
mainly through the junction of central Brussels

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,116
which is subjected to a terminating resistance constantly increasing,

27
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:27,227
as shown in this diagram,

28
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:31,109
it is essential to look for other opportunities passage

29
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:33,699
that would make the train avoid the said junction.

30
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:35,645
The project <i> Diabolo </ i>

31
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,620
commissioned in 2012 by SNCB and Infrabel,

32
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:43,410
is used to connect the national airport

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,270
directly to the major Belgian and international rail routes.

34
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:52,499
Therefore, a service between LiÃ¨ge and Germany on the one hand,

35
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:55,844
and Antwerp and the Netherlands on the other hand,

36
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:59,914
is possible without having to go through the center of Brussels.

37
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,747
The diagnosis of the project <i> Diabolo </ i>

38
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,296
demonstrated the justification of the realization

39
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:11,276
Schuman-Josaphat tunnel, shown here in red,

40
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:14,517
between the lines 161 and 26,

41
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:19,125
which was put into circulation in December 2014.

42
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:25,028
This tunnel has to link the cities of Namur-Luxembourg

43
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:29,503
and the Netherlands via Brussels-National.

44
00:02:29,823 --> 00:02:35,613
It is expected that several lines of the future RER regional express network

45
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,304
will stop at Brussels-Schuman station

46
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:41,012
which will continue to welcome the passage

47
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:42,798
of regular trains.

48
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:44,413
For the new tunnel,

49
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:48,889
the European district will be available by 12-15 minutes of train

50
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:54,519
from the domestic airport, instead of 25-30 minutes before.

51
00:02:55,064 --> 00:03:01,154
Therefore, this multimodal center, supported by the subway system,

52
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:04,614
and with easy connections with the bus,

53
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:07,506
is the main subject of this paper.

54
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,265
Meanwhile, a blueprint,

55
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:15,074
conducted under the direction of Marie-Laure Roggemans in 2008

56
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:20,154
confirmed the importance of achieving a multimodal Schuman hub

57
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:22,964
part of which is nearing completion.

58
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:24,422
It is important to underline

59
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:29,422
this blueprint was based on a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding

60
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:33,869
concluded between the Federal State and the Brussels-Capital Region:

61
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:38,809
the municipality of the city of Brussels and the municipalities of Etterbeek and Ixelles

62
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:40,179
signed in 2006.

63
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,510
This vast urban master plan includes 12 programs,

64
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:48,513
two of particular interest to us here:

65
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:53,735
the Schuman multimodal station and the redevelopment of the Schuman roundabout.

66
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,373
As you see here,

67
00:03:56,586 --> 00:04:00,686
the Schuman multimodal hub is presented by the white square,

68
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:04,036
which will serve as a frame of observation.

69
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:08,927
Aerial view of our square gives us a view of the situation on the ground.

70
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:11,237
As you can see,

71
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,949
the Schuman roundabout is the central point

72
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,429
of Robert Schuman place.

73
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:22,070
Indeed, the red color represents the main transit of cars

74
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,573
entering the city of Liege on one side,

75
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:27,523
coming to Brussels by the Cortenbergh Avenue,

76
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,515
crossing the Schuman roundabout and head downtown

77
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:34,395
through the rue de la Loi.

78
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,941
Another transit entering the side of Namur

79
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,429
via the central tunnel under the roundabout

80
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:46,529
also joined the rue de la Loi, towards the city center.

81
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,931
Meanwhile, several bus lines,

82
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:54,011
public transport here in pink, are circulating,

83
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,852
ensuring the liaison between Place Schuman

84
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:58,939
and other areas of the city.

85
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:05,419
In addition, the bike path of a bike RER, represented by the color yellow,

86
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:08,025
through the same roundabout,

87
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:12,105
ensuring active accessibility to the city center.

88
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,905
But what happens in the basement?

89
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:17,854
The Schuman train and metro station Schuman

90
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:23,528
that you see in orange-yellow, because entirely underground,

91
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:26,962
have just been transformed into depth

92
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:29,756
to accommodate a railroad stop

93
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:31,056
in the new section

94
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:35,306
connecting the lines 161 and 26,

95
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:37,566
here in pale pink.

96
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:42,348
The old line 26 leading to the North Station

97
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:46,088
and the city center, is shown in purple.

98
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,498
In fact, originally,

99
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:51,778
Schuman metro station of the East-West axis

100
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,988
was connected to the Schuman station in 1969.

101
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,469
Metro docks have a length of 300 m,

102
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,670
to facilitate access to the station,

103
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:06,424
one of the two guest rooms

104
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:10,124
is shared between the metro and railway.

105
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:13,452
Today, this initial configuration

106
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,348
completely transformed

107
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:17,608
by the new inter-modal project

108
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:21,332
whose main objective is to move the center of gravity

109
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:25,996
from the automotive use to the public transport,

110
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:30,156
which in this case requires an inter-connection building

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,266
between three means of transportation:

112
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,346
train, subway and bus on the surface.

113
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:38,351
Here interlocks a loop of road networks

114
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:41,601
located directly on the Schuman roundabout.

115
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,516
The outgoing transit traffic from the city center,

116
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:48,564
here in light green color,

117
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:52,498
from Rue Belliard, located further south,

118
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:56,728
takes up the avenue Cortenbergh via a tunnel.

119
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:00,741
On the other side, as already announced earlier,

120
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:06,028
transit traffic entering the side of Namur borrows the central tunnel

121
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:08,748
towards the city center and the small ring,

122
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:11,541
here in dark green color.

123
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,560
Each time, the access to underground car parks are associated with it.

124
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:20,287
So if we superimpose all these flows,

125
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:23,483
it is obvious that the Schuman roundabout

126
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,484
is a rather complex exchange point.

127
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,486
The situation is more clearly visible

128
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:32,266
in the longitudinal section through the station.

129
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,430
This subway station is located at -2 level,

130
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:42,221
then, at -1, the two existing train lines and the new section.

131
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:47,032
The road tunnel goes through the space of the metro station

132
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:52,444
whose difference in height from the road inspired

133
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:55,924
the consultancy Van Campenhout in charge of the project,

134
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,771
to incorporate skylights to take advantage of daylight

135
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,731
in the subway station.

136
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:06,016
The introduction of natural light,

137
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:10,280
combined with the full opening of the interior space of the station

138
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,440
between the two rooms wickets,

139
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:17,372
allowed users to feel in direct contact with the road in life,

140
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,975
and at the same time, to have the feeling of closeness.

141
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,589
Similarly, the issue of accessibility

142
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,609
for all users has been particularly studied.

143
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:33,139
Many elevators for people with reduced mobility,

144
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,081
the effectiveness of which, for now, can not yet be assessed,

145
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:40,151
are being installed.

146
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:44,274
Namely, that the construction of the large pavilion,

147
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,778
that you see here in purple,

148
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:52,338
was conditioned by the question of its integration in the future project

149
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:57,574
of the place Schuman, which was to be executed later.

150
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:01,344
Here is a diagram of the project stakeholders.

151
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:05,954
It is funded primarily by the state, represented by Beliris,

152
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,514
and partly by Infrabel and the Brussels-Capital Region.

153
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:13,714
The owner will be the region

154
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:16,924
of Brussels, Infrabel and B-Holding.

155
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,051
The use of space is part of the inter-municipal transport company

156
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:29,421
of Brussels: STIB, SNCB, Infrabel and also B-Holding.

157
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:32,930
Between the owners and operators,

158
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,590
specific agreements are established,

159
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:39,142
specifying the obligations of each party.

160
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:41,302
To appreciate the difference

161
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:43,522
between before and after the work,

162
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:47,031
here are some pictures of the situation pre-work.

163
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:50,525
Here, we see the same roundabout,

164
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:54,135
with the incoming strip to the city center,

165
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:58,888
the tunnel of the band entering the side of Namur towards the city center,

166
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:03,252
and a local lanes.

167
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,500
The following is the closer view

168
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,689
then the perspective view to the fiftieth anniversary,

169
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:14,173
then seeing the same Schuman place

170
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:17,323
to the street of the Law and the city center,

171
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:22,532
and finally, the view of the dock level of the subway station before work.

172
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:27,263
This major project is about to be completed.

173
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:29,804
Here are some pictures of the project

174
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:32,466
and station-station as planned

175
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,466
and in their current state.

176
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:39,173
The project's first picture shows the new skylights

177
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,958
that allowed to introduce daylight

178
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,418
in the subway station, as we saw earlier.

179
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:49,506
Then the following picture shows the flag

180
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:52,586
of the station-station and its integration,

181
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:56,672
as originally planned by the project but not yet built,

182
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:59,903
or perhaps not at all built.

183
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:04,473
The following shows the space of today's Metro.

184
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:06,892
The railway bridge

185
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:10,812
animates and traverses this space by taking the place of a spectator.

186
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,537
The train already goes through.

187
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:18,062
Pictures on the right concern the two train stops, in itself.

188
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:23,153
The first belongs to the line 161, toward the city center

189
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:24,822
and the rest of Brussels,

190
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:28,623
and the second to the new Schuman-Josaphat section.

191
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,390
After observing the problems of the multimodal Schuman pole,

192
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:39,298
we will explore the development of the public space of the Place Schuman.

193
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:43,795
Now if we go back to the base plan

194
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:47,215
the master plan of the European district,

195
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:49,741
we observed before

196
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:54,171
that the entering automobile traffic borrows the Avenue Cortenbergh

197
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:59,235
around the Schuman roundabout to engage in the rue de la Loi

198
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:00,833
towards the city center.

199
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:05,554
This heavy traffic creates true urban barriers

200
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:07,714
for pedestrian traffic.

201
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,068
To enable the development of a quality public space,

202
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,766
the blueprint for the European neighborhood

203
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,245
calls for traffic tunneling

204
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:20,135
road transit of Cortenbergh Avenue,

205
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:25,286
closing the Schuman roundabout to transit traffic

206
00:12:25,768 --> 00:12:30,368
and then the construction of a tunnel under the rue de la Loi.

207
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:32,991
On the side of the rue de la Loi,

208
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:36,537
given the limited space and limited in area

209
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,050
the blueprint advocated the use of the basement,

210
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:45,104
currently occupied by parking cars,

211
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:47,044
indicated by the color orange,

212
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:50,877
while maintaining the roads for local traffic,

213
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:53,347
this time, in both directions.

214
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:58,677
A competition law urban project was launched in 2008,

215
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:03,217
the winner of which is the Atelier Christian de Portzamparc.

216
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:07,786
This project, which provides a complete restructuring of the neighborhood Act

217
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,317
is oriented towards integration

218
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:12,967
of a large mixing area utilization.

219
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:18,567
It includes an increase in office space of 240,000 mÂ²

220
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,901
and housing up to 110 000 sq.m.

221
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:27,041
while developing shops and local facilities.

222
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,944
The regional planning regulations zoned

223
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:32,843
provides passage through an open street,

224
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:35,693
by reducing the number of traffic lanes,

225
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:40,630
the creation of inter-neighborhood pedestrian crossings via the ground floor

226
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,170
shops and other amenities,

227
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,250
and the creation of pocket parks.

228
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,690
This project allows for green lawns,

229
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:51,647
gardens, shops

230
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:54,257
and a favored circulation for pedestrians.

231
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:59,095
However, a friendly rue de la Loi already has twice a bridge,

232
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:03,729
but without actually gained space in favor of pedestrians in the section

233
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:06,309
regarding the existing alignment.

234
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:10,231
The realization of this project is planned gradually.

235
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,795
Today, only the reduction of a lane for cars

236
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:17,925
and the construction of a bike path instead, has been made.

237
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,240
Meanwhile, what is happening at the Schuman roundabout,

238
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,560
directly affected by these proposed changes?

239
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,760
Indeed, being mainly a road infrastructure,

240
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,580
the change in mobility seen in the Loi district

241
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:38,165
allows the development of urban space instead of Schuman.

242
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:42,026
A redevelopment competition of the Schuman place

243
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:47,176
was launched in November 2009 by Beliris whose winner

244
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:50,781
is the architectural firm Xaveer of Geyter.

245
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:52,411
This bold project

246
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:57,531
which consists of a redevelopment of the site and its surroundings,

247
00:14:58,051 --> 00:15:01,931
is carried by the idea of ââcreating a true agora

248
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:04,861
which takes the form of an amphitheater.

249
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,110
It incorporates the perspective view to the fiftieth anniversary,

250
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:11,288
dear to Brussels.

251
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:14,213
The symbolic power of the unification of Europe

252
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,963
is underlined by the circular shape

253
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:20,155
which can host events

254
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
and demonstrations.

255
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:25,013
While remaining in simplicity,

256
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:28,340
this original project, with a strong identity,

257
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,090
organizes space to pedestrian scale

258
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:35,327
while strengthening the urban center of the Place Schuman.

259
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,717
Here are some pictures

260
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,787
that of Europe gathering place.

261
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:43,592
But what about the suppression

262
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:46,632
of transit traffic on the Schuman roundabout?

263
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:51,868
For the record, incoming traffic borrows Avenue Cortenbergh

264
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,609
around the Schuman roundabout to join the rue de la Loi

265
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,059
and the city center.

266
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,498
The counting done by the Office of Stratec studies in 2009,

267
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:04,528
between 7 am and 8 am,

268
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:09,385
indicates the passage from 1890 vehicles

269
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:16,777
on the roundabout, the flow of cars entering arrives

270
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:19,447
by the side of the Cortenbergh Avenue.

271
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:22,749
Providing a comprehensive mobility plan

272
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,442
demonstrates that it is possible to gradually reduce

273
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,542
this traffic density

274
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:31,143
to only 100 vehicles by a deviation

275
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:34,787
pf transit traffic that should also be accompanied

276
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:39,647
by other mobility planning measures more generally.

277
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:44,412
The solution is moving the traffic

278
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:48,032
transit of the avenue Cortenbergh's tunnel.

279
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:52,894
Indeed, it will use the space of the technical vacuum

280
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:57,484
between the existing tunnel of outgoing traffic from downtown

281
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,987
and the new railway tunnel Schuman-Josaphat.

282
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:05,755
It should be connected to the central tunnel by the Montgomery incoming side,

283
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,364
from Namur towards the city center.

284
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,510
This operation will enable the removal

285
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,329
of transit traffic through the Schuman roundabout.

286
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,099
Decided in 2009 by the government,

287
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:21,311
This project was to be financed jointly

288
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:24,531
by the Brussels-Capital region and Beliris.

289
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,667
However, since then,

290
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,830
the budget reserve of Beliris

291
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,563
provided for the construction of the tunnel,

292
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:34,723
as well as the Loi urban project

293
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,654
has been assigned to other projects.

294
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:41,504
For its part, the Brussels-Capital Region

295
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:45,424
can not afford to bear alone the work.

296
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:50,742
You should know that the realization of this tunnel conditions the realization

297
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:52,542
of the Schuman project

298
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:56,346
that other complexities began to arise,

299
00:17:56,585 --> 00:18:00,217
making it an even more complex borne by the architect,

300
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:02,797
in a non-scheduled manner initially,

301
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:06,674
and that in the meantime the political priorities of the moment

302
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:10,056
were diverted to other projects in the city.

303
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:15,450
So Beliris was forced to cancel the project.

304
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,820
So today, the suspense surrounding the planning of the Schuman roundabout,

305
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:24,592
and the European quarter, continues.

306
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:29,192
Indeed, it must be admitted that large urban projects

307
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,468
and of mobility mobilize large numbers

308
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:34,508
pf actors on the urban scene.

309
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:40,154
Moreover, the implementation of these projects, often very complex,

310
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:44,624
and dependent on a multiplicity of other urban systems factors,

311
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:47,494
is part of a long duration.

312
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:52,656
With time, other needs of the city may arise,

313
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:56,484
which can influence the political elites,

314
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:58,863
to review their priorities

315
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:02,950
and to modify or abandon certain projects

316
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,440
as they were imagined at the start,

317
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:08,610
which indeed happened here,

318
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,030
for the multimodal Schuman pole.
