Hello everyone.
Today's session's main purpose is to illustrate what has been said about on a theoretical tone in previous lessons.
Through some examples, I would like to illustrate how occurs today the search for new equilibrium solutions between isotropic of slowness , that of high speed and that of the average speed through projects both urban and metropolitan.
Firstly, we will discuss some great scenarios of contemporary urban projects for action sometimes on the nodes and sometimes on network lines.
We will see a family of projects for the organization of multimodality and multifunctionality to the nodes of the high-speed networks, and other family projects aimed for the reconfiguration of grounds above railway or below the expressways.
In the second phase of the lesson, we will describe and lay a critical look on a movement that is emerging in many cities for what we will call a new urbanism of slowness.
<I> I suggest you to start the session with the image of the Algiers waterfront. </ I>
<I> It illustrates very clearly the paradigm that we see at work </ i>
<I> in many contemporary urban projects. </ I>
<I> You will see a large urban composition giving its image to the city, </ i>
<I> at the same time providing an elegant solution </ i>
<I> on the relationship between the harbor and the ground of the city. </ I>
<I> The project manufactures both the harbor and its enclosure, </ i>
<I> while it reconfigures the bottom of the old town, the casba. </ I>
<I> This aerial photo of the Montparnasse station in Paris </ i>
<I> is a representative example of the old railway stations </ i>
<I> of which we explained the organizing principle </ i>
<I> in the previous course. </ I>
<I> That is to say, a station designed as an online terminal, </ i>
<I> of a mono-functional line and clearly individualized </ i>
<I> compared to other communication networks. </ I>
<I> And as a train station, which is only one direction of communication. </ I>
<I> The major railway stations of today are no longer the last stop. </ I>
<I> They have become multifunctionsl </ i>
<i> nodes much more complex </ i>
<I> where intersect a wide variety of modes and movement scales. </ I>
<I> The complex Euralille, in France, is a founding reference, </ i>
<I> of a very large family of urban projects </ i>
<I> which is the reorganization of intermodal connections, </ i>
<I> with on one hand the proliferation of soils in the city, </ i>
<I> in interconnected layers </ i>
<I> and secondly, by creating an image around </ i>
<I> a major urban artifact </ i>
<I> mobilized as motor of metropolitan development. </ I>
<I> In Lille, the operation was an opportunity to upgrade a dormant site </ i>
<I> crossed by multiple infrastructures </ i>
<I> and to connect the city to the European network of high speed </ i>
<I> in a strategic node of intersections between Paris, Brussels and London. </ I>
<I> This view shot of the new configuration of the station Paris-Nord </ i>
<I> gives another example of this type of projects. </ I>
<I> It shows how multiple floors town </ i>
<I> is now a picture of urban density. </ I>
<I> In such projects, </ i>
<I> we see that the railway station is only one component among others, </ i>
<I> thereby creating a urban intensity, </ i>
<I> it is a programmatic formula that combines both </ i>
<I> layering and interconnection between </ i>
<i> the different layers of infrastructure, </ i>
<I> the concentration of programs and uses, </ i>
<I> and the quality of public space. </ I>
<I> Getting off underground also leaves still open </ i>
<I> the issue of the underground city </ i>
<I> and its relationship with public spaces surface. </ I>
<I> The new Antwerp Central Station </ i>
<I> shows a third example of this family of projects </ i>
<I> organized not anymore on a logical line, </ i>
<I> but on a logic of intermodality </ i>
<I> and where the station is no longer the terminus or the relay point of a line </ i>
<I> but a connector between soil, </ i>
<I> of speeds and multiple scales of influence. </ I>
<I> In Antwerp, we dug under the city </ i>
<I> and under the monument of the old station </ i>
<I> for the passage of the TGV </ i>
<I> and contributing to the reinforcement of the great European speed. </ I>
<I> But you can also go in trains and local buses, </ i>
<I> coming to the station on foot, by tram or car, </ i>
<I> leave your car at the parking lot or go kiss and ride </ i>
<I> and even come to the station with no intention to take a train </ i>
<I> but with just the idea of â€‹â€‹shopping. </ I>
<I> A second family of large urban projects </ i>
<I> is the reconfiguration of automotive mobility infrastructure systems. </ I>
<I> The aim here is to recreate continuity of tissues [inaudible] </ i>
<I> and enhance the rights to build on or around the plate of the way. </ I>
<I> It is again assuming </ i>
<I>that the multiplication of the city's soil appears both as the means </ i>
<I> to meet the requirements of the different movement speeds </ i>
<I> and as an opportunity to create </ i>
<I> a multiscale and metropolitan business line. </ I>
<I> At Boston, the burial of an expressway </ i>
<I> that was built as a viaduct in the 60 </ i>
<I> was the engine of a connection between the two parts of the city center </ i>
<I> and also the beginning of a major urban regeneration </ i>
<I> around a park created on the base of the old highway. </ I>
<I> This is one example among others. </ I>
<I> But it reflects dramatically </ i>
<I> the inversion paradigm at work in many contemporary projects. </ I>
<I> Then, in the second half of the 20th century, </ i>
<I> we saw many cities recompose their public spaces </ i>
<I> to suit the automotive requirements, </ i>
<I> Today we are witnessing the opposite phenomenon. </ I>
<I> We bury the car to upgrade the public space, green and walkable. </ I>
<I> First, it is a sign that public cultures of action </ i>
<I> are changing </ i>
<I> and the injunctions of sustainable development, </ i>
<I> we now hear for over 30 years, make their effect. </ I>
<I> And secondly, it is also a sign that the compact city, </ i>
<I> major operations, the green in </ i>
<i> the city and the quality of public space, </ i>
<I> are actually powerful economic values â€‹â€‹</ i>
<I> and that in the current context, </ i>
<I> they attract both public operators and the private market. </ I>
<I> In this perspective, I would like to quickly draw your attention </ i>
<I> on a third family of urban action </ i>
<I> this time concerning the reconfiguration of the soil </ i>
<I> but on old railways. </ I>
<I> This is for example the case of the High Line to the west of the island of Manhattan, </ i>
<I> in New York </ i>
<I> where a former railway viaduct, which was created </ i>
<I> to clutter the city freight trains which served the harbor, </ i>
<I> were recently recycled into a landscaped promenade </ i>
<I> that attracts tourists from around the world. </ I>
<I> As in the previous case, we intervened on a line </ i>
<I> once a suitable mode of transport </ i>
<I> to write down a public space for walking and slowness. </ I>
<I> The urban public space and the city make up for in quality and diversity. </ I>
<I> And the High Line is surely a pleasant and attractive place for tourists. </ I>
<I> But we may have to keep a critical mind </ i>
<I> vis-Ã -vis the physical and social restructuring process </ i>
<I> that accompanies the project throughout the district. </ I>
<I> In fact, this is an example that clearly shows </ i>
<I> how the term of nature in the city </ i>
<I> and the quality of public space and walking </ i>
<I> can be suitable both as an argument to a militant speech </ i>
<I> for car mobility, but also as an urban marketing argument. </ I>
<I> Even in its most ecological variations, </ i>
<I> the relationship between mobility and urbanism is </ i>
<i> always more complex than it seems. </ I>
<I> In the 20th century, urban space was governed </ i>
<I> with the paradigm of speed and car mobility. </ I>
<I> We see that a new culture is emerging today, </ i>
<I> more diverse, plural, more conscious of the environment, </ i>
<I> better technologically armed and actually calling into question </ i>
<I> the old balance of power in favor of multimodality. </ I>
<I> Everywhere we see connectors slow slotting </ i>
<I> in the gaps left between the lines </ i>
<I> or in the edge of the infrastructure of speed. </ I>
<I> Their development is such that we can really consider </ i>
<I> this slow network as a territorial subsystem itself, </ i>
<I> that holds and connects between them fine mesh landscaped features, </ i>
<I> of places, activities and flows </ i>
<I> based on recreation, biodiversity, water management, </ i>
<I> but in some cases, on local food production, </ i>
<I> non-market exchange, cooperation or telecommuting. </ I>
<I> I would like to emphasize that this urban planning of slowness </ i>
<I> is not to be taken as a waiver of speed. </ I>
<I> In this respect also, it is not free </ i>
<i> of contradictions. </ I>
<I> In Belgium, for example, there is a very sensible move </ i>
<I> for cycling and cycle highways. </ I>
<I> The need for such highways, such bicycle routes </ i>
<I> is especially felt in a structure </ i>
<I> polycentric urban, </ i>
<I> if we want to create alternatives to the car, we must find ways </ i>
<I> to encourage commuters and schoolchildren </ i>
<I> to overcome the apprehensions regarding cycling </ i>
<I> for paths between 5 and 20 km. </ I>
<I> At this scale, the lanes, flat, </ i>
<I> with adequate services, and where one can drive fast, </ i>
<I> are responses to insecurity, fatigue or discomfort </ i>
<I> felt by users of the bike. </ I>
<I> Here's an example from Brussels, which returns relatively speaking </ i>
<I> in case of the High Line in New York. </ I>
<I> Again, a walk was arranged </ i>
<I> on an ancient way of disused railway. </ I>
<I> Connected to a multimodal core delta, </ i>
<I> it strengthens structurally slow mobility network, </ i>
<I> and supports a mutation of the highway into an urban boulevard. </ I>
<I> A bridge of 60 meters long </ i>
<I> put on round wooden stakes to eight meters above the floor </ i>
<I> affirms the new line in the landscape. </ I>
<I> The project modifies the template from the highway into town, </ i>
<I> and replaces the motorway by the vocabulary of public space, </ i>
<I> thus contributing to the reversal of the balance of power </ i>
<I> between the automobile metric and the pedestrian metric. </ I>
<I> The planning of the slowness is not to be taken as a rejection of the speed </ i>
<I> but I would also like to emphasize </ i>
<I> it is not to be seen as a refusal of technology. </ I>
<I> In Toledo, Spain, one can see for example </ i>
<I> a new transmission line by pedestrian escalator </ i>
<I> that was created to connect a parking for 400 cars </ i>
<I> placed at the bottom of the city </ i>
<I> and to allow to connect it to the upper town </ i>
<I> and release it from cars and make it more accessible to pedestrians. </ I>
<I> Access to stairs is through a passage </ i>
<I> under the foundations of the medieval wall </ i>
<I> which is thus becoming a new city gate. </ I>
<I> The planning of the slow pace also leaves open </ i>
<I> the question of sharing or specialization of public space. </ I>
<I> In Copenhagen, capital of Denmark, </ i>
<I> you can see a cycle point developed in two-way </ i>
<I> to 230 meters long, set broadly enough </ i>
<I> to host cargo bikes, </ i>
<I> and is in-plant on a very intense commercial zone </ i>
<I> and which hosts many pedestrians. </ I>
<I> The bridge separates the stream </ i>
<I> and make the traffic flow for all. </ I>
<I> The reversal of power between the car and the bike </ i>
<I> is more evident in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, </ i>
<I> where a monumental cycle air roundabout </ i>
<I> of 702 meters of diameter suspended in a tower of 700 meters high </ i>
<I> marks the entrance of the cities of Eindhoven and Meerhoven </ i>.
<I> It provides a solution both symbolic and functional </ i>
<I> on the difficult issue of the crossing of cars and bicycle streams </ i>
<I> on the passage of an important crossroads. </ I>
The small set of examples that we have just seen and all case studies that have been proposed to you throughout the course show that the joint between the organization of mobility and the manufacture of territories and city is the collective action of a complex process, multi-scale and multi-player.
For my part, I have contributed only to highlight most material dimension, but throughout the course, you may have noticed that this material component of the action is closely dependent on the political, economic, social and environmental components.
The process is complex but we have also shown through the examples that the joint prosecution of material production between the spaces of the movement and the territory is actually focused on two main issues: action on the nodes and action on the lines.
For the rest, I hope we have convinced you a little of the need to deepen the hypothesis we tried to pass and that values â€‹â€‹research multimodality and the quality of public space as a way to live more humanely and with pleasure the travel time into our territory with multiple speeds.
Thank you for your attention.
