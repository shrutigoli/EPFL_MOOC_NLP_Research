1
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:19,133
For me, the pedestrian,
the great Brussels' central pedestrian

2
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:21,820
is extremely important

3
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,320
in the history of the
city center of Brussels.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,390
Why ? Because for the first time

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,850
and in such a dramatic way, I would say,

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,050
we realize that a public space

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,590
is not only a place of mobility,

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,340
was it sustainable, was it durable,

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,100
but is also a place, at least as much,

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,380
a place of pleasant stillness.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,410
And so, many local residents, many passers-by,

12
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,310
many visitors realized

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,310
the fun one could have
by occupying this public space,

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,590
by strolling there, by staying still for a while,

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,350
by chatting there without being constantly disturbed

16
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:10,040
by noise and by car odors.

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,020
And so, to me, that is a very important thing.

18
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:18,253
Obviously this is only a small space
over all of the Brussels Region

19
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:23,033
but it made noise and
there are already now

20
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:27,033
redevelopment underway or planned

21
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,943
for several other municipal places

22
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:30,823
and several other places in Brussels.

23
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:33,113
So I think it's really something

24
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:36,013
which must affect not only places

25
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:40,763
but also the streets of our entire city,

26
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:48,193
streets that, too, must
cease to be in a priority

27
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:52,193
places where we move quickly
to get from one place to another

28
00:01:52,193 --> 00:01:55,753
in order to be places
where we can stay

29
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:59,753
to talk with others,
to let our children play.

30
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:06,149
So about this issue of
understanding the general context

31
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,319
in which appears the pedestrian project

32
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,319
it seems to me important
to remember, even briefly,

33
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,319
some trends that seem
to me decisive and major.

34
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:17,933
It's economically incontestably

35
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:22,523
the idea that historic city centers, especially here,

36
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:28,793
must be able to give a new appeal

37
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:32,633
in a jet of competition
with peripheral centers.

38
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:37,173
It's how city centers
redefine their atmospheres,

39
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:41,173
their qualities to
ensure the attractiveness,

40
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:45,173
that is sometimes threatened
by a strong competition

41
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:46,793
from the peripheral centers.

42
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:49,823
That is perhaps a first general line

43
00:02:49,823 --> 00:02:51,173
on an economic stand point.

44
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:53,603
Socially, I think it's interesting too

45
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:58,423
to note that overall the policies of the city,

46
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:00,943
of the urban renewal,

47
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:04,003
of the consideration of the
importance of urban quality

48
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:07,683
must be understood in a context

49
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:11,333
that is of a weakening of the policies

50
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,003
of the income redistribution.

51
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,193
In the global context of trade,

52
00:03:15,193 --> 00:03:20,273
there is undoubtedly more
constraints and difficulties

53
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:22,313
to organize social cohesion

54
00:03:22,313 --> 00:03:24,343
via income redistribution.

55
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:29,266
And therefore, city policies are
playing an increasingly important role

56
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:33,786
to ensure, to induce forms
of social cohesion,

57
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:35,886
of conviviality, of living together.

58
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:39,716
And so, there is an
important point at this level

59
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:42,476
that is given to city policies.

60
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:46,281
The development of public
spaces therefore participates ...

61
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:48,391
And thus improvements of public spaces

62
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,411
to pedestrian or semi-pedestrian,

63
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,451
clearly take part of this trend.

64
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:57,032
Third element is of course,
the environmental dimension.

65
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:59,782
I basically take back the three
spheres of sustainable development,

66
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,252
the environmental dimension,

67
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:03,882
which aims tp seek to develop

68
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:06,402
the least polluting modes of transport,

69
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:09,142
the least expensive, therefore,

70
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:11,832
in terms of resources and emissions.

71
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:15,172
And so it is obviously also
in relation with health issues,

72
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:19,562
so gives more place to weak users

73
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:22,412
who can practice and exercise.

74
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:25,542
So here are also major
public health issues.

75
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,942
So it all also contributes
to the understanding

76
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:30,222
in this general context
to say that finally,

77
00:04:30,222 --> 00:04:32,482
at the political level itself,

78
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:36,002
there is no doubt in Brussels
a sort of a political momentum

79
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:37,732
at the level of the city of Brussels,

80
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:41,052
which allows to understand that
there is a shared and common vision

81
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:48,262
between the different parties, personalities,

82
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:51,142
who are currently in power
in the city of Brussels

83
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:53,462
because it basically is a project

84
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:55,762
which dates back many years,

85
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,532
this idea of â€‹â€‹transforming
the central boulevards,

86
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,602
and above all the central boulevard,

87
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:06,662
but also to re-articulate the boulevards
to the nearby neighborhoods.

88
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:10,842
This is a project that dates back several years,

89
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:15,775
which today, here, looks ready to go to something

90
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,775
that would be this pedestrian.

91
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,709
No doubt we should put quotation
marks around the pedestrian,

92
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,119
insofar considering that the accessibility

93
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,299
by car is allowed for residents,

94
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:30,549
for the elderly,

95
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:33,639
for people with reduced mobility, to taxis, etc

96
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,429
it is probably in a layout

97
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:41,189
that will be further situated somewhere

98
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:44,779
near a semi-pedestrian shared space.

99
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,119
We'll see exactly where
to place the cursor

100
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:50,629
but we must also agree on this.

101
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:56,587
But I am convinced that
in all residential areas of cities

102
00:05:56,587 --> 00:06:01,037
there are ways to restore the
hierarchy that should really prevail

103
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:03,767
in all of these places, which is as follows,

104
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:06,427
which is already done
in some places of the world:

105
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:10,511
a street, a space between the houses must be first

106
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:13,001
a place where children can play;

107
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:17,991
secondly, a place where
vehicles may be parked;

108
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,741
and only thirdly a place

109
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:28,031
where cars can move to
go from their home region,

110
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:30,751
their starting point

111
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:33,091
to where they can park.

112
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:36,882
For me, it's the hierarchy in a residential area.

113
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:38,502
And when you have this hierarchy,

114
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,902
the relationship between people is transformed.

115
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,170
A merchant, resident of the city told me

116
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,200
that when the pedestrian was created,

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,150
suddenly she began to breathe for the first time

118
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,640
since long ago.

119
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,640
And she took time to talk with her neighbors.

120
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,040
And to me, that's it.

121
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,487
That's the transformation, the change in hierarchy

122
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,617
in the use of public space.

123
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:09,477
It is also a transformation of
relationships between people,

124
00:07:09,477 --> 00:07:11,647
because if children play in the streets,

125
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:15,187
parents speak with each other

126
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:19,187
and collusion will establish
solidarity, collaboration.

127
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:21,536
That's a city transformed

128
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:24,396
by conversion of the mobility mode.

129
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:29,146
On the specific issue of challenges to meet

130
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:32,286
to pursue this approach,

131
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:36,596
I think there is undoubtedly a sociological issue

132
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:40,276
which is to make the center of Brussels

133
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:44,596
an urban space where the
Brussels-based company can do society

134
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:49,706
so to speak, where everyone feels
somewhere equally at home.

135
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:52,816
Today, Brussels lacks those places.

136
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:56,966
No doubt that Brussels is a city of neighborhoods,

137
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:59,816
made of too many neighborhoods
and not of enough centers.

138
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,996
I think there is a sociological issue

139
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:05,996
of social diversity on this
issue of living together that arises here.

140
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:12,476
And the vision scope of pedestrian poles
is part of this idea

141
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:15,216
of social diversity,

142
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:17,356
a place that would be attractive

143
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:20,536
and that would interest all of Brussels.

144
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:23,083
That certainly is a question.

145
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:27,668
A second issue is the city model

146
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:30,058
thaht we want to defend today

147
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:34,518
for this rehabilitation of historic centers.

148
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:38,738
I think the idea here is scope to develop

149
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:42,738
a city model inhabited, an inhabitad center,

150
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:45,928
so a mix of uses, functions.

151
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:50,418
So the center of Brussels
will not be a shopping mall

152
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:53,018
in competition with other shopping malls,

153
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:58,218
but will be of a living space
shared by inhabitants,

154
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:01,268
external users, employees,

155
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:03,438
strollers, students, and so on.

156
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:07,438
So there it really is, I think, this city model

157
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:11,058
which also underlies this proposal.

158
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:14,058
It is important to say it,
compared to other projects

159
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:16,508
of city â€‹â€‹centers, even European,

160
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:19,348
that sometimes tend toward
too much monofunctionality.

161
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:23,852
A third element, to me it seems,
compared with the stakes,

162
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:27,292
is the challenge of mobility, undoubtedly.

163
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,560
The boulevard would allow to
<i> bypass </ i>, I would say,

164
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,930
the weakest link of the inner ring,

165
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,170
which is the west side link, along the canal.

166
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,800
The central boulevard would allow
to <i> bypass </ i> that.

167
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,800
From the moment we limit transit,

168
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,110
very clearly here,

169
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,670
with the pedestrian project

170
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,970
it must be ensured that the movement of traffic,

171
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,380
even though we can aim
for a reduction of the car pressure

172
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,830
it must in any case be ensured
that this displacement

173
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:03,320
finds its place in a
redefinition of the crown, belt,

174
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,740
of the heart of Brussels.

175
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,500
And that is obviously
an important issue that must be resolved

176
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,180
for the municipal and regional
authorities from elsewhere.

177
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,130
This is an issue that clearly arises at both levels.

178
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:19,876
And finally, I'll point perhaps a final challenge

179
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:21,666
that seems interesting

180
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,616
and that is the issue of time management.

181
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:30,491
I mentioned briefly that some users

182
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:32,971
can access the center.

183
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,893
I have not mentioned, for example, suppliers

184
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:38,963
who can come in from this
hour to that hour in the morning,

185
00:10:38,963 --> 00:10:42,963
that some users may be able to park on certain streets

186
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:44,453
sometimes.

187
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:47,655
We can already see that in
the Rue Neuve there is an improvement,

188
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:50,385
a development that was
proposed whereas before

189
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:55,125
Rue Neuve was pedestrian 24/24, 7/7.

190
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,725
Today and before the pedestrian project,

191
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:00,935
it was adapted with a differentiated
temporal management regime

192
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:04,935
as cars, people, users

193
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:09,275
could use it for parking at night

194
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,345
to avoid a series of problems

195
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:13,885
particularly linked to the insecurity
of these places and so on.

196
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:18,495
So I think the question of learning

197
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:21,685
the differentiated management
in times of public space

198
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:23,875
will arise, is already arising.

199
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,875
And this is a particularly
interesting political issue.

200
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:32,024
It will also manage the issue,
in terms of time frames,

201
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:36,024
of urban events, nocturnal
nuisances, and so on.

202
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:40,024
All this is part of this difficulty,

203
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:45,464
at least these new issues
that arise in a context

204
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:51,064
of public space that somehow
puts society face to face with itself.

205
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:53,724
So society is once again
engaged with itself.

206
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:58,584
For these dynamic to extend,
one will have to realize

207
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,194
thaht it does not apply
only to public spaces

208
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:06,584
which can be assimilated to public places.

209
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:08,864
It can also be applied to the streets.

210
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:12,434
So that means it will be
needed to also establish

211
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:14,174
which will often be difficult,

212
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:17,464
a form of differentiation
between different types of blocks,

213
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:20,664
streets that will continue
to serve primarily

214
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:24,664
for passing cars and other vehicles

215
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:27,724
and then the streets
that will be primarily places

216
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:31,934
where residents can meet,

217
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,404
can have activities,

218
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:37,404
can plant trees and so forth.

219
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,914
And so it obviously demands

220
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:42,684
to act locally in these places,

221
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:47,414
it requires thinking broadly
at the entire agglomeration

222
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:50,574
and then resolve the inevitable tensions,

223
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:52,274
inevitable conflicts,

224
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:55,194
because what is in the collective interest

225
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:58,684
is not necessarily in the
immediate interest of every inhabitant,

226
00:12:58,684 --> 00:13:00,921
of each resident, of each household

227
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:02,911
who live in a given city.
