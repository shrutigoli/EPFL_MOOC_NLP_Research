00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:05,658
Hello.

2
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:08,482
Each and everyone of us makes daily

3
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:10,490
a set of travels.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,600
To go to work, for shopping, for recreation.

5
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:18,501
These travels are part of our daily life

6
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:21,791
and we do not often realize their complexity.

7
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:27,268
The practical exercises we offer throughout this course

8
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:31,858
aim to make you aware and analyze this complexity.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,061
Thus, at the end of each week of classes, we offer you

10
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:40,471
to explore your own daily mobility

11
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:43,536
and to report through its extent,

12
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:46,806
then to analyze the information gathered.

13
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:52,298
Exercises are cumulative, and each week

14
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:56,432
the course brings new elements that will allow each student

15
00:00:56,432 --> 00:01:02,012
to build throughout the weeks his own mobility profile.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,187
In this context, the objectives of these exercises are

17
00:01:07,187 --> 00:01:10,141
first to assimilate theoretical lessons

18
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:12,910
and examples of the different courses,

19
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,480
then to analyze one's own mobility and understand its springs

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,869
and finally, to discover the mobility of other students

21
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,839
and get in touch with them through Peer Reviewing systems.

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,681
Each student will first have to perform the exercise

23
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:34,781
and then will evaluate two other students' work.

24
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:37,377
In the first week of classes,

25
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:41,196
each student will establish his own daily mobility profile.

26
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:45,019
He will describe his travels for a whole week,

27
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:49,194
describing the places of origin and destination of his travels,

28
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:51,775
describing the modes of transport used

29
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:54,285
and evaluating the time spent in such transportation.

30
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:58,740
On this basis, we propose, in the weeks that follow,

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,650
to gradually add additional topics.

32
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,940
How do you spend your travel time?

33
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:09,218
What has allowed you to achieve these trips?

34
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:13,716
And what are the travels you could have or wanted to achieve?

35
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,696
What are the reasons that have prevented you in doing so,

36
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:19,922
what justifies your modal choice,

37
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,779
is it possible to experiment with other modes of travel

38
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,288
for a week,

39
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:28,361
what is the adhesion of the transit stop in common

40
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:31,916
nearest to you and finally,

41
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:36,436
how would you imagine an optimized transport system in your city ?

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,901
In addition to these cumulative exercises based on your mobility profile,

43
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:46,531
you will also have to answer a series of quizzes.

44
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:50,455
Some will aim to help you assimilate

45
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:55,255
items presented in each module and thus will not be marked.

46
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:58,401
But they will be mandatory in order to pass the course.

47
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:02,521
Others will aim to assess your knowledge

48
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:07,863
and note your progress in the assimilation of the course modules.
