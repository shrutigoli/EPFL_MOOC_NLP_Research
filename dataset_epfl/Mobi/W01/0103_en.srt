00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:05,993
Hello.

2
00:00:05,993 --> 00:00:08,137
In this video I talk about the link

3
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:10,777
between air transport and metropolization

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,006
or more specifically the impact of low cost carriers

5
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:16,913
and the airports they use

6
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:19,658
on the transformation of the territories.

7
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:22,510
This presentation is the result of a research work,

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,689
underway at the Catholic University of Leuven,

9
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:28,379
led by Mario Cicolecchia,

10
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:31,814
on the impact of low cost airlines

11
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:34,564
on the transformation of urban territories.

12
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:37,551
It will question the potential

13
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:40,908
of an airport, as a integral urban element,

14
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:44,098
and not as a simple transport equipment.

15
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,749
Is it possible to think the airport

16
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:49,268
as a new centrality of urban production?

17
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,977
What would be its characteristics and dynamics?

18
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:56,167
These issues are among those raised by the research.

19
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,039
To enter to the subject,

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,209
we propose to illustrate, by quotations, the vision

21
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,779
which today focuses on airports.

22
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:06,049
These are not anymore simple equipment

23
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,409
associated with travel and mobility,

24
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,420
but have become key elements

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,500
in the developments of territories.

26
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:15,147
John Urry explains with an example

27
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,343
that the passage of airports

28
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,391
from monomodality to the multimodality,

29
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:23,179
accompanied by multifunctionality,

30
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:27,109
made the airport one of the key elements of globalization.

31
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:29,874
Robertson, meanwhile,

32
00:01:30,402 --> 00:01:32,874
explains by the term "glocalization"

33
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:35,199
that the airport is the meeting point

34
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:39,499
or the articulation between global forces and local forces.

35
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:44,052
Castels explains that airports have become vital elements

36
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:46,377
of space and of global flows

37
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:49,487
on which the globalized economy of today is based.

38
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:54,504
Sudjic says that airports have become, along

39
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,976
museums or shopping malls,

40
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:59,576
public spaces of contemporary cities.

41
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,856
Finally, says Short

42
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:04,803
that airports are not only

43
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,666
nodes of the global network,

44
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,774
but are places of great local environmental impact

45
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:12,762
exacerbating tensions between the requirements

46
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:15,535
of the international connectivity and the needs

47
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,097
to live locally.

48
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,121
All these definitions

49
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:22,334
illustrates the convergence of ideas

50
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,848
on what the airports represent today

51
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:27,578
and on their importance in urban strategies.

52
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:31,483
However, these visions are brought mainly by sociologists,

53
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:32,968
and not by architects

54
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:35,658
or urban planners. So there is very little work

55
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:39,557
that predict the urban development dynamics

56
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:41,143
that are airport-related

57
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:46,083
and that would help to act better on the local and regional area.

58
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,069
Indeed, in the scientific literature,

59
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,279
the study of airports in connection with the urbane is little present.

60
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:56,083
Technical literature is essentially found,

61
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,731
in terms of architecture,

62
00:02:57,731 --> 00:02:59,771
or how to build airports.

63
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,022
These have long been considered

64
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:04,421
as isolated objects, anti-urban

65
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:08,241
and connected to the city only by transport infrastructure.

66
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,625
It was not until 1980

67
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,727
that we started thinking the airport

68
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,799
as an urban object,

69
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,072
able to influence and change its environment locally,

70
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:21,024
while being a fundamental element

71
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:23,204
of metropolisation processes.

72
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,820
This new way of thinking the airport

73
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,694
generated a series of concepts

74
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:32,154
which attempts to define the link from the airport to the city and the urban.

75
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:33,608
We find for example :

76
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:41,832
and others.

77
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,573
We cannot explain here

78
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:46,910
all the concepts but we offer

79
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,562
to resume six models to try to describe

80
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,009
opportunities for city growth from the influence

81
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:55,273
of an airport, or in other words,

82
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:59,003
to describe forms of airport metropolisation.

83
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,520
The first model is the "AIRFRONT" model.

84
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:04,382
At the economic level,

85
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:06,687
it is a kind of "business district"

86
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:10,444
based mainly on commercial and industrial activities

87
00:04:10,444 --> 00:04:11,974
related to transportation.

88
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,943
Spatially,

89
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:18,815
it is a small concentration localized between the city and the airport.

90
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:23,444
It is a model which is little consumer of land because it often develops

91
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:27,184
in places of existing economic activities that it will strengthen.

92
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,813
At the social level,

93
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:31,826
there are certain advantages that are associated with the development

94
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:33,310
of economic activity

95
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,490
and hence the supply of jobs in the region.

96
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:37,305
In terms of governance,

97
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:40,759
this model involves the creation of a spatial plan which often involves

98
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,429
public or private partnerships.

99
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:46,256
The second model is the "DECOPLEX"

100
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:48,275
(Development Ecology Complex)

101
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:49,843
it involves developing

102
00:04:49,843 --> 00:04:53,283
a small industrial complex, economical and linear,

103
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,180
based on airport activity.

104
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:59,459
The activities we will find there will be transporting people

105
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:00,767
and goods

106
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,137
aviation operations and maintenance, etc.

107
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:05,661
Like its predecessor,

108
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:09,213
this model is little consumer of land, it develops a kind

109
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:12,728
of aeropole which focuses not only transportation,

110
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:15,332
but a series of satellite activities.

111
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:17,600
This model has very little social impact

112
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,300
because they are often offshored activities groups.

113
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:24,132
In terms of governance, there is very little impact

114
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:27,201
of public authorities because this model is often handled

115
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,311
by airport actors and private actors.

116
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,105
Thus, it has very little impact

117
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:36,175
on the city and on the socioeconomic development of the concerned territory.

118
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,799
The third model is the "AIRPORT CITY".

119
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:42,400
This is somehow an extension

120
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,704
of the previous model, with the difference

121
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:47,544
that the activity revolving around the airport

122
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:49,896
is no longer exclusively linked.

123
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,414
We can come by economic parks

124
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:55,039
leisure parks, banks, sports centers,

125
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,359
training centers and others.

126
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,715
Spatially,

127
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:01,588
it is a model that extends around the airport,

128
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:04,788
while remaining compact and dense.

129
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:07,630
At the social level, with this type of model,

130
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,391
there is a rupture of dynamics

131
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:12,511
as the airport becomes an element of competition with the city.

132
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:15,738
It includes all services and equipments

133
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,774
that is normally found in the city.

134
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:20,604
Sometimes even there we find a residential component

135
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:22,995
that often develops so competitively

136
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:25,422
compared to what is done in the city.

137
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:26,870
In terms of governance,

138
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,230
it is the airport that plans and develops the territory.

139
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:33,598
The fourth model is the "AIRPORT CORRIDOR."

140
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:36,384
This model matches that of current dynamics

141
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:39,044
between the city of Amsterdam and its airport.

142
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:40,827
Unlike the previous model,

143
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:43,347
where there is a break between the city and the airport,

144
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,019
here, there is an integration attempt.

145
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:48,862
The connection between the city and the airport

146
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:51,383
is no longer a simple linear infrastructure

147
00:06:51,383 --> 00:06:55,423
but an urban development done in several activities and functions.

148
00:06:55,423 --> 00:07:00,243
It is an attempt of coordination between the airport, the city and the region

149
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,973
for the overall growth of the region.

150
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:06,208
To achieve this, it is necessary to have a governance

151
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,494
coordinating between the public actors,

152
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:12,084
the airport actors and private economic actors.

153
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:15,836
The fifth model is the "AIREA".

154
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:20,278
It corresponds to that of Berlin Brandenburg Airport.

155
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:24,312
There is here also an attempted valorization of the region,

156
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:28,022
by balancing the forces of the city and those of the airport.

157
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:29,999
The model offers the development

158
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:33,075
of multiple nodes or specialized economic centers,

159
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:36,978
which are connected between them on the one hand, and to the airport

160
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:38,864
and the city on the other.

161
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:41,658
Spatially, it is a polycentric system,

162
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:43,560
like the modern "zonings"

163
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,525
where mobility and availability of transport infrastructure

164
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:50,485
are the basic conditions of its operation.

165
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:53,647
The region and the public authorities

166
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:55,836
are highly active in the planning

167
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:58,377
and ensure to respond not only to objectives

168
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,663
of international economic development,

169
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:03,523
but also to meet local social needs.

170
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:07,792
Governance is also mixed and involves all stakeholders.

171
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:09,608
This model was created to avoid

172
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:12,037
the development of airport megacities

173
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:15,397
that we will explore in the sixth and final model.

174
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:20,512
The last model is "AEROTROPOLIS".

175
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:22,979
This is an extreme model, inspired from the growth

176
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,796
of US cities.

177
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,846
The airport becomes the center of a new city.

178
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:30,975
The old town is only a part of this new city.

179
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:35,445
The latter is organized in specialized zonings

180
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:37,422
and without much diversity.

181
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:40,759
This model uses a lot of land, due to its spread

182
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,389
and low density.

183
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:43,844
It is based only

184
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:47,124
on economic development as the main engine.

185
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:48,917
Aspects of quality of life,

186
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,673
heritage, or otherwise,

187
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:52,919
are relegated to the background.

188
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,420
This type of model poses a series of problems in terms of governance

189
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,383
because it encompasses different administrative courts, a variety of actors

190
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:03,073
and areas that have developed spontaneously.

191
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:07,466
It involves a complexity of coordination for the overall territorial development.

192
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:11,197
These six models allow us to have a reading grid

193
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:13,715
to analyze current urban developments

194
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:17,111
around airports, including low cost airports

195
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,401
that develop in Europe today.

196
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:22,509
The dynamic development of these appeared

197
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:23,939
in a very short time,

198
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,053
leaving the authorities without management tools

199
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,903
of this type of dynamics.

200
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:32,035
Before the arrival of low cost airlines

201
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:33,818
air transport grew

202
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:36,338
following the pattern "Hub & amp; Spoke ".

203
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:38,603
Ie. a regional airport

204
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:42,243
is connected only with a principal national airport,

205
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:44,121
which is connected

206
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:48,271
with other major airports, national and of other countries.

207
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,478
Therefore, two regional airports

208
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:55,708
could only be connected through the main airports.

209
00:09:56,448 --> 00:10:00,108
This type of model has generated a very technical collaboration

210
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:02,425
between airport as an infrastructure

211
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:05,625
and traditional national airlines.

212
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:09,800
It's a dynamic that has consolidated over time, based solely

213
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,810
on air transport.

214
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,516
With the emergence of low cost airlines,

215
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:18,486
the model changes to the "Point to Point".

216
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,651
This means that any regional airport can be connected

217
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:26,474
with any other without going through a central hub.

218
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,876
In this configuration, new partnerships

219
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:31,123
appear as low-cost airlines

220
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:32,495
are no longer seen only

221
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:34,289
as a means of transport,

222
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:37,096
but as a means to develop the peripheral regions.

223
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:41,282
Thus, public authorities in regions with airports

224
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:45,393
will appeal to airlines such as Ryanair, for example,

225
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:47,727
by offering various facilities,

226
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,782
to help them develop their territory.

227
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,852
These airlines are seen as accessibility generators

228
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:57,540
and as a new resource on which to develop policies

229
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,606
both urban and territorial.

230
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:03,726
Let us now take a concrete case, that of Wallonia, Belgium.

231
00:11:03,982 --> 00:11:06,001
We find two airports:

232
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,812
that of Liege, dedicated exclusively to freight transport,

233
00:11:09,812 --> 00:11:12,920
and of Charleroi, dedicated to transporting people

234
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,140
with low-cost airlines, including Ryanair.

235
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,642
We can see on the left chart

236
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:21,980
the increase in air traffic at the Charleroi airport

237
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,130
since the arrival of Ryanair in 1998.

238
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:29,339
Charleroi Airport is certainly a peripheral airport

239
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,850
compared to that of Brussels, Zaventem,

240
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,710
but it has an advantage of a strategic location.

241
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,210
It is at the crossroads of the highway that connects Charleroi to Brussels

242
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,332
all the way to Antwerp and the Netherlands,

243
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:48,032
and of the highway which connects Paris to Cologne, via Namur and Liège.

244
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,081
To understand the dynamics of Charleroi airport,

245
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:52,606
it is important to understand

246
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,676
the actor games that revolve around him.

247
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,981
First we find the Walloon region

248
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,031
that put airports available

249
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:00,753
to private managers through

250
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,513
concessions and contracts for decades.

251
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,140
Its goal was to revitalize this part of the region,

252
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,617
economically, and increase its attractivity.

253
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,729
Then we find the management company, BSCA

254
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:17,267
(Brussels South Charleroi Airport)

255
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:18,573
which is mainly

256
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:21,568
air traffic and commercial activity,

257
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:24,171
within the terminal only.

258
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:27,165
We also find SOWAER,

259
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,431
(Walloon Airport Company)

260
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,477
whose shareholders are mainly

261
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:35,097
the Walloon region, as well as some private shareholders.

262
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,565
SOWAER support spaces around the airport,

263
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:41,520
developing economic strategies on one hand,

264
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,207
and airport integration strategies with the city on the other.

265
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:49,160
The other major player is the city of Charleroi.

266
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,096
The latter has created, with 68 other cities,

267
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:55,264
an inter-municipal company for the management and implementation

268
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:57,760
of economic and technical studies: IGRETEC.

269
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,025
Its goal, in the case of Charleroi,

270
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:02,684
is to define strategies for the cities located

271
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:06,464
around the airport in order to benefit from its infrastructure.

272
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:09,973
The acting game of the development of Charleroi airport

273
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:13,626
and its territory thus fall around a triangulation

274
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:18,776
between Brussels South Charleroi Airport, SOWAER and IGRETEC.

275
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,050
In this little layout, one can see the occupied areas

276
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,030
for each player in the perimeter of the airport.

277
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,666
In this satellite image, the white line represents the limits

278
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,436
of the airport of Charleroi.

279
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:39,455
The areas in orange and red are areas that are being

280
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,035
developed and are considered strategic.

281
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,827
One of the strategic options of the region is achieving

282
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:51,057
a railway station in the terminal to quickly and directly connect

283
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:54,623
the city of Brussels to Charleroi airport without having to change

284
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:56,913
mode of transport at the Charleroi station.

285
00:13:57,054 --> 00:14:01,514
The desire is to make Charleroi Airport the Brussels South Airport.

286
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,735
With this station project, one would go, considering all the stops,

287
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:08,810
from the Charleroi airport to the center of Brussels,

288
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,473
in a similar time budget than the current movement

289
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:16,043
from the Brussels Zaventem Airport to the center of Brussels.

290
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:20,679
SOWAER is currently developing a strategy to support airports

291
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,580
by making financial resources available, on the one hand,

292
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,300
but it will mainly develop a proactive policy

293
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,350
of creation of land reserves.

294
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:32,680
Through redemption mechanisms or expropriation, it will acquire

295
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,937
land, which it will provide

296
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:37,830
for the economic development of the airport.

297
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,734
During the past three years,

298
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:42,873
SOWAER created roughly thirty hectares to spend

299
00:14:42,873 --> 00:14:45,201
on the economic development of the airport.

300
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:48,719
It is a policy that does not take into account other dynamics

301
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,681
of the territory and its inhabitants.

302
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,723
The choice of these policies are justified

303
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:55,513
by the promise of creating jobs for Wallonia.

304
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,738
The idea is to make economic profits of the airport activity

305
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:01,823
creating potential for development

306
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:03,663
where there was none.

307
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:07,033
In these images we can see how IGRETEC plans

308
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,140
to use its land reserves.

309
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,790
This is the project of one of the two economic parks

310
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,918
IGRETEC proposed for municipalities

311
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:16,198
around the airport.

312
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:18,642
It is divided into five sectors

313
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:22,134
which are: Life Sciences; Aerospace; Graphic Arts;

314
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:25,957
Business Services and Technology Industry.

315
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:28,261
The problem is that there is a lack of

316
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,111
integration of these "clusters" of activity in the city.

317
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:33,432
The residential function is absent

318
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,002
and there was no thorough analysis of the urban territory.

319
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:39,394
It lacks an overall vision of integration

320
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:41,761
as in many regional airports

321
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:44,069
because, as we mentioned earlier,

322
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,027
growth generated by these airports

323
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:48,007
was very quick and unexpected.

324
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:52,074
Municipalities have improvised without mastery of dynamics.

325
00:15:52,124 --> 00:15:54,121
There has not been, in the case of Charleroi,

326
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,789
willingness to develop a new image of the city,

327
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,289
relying on the growth of its airport.

328
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:03,635
On these two images, one can see the second business park

329
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:06,685
proposed by IGRETEC, which proposes to transform

330
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:09,005
urban spaces into economic parks

331
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:11,875
based on research and scientific training.

332
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,130
It is understandable in the case of Charleroi

333
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,651
that we are in models

334
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:17,761
of the type of development, "AIRPORT CITY"

335
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:21,053
with the only difference that we are in a joint governance

336
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:24,395
where governments still have an important role.

337
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:25,655
In this video,

338
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:28,189
we could see what impact an airport,

339
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:30,985
and particularly a low cost airport,

340
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:35,455
can have on the territory and its metropolisation processes.

341
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,984
It is clear that it is important to think of the airport,

342
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:44,494
not as a single transport infrastructure separate from the city,

343
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:48,154
but as a dynamic urban generator equipment.

344
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:52,770
This implies the need to plan the airport's dynamic

345
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,207
in line with those of the city,

346
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:56,883
trying to converge

347
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,435
public policy and local interest

348
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,765
with economic policies of the airport and of the private operators.

349
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:07,419
One of the shortcomings of Charleroi Airport is exactly

350
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:10,979
the lack of integration channels of all stakeholders,

351
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:13,750
including inhabitants, in the exchanges

352
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,790
and definition of the strategies.

353
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:19,322
Finally, the cities involved in this type of airport

354
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:21,772
need to move from a management

355
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:24,255
and a local development strategy

356
00:17:24,255 --> 00:17:26,740
to supra-local strategies for which

357
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,260
they may not have the necessary tools.
