00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:05,556
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:08,653
Today in this video, we will look at

3
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:12,943
the transformation of the territory through mobility.

4
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:16,955
Or more precisely, we will approach

5
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:19,851
the question of the gradual transformation

6
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:23,417
of oppositions between urban territories

7
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,792
and territories rather countryfied,

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,209
ie. the opposition between town and country.

9
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:31,881
We will focus on the transformation of this opposition

10
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:33,318
to the urban reign.

11
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:37,626
<I> This video will allow us in particular </ i>

12
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:41,536
<I> to understand
why this peaceful Swiss village, </ i>

13
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:45,083
<I> not far from Lake Geneva, is not a village. </ I>

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,382
<I> Because here, you have before you a picture of Féchy, </ i>

15
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,193
<I> which is a village in the canton of Vaud, </ i>
<i> So on the Lake Geneva </ i>

16
00:00:54,193 --> 00:00:58,434
<I> and we could paraphrase René Magritte, saying: </ i>

17
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,791
<I> "This is not a village. "</ I>

18
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:05,929
<I> The territorial space frame is built </ i>

19
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:08,170
<I> from many ingredients. </ I>

20
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:14,152
<I> There are three of these ingredients whose arrangement has changed </ i>

21
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:19,831
<I> and the modification of this arrangement led to the development </ i>

22
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:23,946
<I> what might be called urban or rather, what is called urban. </ I>

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,206
<I> The three constitutive dimensions of the space frame territories </ i>

24
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:30,698
<I> whose reports have been transformed </ i>

25
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:35,015
<I> are the morphology, the functional centralities </ i>

26
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:36,783
<I> and the lifestyles. </ I>

27
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:39,579
<I> Until the 60s, </ i>

28
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:43,258
<I> these three dimensions overlapped by snapping-in. </ I>

29
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,399
<I> They are regionalised, </ i>

30
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,736
<I> they draw contrasts between the city and the countryside. </ I>

31
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:52,451
<I> To give you an example, </ i>

32
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:55,903
<I> when you see, from the air, a territory, </ i>

33
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,552
<I> we can say at this time - </ i>

34
00:01:57,552 --> 00:02:00,586
<I> we could do with the exercise with aerial photographs - </ i>

35
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:05,186
<I> we can say at this time if it is a small or a big city </ i>

36
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:06,301
<I> or a village. </ I>

37
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:08,583
<I> One can have an idea, depending on its size, </ i>

38
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,109
<I> of its centrality. </ I>

39
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:16,261
<I> And then we can also say, knowing where people live, </ i>

40
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,753
<I> what is their lifestyle, </ i>

41
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:20,399
<I> someone who lives in a particular village, </ i>

42
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,782
<I> a small town </ i>

43
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,779
<I> will have its daily life </ i>

44
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:27,699
<I> taking place in this space, in this village, </ i>

45
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,756
<I> and will be a lifestyle turned to vicinity. </ I>

46
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:35,194
Since the 1960s,

47
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:40,781
there is an opening of possibilities of location,

48
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,371
in space,

49
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:47,406
spurred by the development of rapid transit systems,

50
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:50,795
firstly by road systems, highways,

51
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,792
then by railway systems

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,731
and also more recently with the development

53
00:02:57,731 --> 00:03:00,887
of remote communication systems.

54
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:06,604
So under the impulse of these developments,

55
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,167
of these mobilities potentials,

56
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:12,434
the three dimensions that we just talked about,

57
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:18,694
they are gradually rearranging themselves and transform the territory.

58
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,798
Morphological boundaries fade

59
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:27,679
and we assist to what is called a urban sprawl.

60
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:31,913
<I> In many urban areas, </ i>

61
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:37,720
<I> it is now very difficult to say where a city begins and stops. </ I>

62
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:43,259
<I> You have before you the example of the outskirt of Algiers, </ i>

63
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,818
<I> very clever is the one who can finally say to us </ i>
<i> where Algiers begins </ i>

64
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:51,896
<I> and where Algiers ends, in functional terms. </ I>

65
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:56,462
Lifestyles are gradually transforming

66
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:59,838
and they detach themselves from spatial proximity.

67
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:04,805
<I> The essential of one's daily life doesn't take place anymore </ i>

68
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:07,015
<I> in the vicinity of one's home, </ i>

69
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:09,941
<I> but in much larger spaces </ i>

70
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:12,229
<I> for a large part of the population, </ i>

71
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,791
<I> and spaces which are also discontinuous. </ I>

72
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:17,422
<I> You have here an illustration. </ I>

73
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:24,217
<I> We're on this picture </ i>
<i> on the outskirts of Prato in Tuscany. </ I>

74
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,718
Functionally,

75
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:33,925
cities radiation is recomposed internationally,

76
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:37,718
which is called the phenomenon of metropolisation.

77
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:43,210
<I> You have this picture of the district of Lille Europe, </ i>

78
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,400
<I> which is located near the eponymous train station, so of Lille Europe. </ I>

79
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:53,006
<I> It's a neighborhood that was built there fifteen years ago </ i>

80
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:58,403
<I> and which aims to make Lille an international metropolis, </ i>

81
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,192
<I> so it has to attract </ i>

82
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:04,243
<I> a number of corporate headquarters, </ i>
<i> of central equipment </ i>

83
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:10,290
<I> that allow Lille to expand beyond its traditional hinterland. </ I>

84
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:17,585
When speaking of the transformation of oppositions between the city and the country

85
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:22,558
and of the advent of the urban reign or of the development of the urban phenomenon,

86
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:25,695
there is often a sort of a misunderstanding that emerges

87
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:28,208
and on which I would really like to insist,

88
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:31,632
the advent of the so-called urban

89
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,449
does not mean that we live

90
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:39,604
in a kind of a great metropolis that could be called Europe

91
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:43,644
in which the different countries and the different cities

92
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,218
would be the neighborhoods.

93
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:50,489
Urban does not kill spatial differentiations,

94
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:53,415
does not kill territories, all is not urban.

95
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:56,674
The whole of Europe is not urban

96
00:05:56,674 --> 00:06:00,573
and I think we need to emphasize this aspect,

97
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:05,802
we are not facing a phenomenon completely encompassing

98
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:10,157
that would swallow that whole continents.

99
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:14,707
If we now return to the place of mobility

100
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,743
in the phenomena which I have just mentioned.

101
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,526
So we have seen that the lifestyles,

102
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,490
morphologies

103
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,228
and centralities

104
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,794
now maintain

105
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:34,373
different relationship than they did in the past.

106
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,074
While in the past,

107
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:38,340
we witnessed snappings-in,

108
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:41,588
a little according to the logic of Russian dolls,

109
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:44,781
now there is much more a system

110
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:48,101
where finally the relations between lifestyles,

111
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:53,225
morphologies and centralities are built by mobility.

112
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:55,325
Mobility,

113
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:59,987
is actually what makes the link,

114
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:06,521
which allows to understand the relationships between these three ingredients,

115
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:09,385
establishing territorial reinforcement.

116
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:14,613
It is for this reason that one can no longer say

117
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:17,475
that the small town that I showed you earlier,

118
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:19,631
Féchy, to not name it,

119
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,431
<I> that Féchy is no longer a village. </ I>

120
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:25,666
<I> Féchy looks like a village </ i>

121
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,395
<I> morphologically, </ i>

122
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:30,076
it has all the attributes of the village

123
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:33,231
if we look at a picture of Féchy,

124
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:34,915
from the air,

125
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:38,521
it seems that it is a village,

126
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:43,977
<I> but Féchy but features the lifestyle of these people. </ I>

127
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:48,779
<I> And the inhabitants of Féchy fit into the great scale. </ I>

128
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,839
<I> If I take the previous illustration, </ i>

129
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,221
<I> their way of life fits in much wider areas. </ I>

130
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:59,511
<I> They will work tens of kilometers away </ i>

131
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:02,260
<I> in Lausanne or Geneva. </ I>

132
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,194
<I> They make their purchases in large shopping centers </ i>

133
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:09,919
<I> as we have seen earlier in the suburb of Prato in Italy, </ i>

134
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,170
<I> so they do not fit </ i>
basically

135
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,633
<I> in a micro-local level. </ I>

136
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:18,698
<I> Finally, Féchy residents are characterized </ i>

137
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,880
<I> by socio-professional categories </ i>

138
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,289
<I> that are related to metropolisation phenomenon. </ I>

139
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,510
<I> The Lake Geneva region, </ i>

140
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,481
<I> the Greater Geneva or the Lake Geneva region </ i>

141
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:36,309
<I> is strongly marked by this metropolization phenomenon. </ I>

142
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:39,709
<I> This results in the presence </ i>

143
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:45,278
<I> of many organizations and multinational companies. </ I>

144
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,939
<I> And in a village like Féchy, there is a strong presence of managerial staffs </ i>

145
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,492
<I> who work in precisely this type of business. </ I>

146
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:57,579
That's what I wanted to show you

147
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:02,936
about the transformation of the territory through mobility

148
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:07,263
taking as a thread this story of a little village.

149
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,921
I wish you a good result of course.
