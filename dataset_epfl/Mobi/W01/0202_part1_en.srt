00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:06,090
Hello.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,626
In this video, we'll see how transport and mobility

3
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:11,207
can transform a city,

4
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:14,554
essentially spatially,
but also socially.

5
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:17,370
This city is Brussels, capital of Europe,

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,857
as you can see behind me on the image.

7
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:22,012
The video is divided into three chapters:

8
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:25,456
The first two relate on how transport infrastructure

9
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:28,430
and speed infrastructure, that are the railway and highways

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,390
have disfigured the center of Brussels and reorganized it.

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,243
The third chapter questions the recent project of a pedestrian center of Brussels

12
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:41,535
on its potential to be or not an engine of transformation of the city,

13
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:45,040
as were before the train and car.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,865
In this video, we left the floor to professionals,

15
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:51,272
Brussels academics and activists.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,520
Each chapter will involve one or two people.

17
00:00:57,356 --> 00:01:01,826
Junction is a long term project.

18
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:07,403
that is to say that this is one of the most emblematic projects

19
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:10,299
of the contemporary history of Brussels.

20
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,980
This is a project that lasted for fifty years.

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,613
The origin is in 1903, when an agreement

22
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:21,940
was signed between the state and the city of Brussels,

23
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:26,812
to link the North Station to the South Station (Gare du Midi)

24
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:30,500
But we can still go further back in time,

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,043
since the first station in Brussels is in 1835,

26
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:36,650
it is the station of AllÃ©e Verte.

27
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:43,807
In fact, this is the first train traveling on the europeen continent, in Belgium.

28
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:45,697
From that moment,

29
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:50,280
we will see the railway develop gradually in Belgium,

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,670
and, in particular, we will have the need to develop other stations.

31
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:04,180
In 1840, a station was set up to be the first South Station,

32
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,088
which is roughly what is now the "Palais du Midi" in Brussels.

33
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,734
And we immediately see, when we have these two stations,

34
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:17,765
(the AllÃ©e Verte station will be moved in 1841 to form

35
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:20,672
the nucleus of the North Station)

36
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:23,548
so, when you have a North Station and a South Station,

37
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:28,741
soon comes the idea to link these two stations.

38
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:31,712
And so a whole series of projects are emerging

39
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,778
and show that in fact, very quickly,

40
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:40,071
we feel the need for a link between the two terminal stations

41
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:43,023
that are the North Station and the South Station,

42
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:50,218
in a context where the railway is developing rapidly,

43
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:55,170
and here was the heart of the network, what quickly became the heart of the network,

44
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:58,487
with two stations that are not linked.

45
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:03,196
That is why, after much debate,

46
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:08,752
we finally decided to build a North-South Junction.

47
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:14,929
The debate takes place in the turning if the nineteenth to twentieth centuries.

48
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:18,793
In 1903, the agreement is signed,

49
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:22,417
and it is actually decided to do it on a hillside,

50
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:28,862
that is to say in the height difference between the upper town and lower town,

51
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:32,708
and therefore crossing Brussels.

52
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:37,471
The problem is that the work takes much longer than expected.

53
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:41,282
And in 1914
the first World War broke out,

54
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:44,497
and the work is far from over.

55
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:47,740
Of course, during the war,
it is not a priority,

56
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,932
the site is abandoned.

57
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:57,040
And after the war rises the question
of the continuation or not of the site,

58
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,755
and we can say that
the file is gradually buried.

59
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:06,136
And then the crisis
of the early 1930s broke

60
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:10,507
and in that context, in 1935,

61
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:16,451
we will launch a number
of major public works in Belgium,

62
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:22,427
and one of these activities,
will be to build, and to rebuild,

63
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:27,583
to resume the construction
of the North-South Junction.

64
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:33,802
And it will be the office for the
completion of the North-South Junction

65
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:37,920
which will start its work
in mid-1930

66
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,890
with the aim of
completing this junction.

67
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:49,582
So it was in 1952 that finally
the first two tracks are inaugurated,

68
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:54,247
tracks which will cross the capital,

69
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,849
and,especially, is inaugurated the Central Station.

70
00:04:57,032 --> 00:04:59,801
What is interesting is that, of course,

71
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:07,195
this causes fundamental changes in the Brussels urban fabric.

72
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:12,215
First, because it must change the stations, it must raise the stations:

73
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,719
the South Station, North Station ...

74
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:17,023
and create a central station.

75
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:20,961
The desire to have a central station
is very clear in Brussels,

76
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:27,198
first so that tourists can go
directly in the heart of Brussels

77
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:29,202
but also for commuters, of course,

78
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:34,334
but also because Brussels
wants a station on its territory.

79
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:37,000
While North and the South Station are

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,920
just outside the territory,

81
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,880
there is a desire to have its own railway station.

82
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:47,770
Works will be gigantic works.

83
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,916
This is a real achievement in terms of the work of engineers,

84
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:58,040
real feat to be presented worldwide

85
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,114
as the example of what the Belgian engineers can do.

86
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:08,044
In reality, it is just 3 km of track,

87
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,098
a little less than 3 km, a tunnel that is about 2 km

88
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:17,812
and this is probably one of the longest projects in the history of Belgium,

89
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:21,885
certainly the longest in Brussels' history.

90
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:23,881
Admittedly, this is not simple,

91
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:28,624
because the land is not quite ideal

92
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:32,094
to build this kind of tunnel

93
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:35,946
but also because we will have

94
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:38,986
to dig a real trench

95
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:44,228
and the tunnel will be built in the open,

96
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:47,610
that is to say, we will work while destroying

97
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,700
all that is located above the junction.

98
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,848
Once the work is completed,

99
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,703
we will cover, of course, that up,

100
00:06:57,703 --> 00:07:03,633
in particular by building a kind of boulevard above the junction.

101
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,742
Some speak of a boulevard

102
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:08,079
which starts from nowhere and comes tonowhere,

103
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,328
because it is not really highly thought on urban planning.

104
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:16,825
It is not highly thought about either the type of buildings

105
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:20,286
that will border the boulevard.

106
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,230
Most architects today consider

107
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,775
this is a great example of
what we have done worse

108
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:33,072
in regards to the contemporary modern art.

109
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:38,520
And above all, we will build around this boulevard buildings

110
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,940
which will be mainly administrative buildings,

111
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:46,636
and therefore it will have the effect
that the Junction will pass through

112
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,920
what was the heart of the old Brussels,

113
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,110
it was really a very dynamic part of the city

114
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,087
which is thus completely destroyed.

115
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,871
While some will say that this is a great way

116
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:04,953
to clean up these old districts, these old streets,

117
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:09,572
where we had an often very poor population.

118
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,821
It's true, and it is also true
that this will cause the departure

119
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:20,084
of a large part of the population
from this part of the city.

120
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,650
Figures vary, but they say it's about

121
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,440
between 11 000 and 15 000 people

122
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,681
who will have to leave the heart of Brussels,

123
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,889
which will not find where to relocate in Brussels,

124
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,684
which will go outside.

125
00:08:31,684 --> 00:08:33,550
It was built for others,

126
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,790
it was not built for Brussels.

127
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:37,700
We did not care about residents,

128
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,687
we did not care about
architecture, about urbanism,

129
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:46,089
we only cared about tourists and commuters

130
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,900
who regularly come to Brussels.

131
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,668
The idea was to enable them to
arrive as quickly as possible

132
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:55,820
in the heart of the city
thanks to the central station,

133
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,770
even at the time of "all the car",

134
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:03,920
via these boulevards where it was
necessary for a car to be able to enter

135
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,985
the fastest in the heart of the city.
