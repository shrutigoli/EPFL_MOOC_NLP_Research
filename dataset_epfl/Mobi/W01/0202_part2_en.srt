1
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,009
<I> (narrator) Regarding the context
of the Expo 58, it must be remembered </ i>

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,653
<I> that it is the first
World Expo after the war </ i>

3
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:23,921
<I> in a context of development,
as we are in the beginning The Glorious Thirty, </ i>

4
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:29,865
<I> and of a will to pacify the world
so peaceful relations </ i>

5
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:38,599
<I> are at the heart of the theme of the expo. </ I>
And so we contemplate, thanks to the means

6
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:46,289
of technology that are available, interplanetary travels, with Sputnik

7
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,328
the highlight of the Russian pavilion, but also planetary travels.

8
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:56,221
Trips become handy, thanks to the car.

9
00:00:56,232 --> 00:01:02,455
The French pavilion exhibits in its
center the DS 19, the name is, of course,

10
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:11,201
iconic and it is the dream for this post-war generation

11
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:17,131
to think that the borders will open
and that we will be able to travel as we please.

12
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:24,655
Expo 58 will be an opportunity
for profound transformations for Brussels

13
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:28,874
to fit it to the car
but these transformations will enroll

14
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:32,519
in some continuity,
historian Christophe Loir has

15
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:37,267
shown that the modal segregation
processes of public space

16
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:42,525
was at work since the
early nineteenth century with, first,

17
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:47,425
the establishment and development of
a promenade for pedestrians,

18
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:52,604
the creation of sidewalks and then,
progressively, with the arrival of mechanical

19
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:58,371
modes of travel in the city,
the confrontation, the competition

20
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:02,288
between the different modes in the public space.
And even before the war,

21
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,775
we complained about the
increased traffic and the problems

22
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:10,082
related to this traffic.
And so in 1936,

23
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:15,515
two pieces of legislation
will be adopted in Belgium.

24
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:22,799
First, the obligation for pedestrians to
circulate exclusively on the sidewalk,

25
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:28,119
and secondly, the authorization
for vehicle owners

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,619
to leave them parked without
a driver on public roads.

27
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:38,695
And so these two decisions, prepared
what was to come later,

28
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:44,202
that is to say the opening
of the public space to flow, rapid flow,

29
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:52,452
automotive flow, both the circulation
flow and also the parking

30
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:55,445
and the hold of the automobile
on the public space.

31
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:58,413
<I> (narrator) A second important item </ i>

32
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:03,483
<I> it is the development of a new
science, the science of traffic </ i>

33
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,278
<I> the "traffic engineering" that had developed </ i>

34
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:10,485
<I> in the interwar period in the United States,
and that a senior Belgian official, </ i>

35
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:13,048
<I> the general director of
Department of Public Works, </ i>

36
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:21,731
<I> Henry HÃ¼ndermarcq, went to learn
in the United States and import in Europe. </ I>

37
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:27,780
<I> So this official was the
spearhead of these urban </ i>

38
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,142
<I> transformations experienced in Brussels
but beyond that, he also has been </ i>

39
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:38,742
<I> one of the pioneer and thinker
of the European motorway network. </ I>

40
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:42,854
<I> (narrator) Brussels, site
in the center of the capital </ i>

41
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:44,834
<I> M Vanaudenhove, very paternal, </ i>

42
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:48,881
<I> embraces the girl who presents to him
the scissors of circumstances </ i>

43
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:52,851
<I> and this is how the Minister
inaugurated the first tunnel of the small ring. </ I>

44
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:58,634
<I> This gesture accomplished, the personalities in
procession pass under the street of the Act (Rue de la Loi). </ I>

45
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:08,358
<I> It is to the Mayor of Brussels,
Mr. Cooremans that belongs to cut </ i>

46
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:11,768
<I> the ribbon that bars off
the exit of the work of art. </ I>

47
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:20,001
<I> The spectators who were watching
the scene, might have thought: "And one down!" </ I>.

48
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,759
What characterizes the works
that transformed Brussels

49
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,417
for Expo 58, is their speed

50
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:37,507
unlike any other major projects
that Brussels and Belgium have known.

51
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:45,098
In 3 years, from 1955 to 1958, nearly
130 km of roads were created

52
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:53,328
or renovated, it's a countless number
of intersections that have been built,

53
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:58,267
about thirty bridges were built,
six tunnels and a viaduct

54
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:05,284
in the city, a big six-storey parking,
well-named parking 58,

55
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:09,359
in the heart of Brussels and
close to 35,000 parking space

56
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:19,107
on the Expo site.And so the 1958 due date served

57
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:24,849
as very strong pulse to
initiate a plan that would continue

58
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:29,311
later because it was only a part
of the most urgent work

59
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:36,315
that had been made at this time.
<I> Then, a second interesting item </ i>

60
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:40,885
<I> is that Expo 58 also was an opportunity,
perhaps paradoxically, </ i>

61
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:45,810
<I> to renovate the public transport network
and the tram network in Brussels </ i>

62
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,534
<I> particularly because the organizers of the
exhibition and the authorities of the time </ i>

63
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:53,809
<I> were well aware that not all
the visitors were going to come </ i>

64
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:59,298
<I> by car. The automobile
coverage of households still being </ i>

65
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:04,049
<I> very low at the time. And so,
this is an element which explains why </ i>

66
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:08,150
<I> Brussels did not cast aside
its tram network at the time, </ i>

67
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:15,410
<I> unlike many other cities in Europe.
And continued to perceive </ i>

68
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:22,395
<I> the tram, the surface public
transportation as both a necessity, </ i>

69
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:25,336
<I> and a disability, regarding the flow, </ i>

70
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:28,716
<I> the fluidity of the automotive traffic. </ I>

71
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:33,516
<I> And nothing has been done
for many years to enhance </ i>

72
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,802
<I> the speed of the surface transport </ i>

73
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:40,805
<I> by installing them, for example,
in protected sites. </ I>

74
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:48,475
<I> The context of the 58 expo was of the functional city, </ i>

75
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,348
<I> of the Athens Charter, with
the separation of functions </ i>

76
00:06:53,348 --> 00:07:00,603
<I> in the city and the development
of the tertiary function, </ i>

77
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:05,703
<I> of the tertiary employment
with the prospect of making Brussels </ i>

78
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:07,879
<I> a great international capital. </ i>

79
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,529
<I> The authorities were preparing
to defend the candidacy </ i>

80
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:16,719
<I> of Brussels as the headquarters
of the main insititutions of the Union </ i>

81
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:22,550
<I> and later the NATO
and other institutions as well. </ I>

82
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,894
<I> So many great works of the time have
targeted the transformation of the city </ i>

83
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:32,454
<I> and of the heart of the city
as a work area, an office space, </ i>

84
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:36,145
<I> a great project that emerged
at roughly the same time, </ i>

85
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:40,356
<I> a little bit after the Expo 58 is
the transformation of the northern district, </ i>

86
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:50,112
<I> the Manhattan plan, a symptomatic name.
Speed projects, of high-speed, </ i>

87
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:56,122
<I> highway projects were concretely embodied
in these large urban projects </ i>

88
00:07:56,122 --> 00:08:00,562
<I> since in this northern district
were to cross highways </ i>

89
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:06,552
<I> from the north of Europe and were
expected to join ... to connect the south, </ i>

90
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:12,052
<I> along the East/West highway
coming from Ostend to Germany. </ I>

91
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:20,885
So these changes led to the development,

92
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:25,453
as in many cities at the time,
of peri-urbanization

93
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:30,903
since the center was devalued,
or at least devalued

94
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:37,821
regarding the housing, it was just supposed to be a place of business

95
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:42,183
and a place of commerce.
And the peri-urbanization,

96
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:48,061
which had already begun in the 19th
century in Brussels for the categories of the

97
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:53,061
middle and upper classes, was amplified from that time.

98
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:58,438
<I> One of the great achievement of the
Expo 58 was the construction of the viaduct </ i>

99
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:03,115
<I> on the Boulevard Leopold 2 that
leads to the Basilica of Koekelberg and beyond </ i>

100
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:07,905
<I> to the North Sea. It's called
the Sea Viaduct precisely </ i>

101
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:13,350
<I> and allowed drivers to
spend a day at the beach. </ I>

102
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,775
<I> The viaduct was fairly quickly decried
as it faced the bedrooms </ i>

103
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:26,225
<I> of local residents that
lined up this work of art. </ i>

104
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:30,475
<I> So, in the 80s, it was
decided to demolish it </ i>

105
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:35,538
<I> and to build in its place
a tunnel. Brussels and Belgium, </ i>

106
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:40,263
<I> has a long tradition of underground
so it was an opportunity to build </ i>

107
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:47,588
<I> the longest road tunnel in Belgium.
And, in reality, also to increase </ i>

108
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:53,078
<I> the road ability of this artery,
since instead of the viaduct </ i>

109
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:58,853
<I> which had  3 lanes,
which was fueled regarding the importance </ i>

110
00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:03,693
<I>of  traffic with two bands in one way
and in the other, a tunnel was created </ i>

111
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:06,804
<I> with twice two bands
while readjusting the area </ i>

112
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:13,777
<I> to the benefit of traffic. </ I>
So this is a first evolution

113
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:18,867
but which does not really manifest a paradigm shift.

114
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:24,156
The recent destruction of Reyers
Viaduct is probably more part

115
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:28,689
of a change in design of the
development of the urban space

116
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:31,075
and of the urban public space insofar

117
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:34,830
this destruction was not accompanied by the decision,

118
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,724
or on the contrary, led to the decision to give up

119
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:43,440
digging a new tunnel. So the road capacity will be reduced

120
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:51,309
there and the area will be developed
into an urban boulevard, according to this logic

121
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:54,926
however, of modal segregation, where
there will be a space for pedestrians,

122
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:59,096
a space for cyclists,
a space for cars.
