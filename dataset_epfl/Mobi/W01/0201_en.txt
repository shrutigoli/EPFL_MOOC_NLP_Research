Hello everyone.
Today in this video, we will look at the transformation of the territory through mobility.
Or more precisely, we will approach the question of the gradual transformation of oppositions between urban territories and territories rather countryfied, ie. the opposition between town and country.
We will focus on the transformation of this opposition to the urban reign.
<I> This video will allow us in particular </ i>
<I> to understand why this peaceful Swiss village, </ i>
<I> not far from Lake Geneva, is not a village. </ I>
<I> Because here, you have before you a picture of FÃ©chy, </ i>
<I> which is a village in the canton of Vaud, </ i>
<i> So on the Lake Geneva </ i>
<I> and we could paraphrase RenÃ© Magritte, saying: </ i>
<I> "This is not a village. "</ I>
<I> The territorial space frame is built </ i>
<I> from many ingredients. </ I>
<I> There are three of these ingredients whose arrangement has changed </ i>
<I> and the modification of this arrangement led to the development </ i>
<I> what might be called urban or rather, what is called urban. </ I>
<I> The three constitutive dimensions of the space frame territories </ i>
<I> whose reports have been transformed </ i>
<I> are the morphology, the functional centralities </ i>
<I> and the lifestyles. </ I>
<I> Until the 60s, </ i>
<I> these three dimensions overlapped by snapping-in. </ I>
<I> They are regionalised, </ i>
<I> they draw contrasts between the city and the countryside. </ I>
<I> To give you an example, </ i>
<I> when you see, from the air, a territory, </ i>
<I> we can say at this time - </ i>
<I> we could do with the exercise with aerial photographs - </ i>
<I> we can say at this time if it is a small or a big city </ i>
<I> or a village. </ I>
<I> One can have an idea, depending on its size, </ i>
<I> of its centrality. </ I>
<I> And then we can also say, knowing where people live, </ i>
<I> what is their lifestyle, </ i>
<I> someone who lives in a particular village, </ i>
<I> a small town </ i>
<I> will have its daily life </ i>
<I> taking place in this space, in this village, </ i>
<I> and will be a lifestyle turned to vicinity. </ I>
Since the 1960s, there is an opening of possibilities of location, in space, spurred by the development of rapid transit systems, firstly by road systems, highways, then by railway systems and also more recently with the development of remote communication systems.
So under the impulse of these developments, of these mobilities potentials, the three dimensions that we just talked about, they are gradually rearranging themselves and transform the territory.
Morphological boundaries fade and we assist to what is called a urban sprawl.
<I> In many urban areas, </ i>
<I> it is now very difficult to say where a city begins and stops. </ I>
<I> You have before you the example of the outskirt of Algiers, </ i>
<I> very clever is the one who can finally say to us </ i>
<i> where Algiers begins </ i>
<I> and where Algiers ends, in functional terms. </ I>
Lifestyles are gradually transforming and they detach themselves from spatial proximity.
<I> The essential of one's daily life doesn't take place anymore </ i>
<I> in the vicinity of one's home, </ i>
<I> but in much larger spaces </ i>
<I> for a large part of the population, </ i>
<I> and spaces which are also discontinuous. </ I>
<I> You have here an illustration. </ I>
<I> We're on this picture </ i>
<i> on the outskirts of Prato in Tuscany. </ I>
Functionally, cities radiation is recomposed internationally, which is called the phenomenon of metropolisation.
<I> You have this picture of the district of Lille Europe, </ i>
<I> which is located near the eponymous train station, so of Lille Europe. </ I>
<I> It's a neighborhood that was built there fifteen years ago </ i>
<I> and which aims to make Lille an international metropolis, </ i>
<I> so it has to attract </ i>
<I> a number of corporate headquarters, </ i>
<i> of central equipment </ i>
<I> that allow Lille to expand beyond its traditional hinterland. </ I>
When speaking of the transformation of oppositions between the city and the country and of the advent of the urban reign or of the development of the urban phenomenon, there is often a sort of a misunderstanding that emerges and on which I would really like to insist, the advent of the so-called urban does not mean that we live in a kind of a great metropolis that could be called Europe in which the different countries and the different cities would be the neighborhoods.
Urban does not kill spatial differentiations, does not kill territories, all is not urban.
The whole of Europe is not urban and I think we need to emphasize this aspect, we are not facing a phenomenon completely encompassing that would swallow that whole continents.
If we now return to the place of mobility in the phenomena which I have just mentioned.
So we have seen that the lifestyles, morphologies and centralities now maintain different relationship than they did in the past.
While in the past, we witnessed snappings-in, a little according to the logic of Russian dolls, now there is much more a system where finally the relations between lifestyles, morphologies and centralities are built by mobility.
Mobility, is actually what makes the link, which allows to understand the relationships between these three ingredients, establishing territorial reinforcement.
It is for this reason that one can no longer say that the small town that I showed you earlier,
FÃ©chy, to not name it,
<I> that FÃ©chy is no longer a village. </ I>
<I> FÃ©chy looks like a village </ i>
<I> morphologically, </ i> it has all the attributes of the village if we look at a picture of FÃ©chy, from the air, it seems that it is a village,
<I> but FÃ©chy but features the lifestyle of these people. </ I>
<I> And the inhabitants of FÃ©chy fit into the great scale. </ I>
<I> If I take the previous illustration, </ i>
<I> their way of life fits in much wider areas. </ I>
<I> They will work tens of kilometers away </ i>
<I> in Lausanne or Geneva. </ I>
<I> They make their purchases in large shopping centers </ i>
<I> as we have seen earlier in the suburb of Prato in Italy, </ i>
<I> so they do not fit </ i> basically
<I> in a micro-local level. </ I>
<I> Finally, FÃ©chy residents are characterized </ i>
<I> by socio-professional categories </ i>
<I> that are related to metropolisation phenomenon. </ I>
<I> The Lake Geneva region, </ i>
<I> the Greater Geneva or the Lake Geneva region </ i>
<I> is strongly marked by this metropolization phenomenon. </ I>
<I> This results in the presence </ i>
<I> of many organizations and multinational companies. </ I>
<I> And in a village like FÃ©chy, there is a strong presence of managerial staffs </ i>
<I> who work in precisely this type of business. </ I>
That's what I wanted to show you about the transformation of the territory through mobility taking as a thread this story of a little village.
I wish you a good result of course.
