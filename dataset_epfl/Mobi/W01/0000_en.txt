Hello and welcome to our course <i> Mobility and Urban Planning </ i>
This course aims to introduce the issue of links, often paradoxical and complex, between territory and travel.
<I> In particular, it offers to link social science approaches </ i>
<I> and those of urbanism regarding these issues. </ I>
The course is given by three teachers: Bernard DeclÃ¨ve to my right,
<I> a Professor of Urban Planning at the Catholic University of Louvain la Neuve </ i>
Aniss Mezoued to my left, a doctor
<I> and a researcher at UCL and at EPFL. </ I>
And myself, Vincent Kaufmann, professor of urban sociology
<I> and mobility analysis at EPFL. </ I>
This course is the result of exchanges
<I> and collaboration between EPFL and UCL for ten years, </ i>
<I> both in terms of teaching than on research </ i>
<I> The examples and case studies presented </ i>
<I> came from research conducted by the two teams. </ I>
<I> They naturally concern Belgium and Switzerland, but also  </ i> other countries like France, Spain, Germany, Algeria, Colombia, Chile.
<I> Several guests from our research teams </ i>
<I> come and present their work during the sessions: </ i>
<I> Mariochi Coleccia, Marie-Paule Thomas, SÃ©bastien Munafo, Emmanuel Ravalet, </ i>
<I> Vincent Stephanie Geslin, Regina Witter, Gordana Micic and Yafiza Zorro. </ I>
On the documentary level, the course also appealed to reports from Radio TÃ©lÃ©vision Suisse, to audiovisual archives of Belgian television, and to the <i>  Forum Mobile Lives website </ i>. which is a research institute on mobility.
We cordially invite you to subscribe to the newsletter of
<I> Mobile Lives Forum as we engage in the course </ i>
<I>  contents of its website, which presents every month </ i>
<I> discussions on mobility and social issues </ i>
<I> as controversies, interviews, reports or account reports of research. </ I>
The course is organized into seven modules, which correspond to seven weeks of classes where you will find four to six videos of 10 to 25 minutes, as well as readings, graphics, quizzes and exercises.
The course will be an introductory round of interactions between mobility
<I> and urban dynamics, and will propose methodological and operational tools </ i>
<I> to apprehend and regulate mobility. </ I>
<I> The course thereby shows learners the interrelations between city and mobility, </ i>
<I> and between urban space and travel flows, while offering a renewed vision </ i>
<I> of transport and of its impact on the territory and ways of life. </ I>
<I> To follow this course, there are no prerequisites, </ i> except motivation and interest regarding issues of mobility and urban planning.
It may be followed by much of undergraduate students, master students, doctoral students or continuing-education students from various disciplines.
<I> We hope to have aroused your interest in the course </ i>
<I> and hope to meet your learning needs. </ I>
<I> We look forward to seeing you online. </ I>
