1
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:06,378
Welcome.

2
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:09,673
Welcome to the Plasma Physics course
of the EPFL.

3
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:14,841
In the last module, we introduced
the Boltzmann equation.

4
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,209
When we have introduced
this equation

5
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:23,734
we have separated the long range
forces that are associated

6
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:29,951
to collective effects from the short range
forces, the ones that are associated

7
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,792
with the collisions.

8
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:39,130
Now, let me first say that in a plasma,
according to the definition of plasmas,

9
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:45,331
long range collective effect
have to dominate over collisions.

10
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:50,218
However, despite this effect, 
collisions may still play

11
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,845
an important role.

12
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:53,858
And therefore it's worth,

13
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:59,609
looking at those and studying 
the effect of collisions in a plasma.

14
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:07,265
In the present module,
we will give a basic introduction

15
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:08,591
of collisions.

16
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:15,671
Now, the particles present in a plasma
can collide both with neutrals

17
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:18,968
and with other charged particles.

18
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,581
The most interesting collisions
are the ones against

19
00:01:22,713 --> 00:01:24,377
other charged particles:

20
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:28,106
<i>Coulomb collisions</i>, and this is what
we will focus our attention on.

21
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:33,284
We will therefore introduce
the basic concept of

22
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:38,159
<i>collision frequency cross-section</i>
that is useful to analyze

23
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:41,388
the Coulomb collisions in a plasma.

24
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,513
The first thing that we want to do
is to give a simple estimate

25
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:49,637
of the Coulomb collision frequency.

26
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,294
It's something that we have
already mentioned

27
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:56,387
while giving a rigorous definition
of a plasma.

28
00:01:57,432 --> 00:02:00,219
Let's do it now a bit more rigorously.

29
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:06,949
Let's suppose that we have an electron
that moves and goes across

30
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:13,070
a heavy ion with a charge Z e.

31
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,563
Because of the Coulomb interaction
that exists between these two

32
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:23,491
charged particles, then the trajectory
of the electron which is initially

33
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,824
moving in this direction,

34
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,798
will be deviated.

35
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:34,940
We will call ve to initial velocity
of electrons.

36
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:38,248
And we will denote with b

37
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:46,538
the distance that I have 
pointed out here.

38
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,155
Basically, the impact parameter
is the shortest distance

39
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:56,809
at which the electron and the ion
would be if the electron's trajectory

40
00:02:56,858 --> 00:02:58,623
was not modified.

41
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:05,589
Let's try to estimate when the deviation
due to this Coulomb force

42
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:07,597
starts to be important.

43
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,561
Well, what we have to do 
is to evaluate ratio

44
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:19,661
between the Coulomb interaction
energy and the kinetic energy.

45
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:29,281
That is for the kinetic energy me ve²

46
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:35,704
and for Coulomb interaction energy
this will be given by

47
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:41,009
the product of the two charges
of the two particles divided by

48
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:44,852
(4 π ε₀ b).

49
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,069
The deviation of the trajectory
will start to be important

50
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,038
when this ratio is about 1.

51
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:59,293
This means that the impact
parameters at which Coulomb

52
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,849
interaction becomes important
can be estimated

53
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:12,256
and will be equal to 
Ze²/(4 π ε₀ me ve²).

54
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:17,502
And that this quantity for reasons
that we will explain later

55
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:24,829
has actually a name, 
it's called b_π/2.

56
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:29,494
At this point, we can evaluate
the Coloumb cross-section,

57
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:37,092
which is the area effectively seen
by the electron moving

58
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:50,024
towards this ion and that can be
estimated as π (b_π/2)².

59
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:57,037
We will call this cross section
-as it is associated to the b_π/2

60
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:01,587
parameter- as σ_π/2
and therefore using the expression

61
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,736
that we have just given, 
it will be given by

62
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:21,028
σ_π/2 = 
( π Z² e⁴) / {(4 π ε₀)² me² ve⁴}

63
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,956
From these we can derive
a collision frequency [ 𝛎_π/2 ]

64
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:28,348
that is

65
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:35,764
given by the product
of the target density and

66
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:39,896
the incoming electron velocity
and the cross-section,

67
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:45,317
which, by plugging in all the numbers
we have put here will be given by

68
00:05:47,403 --> 00:06:04,802
𝛎_π/2 = 
( ni π Z² e⁴)/(4 π ε₀)² / (me² ve³)

69
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:09,582
So we actually have some questions
that have to be associated

70
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,182
with this simple estimate.

71
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:16,049
The first one is: Is this
a correct estimate?

72
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,572
It's so simple if you want.

73
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,700
in particular, what we have supposed
herer is that these are collisions

74
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:35,696
where there is a large deflection
of the electron's trajectory,

75
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:41,805
so in general: do small angle deflections
matter in a plasma, or shall we just account

76
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:46,762
for these large angle deflections
that we have described here?

77
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,847
And second question:

78
00:06:57,844 --> 00:07:01,867
Here we have looked at the interaction
of an electron with one single particle.

79
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:06,505
Instead, as we know there
are many charged particles in a plasma

80
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:11,877
so, how can we take into account properly
the interaction with many particles?

81
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:30,821
These are two questions
that we are going to address

82
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:34,971
with a more rigorous estimate
of the collision frequency.

83
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:40,451
So what we are going to do
is now more a detailed evaluation

84
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:45,026
of how the trajectory of an electron
impacting an ion

85
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:49,565
is modified because of the Coulomb
interaction and then we will take

86
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:54,603
into account that the electron interacts
at the same time

87
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:58,530
with all the other particles present
in the system.

88
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:03,849
So let's go back to our electron
impacting the ion.

89
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:20,017
We will denote with θ 
the angle between the incoming

90
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:24,152
velocity and the velocity
after the collision

91
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:28,538
more precisely we will denote
with θ this angle.

92
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:34,312
Now for two particles such as the electron
and the ion that we are considering

93
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:36,784
that are interacting
through Coulomb force.

94
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:49,467
One can show from the conservation
of energy and angular momentum,

95
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:55,138
-we won't do all the steps but this is
a well known result

96
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,870
from classical mechanics -

97
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:08,316
[that] in the limit of me/mi << 1,

98
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,591
from the conservation
of the energy and the angular momentum,

99
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:16,046
then one can show that
tan (θ/2)

100
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:29,589
is equal to
Z e² / (4 π ε₀ me ve² b)

101
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:33,722
Now the interesting thing
is that this quantity,

102
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:41,666
Z e² / (4 π ε₀ me ve²)
is exactly what we have defined before

103
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,839
as b_π/2.

104
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,579
So this tangent can be written as
tan (θ/2) = b_π/2 / b.

105
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:54,769
And now the meaning of b_π/2 
becomes clear.

106
00:09:54,946 --> 00:10:02,777
In fact, when b is equal to b_π/2 , 
then it's found that

107
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:05,658
tan (θ/2) = 1.

108
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,634
Therefore, θ = π/2 .

109
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,569
So b_π/2 corresponds
to the impact parameter

110
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:19,601
at which the electron is deflected
by 90 degrees.

111
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:25,712
Now, taking this into account,
the deflection due to each collision,

112
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:28,561
we notice that in a plasma
there are interactions

113
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:33,693
with many particles, so what we want
to address is: What is the cumulative

114
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:35,631
effect of these collisions?

115
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,342
So more precisely, what we have
is for example an electron

116
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:56,580
which is going towards a plasma.

117
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:08,942
And what we want to know
-to learn about- is how much this velocity

118
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,777
will be deflected because of
the interaction of this electron

119
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:15,453
with all the ions present in the plasma.

120
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:20,917
In general, we will have that,

121
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:23,836
because of the symmetry
of these one-to-one collisions,

122
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,815
that the [average] deviation
of the perpendicular electron

123
00:11:28,924 --> 00:11:31,669
velocity will be equal to zero.
[ < ∆<b>v</b>⊥e > = 0]

124
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:33,889
However,

125
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:41,580
the spreading of the perpendicular
electron velocity will not

126
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:43,470
be equal to zero.
[ < (∆v⊥e)² > ≠ 0]

127
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:50,106
Here with perpendicular [⊥] and 
parallel [‖], I mean perp. and para.

128
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:53,396
to the initial velocity of the electron.

129
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:05,247
Now, if we want to evaluate
what is the spreading

130
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:08,937
of the perpendicular velocity
as a function of time,

131
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,267
well this derivative will be due to
the interaction of the electrons

132
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:28,708
with the particles that are all located
at different impact parameters,

133
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:38,967
and more precisely, we will count
particles that are in the differential

134
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:50,809
cross-section that goes from b to b+db
and the number of these collisions

135
00:12:50,892 --> 00:12:58,699
will be equal to the target density
times ve, the initial velocity

136
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:03,975
times the differential cross-section
that is this area among

137
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:10,767
the two orange lines 
and is given by 2π b db

138
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:19,649
and then each collision will give
a certain (∆v⊥e)²

139
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:24,243
and then we will have to integrate
over all possible impact parameters.

140
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,008
Now, to make some progress,
let me point out that this quantity

141
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,646
can be expressed by knowing
what is the deviation

142
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:40,959
due to the Coulomb force,
and in fact, (∆v⊥e)²

143
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:48,836
is equal to ve² sin²θ.

144
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:56,499
And now we can use one of the properties
of the sinus function

145
00:13:56,576 --> 00:14:02,288
that is sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2),

146
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:18,944
and then, dividing and multiplying 
by cos²(θ/2), this is equal to

147
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:27,949
4 ve² tan²(θ/2) cos⁴(θ/2)

148
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:35,609
This again, using 
trigonometric identities

149
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:40,273
can be written
in terms of tan²(θ/2).

150
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:57,595
The next thing of this expression
is that tan²(θ/2)

151
00:14:57,737 --> 00:14:59,887
can be expressed in terms of b.

152
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:05,624
Therefore this integral becomes
the integral...

153
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,574
the integral of this function
that depends,

154
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:26,802
as we have seen here, only from
tan²(θ/2) that we have

155
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,670
expressed in terms of
( b_π/2 / b ).

156
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:36,015
Now what are the limits of integration
of this function?

157
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:45,322
Well, there are no issues for b going
to zero unless quantum effects

158
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:50,774
become important but we have excluded
to take those into account

159
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:56,531
in our system so 
the integral will go from zero to...

160
00:15:56,945 --> 00:16:01,716
if you look here, for b
that goes to infinity,

161
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:07,505
what you actually have is an integral
that will diverge.

162
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,329
Why is that?

163
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,740
Well, it's because we have assumed

164
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,916
that the Coulomb interaction 
will be valid for all distances

165
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:22,933
but as we know, in a plasma
the Coulomb potential

166
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,691
is screened at a distance

167
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,759
that is compatible to the Debye length
[λD] and therefore there are no

168
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:35,009
1-to-1 particles [interactions] at impact
parameters that are greater than λD.

169
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,754
More precise calculations

170
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:42,566
would have required to evaluate
this expression by taking to account

171
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:46,151
a screened Coulomb force which
we did not do,

172
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:53,808
so we can replace this by basically
limiting our integral to the Debye length

173
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,007
of our plasma.

174
00:16:56,494 --> 00:17:03,493
And this integral can actually be solved
analytically, and in the limit of

175
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:11,666
λD >> b_π/2 is found to be

176
00:17:11,735 --> 00:17:12,713
equal to...

177
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,226
to this quantity which depends
on ion density, the electron velocity

178
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:30,563
the b_π/2 parameter
and the logarithm of the Debye length

179
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:35,256
divided by b_π/2,
(the π/2 impact parameter).

180
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,070
Well, this is a key result
that allows us to make

181
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:42,064
three observations.

182
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:49,390
The first one is related to
the evaluation of what is the change

183
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:53,719
in the parallel velocity
of the electron beam

184
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:59,176
due to these collisions,
to this ensemble of collisions.

185
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:05,126
This can be done by noticing that
the electrons do not lose much energy.

186
00:18:08,914 --> 00:18:11,592
So we can actually
make three observations.

187
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:18,476
The first one leads to the estimate
of what is the change of the parallel

188
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:22,783
electron velocity because of the multiple
interactions with the ion

189
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:24,175
present in a plasma.

190
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:25,134
Why is that?

191
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:32,696
Well, this is because the electrons
impacting such heavy particles,

192
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:38,171
can be assimilated with
the collision between for example,

193
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:42,091
of a ball against a wall.
When you throw a ball against a wall,

194
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:48,275
the ball changes considerably
it's velocity, but if the collision

195
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,978
is elastic, then the ball is reflected
with the module of the velocity

196
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:56,271
that is similar to the

197
00:18:56,796 --> 00:18:59,550
incoming one, before the collision.

198
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:06,278
Therefore we have that
because of conservation of the energy,

199
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:08,127
of the electron energy,

200
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:17,105
that the kinetic energy,
after the collision, that is given

201
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:21,446
by the sum of the parallel energy
which has been deviated

202
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:25,175
by ∆v‖e, and 
the perpendicular energy [(∆v⊥e)²]

203
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:28,202
is equal to the initial kinetic energy.

204
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:36,708
From which by developing the square,
and eliminating ve² and ve²,

205
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:38,769
we get that...

206
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:54,151
ve (∆v‖e)+ 1/2 (∆v⊥e)² = 0.

207
00:19:56,274 --> 00:20:01,114
In developing this expression,
we have neglected (∆v‖e)²;

208
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:06,048
this is valid for collisions
leading to small deviations.

209
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:09,705
As we will see in a few moments, 
it's a reasonable assumption

210
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:13,093
for most of the collisions
that occur in a plasma.

211
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:20,176
From which, by inserting
into this expression, we obtain that

212
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:40,538
d/dt(∆v‖e) = -4 π ni ve²(b_π/2)² ...

213
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,679
and this logarithm:
... ln(λD/b_π/2)

214
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:52,512
As a matter of fact, ln(λD/b_π/2)

215
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:56,506
is coming back and it has a name,

216
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,142
we give it a name in plasma physics.

217
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:02,881
We introduced this so called
<i>Coulomb logarithm</i>

218
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:10,159
that we will denote as ln Λ
capital lambda,

219
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:20,698
and it is equal to 
ln(λD/b_π/2)

220
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,462
And while λD can change a lot,

221
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,938
b_π/2 can change a lot.

222
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:32,572
However, the logarithm of the ratio
is fairly constant

223
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:37,506
throughout all the plasmas
that we have in the universe.

224
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:43,748
In fact, in most plasmas ln Λ
is between 15 and 25.

225
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:53,021
The third observation is relative
to what we have just derived now.

226
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:57,677
The variation of the parallel energy
can be expressed in terms

227
00:21:57,677 --> 00:21:59,535
of a frequency.

228
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:06,935
That is the collision frequency
of the electrons against the ions [ 𝛎ₑᵢ ]

229
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,387
times the incoming velocity.

230
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:15,668
Where this collision frequency
of the electrons against the ions

231
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:19,981
is given by the expression
that we can derive from here.

232
00:22:25,505 --> 00:22:29,324
And I realize that I forgot 
a squared here.

233
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:36,697
Now the collision frequency
is associated with

234
00:22:36,697 --> 00:22:41,685
a cross-section through the formula

235
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,867
that follows:
[ 𝛎ₑᵢ = ni σₑᵢ ve ]

236
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:46,727
We have that the collision
[cross-section],

237
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:51,854
the effective collision [cross-section]
for the incoming electrons

238
00:22:51,922 --> 00:22:55,723
impacting against the ions
is equal to

239
00:22:55,813 --> 00:23:06,883
σₑᵢ = 4π (b_π/2)² ln Λ

240
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:13,238
And now it's interesting to compare
this cross-section with the one

241
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:18,955
that we had evaluated just before.
It was the cross-section relative

242
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:24,242
to short impact parameters
π (b_π/2)².

243
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:30,843
This ratio will be equal to...

244
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:34,844
π (b_π/2)²

245
00:23:37,565 --> 00:23:40,270
divided by what we have just found here.

246
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:52,549
And this is an easy ratio to evaluate
because it will be given by 1/ (4 ln Λ) .

247
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:57,288
The Coulomb logarithm is of the order
of 20, times 4 it will be

248
00:23:57,342 --> 00:23:59,969
of the order of 10⁻² .

249
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:03,390
It's much, much smaller than one.

250
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:06,178
Conclusion?

251
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:11,616
The conclusion is that
small angle deflections,

252
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:19,623
-small angle collisions- play a dominant
role with respect to large deflections

253
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,445
in a plasma,

254
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:25,934
as this ratio is much smaller than one.

255
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:32,808
This is consistent with what we have done
earlier when we have neglected (∆v‖e)².

256
00:24:32,994 --> 00:24:37,669
To conclude the present module,
let me say that what we have done

257
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:42,253
was to introduce the main basic
properties of Coulomb collisions

258
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:43,708
in a plasma.

259
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:47,754
We have started from a simple order
of magnitude estimate

260
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:53,199
and then we went more precise
to study what the cross-sections are

261
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,679
and frequency of Coulomb collisions
in a plasma.

262
00:24:56,557 --> 00:25:00,421
We are now ready, -this is what we will do
in the next module-

263
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:04,878
to look at what the consequences 
of collisions are in a plasma.
