1
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:09,511
In the past module we have introduced
the basic properties of collisions,

2
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:11,966
and Coulomb collisions in a plasma.

3
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:15,253
We have now all the elements to study,

4
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:18,055
to analyze the collisional
processes in plasma,

5
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:20,237
and we will focus on three of those.

6
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:26,309
The first one is the slowing down
of a beam that passes through a plasma.

7
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:29,576
The second collisional process
that we will look at

8
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,756
is the plasma resistivity,

9
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:37,069
and then we will order the collisional
time scales present in a plasma.

10
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,990
More precisely, what we have evaluated

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,025
was the slowing down
of one single particle

12
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:46,743
with the ve velocity,

13
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:50,611
and this [d/dt (∆v‖e)], 
which is the variation

14
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:53,893
of the parallel electron velocity

15
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:57,953
is equal to the electron-ion
collision frequency [ 𝛎ₑᵢ ]

16
00:00:57,953 --> 00:01:00,477
times the electron velocity [ve].

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,597
This is equal to, we have found,

18
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:19,074
-4 π ni ve² (b_π/2)² ln(Λ)

19
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,877
And inserting now the expression
we have for b_π/2

20
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,375
this will be equal to

21
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,183
this expression here.

22
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:40,130
This formula here actually
allows us to evaluate

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,333
the slowing down
of an electron beam in a plasma.

24
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:03,261
We will focus on a beam

25
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:07,587
that is characterized by having
a Maxwellian distribution function

26
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:16,435
that is in the direction
parallel to the incoming beam,

27
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:19,957
to the velocity of the incoming beam.

28
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:24,442
The distribution function
will be given by the density

29
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:26,667
times a normalization factor

30
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,749
times this exponential where ue
is the collective velocity of the beam,

31
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:36,849
the average velocity of the beam.

32
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:41,584
We can draw this distribution function.

33
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:46,581
It's a function of v‖e,

34
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:50,481
u* will be localized here,

35
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:57,315
and the Maxwellian distribution function
will develop around ue.

36
00:02:58,156 --> 00:03:01,619
We will make the assumption that ue

37
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:05,924
is much smaller than v thermal e [vthe].

38
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:10,730
Therefore, if you want,
the spreading of this Maxwellian

39
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:18,612
is much larger than the average 
electron velocity,

40
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,768
Now in order to evaluate
the slowing down of the beam,

41
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:28,839
what we have to estimate
is d/dt ue,

42
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:35,046
the variation of the average velocity
of the electrons that constitute our beam,

43
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:37,128
and this will be equal to

44
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:44,318
the frequency that
we have just introduced here, [ 𝛎ₑᵢ ]

45
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,080
the electron-ion collision [frequency] 
times the parallel electron velocity

46
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:54,376
averaged over the distribution
function of the beam.

47
00:03:54,994 --> 00:04:03,846
In other words, this will be equal to 
-1/n₀

48
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:10,798
and then this quantity averaged
over the distribution function,

49
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:19,891
and in the case that
we are looking at here,

50
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:25,619
of ue << vthe ,

51
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:36,695
this is approximately equal
to -< 𝛎ₑᵢ > ue, where ...

52
00:04:54,274 --> 00:05:01,692
... where this is the result of the averaged
collision frequency that you find

53
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,174
if you carry out this
integral in the limit

54
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:10,987
of ue << vthe,
as we have given here.

55
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:14,551
Okay?
This collision frequency gives

56
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:20,300
the slowing down of the electron beam
due to the interaction with the ions.

57
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,225
There are, however, also collisions
of this electron beam

58
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:29,265
with the electrons
that are present in a plasma.

59
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:38,130
So in general, in this case of electrons
scattering against other electrons,

60
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:44,262
one cannot assume any more
that the target particles are fixed,

61
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:47,994
and the calculation
of the scattering angle

62
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,446
has to be done again.

63
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:55,855
In general the analysis
is more complicated.

64
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:06,515
However, we expect that
the deflection of the electrons

65
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:13,015
impacting against electrons
will be similar to the one of

66
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,835
an the electron impacting against an ion.

67
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:22,067
And without carrying out
all the detailed calculation,

68
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:29,264
we can write that the electron-electron
collision frequency [𝛎ₑₑ]

69
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:36,167
can be estimated
to be given by this expression,

70
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:41,485
which basically corresponds
to the electron-ion collision frequency,

71
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:47,512
taking into account that
ions and electrons

72
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:50,308
may have different densities,

73
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:56,848
and that [ions] have Z times
the electron charge.

74
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:04,280
Okay, now we have all the elements
to evaluate resistivity in a plasma.

75
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,661
Let's imagine we have a plasma,
we apply an electric field,

76
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:12,204
charged particles will start to move,
responding to this electric field.

77
00:07:12,204 --> 00:07:16,956
However, their motion will be slowed down
because of the presence of collisions.

78
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:21,992
And these overall dynamics
can be represented

79
00:07:21,992 --> 00:07:24,876
as an effective resistivity of the plasma.

80
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,155
So let's evaluate this resistivity.

81
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:32,171
Our plasma will be made by ions,

82
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,486
and electrons.

83
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:46,837
Now, we apply an electric field, E,

84
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:51,152
and particles will respond
to this electric field.

85
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:56,646
The ions will start to move
in the direction of the electric field,

86
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,596
along the electric field,

87
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:03,896
while the electrons will be pushed
against the electric field.

88
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:08,688
This effectively will result
in a current in a plasma.

89
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:18,254
Electrons and ions will tend
to respond in a different way.

90
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:21,399
As a matter of fact,
the ions are much heavier,

91
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,318
and they will respond
to the electric field

92
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:29,783
less promptly than the electrons.

93
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:32,106
Therefore, what we will do,

94
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:36,723
we will focus on the electron dynamics
which have a higher mobility.

95
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:44,874
And the electrons will satisfy
-will follow- an equation of motion,

96
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:52,399
which states that they will be accelerated
by the electric force,

97
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,924
and then slowed down by collisions,

98
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,218
collisions with the ions.

99
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:04,559
Where the collisions [term] with the ions
-we have just evaluated-

100
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:16,262
is given by the effective collision
frequency for electrons against the ions

101
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:21,424
that we have evaluated
in the limit of the drift velocity,

102
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:25,486
so the velocity
responsible for the current,

103
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:29,642
being much smaller
than the thermal velocity.

104
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:34,968
Now, in order to make some progress,
let me make a couple of observations.

105
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,791
The first thing is that
after a transient,

106
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,739
where particles are accelerated,
and then slowed down by collision,

107
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:46,311
there will be a steady state

108
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:50,425
where the d/dt term
will be equal to zero.

109
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:07,624
The second thing we notice is that in 
general, j [current density] is written

110
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:13,406
as - ne e (ue -ui)

111
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:21,697
And if we multiply this equation now
by e, we obtain

112
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:37,445
this expression, where we have
explicitly written the Rei term,

113
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:42,358
and what we have here, actually,
is the current.

114
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:49,319
This will be actually given by,
actually equal to me,

115
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:52,701
collision frequency and current,

116
00:10:53,225 --> 00:11:05,243
which implies that E is equal to
E = me <𝛎ₑᵢ>/(e² ne) j

117
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:11,015
Now, we can compare this
with Ohm's law that we know

118
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:17,887
from medium, from all the other media,
from metals, etc.,

119
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:23,029
It says that E = η j

120
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:26,764
from which we obtain,
by comparing these two expressions,

121
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:31,638
and introducing the evaluation
of the collision frequency

122
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:34,374
that we have given previously,

123
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:38,166
we obtain that the resistivity
in a plasma is given

124
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:52,646
by this expression, which represents

125
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:58,128
the plasma resistivity
due to electron-ion collisions.

126
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:08,037
Two observations here.

127
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:14,417
The first one is related to the dependence
of the resistivity of the temperature,

128
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,951
and what we observe is that

129
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,645
the resistivity decreases
with the temperature.

130
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:26,762
This is fairly surprising, if you want,
if you think about metals,

131
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:30,229
the resistivity definitely increases
with the temperature.

132
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:33,523
And second observation
is that this resistivity

133
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:37,046
is independent of n, the density.

134
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,426
Nowhere is there density,
the plasma density.

135
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:45,416
Why is that?
Well, basically the reason is

136
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,104
that while the number of carriers,

137
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:51,146
of current carriers,
increases with the density,

138
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,438
also the collisions
increase with the density,

139
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:59,732
and the net effect will be that
the resistivity is independent of density.

140
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:04,642
We have evaluated
the effective collision frequency

141
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:10,407
related to the slowing down
of an electron beam entering a plasma.

142
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:15,551
We've also mentioned that
the same beam can be slowed down

143
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:18,506
by interaction with the other electrons.

144
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:21,929
There are many collision frequencies
that we can think of,

145
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:27,513
ions impacting against other ions,
or ions against electrons,

146
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:30,754
and also we may be
interested, for example,

147
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:34,948
not only in slowing down and therefore
the exchange of momentum,

148
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,728
but rather on the exchange of energy.

149
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:40,637
There are a number
of collision frequencies,

150
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:45,348
so what I'll try to do now is to give
another view of all of them.

151
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:49,191
The first collision frequency
that we have just introduced

152
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:52,577
was the collision frequency
of the electrons against the ions,

153
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:57,003
and this is one that
we have evaluated rigorously,

154
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,427
and we have found that it's equal to

155
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:08,299
this expression here.

156
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:12,154
We had briefly mentioned
the electron-electron collisions.

157
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:15,050
We did not go into
the details of the derivation,

158
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,762
we've just shown that
the order of magnitude [ of 𝛎ₑₑ ]

159
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:21,993
should be similar to the one
for the electron-ion.

160
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:28,458
And then, based on the electron-electron
collision frequency,

161
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,587
we can imagine what is
the collision frequency

162
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:36,161
for ions against the ions:
this will basically be made

163
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:39,432
by replacing the electron mass

164
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:41,825
with the ion mass
and the electron temperature,

165
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:43,777
with the ion temperature.

166
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:50,914
Besides, of course,
the density and the charge.

167
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,808
Now, these three collision frequencies

168
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:17,505
are collision frequencies
for momentum exchange.

169
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:20,608
They represent the change of velocity,

170
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:24,638
therefore the change of momentum
of impacting particles.

171
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:30,950
However, particles also exchange energy,

172
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,274
for example, there will be
some amount of energy

173
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:37,318
that is gained by the ions

174
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:40,578
when an electron beam enters in a plasma.

175
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:44,982
What is this energy ?

176
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:51,306
Because of momentum conservation,

177
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:59,216
we will have that me ∆ve
has to be equal to mi ∆vi

178
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:06,951
which implies, for the variation
of energy for ions that

179
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:11,241
1/2 mi (∆vi)² ,

180
00:16:13,563 --> 00:16:16,329
this, by using this expression for ∆vi

181
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:25,347
will be equal to 
me²/(2 mi) (∆ve)²

182
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:34,992
And now, as ∆v⊥e is much larger
than ∆v‖e

183
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:45,570
we will have that this is equal to
me²/(2 mi) (∆v⊥e)²

184
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,805
Why is that?
Why is ∆v⊥e much larger

185
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:53,619
than ∆v‖e?

186
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:57,625
It's because, as we've derived
in the previous module,

187
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:06,576
we have that ve ∆v‖e
is comparable to (∆v⊥e)²,

188
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:11,629
and as 1/2 me ve² is much larger
than the variation of the energy,

189
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:15,502
we will have that ∆v‖e
can be neglected here

190
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:20,252
in the evaluation of ∆ve.

191
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:31,490
Now, as we have evaluated the variation
in time of ∆v⊥e, that is...

192
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:53,687
we will have that the frequency
at which energy is exchanged

193
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,251
is equal to ...

194
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:11,074
which can be estimated,
looking at what is the expression,

195
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:16,172
for the < 𝛎ₑᵢ > collision frequency
for momentum exchange,

196
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:23,158
as < 𝛎E > = 2(me/mi) < 𝛎ₑᵢ >.

197
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:28,919
This is, as a matter of fact,
a much smaller quantity

198
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,533
than the collision frequency
for momentum exchange

199
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:35,408
of electrons with respect to ions.

200
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:41,254
So here we are ready to summarize
the results that we've found

201
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:44,396
throughout these collision frequencies,

202
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:48,509
and if we represent time,

203
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:54,556
we will see that basically there are
three families of collisions.

204
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:58,157
The first one, which is the fastest one,

205
00:18:58,914 --> 00:19:02,212
which corresponds
to a very fast time scale,

206
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:08,127
is the one for electron-ion
and electron-electron collisions.

207
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:15,137
And then, after a time scale
that is of the order of

208
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:17,568
square root of mi/me,

209
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:22,108
that in the case of hydrogen
is about 40,

210
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,183
then we will have
the ion collisions time scale,

211
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:32,320
and then again, after a time scale

212
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,037
a factor of square root of (me/mi),

213
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:43,327
we will have the exchange of energy.

214
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,069
So what will happen in a plasma?

215
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:50,611
Well, in a relatively short time scale,

216
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:56,398
electrons will collide with ions
and with the other electrons.

217
00:19:56,398 --> 00:20:02,215
This will lead to isotropization
of the electron distribution function,

218
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:05,514
which will therefore
tend to a Maxwellian.

219
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:09,884
On a time scale that is longer
by a factor of 40,

220
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:12,867
the ions will collide
with the other ions,

221
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:17,595
basically the ion distribution function
will tend to thermalize,

222
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:22,220
and after a factor of 40 to time scale,

223
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,685
so on a much longer time scale,
by an order of 40,

224
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:31,600
then the electrons and the ions
that have thermalized within each other

225
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,027
will exchange energy,

226
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:38,854
and they will tend to reach
the same temperature.

227
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:43,431
There is still one time scale
that I would like to add,

228
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:45,921
which we did not derive rigorously,

229
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:50,051
however one can find that it's similar

230
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:54,342
to the energy exchange
collision frequency,

231
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:58,884
and it's the one of the ions
colliding against the electrons.

232
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:03,844
So the slowing down
of an ion beam entering a plasma

233
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:06,210
because of collisions with the electrons.

234
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,822
This may be important in some processes
that occur in fusion plasmas.

235
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:17,854
We have considered
a number of collisional processes

236
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:20,166
that take place in a plasma.

237
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,052
Well, let me just summarize
the most important results.

238
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:28,600
The first one concerns
the plasma resistivity we have found,

239
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,911
and this is quite surprising,

240
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:36,357
that the plasma resistivity
decreases with the temperature,

241
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:40,433
and is independent of the density.

242
00:21:41,837 --> 00:21:46,648
We also looked at the collisional
time scales present in a plasma,

243
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:50,720
and we have seen that
the energy equipartition time scale

244
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,537
is about 40 times longer
than the ion collisional time scale,

245
00:21:55,537 --> 00:22:02,095
which in turn is about 40 times longer
than the electron collisional time scale.

246
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:06,627
With this, with the present module,

247
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:12,139
we conclude the detailed analysis
of collisional processes in a plasma.

248
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:18,051
In the next module, we will go back
to the Boltzmann equation,

249
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:23,209
and we will simplify it, assuming
that we are looking at cases

250
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:26,200
where collisions in plasmas
can be neglected,

251
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,749
and therefore deriving
the equation that describes

252
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:33,084
the dynamics of a collisionless plasma.
