1
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:06,180
Welcome.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,739
Welcome to the Plasma Physics course
of EPFL.

3
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:12,840
Today, we're going to talk about
the Vlasov equation.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,261
We will derive the Vlasov equation
from the Boltzmann equation.

5
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:20,680
We will deduce the conservation laws
that can be applied to the Vlasov equation.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,539
We will interpret the Vlasov equation

7
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,268
and we will give some 
formal solution of it.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,299
So, the Boltzmann equation states that 
the derivative with respect to time

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,111
of the distribution function

10
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:41,839
is due to the streaming of particles 
in configuration space,

11
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:46,071
plus the streaming in velocity space,

12
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,742
due to the long-range electric
and magnetic forces,

13
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:05,180
and also taking to account
the short-range forces

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,090
that are associated with collisions.

15
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:16,023
Now as we have seen, collisions
can typically play a less crucial role

16
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:21,192
in determining the dynamics
of a plasma than the long-range forces.

17
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:25,537
Therefore, if collisions can be neglected,

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,366
which is the case where 
the number of particles in a Debye cube

19
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:34,044
is really, really large,

20
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:38,924
larger than what is required 
by the definition of a plasma.

21
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:43,678
So large that the collisions 
can be completely neglected.

22
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:51,577
Then we can set
the collision operator to zero.

23
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,381
We obtain therefore

24
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,001
an equation,

25
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,511
an equation that is called
the <i>Vlasov equation</i>

26
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:31,560
and which is one of the 
fundamental equations in plasma physics.

27
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:34,989
Now, for simplicity of notation,

28
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:46,150
we will denote the electric field
due to long range interactions

29
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:47,898
simply as E ,

30
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:55,959
and similarly the magnetic field 
due to long-range interaction, as B.

31
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,734
We won't forget however,
that the electric and magnetic field

32
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:05,387
that enter in the Vlasov equation are 
the ones due to long-range interactions.

33
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:14,420
The Vlasov equation has then to be coupled
to Maxwell's equations.

34
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:28,275
And in fact, one can define 
the charge density ρ

35
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:34,928
as the sum overall species
present in our system of qs,

36
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,142
the charge of each particle,

37
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:49,738
times the integral
of the velocity space of fs(r, v, t)

38
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:53,568
and similarly for the current density
we will have that j

39
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:58,910
will be given by the sum over all species,

40
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,958
of the charge of each species,

41
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:09,466
times the integral of the velocity
of the particles,

42
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:14,150
averaged according to their distribution.

43
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,201
What are the properties 
of Vlasov equation?

44
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:20,967
Let's give a look at 
the conservation properties

45
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:25,852
for the distribution function 
as it's evolved by the Vlasov equation.

46
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:41,455
The Vlasov equation that we have just 
derived can be written as .... this,

47
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:46,326
and then, there are some 
conservation properties

48
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:53,209
that are satisfied by the Vlasov equation,
that we can study.

49
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:57,635
First of all, there is the conservation
of the total tumber of particles

50
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:01,238
that is satisfied by the Vlasov equation.

51
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:12,527
In fact, if we integrate over all the
configuration space,

52
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:18,057
and over all velocities, 
the Vlasov equation,

53
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:31,035
then we obtain for the time derivative,
the integral over all space,

54
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:38,608
overall velocities, of ∂fs/∂t.

55
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:44,430
Plus for the term related 
to the streaming in configuration space,

56
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:59,398
we have the integral over all space, 
over all velocities of v⋅∂fs/∂r

57
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:03,849
And then, there is 
the streaming term in velocity space.

58
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,597
Now, let's consider
the three terms here separately.

59
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:24,031
Let's start from the first one.

60
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:31,484
We can take out the time derivative
from the two integral signs.

61
00:06:31,484 --> 00:06:38,219
and we will in fact that ∂/∂t
over first the configuration space

62
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:42,898
and over the velocity space of fs.

63
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:49,828
This double integral actually is equal 
to the total number of particles

64
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:57,796
and therefore this is equal 
to the time derivative of Ns,

65
00:06:58,046 --> 00:07:00,013
the total number of particle Ns,

66
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:05,240
For what concern the term related 
to the streaming in phase space.

67
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:11,141
Well, we have seen that we can bring
the velocity term

68
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:14,282
inside the ∂/∂r term.

69
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:21,612
Velocity and configuration space
are two independent variables

70
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:25,538
in coordinates of the phase space.

71
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:31,400
Therefore this can be written as 
the integral over dr

72
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:48,986
and the integral over dv of the 
divergence of v fs. [ ∂/∂r ⋅ (v fs) ]

73
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:53,663
Now we can use the divergence theorem

74
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:58,333
to carry out the integral 
over the configuration space,

75
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:04,147
and this integral will be reconducted 
to an integral over the surface

76
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:06,158
that extends to infinity,

77
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:10,198
and if we assume that
the distribution function

78
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:14,841
-once we push our surface
of interest to infinity-

79
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:22,769
decays to zero, then this integral
will be equal to zero.

80
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,082
Finally, the integral related 
to the streaming of particles

81
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:30,919
in velocity space, will be given by

82
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,930
the double integral 
over the configuration space

83
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,952
and the velocity space...

84
00:08:39,003 --> 00:08:43,987
Now let me do that immediately
we can bring as we have seen,

85
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:48,216
the first term inside 
the ∂/∂v operator

86
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:54,247
because E is independent 
of v and (v × B) is perpendicular to v.

87
00:08:54,247 --> 00:09:00,879
Therefore I can write this 
as the divergence in velocity space

88
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:13,038
of qs/ms ( E + v × B) fs

89
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:19,972
And here, here we can again use 
the divergence theorem

90
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:25,505
to evaluate this volume integral,
volume in velocity space

91
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:29,770
as an integral over a surface 
that extends to infinity

92
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,648
and as there are no particles 
which have an infinite velocity,

93
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:44,041
the surface integral of this term here,
of this expression will be zero,

94
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:48,395
and therefore the whole expression here
will be equal to zero.

95
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:54,197
The conclusion is that 
just one term survives,

96
00:09:54,197 --> 00:10:03,228
that is dNs/dt
which is equal to zero.

97
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:06,586
Particles are conserved.

98
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:12,723
Analogously, 
we wont prove it rigorously,

99
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:17,090
but let me just mention 
that this Vlaslov equation implies

100
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,468
the conservation of momentum.

101
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:28,288
In fact, if we consider 
total momentum of our system,

102
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:33,226
that is equal to the sum 
of the momentum of the particles,

103
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:35,214
associated with particles,

104
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:47,543
plus the momentum of the field 
that is for the momentum of particles

105
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:53,063
equal to the sum of overall species of ms,

106
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:57,837
the integral over the full 
configuration space

107
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:03,885
and the full velocity space 
of the momentum of the particles

108
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:07,603
taking into account v 
according to

109
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:10,244
how they are distributed in free space.

110
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:16,879
Plus, the momentum associated 
with the electric field,

111
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,235
that is the momentum 
of the Poynting vector.

112
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:26,429
that has to be integrated
over all configuration space.

113
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:33,468
All this, this total momentum
is a conserved quantity.

114
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:40,359
Besides the conservation 
of the total number of particles

115
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:44,745
and the conservation 
of the total momentum,

116
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:49,237
there are other quantities 
that are conserved by the Vlasov equation.

117
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,306
In particular, energy and entropy. 
Let's give a look at those.

118
00:11:56,605 --> 00:12:01,386
For what concerns 
the conservation of energy,

119
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:08,923
we have to define the total energy,

120
00:12:08,923 --> 00:12:13,094
which is the sum of the kinetic energy
of the particles,

121
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,017
plus the energy associated with
the electric and magnetic fields.

122
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:27,320
The total kinetic energy will be given
by the sum over all species of the integral

123
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,563
of the distribution function 
over the full configuration space

124
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:42,175
velocity space of one half
the kinetic energy of particles

125
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:47,399
with velocity v, weighted according
to the distribution function.

126
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:56,021
Then we will have to add to this the energy
of the electric and magnetic fields.

127
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,745
That is the integral 
over the full configuration space

128
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:05,160
of the energy associated 
with the electric field

129
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,006
plus the energy associated 
with the magnetic field.

130
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:13,499
and this is a conserved quantity.

131
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,240
We won't prove it rigorously,

132
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,869
but let me point that this property 
that is fairly fundamental.

133
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:27,759
And finally, let me also state 
another property of the Vlasov equation.

134
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,721
That is the entropy is conserved.

135
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:35,308
We define entropy, 
the total entropy of the system,

136
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:41,742
according to the typical definition
that is given in the information theory.

137
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:47,938
Therefore as minus the sum 
overall species of that integral

138
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:52,250
over all the configuration space,

139
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:58,192
all velocities of fs,
-the distribution function-

140
00:13:58,266 --> 00:14:03,514
times the natural logarithm of fs.

141
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:09,981
Now, we won't prove it rigorously,
but let me state that

142
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:16,916
if we evaluate the time derivative 
of this function with respect to time,

143
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:21,835
of the total entropy, 
which is therefore, -if you

144
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:41,112
take the derivative inside the integral-
( ∂fs/∂t ln(fs) + ∂fs/∂t).

145
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:47,062
If you carry out this calculation, 
taking into account

146
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:52,496
that fs satisfies the Vlasov equation 
then what you find is that

147
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:56,005
this dS/dt is equal to zero.

148
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:09,593
Therefore, the Vlasov equation 
describes time-reversible processes.

149
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,090
Why is that? Fundamentally
because dissipative processes,

150
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:20,985
-collisional processes- have been 
neglected in the Vlasov equation.

151
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:27,538
Having focused on 
the conservation properties

152
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,690
implied by the Vlasov equation,

153
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,195
we can now give a look at how 
the Vlasov equation

154
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:36,397
can be physically interpreted.

155
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,854
There are actually two interpretations,
two physical interpretations

156
00:15:40,854 --> 00:15:44,295
of the Vlasov equation 
that I would like to point out.

157
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:50,773
The first one is associated with the fact
that as it's described by the Vlasov equation,

158
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:58,978
the motion of fs -the distribution
function- is incompressible.

159
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:05,374
In fact if we take the divergence 
in the six-dimensional space of u,

160
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:11,892
where u is the six-dimensional velocity
that we have introduced in the module

161
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:19,199
where we derived the Boltzmann equation,
that will be ∂/∂r ⋅ v

162
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:25,637
the divergence of v,
plus the divergence in the velocity space

163
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:31,780
of the acceleration
that will be equal to zero.

164
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,660
This is because the velocity 
as we have said

165
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:44,234
is a phase space coordinate independent 
from the configuration space,

166
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:47,933
and the force is given by

167
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:51,777
the sum of the electric 
and magnetic forces.

168
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:55,807
The electric field 
does not depend on the v,

169
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,034
the Lorentz force is perpendicular
to v and therefore also

170
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:02,594
this divergence term is equal to zero.

171
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,508
What does it mean in practice?

172
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:11,825
Well, if we look at the evolution
of the particle distribution function

173
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:18,008
in [the phase] space
that I am considering here

174
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:20,451
and where I project

175
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:27,445
the six-dimensional space 
over the 2-D plane that we can deal with.

176
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:31,901
Therefore, when we consider here
the projection

177
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:38,754
of the configuration space coordinate
and velocity coordinate.

178
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:45,457
So, if we consider a small volume 
in the phase space,

179
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:52,257
the particles that are contained
in this volume will be displaced

180
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:55,001
as a function of time.

181
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:02,124
And if we look at the volume 
that these particles will occupy

182
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,636
after a certain time,

183
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:11,855
we may find that it
may have changed its shape,

184
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:15,833
however, the volume

185
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:19,154
that contains these particles 
will be the same.

186
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,493
The motion is incompressible.

187
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,997
There is another interpretation

188
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:27,818
that I would like to point out 
of the Vlasov equation.

189
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:33,540
In order to look at 
this interpretation,

190
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,516
we have 
to look at the variation

191
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:41,469
of the distribution function 
along the particle orbit.

192
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:47,611
More precisely what we want to evaluate is
the time derivative

193
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:55,918
of the distribution function as seen by
a particle traveling over its orbit.

194
00:18:56,292 --> 00:19:02,474
This will be given by -taking into account
the definition of the convective derivative

195
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:10,101
that we have here-, will be given by
explicit time derivative of fs,

196
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:18,105
plus, -by using the chain rule-,
the derivative of the position

197
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:21,267
and configuration of space 
with respect to time,

198
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:27,809
along a particle orbit,
⋅ ∂fs/∂r,

199
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:32,905
plus, the derivative 
with respect to time of the velocity

200
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:40,710
along a particle orbit 
⋅ ∂fs/∂v.

201
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:48,013
This is equal to -- 
okay, we won't to work on

202
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:51,530
the explicit time derivative,
it's fine as it is.

203
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:56,351
So what is the derivative 
with respect to time

204
00:19:56,351 --> 00:20:02,938
of the particle position
if we are moving along with the particles?

205
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:13,016
This will be given by the velocity
of the particle ⋅ ∂fs/∂r, plus ...

206
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,331
-- okay, what is the derivative

207
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:21,811
with respect to time of the velocity
when we are moving with the particles?

208
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:24,637
That will be equal to 
the acceleration of the particle.

209
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:35,214
That is, F/ms ⋅ ∂fs/∂v.

210
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:45,909
This therefore will be equal to 
∂fs/∂t + v⋅∂fs/∂r + ...

211
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:49,849
plus we can explicitly write 
the force term

212
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:53,724
that is given by the sum of the electric
and magnetic forces.

213
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:56,734
... + qs/ms (E + v × B) ⋅ ∂fs/∂v

214
00:20:56,734 --> 00:21:01,951
And the interesting thing is that here
what you have obtained

215
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:08,616
is actually the Vlasov equation 
and therefore as fs is evolving

216
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,340
according to Vlasov equation

217
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,067
this -because of Vlasov-
has to be equal to zero.

218
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,338
What does it mean?

219
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:21,037
It means that according 
to the Vlasov equation,

220
00:21:21,037 --> 00:21:24,437
fs, the distribution function,

221
00:21:24,437 --> 00:21:37,298
as measured when moving along
the particle trajectory is constant.

222
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:46,039
We have looked at 
the conservation properties

223
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,437
associated with the Vlasov equation.

224
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:51,110
We have looked at 
the possible interpretation

225
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,273
of the Vlasov equation.

226
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:58,609
Now, its time to give a look if there
are solutions to the Vlasov equation.

227
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,843
Surprisingly, there are many solutions 
of the Vlasov equation.

228
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:10,788
In fact, if Cj are constant of motion,

229
00:22:12,393 --> 00:22:21,221
for j = 1, 2, ... to a big number J

230
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:29,998
then what I'm going to show
is that fs, a distribution function

231
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:39,643
that is a function of these Cj, 
fs(C1, C2, ..., CJ)

232
00:22:39,643 --> 00:22:46,813
is a solution of the Vlasov equation.

233
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:55,708
In fact, if we try to inject 
this distribution function

234
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,548
into the Vlasov equation, and therefore,

235
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:08,248
we evaluate the time derivative of fs
streaming in the configuration space

236
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:15,113
and in velocity space
which as we have just seen,

237
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:23,658
is equal to the time derivative 
of the distribution function

238
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:26,583
as seen from the particle orbit.

239
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:30,940
Then what we have is, 
-by using the chain rule-

240
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:37,707
that the derivative with respect to time
of the distribution function

241
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:39,272
along the particle orbit

242
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,854
will be equal to the derivative
of fs with respect to C1 [ ∂fs/∂C1 ]

243
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:52,836
times the derivative of C1 
with the respect to time [ ∂C1/∂t ]

244
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:55,877
as evaluated along the particle orbit,

245
00:23:56,604 --> 00:24:09,124
... + ∂fs/∂C2 ∂C2/∂t

246
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,407
as evaluated along the particle orbit,

247
00:24:14,677 --> 00:24:33,449
plus all the other derivatives 
until ∂fs/∂CJ ∂CJ/∂t

248
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:34,854
along the particle orbit.

249
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:43,667
Now, as C1, C2, C3, ..., CJ 
are constants of motion,

250
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:49,038
the time derivatives 
of these functions as evaluated

251
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,126
along the particle orbit is equal to zero.

252
00:24:52,498 --> 00:24:56,171
Therefore, all this quantity 
will be equal to zero.

253
00:24:56,171 --> 00:25:02,250
In other terms, the distribution function
that we have just defined

254
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,346
satisfies the Vlasov equation.

255
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:07,406
It's a solution of the Vlasov equation.

256
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:11,845
To make things a bit more concrete,
let us give some examples.

257
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:17,626
For example, let's consider 
the case of a system

258
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:23,264
where there is no magnetic 
nor electric field.

259
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:36,786
What we will have in this case is that 
vx, vy and vz are constants of motion

260
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:45,044
which implies that any function 
fs(vx, vy, vz)

261
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,037
is a solution of the Vlasov equation.

262
00:25:49,343 --> 00:25:55,187
Maybe a more interesting case
is the one of E = 0,

263
00:25:56,026 --> 00:26:04,406
a magnetic field that is uniform 
along the z direction,

264
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:08,995
then in this case, we have a number 
of constants of motion:

265
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:12,940
For example, 
the velocity in the z direction

266
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,130
is a constant of motion.

267
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:20,245
The kinetic energy of the particles,
[is a constant of motion]

268
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,747
and then if you look at the particle orbits

269
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:33,332
you find that 
vy + (qs B₀/ms) x

270
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:44,734
and vx - (qs B₀/ms) y

271
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:52,757
are all constants of motion. 
This implies that any function

272
00:26:52,924 --> 00:27:22,094
fs (vz, v², vy + (qs B₀/ms) x, ...
... vx - (qs B₀/ms) y)

273
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:24,674
is a solution of Vlasov.

274
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:31,792
Let me make a couple of observations.

275
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:41,198
The first observation is that
the behavior of the Vlasov equation

276
00:27:41,198 --> 00:27:47,113
is fairly different from that one 
can expect from the Boltzmann equation.

277
00:27:54,192 --> 00:27:58,784
Where because of the presence of collisions
in the Boltzmann equation,

278
00:27:58,784 --> 00:28:06,153
we expect that only 
the Maxwellian distribution function

279
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,283
is a stationary solution.

280
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:16,702
Here with Vlasov, things are very 
different because whatever function

281
00:28:16,702 --> 00:28:22,602
for example in this case of 
vx, vy, and vz is a solution of Vlasov.

282
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:26,963
Therefore, it can be very far from 
the thermodynamic equilibrium.

283
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:32,175
A second thing to notice is that, 
in general,

284
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:38,902
it's very difficult to find
the constants of motion

285
00:28:43,078 --> 00:28:48,496
in realistic cases, 
the ones that are of interest to us

286
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:52,310
for practical application.

287
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,192
Here we are at the end of this of lecture.

288
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:59,990
What we have done was to derive from the
Boltzmann equation the Vlasov equation.

289
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,750
That is done simply by neglecting 
the collision operator

290
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,221
that is present in the Vlasov equation.

291
00:29:06,221 --> 00:29:11,022
And then what we have done was 
to study and to look at the properties

292
00:29:11,022 --> 00:29:14,602
of the evolution of the distribution function
in phase space.

293
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:17,060
We have derived one conservation law,

294
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,713
the conservation 
of the total number of particles.

295
00:29:20,713 --> 00:29:24,340
There are other conservation laws 
that I have just stated:

296
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,074
the ones of momentum, energy 
and the conservation of entropy.

297
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:35,588
It takes a bit time, and
I leave it as an exercise to do,

298
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:40,328
it's an interesting calculation
to do by yourself, if you would like,

299
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:45,754
but let me point out that the Vlasov 
equation has these nice properties.

300
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:49,580
And then what we have done is
to provide some new interpretation,

301
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,162
some interpretation 
of the Vlasov equation,

302
00:29:52,162 --> 00:29:54,192
which has actually allowed us

303
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,180
to find a formal solution 
of Vlasov equation.

304
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:01,379
Unfortunately, formal solutions 
do not work

305
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:04,695
in the cases of practical interest,
and therefore,

306
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:08,935
one has to solve the Vlasov equation 
or in general the kinetic equations

307
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:11,075
by using a numerical approach.
