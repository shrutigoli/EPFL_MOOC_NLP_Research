1
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:07,097
Welcome!

2
00:00:07,097 --> 00:00:10,004
Welcome to the Plasma Physics
course of EPFL.

3
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:16,439
In the past modules we've shown
how the Vlasov equation can be derived.

4
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:21,472
We have pointed out
that some analytical progress is possible.

5
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,817
In some particular cases
we've focused our attention

6
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,677
on the two-stream instability.

7
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:34,643
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to 
progress analytically in most of the cases

8
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:38,838
and plasma physicists
have to turn themselves

9
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,537
towards the use of numerical methods

10
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:46,407
in order to solve the Vlasov equation
and approach the dynamics of plasma.

11
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:52,466
The goal of the present module
is to give you a short introduction

12
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:58,515
to numerical methods that are used
for solving the Vlasov equation.

13
00:00:58,906 --> 00:01:01,877
The first thing that I will do
Is that I will tell you why

14
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:04,516
simulating plasma is so complicated,

15
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:07,592
and it's basically because
of the wide range

16
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:11,944
of spatial and temporal scales
that are involved by the plasma.

17
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:18,645
Second thing that I will do
is to introduce a numerical method,

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,904
the <i>PIC</i> method, the <i>Particle In Cell</i>,

19
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:24,519
that is used to solve the Vlasov equation.

20
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:31,338
Let's draw a time arrow
through which we will represent

21
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:37,333
the times scales that are present
in a fusion reactor.

22
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,952
I will look at them in seconds.

23
00:01:44,168 --> 00:01:47,739
There will be phenomena
on very short time scales,

24
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:51,579
10⁻¹⁰, 10⁻⁸ seconds.

25
00:01:54,876 --> 00:02:00,255
And phenomena that occurs
on very much longer time scales.

26
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:06,899
The fastest phenomena present
is the electron cyclotron motion.

27
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:14,928
It occurs on a time scale that is
smaller than10⁻¹⁰ seconds.

28
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:21,446
The second phenomenon that is observed

29
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:24,295
is the ion cyclotron motion.

30
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:30,063
It occurs on a time scale
of the order of 10⁻⁷ seconds.

31
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:36,749
Then, in all these devices to confine
plasma for fusion purposes,

32
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:40,330
there is turbulence present,
and microturbulence occurs

33
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,410
on a time scale of 10⁻⁵ seconds.

34
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:49,380
There are global instabilities

35
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:56,329
that occur on a time scale of the order
of 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻³ seconds:

36
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:59,420
these are
<i>fast global instabilities</i>.

37
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:04,634
There are the so-called
<i>slow global instabilities</i>

38
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07,516
on a fraction of a second.

39
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:12,835
The energy confinement time
in this kind of devices

40
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:15,492
is of the order of the second.

41
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,102
Then there are phenomena
that occur on even longer time scale,

42
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:26,002
for example, the gas equilibration
with the vessel walls.

43
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:32,012
A wide range of phenomena
therefore, that occur on time scales

44
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:37,299
that are separated by ten to twelve
or even more orders of magnitude.

45
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,804
All non-linearly coupled and interacting.

46
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,004
And similarly, we have also the--
I won't go into the details,

47
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:51,430
but we have also a wide range
of spatial scales involved.

48
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,530
Representing all these phenomena
at the same time is extremely challenging

49
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,643
for computational purposes.

50
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:07,510
This is why plasma physics
is at the forefront of the development

51
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,996
and the exploitation
of numerical techniques.

52
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:19,187
Despite the complexity of the phenomena
that plasma physicists have to deal with,

53
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:23,070
significant progress
has been made in the field

54
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,943
thanks to the use
of numerical simulations,

55
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:31,624
and thanks to the computational power
that is increasingly available.

56
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:38,644
For example, here is the result
of one of the state of the art simulations

57
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:40,807
that are done in plasma physics.

58
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:45,170
A kinetic simulation of turbulence
in the core of a tokamak device.

59
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:50,922
This simulation has been run on one
of the fastest computers in the world.

60
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:55,431
It's been done by using 10,000 processors

61
00:04:55,431 --> 00:05:00,955
and in total, more than a million
CPU hours have been devoted

62
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:05,097
to obtain the result
that we are looking at here.

63
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:11,360
I believe that I have given you an idea
of why simulating plasma dynamics

64
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,254
is so challenging.

65
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:19,709
Now, let me finally go to the point
of our module, that is:

66
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,230
What are the numerical method
that can be actually used

67
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,862
to solve the Vlasov equation?

68
00:05:25,862 --> 00:05:28,414
Let me say that there are
different techniques.

69
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,208
On the one hand,
we can discretize on a grid

70
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:37,226
that the six-dimensional phase space
and advance the Vlasov equation in time.

71
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:43,620
This is possible, but it's not typically
the scheme that is used

72
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,325
to approach numerically
the Vlasov equation.

73
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,652
The numerical method
that is typically used

74
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:52,790
is the so-called PIC,
Particle in Cell method, and now

75
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,184
I will tell you the ideas
behind this method.

76
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:01,238
I first start by recalling
the Vlasov equation,

77
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,187
which states that the variation
of the distribution function

78
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:13,348
is due to the streaming velocity

79
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,488
in configuration space
and in the velocity space.

80
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:22,511
This equation can be interpreted
as we have seen it in the previous lecture

81
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:26,810
by saying that along
the trajectory of particles,

82
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:37,360
that is, in phase space, given by dr/dt= v,

83
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:43,069
and dv/dt = q/m (E + v × B),

84
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:47,088
f is constant,

85
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,277
in other words, that df/dt=0.

86
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:59,732
How can we represent this in phase space?

87
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:02,958
We can project
the six-dimensional phase space

88
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,638
on the two dimensions of this screen.

89
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:11,265
Here will be the spatial coordinate,

90
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:15,018
here will be the
velocity coordinate.

91
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:21,677
And if we consider a particle
starting with a specific velocity

92
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:27,910
and specific spatial location, at time t=0

93
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,913
and we follow
the trajectory of this particle

94
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,992
as a function of time,

95
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:39,302
the distribution function f
will be constant

96
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:42,376
as we move along this trajectory.

97
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:47,227
The PIC method is based
on this consideration.

98
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:53,113
PIC means Particle In Cell method.

99
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,251
The method is based on representing

100
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:05,777
the distribution function
at initial time t = t₀

101
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:14,307
as the sum of a large number of functions

102
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:16,821
that we will call fα

103
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:24,002
that depend on the spatial coordinate
and the velocity coordinate,

104
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:31,398
where these fα have the propertiy
of having compact support,

105
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:35,924
therefore they are equal to zero

106
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,765
everywhere except
in a region of the phase space

107
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:48,704
and they are symmetric with respect
to rα0 and vα0.

108
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:55,153
These fα's, -we will see
the reason soon-,

109
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:57,735
are also called <i>superparticles</i>.

110
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,761
What does it mean?

111
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:10,982
If we look at the projection
of the phase space,

112
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:14,816
we will see that these
fα's are everywhere...

113
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,071
they are a compact support,
therefore they are everywhere zero

114
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:22,601
except for that small domain,

115
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,985
and they are symmetric,

116
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:33,825
and therefore they are centered around
the rα0 position and vα0 velocity.

117
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:41,738
We introduce the integral Iα(fα)

118
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:49,981
of the superparticle function
as the integral over the full phase space,

119
00:09:50,494 --> 00:09:55,986
so dr dv of fα
[ Iα = ∬ dr dv fα ]

120
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:00,729
and then we will impose that at all times

121
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:10,366
f is still given by the superposition
of these superparticles

122
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:26,168
which are centered at a position
rα(t) and vα(t) that varies in time.

123
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:35,127
In particular, we require that,
these rα(t) and rα(t)

124
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:37,931
satisfy the following equations,

125
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:51,097
which resemble very much
the equation of motion

126
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:54,072
that we've just written for particles.

127
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:58,745
Except for these Eα and Bα terms

128
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:02,367
that have to be defined.
And we define them

129
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:14,590
according to an integral 
that weights the electric field

130
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:22,021
according to where the position
of these superparticles is in phase space.

131
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:29,261
And analogously for the magnetic field,

132
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:36,423
imposing the initial conditions ...

133
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:58,429
Then, we have that, if we evaluate
the convective derivative

134
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:08,914
d/dt fα(r-rα(t), v-vα(t)) as rα(t)
and vα(t) follow this equation,

135
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:12,590
then we will have that this will be
approximately equal to zero,

136
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:20,210
which means that f, defined
as the sum over all superparticles

137
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,422
is a solution of Vlasov.

138
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,288
In other terms, how does the PIC code,
Particle In Cell method work?

139
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:37,140
One has to find the ,

140
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:43,088
the rα(t) and vα(t) that satisfy
the equation of motion that I've written,

141
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:46,371
starting with the following
initial condition

142
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:50,986
which means, basically,
to follow a certain trajectory

143
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:56,552
and then, once you have found
the rα(t) and vα(t),

144
00:12:56,552 --> 00:13:01,293
you can evaluate
the fα's that are here,

145
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:04,980
sum them up,
and what you obtain

146
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,641
is an approximation
of the distribution function at all times.

147
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,003
So how does the PIC method
work in practice?

148
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:19,224
We will focus on a one-dimensional system

149
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:23,578
and we will look at electrostatic limit.

150
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:26,885
If we know the charge present in a system,

151
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:31,835
then by solving the Poisson equation,

152
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:36,600
we can estimate electrostatic potential.

153
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,753
Once we know the electrostatic potential,

154
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:47,616
we can deduce the electric field as minus
the derivative of Φ with respect to x.

155
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:51,024
Now, to solve the Poisson
equation numerically,

156
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:53,745
we have to discretize space,

157
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:01,033
and we will introduce a grid

158
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:08,783
where we will discretize
x with x0, x1, x2, etc.

159
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:15,255
xj-1, xj, xj+1, etc.

160
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:19,293
and similarly for time,
it will be discretized

161
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:44,429
with t0, t1, t2,... ti-1, ti, ti+1
with a grid spacing Δx

162
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:52,452
that is constant
and therefore equal to xj+1- xj,

163
00:14:53,377 --> 00:14:56,026
and similarly for time.

164
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:05,564
The charge density it will be evaluated
on the points of this grid.

165
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:11,293
and will be denoted as ρji.

166
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:17,886
and this will be the charge
density at location xj and time ti.

167
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:21,222
We will proceed similarly
for the electric field

168
00:15:21,222 --> 00:15:23,740
and for the electrostatic potential.

169
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:30,908
At this point on this grid we need
to discretize the derivatives

170
00:15:33,654 --> 00:15:38,133
and we will have that
dΦ/dx at position j

171
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:42,059
is approximately equal
to the finite difference

172
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:47,963
between Φ evaluated at point j+1

173
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:54,752
and Φ at point j-1 divided by 2 Δx

174
00:15:54,752 --> 00:16:01,827
and by combining similar expressions
from first order derivative,

175
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:07,845
we will have that for second
order derivative at position j,

176
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:24,455
a good approximation will be provided
by ( Φj+1 - 2 Φj + Φj -1) / Δx²

177
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:28,078
Therefore, coming back
to our Poisson equation

178
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:44,225
we will have that 
( Φij+1 - 2 Φij + Φij -1) / Δx²

179
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:51,930
is equal -ρij/ε₀

180
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,394
and then similarly
for the electric field,

181
00:16:55,531 --> 00:17:00,245
this will be given by -1/ (2 Δx)

182
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,185
The difference
between electrostatic potential

183
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:10,291
at position j+1 and j-1.

184
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:14,709
Once we have evaluated the electric field,

185
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,188
we have to evaluate the electric field 
acting on a superparticle.

186
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:29,025
For this we will assume
that the electric field is equal to Ej

187
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:40,800
for x j-1/2 < x < xj+1/2.

188
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:44,037
What that does, xj+1/2 mean?

189
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,495
It's the point in between xj and xj+1

190
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,322
and as we have just seen,
the electric field

191
00:17:56,322 --> 00:18:02,645
acting on superparticle α,
which is defined as Eα,

192
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:11,696
Eα = ∬ E fα dx dv

193
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:15,947
can be rightly
evaluated if we assume

194
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:26,721
that fα f alpha is equal to the product
of two Dirac functions

195
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:30,940
centered around xα and vα.
[ fα = δ(x-xα) δ(v-vα) ]

196
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:39,651
This fα, which is the simplest
that can be used in a PIC method,

197
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,876
hass the properties
that we have just listed.

198
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:45,184
It has a compact support:

199
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:50,083
it's equal to zero, except
for a finite region of the phase space

200
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:55,626
and it is symmetric with respect
to xα and vα.

201
00:18:56,654 --> 00:19:03,225
With these definitions, one obtains
that Eα is equal to Ej,

202
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:12,269
being the distance between xj
that is considered here and xα,

203
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:18,689
less than or equal to Δx/2.

204
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,500
Therefore, here we can have
the electric field

205
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,729
acting on superparticles

206
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:34,602
by knowing that the expression
that we have already derived here, Eij,

207
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:37,454
will give us Eiα.

208
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:41,559
At this point we have everything
to solve Newton equations

209
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,598
for each superparticle.

210
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:50,648
dxα/dt = vα,

211
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:59,290
and 
dvα/dt = (qα/mα) Eα.

212
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:05,283
To do that we discretize
the time derivative

213
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:08,064
as we have done for the spatial derivative

214
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:15,099
and we will have that the difference
between xα at [time] i+1

215
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:22,166
minus xα at [time] i, divided by Δt
is equal to vα,

216
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:27,391
considered at time i+1/2 ,

217
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:34,837
and with a similar law we will evaluate
the advancement of the velocity.

218
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:48,773
With these equations we can advance the 
[super]particles velocities and positions.

219
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,933
And by advancing the [super]particles
velocities and positions,

220
00:20:52,933 --> 00:20:56,882
we can assign the charge to the grid,

221
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,634
to the spatial grid
that we are considering.

222
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,977
In order to evaluate
the charge in each cell,

223
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,302
which will allow us
to solve the Poisson equation,

224
00:21:13,302 --> 00:21:20,752
we will notice that ρij will be given
by (1/Δx) [times]

225
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:25,373
the charge contained inside each cell,

226
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:29,652
which will be given by the integral
of the distribution function

227
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:35,769
that we have approximated as the sum
over all the superparticles,

228
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:38,393
which have all charge qα

229
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:46,138
and this integrated over the velocity,
direction, and the grid

230
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:56,227
and spatial direction
from xj-1/2 to xj+1/2.

231
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:02,791
This is in other terms equal
to (1/Δx) [times]

232
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:09,331
sum over all the [super]particles
that belong to this j cell qα.

233
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:16,532
And let's write it explicitly: summing
over these α that belong to j,

234
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:20,304
we mean summing
over superparticles

235
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:31,095
such that their position
is in between xj-1/2 and xj+1/2,

236
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:37,475
from which we can close our system

237
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:40,890
by assigning ρij, as we have seen,

238
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,787
sum over all [super]particles
that belong to the j cell.

239
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:53,346
So here is how the PIC method
works in practice.

240
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:59,096
We start by giving an initial condition
where all the particles' position are known

241
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:03,246
from which we can evaluate
the charge distribution,

242
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:08,051
by solving the Poisson equation,
we evaluate the electrostatic potential,

243
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:11,309
and from this, we have the electric field.

244
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:14,559
From the electric field,
evaluated on the grid,

245
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,522
we estimate the electric field
acting on a superparticle,

246
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:22,989
and once we know the electric field
acting on a superparticle

247
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:27,085
we can solve the Newton equation
for each one of the superparticles

248
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:32,067
through which we are discretizing
our distribution function,

249
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:35,876
and here is the Newton equation
that we can solve

250
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:40,539
to advance at the next [time] step
the position of the particles

251
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:44,023
and once we go
to the next step in position,

252
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:48,507
we can evaluate
the new distribution of charge,

253
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:54,647
assign the charges to the grid, and go
on by evaluating the Poisson equation

254
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:57,164
at the new time step, and so on.

255
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:01,124
By advancing this system in time,

256
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:05,374
we can actually look at the evolution
of the distribution function,

257
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:09,923
of the electric field, and the electrostatic 
potential in time and space.

258
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:15,014
In the exercise of this series of lectures

259
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:20,106
will be actually focused
on a Particle In Cell, PIC simulation

260
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:25,178
of a one-dimensional system
in the electrostatic limit

261
00:24:25,178 --> 00:24:29,812
where we will see two
counterstreaming beams of electrons

262
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:33,994
that interact between each other.

263
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:40,916
So here we get to the summary slide
of the present lecture

264
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:45,214
that has been devoted
to the simulation in plasma physics.

265
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:52,256
We have given a very short introduction
of how models are approached numerically.

266
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:55,977
The first thing
that I have done is explain

267
00:24:55,977 --> 00:25:00,585
why it is so challenging to do
numerical simulations of plasmas.

268
00:25:00,585 --> 00:25:04,617
It's because of the wide range
of spatial temporal scales

269
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:08,481
at which phenomena occur in plasmas.

270
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:12,265
Then I briefly talked about
different simulation approaches

271
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:16,856
to focus then on the
Particle In Cell method, the PIC method

272
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:20,471
that is used in plasma physics
to solve the Vlasov equation.

273
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:26,898
Let me just point out that the PIC method
is not only used in plasma physics.

274
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:32,768
It's used in a variety of fields,
starting from fluid mechanics

275
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:37,931
to the study of dynamics
of stars in galaxies,

276
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:40,829
to the study of semiconductors.

277
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:45,203
This is a fairly general method
and we went into the details

278
00:25:45,203 --> 00:25:48,301
to explain how this works in practice

279
00:25:48,301 --> 00:25:52,236
in the simplest case
of one-dimensional plasma

280
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:54,469
in the electrostatic limit.
