00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:03,483
Throughout lecture one,
we have had the opportunity

2
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:06,252
to familiarize ourselves 
with the most basic concepts

3
00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:07,563
of plasma physics.

4
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:10,167
Plasma dynamics is 
a complex subject.

5
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:11,933
And we have started to uncover it

6
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:14,213
by studying the trajectory
of charged particles

7
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:16,749
in assigned electromagnetic fiields.

8
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:20,378
In reality, these fields result 
also from the position and motion

9
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:22,977
of the charged particles
that compose the plasma.

10
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:25,587
Therefore their evaluation
cannot really be separated

11
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:27,934
from that of the particle trajectories.

12
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:31,275
As a consequence, 
[inaudible] just simply describes

13
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:32,893
the motion of the charged particles,

14
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:35,280
and the generation
of the electromagnetic fields,

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,832
is a necessity to actually
capture the plasma dynamics.

16
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:41,889
A fairly complete model
is given by the kinetic theory,

17
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:45,366
the subject of this lecture
which is given by Professor Paolo Ricci.

18
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,265
Starting from the most complete model

19
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:49,519
that describes the trajectories
of all plasma particles,

20
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:51,679
in a self-consist electromagnetic fields,

21
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,440
statistical matters will be applied
to derive a kinetic model for a plasma.

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,790
This model separates long-range
electromagnetic interactions

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,852
from one to one interactions,
that is the core of collisions.

24
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:07,048
Professor Ricci will first focus
on the plasma collision processes.

25
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:10,669
Despite being ultimately neglected
in most commonly used kinetic model,

26
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:12,573
the one based on the plasma equation,

27
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,621
in fact collisions play an important role
in the plasma dynamics,

28
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:18,229
as well as in a number of applications.

29
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:21,061
Then, the properties of 
the Vlasov equation will be described,

30
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,407
as well as one 
of its simplest applications,

31
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:26,459
the study of the dynamics 
of two counter-streaming beams.

32
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,722
Finally, a brief introduction
will be given to the numerical solution

33
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,549
of the Vlsaov equation.
