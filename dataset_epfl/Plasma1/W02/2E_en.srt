00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:10,125
Welcome, welcome to the plasma physics 
course of EPFL.

2
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:14,439
In the past modules, we have introduced 
the Vlasov equation.

3
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:17,866
It's now time to see an application.

4
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:22,011
Probably the simplest kinetic calculation 
that can be done.

5
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:26,466
The one of the stability of 
two plasma beams

6
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:29,994
that are counter streaming
in opposite directions.

7
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,554
In order to do this calculation 
we will first of all simplify the system

8
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:43,619
of equations that we have introduced 
in the past modules to consider

9
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,797
a one-dimensional electrostatic evolution.

10
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:51,844
Then we will introduce some techniques: 
the one of <i>linearization</i>

11
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:56,531
and <i>normal mode analysis</i> that will be 
useful throughout the course.

12
00:00:57,274 --> 00:01:02,312
And finally, we will focus on 
the actual calculation of the stability

13
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,468
of these two counter streaming beams.

14
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:10,595
Let me first of all recall the system
that we are considering.

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,960
Basically we are considering 
the Vlasov equation for species s

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,196
( s = ions and electrons),
which has to be coupled

17
00:01:22,196 --> 00:01:23,804
to Maxwell's equations:

18
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:27,269
∇⋅E = ρ/ε₀

19
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:34,210
∇⋅B = 0 
∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

20
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:41,174
and
∇ × B = μ₀ ( j + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

21
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:47,056
In order to simplify this system 
we will consider

22
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,195
an electrostatic evolution with B = 0.

23
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:59,097
Therefore the Vlasov equation becomes 
the following one where we have

24
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:02,097
neglected the (v × B) term

25
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:07,947
and the Maxwell system reduces to
∇ × E = 0

26
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,023
and 
∇⋅E = ρ/ε₀

27
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:20,406
From which we deduce that 
E = -∇Φ

28
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:27,821
and ∇²Φ = -ρ/ε₀
[ ∇² = Laplacian square]

29
00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:33,316
We will make the further assumption 
that the ions constitute

30
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:37,792
a fixed the background of 
constant density n₀.

31
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:44,503
We will have therefore to follow the Vlasov 
equation for the electron species only

32
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:48,057
with just charge e and mass me,

33
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,723
which has to be associated with 
the Poisson equation

34
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:55,871
for the electrostatic potential,
which takes the form of

35
00:02:55,871 --> 00:03:00,603
∇²Φ = e/ε₀ ∫fe dv

36
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:05,097
minus the contribution of the ions
[ - (e/ε₀) n₀ ]

37
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:09,782
As we will consider only 
the electron species

38
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:12,685
to simplify the notation.

39
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:15,922
Let me replace fe by f.

40
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:20,709
Therefore we will talk about f.

41
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:24,086
We will mean the electron 
distribution function.

42
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:29,155
We will now introduce 
a mathematical technique:

43
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:31,569
the <i>linearization</i>,
which will be used

44
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:33,906
throughout the rest of the course.

45
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:36,577
What is the main idea?

46
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:40,072
Basically let's assume that 
we have a physical quantity

47
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:47,731
and this physical quantity can be written
as the sum of a constant, uniform

48
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:53,129
background value plus a small 
perturbation on top of it.

49
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:59,795
We typically are interested in studying 
the evolution of this

50
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:04,109
small perturbation on top of it
and this can be done easily

51
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:06,005
by linearizing the equations.

52
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:10,819
So let's look at the details of 
what I'm saying here.

53
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,993
We want to separate the 
equilibrium and the small perturbation.

54
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,463
Basically, let's assume that 
we have a physical quantity

55
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,312
as a function of a some 
coordinate x.

56
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,339
Physical quantity for example g(x).

57
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:38,877
So, let's consider the g quantity 
which depends somehow on x.

58
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:45,890
This g quantity can be written as 
the sum of a constant uniform value

59
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:53,154
plus a perturbation of 
this uniform background.

60
00:04:54,057 --> 00:05:01,734
In other words, g can be written as 
the sum of g₀ + g₁

61
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:04,684
where g₀

62
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:10,563
is an equilibrium steady state 
and uniform value

63
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:18,189
and g₁ the perturbation. 
As a matter of fact, the linearization,

64
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,679
this technique we are talking about

65
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:25,061
is meaningful in the case where g₁

66
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:28,837
is much much smaller than g₀.

67
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:34,797
Basically the background constant uniform 
value is perturbed by a small amount.

68
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,330
In our case, in the case of 
the Vlasov equation

69
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,659
that we are considering, we will assume 
that the distribution

70
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:52,114
function of the electrons will be written 
as the background value f₀(v) ,

71
00:05:52,806 --> 00:06:00,493
which we will allow only to depend on 
v plus a perturbation f₁(r,v,t) ,

72
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:03,858
much much smaller than f₀

73
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:12,172
and for the electrostatic potential we 
will write it as Φ = Φ₀ + Φ₁(r,t)

74
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:19,049
that depends on space and time 
and we will assume that

75
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:24,063
the constant background value, 
Φ₀ = 0 and therefore

76
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:29,965
that the electrostatic potential is basically 
equal to the perturbation Φ₁(r,t).

77
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:35,970
And similarly we will have 
the electric field will be

78
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:39,086
[only paterbed] electric field.

79
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:48,022
What is the advantage that 
I've introduced in Linearization,

80
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:53,233
well as the paterbation of much smaller 
than the equilibrium quantities

81
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:01,642
when writing down the equation 
we can neglect terms that comes from

82
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:07,873
the product of paterb quantity 
with other paterb quantities.

83
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:14,491
Basically what we can do, we can linearize 
the equation into the paterb quantities

84
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:19,467
neglecting higher order terms
and retaining only the leading one.

85
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,810
Let's see this 
practically in one example.

86
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:28,028
So what we want to do, 
is to linearize

87
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:34,585
the equations, in particular 
the Vlasov-Poisson system

88
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:38,337
that are we are considering,
retaining only the leading order terms.

89
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,948
Let's consider first of all 
the case of the Vlasov equation.

90
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:49,130
We will write f as 
f₀(v) + f₁(r,v,t)

91
00:07:51,162 --> 00:07:53,782
in all terms, in all expressions

92
00:07:55,691 --> 00:08:02,991
and we will introduce only the perturbed
electric field E₁ into the force term.

93
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:07,681
Okay, f₀ does not depend on time,

94
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:15,648
therefore this expression 
reduces to ∂f₁/∂t.

95
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:21,408
Here we have that f₀(v) 
does not depend on r,

96
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:28,126
therefore this will become ∂f₁/∂r

97
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:31,420
and this expression, well both--

98
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:37,527
f₀ and f₁ depend on v, 
therefore we will have that the system

99
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:40,579
is given by the sum of two terms:

100
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:49,611
E₁⋅∂f₀/∂v + E₁⋅∂f₁/∂v

101
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:55,994
Now f₀ is much larger than f₁

102
00:08:57,248 --> 00:09:02,159
therefore this term is much smaller 
than the first one.

103
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:04,285
We can neglect it.

104
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:09,352
Retaining only the first order 
term in the perturbation,

105
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:13,594
If you want only terms that 
are linear in the perturbation

106
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,514
and neglecting the quadratic terms 
in the perturbation.

107
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:20,854
We will retain only 
the leading order term.

108
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:27,525
How about the equation 
for the electric field

109
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,547
and electrostatic potential?

110
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:35,329
Well we have that 
E₁ = -∇Φ₁

111
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:41,302
and for the Poisson equation, we will
have the contribution from

112
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:52,859
the background charge of the electrons,
the perturbed charge of the electrons,

113
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:56,432
minus the charge of the ions.

114
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:58,581
Now we expect that

115
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:05,840
at the equilibrium the electron 
equilibrium distribution function

116
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,165
will have a density that is equal 
to the one of the ions

117
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:16,373
and therefore that these two terms 
will cancel. We will obtain therefore

118
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:22,354
∇²Φ₁ = e/ε₀ ∫f₁ dv.

119
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:26,051
Therefore, our linearized system

120
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:32,122
will be given by the linearized 
Vlasov equation,

121
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,646
where we can actually replace E₁ with Φ₁
[ E₁ = E₁ = -∂Φ₁/∂r ],

122
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:42,375
and lineralized Poisson equation.

123
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:47,106
Now let me point out that 
this set of equations,

124
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:52,954
that we have obtained is much much simpler
than the one that we had considered

125
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:57,446
at the beginning, as the perturbed 
quantities, the ones that evolve in time,

126
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:03,069
f₁ and Φ₁ are actually containing 
expressions that are linear

127
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:05,090
with respect to them.

128
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:11,932
Having linearized the equations, now 
we can use the normal mode of analysis.

129
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:17,363
Basically we can decompose f₁ 
and Φ₁ in Fourier modes.

130
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:22,496
And then look at the dynamic evolution 
of each single Fourier mode.

131
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:27,696
We will write the f₁(r,v,t)

132
00:11:28,143 --> 00:11:30,874
as the integral for the mode 
in space and time.

133
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:36,295
We will write the distribution function,

134
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:43,092
f₁(r,v,t)

135
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:48,752
as the integral over all the Fourier 
modes in space so over dK,

136
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:55,941
the integral over dω of 
the Fourier modes f̃₁(K,v,ω)

137
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:04,233
which we will denote with a tilde, 
of (K,v,ω).

138
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:14,059
So the Fourier modes f̃₁ times 
exp {i (K⋅r - ωt) }

139
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:15,891
Why do we do that?

140
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:19,133
It's because that the Fourier transform
has some very nice properties

141
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:21,420
that we will use.

142
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:27,542
The first one is if we want to evaluate 
the time derivative of f₁,

143
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:32,209
whichit will be given by 
the integral over dK and dω

144
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:34,945
and then we will have 
to derive this expression

145
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:40,340
and it will give -iω 
by deriving with respect to time

146
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:48,987
and then f̃₁(K,v,ω) and the exponential,

147
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:59,035
and similarly the spatial derivative 
will become the integral over dK and dω,

148
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:04,078
and when we take the spatial 
derivative, we get iK f̃₁(K,v,ω).

149
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,552
If you want: 
∂/∂t ⇒ -iω

150
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:14,477
and 
∂/∂r ⇒ iK

151
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:20,873
Starting from the Vlasov equation...

152
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:35,867
introducing the expression 
for f₁ that we have written here

153
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:41,810
the Vlasov equation can be written 
as the integral over dK and dω

154
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:46,213
and then taking into account 
the fact that there are

155
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:49,357
∂/∂t and ∂/∂r so a

156
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:57,672
(-iω + iK⋅v) f̃₁ term

157
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:01,883
and then Fourier transform of Φ₁.

158
00:14:03,904 --> 00:14:09,908
We notice that ∂f₀/∂v is constant 
with respect to space and time

159
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:14,667
and therefore can be brought 
inside the integral over dK and dω.

160
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:19,249
It's just a constant with respect 
to space and time.

161
00:14:20,781 --> 00:14:27,912
And here we are using again the properties
of the spatial derivative.

162
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:33,297
Everything has to be multiplied by 
the exponential term,

163
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,538
and this has to be equal to zero.

164
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:41,682
One property of the Fourier modes is that 
there are all orthogonal to each other

165
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:47,270
so the only way that this integral is 
equal to zero is that all

166
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,996
the coefficients of Fourier modes 
are equal to zero,

167
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:56,720
which means that for every ω and K 
we need to have

168
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:10,347
that 
(-iω + iK⋅v) f̃₁ + i (e/me) Φ̃₁⋅∂f₀/∂v

169
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:18,606
has to be equal to zero, which also implies 
that f̃₁ , the Fourier transform

170
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:24,448
of f₁ has to be equal to - extracting 
it from this expression-,

171
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:35,450
an expression that is linear in Φ̃₁
and which depends on ω , K

172
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,181
and the equilibrium distribution function.

173
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:45,063
We can then insert this f̃₁ in the
Fourier transform of the Poisson equation

174
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,416
and ∇²Φ̃₁ will become -K²Φ̃₁ ,

175
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:57,996
equal to -basically- the integral of f̃₁
over dv.

176
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:05,062
and now we can use the expression 
for f̃₁ to obtain an expression

177
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:07,603
that depends on Φ̃₁.

178
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:17,213
Now we can actually collect in this 
expression Φ̃₁ and K²

179
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:26,012
and we will have left-hand side minus 
the right-hand side, changing both signs

180
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,211
in this integral.

181
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:40,775
This function that multiplies Φ̃₁
will be denoted as D(ω,K).

182
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:46,154
It's a function that depends 
essentially on ω and K

183
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,183
and is called 
the <i>dispersion function</i>.

184
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,542
So what are the possibilities here?

185
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,370
Well it can be that Φ̃₁ is equal to zero.

186
00:16:55,687 --> 00:17:00,534
It means that the Fourier mode is 
not present in the system

187
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:03,552
and this is the less interesting case

188
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:08,571
or more interesting it could be 
that D(ω,K) = 0

189
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:13,774
and in this case we could have
Φ̃₁ ≠ 0.

190
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:20,749
If you want, with D(ω,K) = 0

191
00:17:20,993 --> 00:17:25,146
we will find the intrinsic modes 
that can be present in the system.

192
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:33,939
In other words, by looking 
at the solutions,

193
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:39,518
i.e. the values of ω and K such that
D(ω,K) = 0

194
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:44,081
we find the modes that can be sitting 
in our plasma without,

195
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:50,982
being driven from outside.

196
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:55,700
Let me note one more thing 
before we proceed.

197
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,549
In this integral, there is actually 
a singularity when

198
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:03,597
ω becomes equal to K⋅v.

199
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:08,375
This is actually something 
very interesting in plasma physics.

200
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:15,410
This singularity occurs
when the velocity of the particles

201
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,916
match the phase velocity of the wave.

202
00:18:19,204 --> 00:18:22,354
Basically when particles are 
<i>resonant</i> with the wave.

203
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:26,621
Dealing with these singularities 
is actually very difficult

204
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:32,787
and we will avoid having to explain how 
to deal with these singularities

205
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:34,651
in the present course

206
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:39,733
by considering a case where they are not present

207
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:48,817
because f₀ is equal to zero when 
we consider particles with which ω = K⋅v.

208
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:54,015
Now we have all the elements 
to look and study the dynamics

209
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:57,129
of the system that we want to focus on.

210
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:02,816
The system of two plasma beams, 
shot one against each other,

211
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,481
two counter streaming beams.

212
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:08,683
We want to understand 
what are the intrinsic modes

213
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:10,491
present in this system

214
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:12,873
as a matter of fact
two counter streaming beams

215
00:19:12,873 --> 00:19:19,323
is a system that is very far from 
thermodynamic equilibrium.

216
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:23,193
So, are there intrinsic modes in 
the system that can grow

217
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:29,001
and try to restore the
thermodynamic equilibrium ?

218
00:19:29,606 --> 00:19:31,704
This is what we will do now.

219
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,772
To furthermore simplify system 
we are looking at,

220
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:40,045
we will make the hypothesis of 
a 1-D system,

221
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,835
therefore where <b>K</b> is only 
along the x-direction [ <b>K</b> = K <b>ex</b>]

222
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:54,351
and f₀, d the equilibrium 
function, depends only on vx

223
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:58,419
and for simplicity let me call this vx u.
[f = f₀(vx) = f₀(u) ]

224
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:02,566
So I won't have to carry the index x.

225
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:10,600
In the hypothesis of a 1-D system 
we have that the dispersion function

226
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:20,526
becomes equal to one plus this term 
that has been simplified

227
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:26,120
by considering only a one-dimensional 
distribution function.

228
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:32,140
We are now considering 
two counter streaming beams.

229
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:41,318
Basically the equilibrium 
distribution function f₀

230
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:46,207
is given by the sum of two beams:

231
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:54,350
one at v₀ and the other 
with particles flowing at -v₀.

232
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:58,672
The distribution function that 
we have already seen

233
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:02,396
in a previous module,

234
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:09,601
is centered between
-v₀ and v₀.

235
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:16,474
It's always difficult to draw Dirac
functions that will be something--

236
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:22,062
really peaked around -v₀ and then 
equal to zero

237
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:29,418
and then again at v₀ we will have 
the Dirac function.

238
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:35,900
Now as I was saying, f₀ is very far from 
thermal equilibrium.

239
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:44,394
Are there intrinsic modes to try 
to restore thermal equilibrium?

240
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:48,172
What do we have to do

241
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:55,662
is to evaluate the dispersion function.

242
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:02,561
So this function with f₀ 
given by this expression,

243
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:07,834
the nice thing of this formula here 
is that it avoids [having] to consider

244
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:13,933
[the singularity at ] ω - Ku = 0,
as the distribution function

245
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:18,047
is equal to zero, except at 
two precise points.

246
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,767
And this makes this integral 
a standard integral

247
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:26,040
without the singularities to consider
and therefore

248
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,956
we have that D(ω,K) will be 
given by this integral.

249
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:38,706
Now we can actually integrate 
this expression by parts

250
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:44,030
and it will give f₀/ (ω - Ku)

251
00:22:45,316 --> 00:22:52,542
that has to be evaluated from 
u = -∞ to u = ∞

252
00:22:52,592 --> 00:22:58,487
minus the integral of K f₀

253
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:04,425
and then the derivative of 1/(ω - Ku)

254
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:07,896
and this is equal to one minus...

255
00:23:08,645 --> 00:23:11,422
-we have some coefficient here-

256
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:16,699
and then, well this integral 
is actually simple--

257
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:22,508
I mean first of all the evaluation 
of f₀/ (ω - Ku) from with u

258
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:26,584
taken at -∞ and ∞ is easy

259
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:32,525
because f₀ is equal to zero 
for u = -∞ and u = ∞

260
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:36,348
and this integral is also simply 
done because

261
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:41,035
it's the sum of 
two Dirac functions,

262
00:23:41,074 --> 00:23:47,560
and therefore there will be only 
two contributions [at u=-v₀ and u=v₀].

263
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,319
Carrying out the integral will give ...

264
00:23:52,606 --> 00:23:57,558
... we will have to replace u with -v₀ and v₀.

265
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:03,596
Now we have 
to evaluate the intrinsic mode

266
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:05,256
present in the system.

267
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:15,812
Basically, 
D(ω,K) = 0

268
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:24,988
If we look at the expression of 
D(ω,K) as a function of ω² ,

269
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,322
we find that this is a

270
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:34,689
fourth order polynomial equation.

271
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:37,096
Therefore it will have four roots

272
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:45,519
that are complex conjugates, in fact, 
the coefficients are real

273
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:48,151
and they belong to the complex plane.

274
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:53,705
Now, we can actually draw 
the function, D(ω,K),

275
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:02,504
as a function of ω.

276
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:08,806
What we observe is that for ω
going to plus and minus infinity,

277
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:15,489
this term tends to zero and 
therefore D tends to 1.

278
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:20,189
There is in other words, an
asymptote that is at D=1

279
00:25:21,223 --> 00:25:26,063
and we can also see that there will be 
two singularities when

280
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:31,277
ω is equal to plus and minus K v₀,

281
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:35,479
where this will tend to infinity 
and therefore D(ω,K)

282
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:37,371
will tend to minus infinity.

283
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:40,901
So, two vertical asymptotes.

284
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:47,711
The function will tend to 1 
with ω going to infinity

285
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,953
and similarly here 
and then in this region

286
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:57,735
it will depend a bit on 
the parameters ω, K and v₀.

287
00:25:57,735 --> 00:26:01,167
This is an even function,

288
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:04,769
so we expect that it will do 
something like that

289
00:26:05,345 --> 00:26:07,140
or something like that.

290
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:13,144
And the number of roots 
will be different if

291
00:26:14,012 --> 00:26:21,305
the D(ω,K) crosses or not the axis.

292
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:29,526
More precisely, if D(ω,K) 
evaluated at ω = 0

293
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:32,223
is greater than zero,

294
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:39,137
then there are four roots.

295
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:43,877
This corresponds to the case
that I have drawn here.

296
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:46,086
In this case.

297
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:56,362
Therefore if we look at 
the time dependence of the Fourier modes,

298
00:26:56,509 --> 00:27:03,109
which will be given by exp{-iωt}

299
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:08,065
as their ω belong to the real axis 
we will have modes

300
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:11,136
that are oscillatory, and not growing.

301
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:17,918
There are no intrinsic growing modes

302
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:25,557
that will tend to destroy
the initial distribution function

303
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:30,062
trying therefore to recover 
thermal equilibrium.

304
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:38,184
But if D(ω= 0,K) is less than zero,

305
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:41,815
we will have two roots with

306
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:48,510
ω belonging to the real axis, 
which correspond to these two roots

307
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:53,542
and at here we will look at this case

308
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:59,481
where there are no other solutions 
and therefore we will have two roots,

309
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,328
complex conjugates, that belong to ℂ,

310
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:10,089
Therefore if we look at 
the time dependence of the Fourier modes,

311
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:17,175
we will have that these Fouriermodes 
will contain two

312
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:23,736
imaginary parts with opposite signs 
because they are conjugates

313
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:27,807
and therefore one of the solutions 
will be growing.

314
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,193
There will be an unstable mode 
that can grow in the system.

315
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:41,295
What does it mean in practice?
If we evaluate D(ω= 0,K)

316
00:28:42,257 --> 00:28:48,647
-that is this expression here 
evaluated at ω = 0-

317
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:53,270
we get one minus--

318
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:59,058
let me notice that 
this quantity here,

319
00:29:00,017 --> 00:29:03,461
this is sort of interesting is that 
the plasma frequency.

320
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:14,753
So we can write this as 
1 - ωpe² / (K v₀)²

321
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:20,081
and this has to be less than zero 
to have unstable stable modes,

322
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:27,816
which means that (K v₀)²
has to be less than ωpe².

323
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:33,469
Well this means that 
unstable modes are present

324
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:40,377
at <i>sufficiently</i> low K, which corresponds 
to <i>sufficiently</i> long wave length.

325
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:50,174
So if the system is large enough, 
therefore if small K's

326
00:29:50,174 --> 00:29:53,202
are allowed to grow and 
to be present in the system,

327
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:59,756
you will have modes that will grow 
on top of this equilibrium.

328
00:30:00,594 --> 00:30:03,799
To summarize the contents 
of the present lecture,

329
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:09,484
let me say that we have considered 
one of the simplest kinetic calculations.

330
00:30:09,484 --> 00:30:13,979
The one of two beams that are shot 
to one against each other,

331
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,875
two counter streaming beams,

332
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:22,746
we have simplified the Vlasov Maxwell 
system to look at the evolution

333
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:29,231
of a 1D one dimensional system that
displays electrostatic evolution.

334
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,173
We have also used and applied 
mathematical techniques

335
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:36,585
that we will use throughout this course:

336
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:40,529
linearization and normal mode analysis.

337
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:41,879
And what have we found?

338
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:44,642
We've found that there are

339
00:30:46,602 --> 00:30:50,809
intrinsic modes present 
in the system that can grow.

340
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:55,535
They can grow if the system 
is sufficiently large,

341
00:30:55,535 --> 00:31:01,407
if long enough wavelengths are 
allowed to grow in the system.

342
00:31:02,722 --> 00:31:06,514
Analytically this is the only 
conclusion we can draw.

343
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:13,224
If we want to really look at the dynamics,
the temporal evolution of these two beams,

344
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:17,909
we have to use numerical techniques

345
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,757
and this will be the goal 
of the next module.
