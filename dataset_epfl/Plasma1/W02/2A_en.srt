00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:09,619
Welcome — welcome 
to the plasma physics course of EPFL.

2
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:11,472
My name is Paolo Ricci.

3
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:13,826
I am a professor 
in theoretical plasma phsyics

4
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:18,930
here at EPFL, and today
I would like to introduce the concept

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,243
of kinetic description of a plasma.

6
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:27,977
Throughout the first part of the course,
we have studied how charged particles

7
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:32,609
move in given electric and magnetic fields.

8
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:38,479
Today it's time to look at considering
a more self-consistent description

9
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,334
of a plasma, taking into account
that these charged particles move

10
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:46,584
under the effects
of the electric and magnetic fields

11
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:49,057
that they have themselves generated.

12
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:54,676
So, as a first step 
in today's lecture, we will start

13
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:57,183
from a self-consistent description

14
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:01,769
of a plasma — the most complete
description we can come up with.

15
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:06,074
Then we will introduce the concept
of distribution functions

16
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:10,510
and give some examples,
and then starting from the fact

17
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,166
that particles are conserved,
we will derive

18
00:01:15,836 --> 00:01:19,823
an equation, the Boltzmann equation,
which actually states

19
00:01:19,823 --> 00:01:24,368
how the particle distribution function
evolves over time.

20
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:30,019
The self-consistent description
of a plasma starts

21
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:32,893
by noticing that once
we know the forces

22
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:35,913
that act on each particle,

23
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,978
we can know the position
and velocity of all particles

24
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:42,139
by using Newton's law,

25
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:48,442
for all particles from one, two, three,

26
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:51,174
to the last one, N.

27
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:57,872
More precisely, what we want to do
is to consider the mass

28
00:01:58,873 --> 00:02:04,677
times the acceleration equal to the forces
that are acting on each particle.

29
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:10,052
As we are dealing with 
electrically charged particles

30
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:24,702
will be given by 
qi { E (ri, t) + vi × B (ri, t) }

31
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:30,422
Once we know the position
and the velocity of all particles

32
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:33,959
we can evaluate the charge
density and the current density.

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,564
In fact, the [charge] density
will be equal to the sum

34
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:42,080
over all particles, of their charge [ qi ]
times a delta function [ δ(r-ri) ]

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,780
that takes into account 
that the particles are located

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,995
at the position ri, and
therefore the contribution

37
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:54,994
of the charge will be 
equal to zero everywhere else

38
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:58,573
but at their own position.

39
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:02,762
Similarly, for the current density
we will have that this

40
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,707
will be equal to the sum 
-over all particles-,

41
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:08,868
[of the] charge of all particles,

42
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:11,917
then their velocity [vi] 
times the delta function

43
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:15,492
that takes into account
that particles are located ri.

44
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,404
Once we know the charge density
and the current density,

45
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:25,352
we can evaluate the electric 
and magnetic fields.

46
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:31,691
This can be done
by using Maxwell's equations,

47
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:39,746
which state that the divergence of E

48
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:43,196
is equal to ρ/ε₀,
[ ∇⋅E = ρ/ε₀ ]

49
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:48,642
the curl of E is equal to -∂B/∂t.
[ ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t ]

50
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:52,956
Divergence of B is equal to zero
[ ∇⋅B =0 ]

51
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:57,830
and the curl of B is equal to μ₀

52
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:05,854
(j + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) .
[ ∇ × B = μ₀ ( j + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) ]

53
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:09,238
Once we have evaluated the
electric and magnetic fields

54
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:13,144
by solving Maxwell's equations,
we can actually evaluate the force

55
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:14,874
that acts on each particle.

56
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:19,170
In fact, the force that acts
on each particle

57
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:25,308
will be given by the electric force

58
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:30,232
with the electric field evaluated at ri

59
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:33,785
plus the Lorentz force.

60
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:43,143
The system of equations
that I have just described

61
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:49,327
actually is able to represent
carefully and in the most complete way

62
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:51,219
the dynamics of the plasma.

63
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:57,291
It's able to describe the evolution
and the motion of all the particles

64
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:02,225
that constitute our system
in the electric and magnetic fields

65
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:06,615
that are self-consistently generated
by their presence.

66
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:11,961
The description that we've given
of a plasma is very complete,

67
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,952
very accurate, however it's not practical.

68
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:19,823
It wants to describe the evolution
of a huge number of particles.

69
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:25,587
Just to give you an example,
there are about 10²¹ particles

70
00:05:25,587 --> 00:05:28,675
in a fusion experiment.

71
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:33,580
It's way too many to deal
both numerically and analytically.

72
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,345
We need a different approach,
a statistical approach.

73
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:41,379
This is why we are going to introduce
the distribution function,

74
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,193
which is a function that tells us

75
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:49,618
how particles are distributed,
-are located- in phase space.

76
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,217
Phase space is a six-dimensional space:
3 dimensions in velocity,

77
00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:57,838
3 dimensions in configuration space.

78
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:04,154
It's something that I cannot represent
on the screen here,

79
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:05,910
on the two-dimensional screen.

80
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,492
Therefore I will do a projection
of the six-dimensional plane

81
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:13,408
on the two-dimensional plane
that we can look at.

82
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:19,816
Here is the projection
of this six-dimensional plane

83
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:25,212
for what concerns 
the configuration space position

84
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,775
and for what concerns the velocity position.

85
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:33,064
Particles are distributed
in this phase space

86
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:35,131
and I will draw a few of them.

87
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:38,672
They are these points
that I am representing here.

88
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:43,049
Let's consider a volume —

89
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,049
a volume that is large

90
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:50,437
from a microscopic point of view,

91
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:54,006
so that many particles
are contained in it,

92
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:58,529
but which is still small
by looking at it macroscopically.

93
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:03,293
This volume will have an extension
that is given by dv

94
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:07,868
along the v direction
and dr along the r direction.

95
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:13,098
What we do: we define a function,
the distribution function, f(r,v,t)

96
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:18,317
which is a function of position,
velocity and time,

97
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:21,835
such that when the value of this function,

98
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:27,053
is multiplied by dr dv, what we obtain

99
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:30,599
is the number of particles

100
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:37,971
that are contained 
the phase space volume,

101
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,012
at time t

102
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:47,247
dr dv, centered in r and v.

103
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:51,840
Actually there is a distribution function
for each species and therefore,

104
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,231
for each species we will have
a distribution function

105
00:07:56,772 --> 00:07:58,651
that we will call fs(r,v,t)

106
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:00,873
-s is the index of the species-

107
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:05,319
that will depend, of course, 
on position, v, and t.

108
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,527
Some interesting quantities:

109
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:16,903
first the total number 
of particles for species s

110
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:20,024
that we'll call Ns,

111
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:22,399
and this will be the integral

112
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,821
over all positions, over all velocities

113
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:33,895
of the distribution function.
[ Ns = ∫ dr ∫ dv fs(r,v,t) ]

114
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:36,888
Anotherquantity of interest: 
the number density,

115
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:43,487
which represents the density of particles
in configuration space

116
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:46,909
independently of their distribution
in velocity space.

117
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:51,133
This will be a function 
of position [and] time

118
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:55,392
and will be given 
by the integral over all velocities

119
00:08:55,855 --> 00:09:00,551
of the distribution function
[ ns = ∫ dv fs(r,v,t) ]

120
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,012
and finally the average velocity

121
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,228
which is a function of position
and which is given by the average

122
00:09:10,636 --> 00:09:14,053
of the velocity of all particles,

123
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,493
weighted according 
to their distribution function.

124
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:21,498
[ us = 1/ ns ∫ dv v fs(r,v,t)]

125
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:25,360
We have introduced the concept
of distribution function.

126
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,163
Let's give some examples.

127
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:31,886
We are going to consider
distribution functions

128
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:36,220
that are independent 
of the spatial coordinates.

129
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,324
We will in other words consider
a uniform plasma.

130
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:45,192
We will consider a distribution function
that also does not depend on time.

131
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:49,880
Probably the most known example
of a distribution function

132
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,237
is the Maxwell-Boltzmann 
distribution function.

133
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:56,790
This is the distribution function
of the plasma particles

134
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,495
once the thermal equilibrium is attained.

135
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:06,668
It states that particles are distributed

136
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:11,184
according to a Gaussian
distribution function.

137
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:18,260
If we specify this distribution function
in one dimension, we have

138
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,484
that F₀(v) 
-this time it is not the modulus,

139
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:28,275
it is really the one-dimensional
distribution function -

140
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:33,917
is equal to n₀ 1/( 2 π vth )
[vth = v_thermal]

141
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:37,911
- this time to the power 1/2 -

142
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:43,381
exp {-v² / (2 vth²) }.

143
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:50,022
We can draw this distribution function
for the one-dimensional case

144
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:52,635
as a function of the velocity

145
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:59,416
and what we have is a curve 
that peaks at v = 0.

146
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:05,688
The spreading of this curve 
is given by vth.

147
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:12,902
Another interesting distribution function
is a monoenergetic beam in one dimension

148
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:23,770
and this will be given
by F₀(v) = n₀ δ(v-v₀),

149
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,904
[where] v₀ is the velocity of the beam.
Basically all particles

150
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:33,479
have a velocity that is equal
to v₀ and there are no other particles

151
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,910
that have a velocity different from v₀.

152
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:41,035
If we try to draw this function,
it's very difficult to draw

153
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:45,854
a Dirac distribution,
but at least intuitively

154
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:49,812
we can give an idea of how

155
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:52,777
this distribution function looks.

156
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:56,748
In fact, the distribution function
will be equal to zero

157
00:11:56,748 --> 00:12:03,386
except at v = v₀. It will be 
something very close to zero,...

158
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:09,518
... and then around v = v₀
it will go up to infinity,

159
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:12,687
- of course I cannot
go out from the screen- ,

160
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:16,203
then it will fall back to zero.

161
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:22,116
The last example of distribution function
that I would like to give is

162
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:25,935
two counter-streaming beams
in one dimension.

163
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:31,101
In that case, the distribution function
is given by the sum

164
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:36,581
of two Dirac functions,
one centered at v₀,

165
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:40,296
and one centered at -v₀, for example.

166
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:45,048
The distribution function in this case

167
00:12:46,193 --> 00:12:48,863
will be equal to zero everywhere

168
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:53,554
except at -v₀ and at +v₀.

169
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:59,599
Therefore equal to zero up to -v₀,
where it will go up to infinity—

170
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:02,343
of course here I cannot represent that,

171
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:07,446
then go down back to zero, up to v = v₀,

172
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:12,206
where I will go up to infinity again,
and then it will come back [to zero].

173
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:18,429
Now that we have introduced
the concept of distribution function

174
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:21,906
and we have given a few examples
of distribution functions,

175
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:26,346
we can start to derive an equation,
an equation that shows how

176
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:29,840
the distribution function evolves
as a function of time.

177
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:35,372
To do that, the starting point
is noticing, observing

178
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:39,854
that particles are not created
nor destroyed in phase space.

179
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:43,377
So the starting point 
of this equation will be the observation

180
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:46,390
that particles are conserved
in phase space.

181
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,036
Let's try to translate it
into mathematical expressions.

182
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:54,586
Let's start from our phase space —

183
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,788
the six-dimensional phase space
that here I have to project

184
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,344
over two dimensions,

185
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:03,540
and where the particles are located.

186
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:08,095
If there are no sources,
nor sinks of particles,

187
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:15,837
then if we look at a small volume
present in our system,

188
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,124
what we will observe is
that the variation of the particles

189
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:24,384
contained in this small volume
will be due to the flux

190
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:30,226
of particles inflowing
or outflowing from this volume.

191
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:35,873
In other words, it will be given
by minus the divergence,

192
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:40,560
divergence that has to be evaluated
in a six-dimensional space [ ∇₆⋅ ],

193
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,650
the six-dimensional phase space —

194
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,594
of u, which is the velocity at which

195
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:52,149
particles are moving
in the phase space, times fs.

196
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:57,451
This is something that
tells us that particles are conserved.

197
00:14:58,348 --> 00:15:01,041
They are not created nor destroyed.

198
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:08,182
What do I mean with this 
nabla in six dimensions? [∇₆]

199
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:13,431
This is the generalization
of the nabla operator

200
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:16,829
that we know from three-dimensional space,

201
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:19,829
extended to velocity space.

202
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,259
So this will be equal to

203
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:36,996
∇₆⋅ = (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z, ∂/∂vx, ∂/∂vy, ∂/∂vz)

204
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:40,912
which is also equal,
and we will shorten this

205
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:45,216
as the nabla operator
in the configuration space

206
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:49,346
that I will write as ( ∂/∂<b>r</b>)
and the nabla operator

207
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:53,433
in velocity space, 
that I will write as ( ∂/∂<b>v</b>).

208
00:15:55,411 --> 00:16:00,921
Now <b>u</b> is the derivative of <b>r</b>

209
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:05,540
with respect to time
and of <b>v</b> with respect to time.

210
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:14,622
Particles change their position in time

211
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:16,502
and this change is equal

212
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:22,078
to the velocity and 
they change their velocity

213
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:27,127
according to their acceleration,
which is given by the force

214
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,424
divided by the mass of the particles
according to Newton's Law.

215
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:37,546
This in other terms is equal to <b>v</b>,

216
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,770
and then we have to divide 
the forces in two.

217
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:48,043
As we know from the first part
of the course, there will be

218
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:50,309
long-range forces [ Fˡʳ ]

219
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:57,297
that will act on our system
plus short-range forces [ Fˢʳ ]

220
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:03,900
The long-range forces are the forces
due to collective effects that occur

221
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,092
to a global evolution of our system,

222
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:12,797
while the short-range forces
are due to collisions,

223
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:15,585
basically one-to-one particle interactions.

224
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:19,460
Just to be clear, [the superscript] <i>l.r.</i>
will stand

225
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,843
for <i>long-range</i> forces,
the ones due to collective effects,

226
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:29,479
while with <i>s.r.</i> we will denote
<i>short-range</i> forces.

227
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:34,596
If we introduce this expression

228
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,596
in the continuity equation

229
00:17:37,596 --> 00:17:39,816
in the six-dimensional space,

230
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:44,014
what we obtain is that ∂fs/∂t

231
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:49,145
is equal to the part of the divergence

232
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:54,645
that is the one in configuration space,

233
00:17:54,645 --> 00:18:02,075
so it's -∂/∂<b>r</b> ⋅ (<b>v</b> fs)

234
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:05,083
minus ∂/∂<b>v</b> ...

235
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,143
of the contribution

236
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:10,308
of both long-range and short-range forces.

237
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:17,390
Here we have translated
this six-dimensional operator

238
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,390
in an operator in real space
and in velocity space.

239
00:18:22,963 --> 00:18:26,364
The conservation law
that we have just derived

240
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:31,028
can be put in a more usual form —

241
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,208
the so-called Boltzmann equation,

242
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,606
which is the equation 
that can be used to describe

243
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:41,452
how the distribution function

244
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:43,272
evolves as a function of time.

245
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:50,058
The starting point is the conservation law
that we have just written.

246
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,991
Let's make a few observations.

247
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:05,050
The first thing that we have to notice
is that as v is independent of r,

248
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:10,413
as <b>v</b> and <b>r</b> are independent
phase-space variables,

249
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:17,388
then we will have that 
∂/∂<b>r</b> ⋅ (<b>v</b> fs)

250
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:18,298
is equal

251
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:22,608
to <b>v</b> ⋅ ∂fs/∂<b>r</b>.

252
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:26,788
The second thing that we notice
is that the forces that we have written

253
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:29,861
are actually electric and magnetic forces.

254
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:34,139
So F long-range [ Fˡʳ ], for example,

255
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:38,675
will be equal to the charge 
of the particles multiplied

256
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:42,789
by the long-range electric field [ Eˡʳ ]

257
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:44,790
plus the Lorentz force 
[ <b>v</b> × <b>B</b>ˡʳ]

258
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:50,620
Now the electric field
is independent of <b>v</b>.

259
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:56,299
The Lorentz force is perpendicular to <b>v</b>.

260
00:19:58,285 --> 00:20:02,740
This implies that the divergence
with respect to <b>v</b>

261
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,734
of ( <b>F</b>ˡʳ fs), is equal

262
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:14,175
to the force long-range dot ∂fs/∂<b>v</b>
[<b>F</b>ˡʳ ⋅ ∂fs/∂<b>v</b>]

263
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,772
What does it mean?

264
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:20,618
If we use this expression 
in the calculation,

265
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:23,703
in the conservation law
that we have written,

266
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:28,439
we have that ∂fs/∂t will be equal

267
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:34,019
to -<b>v</b> ⋅ ∂fs/∂<b>r</b> minus —

268
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,854
let's separate the contribution
of long-range and short-range forces,

269
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,679
so it will be the long-range forces

270
00:20:47,263 --> 00:20:53,075
dot ∂fs/∂<b>v</b>
[<b>F</b>ˡʳ/ms ⋅ ∂fs/∂<b>v</b> ]

271
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:57,585
minus the contribution
of the short-range forces.

272
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:03,599
We can rewrite these in a more usual form

273
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:08,893
by bringing these terms
on the left-hand side

274
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:19,390
and leaving the short-range forces
on the right-hand side.

275
00:21:21,828 --> 00:21:25,782
This term here

276
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:29,626
is actually a term that is
related to collisions.

277
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:33,885
It gives the evolution
of the distribution function

278
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:38,003
due to collisions. It is something
that is usually called

279
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:43,435
the collision operator
and is denoted as (∂f/∂t)c

280
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,694
with an index c

281
00:21:46,694 --> 00:21:48,565
to say that this is due to collisions.

282
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:53,124
From this we get an equation

283
00:21:55,768 --> 00:22:00,659
where I explicitly write the forces
as the decomposition

284
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,572
of the electric and magnetic force

285
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:14,464
which is known as the <i>Boltzmann equation</i>.

286
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:24,047
So here we got to the end
of today's lecture.

287
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:25,514
What have we done?

288
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:29,472
We have approached
a self-consistent description

289
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:34,386
of a plasma by taking 
into account that particles move

290
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,727
under the electric and magnetic fields
that they have themselves generated.

291
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:42,736
Therefore what we've done
is to introduce the tools

292
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,670
to describe the system
of many particles.

293
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,893
We have introduced the concept
of distribution function,

294
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:53,422
and then we have derived,

295
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:58,134
by starting from the conservation 
of particles, an equation —

296
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:02,438
the Boltzmann equation — which states
how this distribution function

297
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:05,541
evolves in time in the phase space.
