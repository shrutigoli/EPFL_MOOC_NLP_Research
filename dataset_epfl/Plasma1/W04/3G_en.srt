00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:10,209
Welcome to the course on plasma physics
and application to fusion energy.

2
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:11,941
astrophysics and industry.

3
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:17,346
My name is Duccio Testa and in this lecture
we will be studying the stability

4
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:18,880
of the MHD equilibrium.

5
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:24,784
What happens if a plasma
in MHD equilibrium is perturbed?

6
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:27,784
We want to answer this question,

7
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:34,446
and we will do this by working
through some examples of MHD instability.

8
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:37,344
We will be looking
at the sausage instability,

9
00:00:37,344 --> 00:00:42,230
at the kink instability, and then 
at the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

10
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:48,279
We will then look at the effect
of the wall surrounding the plasma

11
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:52,785
on instabilities and the link
to flux freezing.

12
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,008
Then we will study methods

13
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:58,787
to analyze the stability
of MHD equilibria.

14
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:03,599
What happens if a plasma
in MHD equilibrium is perturbed?

15
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:07,451
There are different possible scenarios
and we will look at them

16
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:09,560
in analogy with classical mechanics.

17
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:12,665
The first example is this one here.

18
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:18,830
We have a potential well — the black line
— and our system, the green dot,

19
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,504
sits at the bottom
of the potential well.

20
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:27,517
This is a situation of stable equilibrium
because if we displace our system,

21
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:32,193
its potential energy increases
and then it will hold back

22
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:36,308
to the bottom of the well
in the starting equilibrium position.

23
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:38,629
This is a stable situation.

24
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:43,689
The second example here
is actually the opposite of the first.

25
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:46,571
We are in a situation
of unstable equilibrium.

26
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:50,986
In fact, we are at the top
of the hill in potential energy,

27
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:55,421
so if our system is displaced
its potential energy will decrease

28
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:59,729
and it will keep rolling away
from the equilibrium point

29
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,518
at the top of the hill.

30
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:04,877
This is a situation 
of unstable equilibrium.

31
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:10,626
We have a third situation here
where the equilibrium

32
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,883
of our system is indifferent
because the potential energy is flat,

33
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:18,072
so we can move it left or right.

34
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,057
Potential energy doesn't change.

35
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:23,490
This is a situation 
of indifferent equilibrium.

36
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:28,085
The situation can actually be more complex

37
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:30,678
For instance, we have a case here

38
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:34,053
where our system sits 
at the top of the hill

39
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:40,905
in potential energy, but in fact,
we notice [that] if our equilibrium is perturbed,

40
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:45,246
this system will roll down the hill and it
actually will not go very far

41
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:49,183
because it will end up at the bottom
of a potential well here.

42
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:52,256
This is another situation of equilibrium.

43
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:56,228
This system is really linearly unstable,

44
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:59,748
but in the end it will be
nonlinearly stable.

45
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:06,145
The final case, here,
is the opposite of our previous case.

46
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:10,594
The system, in its initial condition
of equilibrium, is at the bottom

47
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:16,090
of a potential well, but if we move it,
it may go up to the top of the hill.

48
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,440
Then potential energy decreases
by rolling down the hill.

49
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,839
So this system is linearly stable,
but nonlinearly unstable.

50
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:30,894
We will consider the example of 
instability affected the MHD equilibria,

51
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:32,985
and therefore we will basically work

52
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:38,329
on the situation where we are
in this condition, a situation

53
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:40,029
of unstable equilibrium.

54
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,058
The first example of instability
is the sausage instability in the Z-pinch.

55
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:53,370
We remember from the previous lecture —
[that] the Z-pinch is a confinement device,

56
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,382
where we have an axial current, Jz,

57
00:03:57,382 --> 00:04:01,038
and an azimuthal magnetic field, Bθ.

58
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:05,801
The equilibrium of the Z-pinch
is described by the balance

59
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,435
between the gradient
in the plasma pressure P,

60
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:12,955
the magnetic field pressure
Bθ²/2μ₀

61
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:17,231
and the tension of the magnetic field 
lines being wrapped around the surface

62
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,482
of the Z-pinch.

63
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:22,550
Now we assume an initial perturbation
in the form of compressions and bulges.

64
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:28,114
P1 is a point where we 
have compressed the plasma.

65
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:35,262
The total current in the Z-pinch, 
I, remains constant.

66
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:37,268
At this compression point,

67
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:41,948
the radius of the plasma cross-section

68
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:46,267
becomes smaller 
and therefore Bθ increases.

69
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:51,569
So the magnetic pressure increases,
which squeezes the plasma further.

70
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:55,075
So we are further compressing the plasma.

71
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,600
The initial perturbation grows.

72
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:03,945
Basically, at the point P2,
which is a point of bulging,

73
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:07,341
we have the opposite,
Bθ decreases,

74
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:10,221
which then allows the plasma
to expand further.

75
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:14,075
So the initial perturbation grows,
and the net effect

76
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:15,713
is the sausage instability.

77
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:21,793
Now the second example of instability
is the kink instability in the Z-pinch.

78
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:26,313
We assume an initial perturbation
in the form of bending.

79
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:31,129
We've pushed up the plasma at P1.

80
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:34,031
The field lines come closer to each other.

81
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:40,064
Bθ increases, therefore 
the magnetic pressure increases,

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,461
and this pushes the plasma up.

83
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,872
At P2, the field lines comes apart.

84
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,258
Bθ decreases, the magnetic pressure 
decreases, and the plasma

85
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:56,287
cannot be pushed back down.

86
00:05:58,603 --> 00:06:01,715
So the net effect is the growth
of the initial perturbation.

87
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:04,184
The plasma is pushed up.

88
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:07,127
The net effect is the kink instability.

89
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:12,087
After the example of instability is
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in plasmas

90
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:17,861
We consider an equilibrium
with the plasma on top of a vacuum region,

91
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:19,719
subject to gravity.

92
00:06:20,826 --> 00:06:24,777
The interface between the plasma
and the vacuum is perturbed

93
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:26,033
by a ripple.

94
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,871
There is a drift, induced by gravity,

95
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:35,416
and this drift leads 
to charge separation —

96
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,064
ions on one side,

97
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,461
electrons on the other side.

98
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:46,138
Charge separation leads
to an electric field E,

99
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:51,578
and the resulting (E × B) drift
increases the original perturbation.

100
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,768
It pulls the ripple down,
it pulls the ripple up.

101
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,850
So again, the initial perturbation grows.

102
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:04,399
We are in a situation of instability.

103
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:08,922
If we reverse this situation,
so if we put the vacuum region on top,

104
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:14,835
or if the direction of g is reversed,
this equilibrium becomes stable.

105
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:19,364
The most common example
of Rayleigh-Taylor instability is

106
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:21,408
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in fluids.

107
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,728
Here we have a simulation
that shows the development

108
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:29,090
of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
when we have a heavy liquid —

109
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,831
water, in blue — that sits
on top of a light liquid — oil,

110
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:37,216
in yellow, subject to gravity.

111
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,712
We have an initial ripple
at the interface surface

112
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:46,865
and we see that as a function
of time this ripple is amplified.

113
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,546
We can go back
to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability

114
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:55,548
in plasma and the centrifugal force
due to the magnetic field's curvature

115
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:57,494
plays the role of gravity.

116
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:02,392
This force, Fc, is expressed
by this formula.

117
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:04,938
You see that it depends on Rc.

118
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:08,740
This is the radius of curvature
of the magnetic field line.

119
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:13,285
Here we have two drawings.

120
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:16,630
In the first case, Rc points
away from the plasma.

121
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:22,094
So it goes from the heavier fluid
to the light fluid.

122
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:25,450
This leads to instability.

123
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:30,743
In fact, this is a situation
that we call a situation

124
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,154
where the magnetic field
has a bad curvature.

125
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:36,708
The magnetic field is concave
towards the plasma.

126
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:42,411
The opposite situation
is if Rc points towards the plasma,

127
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:48,033
so from the lighter fluid, the vacuum,
to the heavier fluid, the plasma.

128
00:08:48,924 --> 00:08:51,246
In this case, the equilibrium is stable.

129
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:54,760
This is a region of good curvature.

130
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,772
The magnetic field is convex
towards the plasma.

131
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,721
Let's look at the role
of the wall surrounding the plasma

132
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:04,377
on MHD instability.

133
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:09,027
You can see here a plasma column,
which has a current J,

134
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:10,800
and a magnetic field B.

135
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:15,943
There is an instability that develops
and pushes the plasma

136
00:09:16,683 --> 00:09:19,115
towards the surrounding ideal wall.

137
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:21,942
The resistivity of the wall, η, is zero.

138
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:25,534
The magnetic field
cannot penetrate into the wall.

139
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,971
So we ask ourselves:
can the magnetic field penetrate

140
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:32,729
inside the plasma
and can the magnetic flux

141
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,609
to [inside] the plasma change?

142
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,059
To answer this question,

143
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,828
we have to study one important property
of ideal MHD, which is

144
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:44,914
the conservation of the magnetic flux.

145
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:51,382
The magnetic flux Φ is the flux
of the magnetic field B

146
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,003
through the surface S
that encloses the field line.

147
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,472
These are our field lines.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,005
This is the surface S which is delimited

149
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:04,615
by a contour C.

150
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:12,518
Let's describe the time derivative
of the magnetic flux: dΦ/dt.

151
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:17,213
We can put the time derivative
into the surface integral

152
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:21,167
because the temporal
and spatial coordinates are independent.

153
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,612
So dΦ/dt is the sum of two terms:

154
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:27,193
the time derivative of the magnetic field,

155
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:33,499
∂B/∂t • dS, plus B • the time derivative

156
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,649
of dS, the surface element.

157
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,699
We can study these two terms separately.

158
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:43,795
We can start with the first one
and we can use Faraday's law.

159
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:52,059
So we have the integral
over the surface S of ∂B/∂t

160
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:57,684
is minus the integral [over] the surface S
of the curl of E • ds.

161
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,393
We can now use Stokes' theorem
and express the surface integral

162
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:08,793
in an integral over the contour C,
delimiting the surface.

163
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:15,222
Now we can work
on to the second term.

164
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:18,633
So we are looking at
the time derivative

165
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,624
of the surface element dS.

166
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:26,557
So at time t1, the surface element
is delimited by this contour, C1,

167
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:30,897
which moves at time t2 
to the front contour, C2.

168
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:35,171
So if you take a point
on the first contour,

169
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:41,060
we can have the vector, 
dl, and the normal,

170
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:45,835
so the variation 
of the surface element, ds,

171
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:51,045
we can simply see that it is
the cross-product of (vdt × dl).

172
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:57,651
So we can use this expression for [d/dt of ] dS
in the second term of our integral.

173
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,133
So our surface integral, B • d/dt dS,

174
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:12,073
becomes the integral over the contour C

175
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:15,794
or B • (v × dl).

176
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:20,122
We can now put the two terms
together that we have obtained

177
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:22,241
for the time derivative

178
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,926
of the magnetic flux, dΦ/dt.

179
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:35,360
So we have two integrals
over the contour, C.

180
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,155
We can rearrange the terms
in the second integral

181
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:40,848
and combine it with the first.

182
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:50,139
What we have here
is that dΦ/dt is minus the integral

183
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:55,221
over the contour C of 
(E + v × B) • dl.

184
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,200
This is the Ohm's and we know

185
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,985
that the (E + v × B)
in ideal MHD is equal to zero.

186
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,111
And so this integral is equal to zero,

187
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:13,720
which tells us that dΦ/dt 
is equal to zero.

188
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:17,539
As dΦ/dt is equal to zero
in the ideal MHD,

189
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:22,281
the magnetic flux through every surface
moving with the plasma is constant.

190
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:28,148
The magnetic flux is therefore frozen
into the plasma in the absence

191
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:29,469
of plasma resistivity.

192
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:33,578
We can now go back
to the effect of the wall

193
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:35,486
on MHD instabilities.

194
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,951
The magnetic field, when the plasma

195
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:45,731
is pushed towards the wall,
cannot penetrate into the wall,

196
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:48,684
so the magnetic field
is compressed in the vacuum region

197
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:51,006
between the plasma and the wall.

198
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:56,288
The magnetic pressure is increased,
and that pushes the plasma

199
00:13:56,288 --> 00:13:58,577
back towards the center of the device.

200
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:02,976
This tells us that plasmas
can be stabilized

201
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,529
by a surrounding wall.

202
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:08,764
However, this effect is limited
by the finite resistivity

203
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:14,613
of the plasma and of the wall,
and so this effect only lasts

204
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:16,646
over a finite time scale.

205
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,793
Let's look at some general methods

206
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,537
for general analysis of MHD stability.

207
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:29,819
For uniform plasmas,
we can perform a Fourier analysis

208
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,288
in space and time.

209
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,298
This corresponds 
to a normal mode analysis.

210
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:36,616
So we assume perturbation in the form

211
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:42,306
of an exponential (ik • x - iωt)

212
00:14:42,306 --> 00:14:46,134
and then we look at the imaginary part
of ω, the wave frequency.

213
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:50,381
If the imaginary part of ω
is positive, we are in a situation

214
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:54,947
where the perturbation grows,
so we are in a situation

215
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:56,606
where an instability develops.

216
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:02,162
For non-uniform plasmas,
we can cast the MHD equations

217
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:04,551
into a force balance equation.

218
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:08,953
We have the mass density
of the fluid element ρM

219
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,331
times d²ξ / dt² .

220
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:17,534
ξ is a fluid displacement,

221
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:23,247
and this is equal to a force operator
F(ξ), that represents

222
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:28,592
the force acting on the fluid element
whose mass density is ρM,

223
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:31,194
producing a displacement ξ.

224
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,891
We can then perform 
a Fourier analysis only in time.

225
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:41,295
This tells us that -ρMω² ξ

226
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:45,172
is equal to F — this is 
an Eigenvalue equation;

227
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:49,692
the sign of ω² determines 
the stability or instability.

228
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:53,976
We can also perform
an energy principle analysis.

229
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:58,067
We can evaluate the equivalent
of the work δW which is

230
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,435
-1/2 the integral

231
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:04,528
over the plasma volume V of F • ξ.

232
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,373
This corresponds to the change
in the potential energy of the system.

233
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:13,359
The sign of δW, corresponds
to stability or instability.

234
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:18,082
We've seen that the plasma
in an MHD equlibrium

235
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:21,609
and in general can be subject
to many instabilities.

236
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:24,215
How can we control this instability?

237
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:26,172
We have two methods.

238
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:28,800
The first method is 
a passive control system.

239
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,459
We use intrinsic 
stabilization mechanisms

240
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:35,022
as we have seen in the case of a wall
surrounding the plasma.

241
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,774
The second method
is an active control system.

242
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:43,150
We detect the onset
of an instability and apply

243
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:48,786
feedback control schemes in real-time
that act on plasma parameters

244
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:53,717
and with this feedback control scheme
we can try to stabilize the instability

245
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:55,705
or limit its development.

246
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:00,230
Let's summarize 
what we've discussed in this lecture.

247
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:03,484
We've qualitatively
discussed some examples

248
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:07,518
of instability: the sausage,
the kink, and the Rayleigh-Taylor.

249
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,966
We've see that the wall
surrounding the plasma

250
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:15,335
can be stabilizing
because of the frozen-in condition

251
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,504
of the magnetic field,
which is valid in ideal MHD.

252
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:24,868
Then we've seen that the linear stability
of an MHD equilibrum can be studied

253
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:29,082
using Fourier analysis techniques
or energy considerations.
