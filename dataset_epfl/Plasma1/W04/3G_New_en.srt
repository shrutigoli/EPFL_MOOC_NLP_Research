00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,660
My name is Duccio Testa and in this lecture
we will be studying the stability

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,200
of the MHD equilibrium.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,100
What happens if a plasma
in MHD equilibrium is perturbed?

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,100
We want to answer this question,

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,760
and we will do this by working
through some examples of MHD instability.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,660
We will be looking
at the sausage instability,

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,550
at the kink instability, and then
at the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,590
We will then look at the effect
of the wall surrounding the plasma

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,100
on instabilities and the link
to flux freezing.

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,320
Then we will study methods

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,100
to analyze the stability
of MHD equilibria.

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,910
What happens if a plasma
in MHD equilibrium is perturbed?

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,770
There are different possible scenarios
and we will look at them

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,880
in analogy with classical mechanics.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,980
The first example is this one here.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,150
We have a potential well — the black line
— and our system, the green dot,

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,820
sits at the bottom
of the potential well.

18
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,830
This is a situation of stable equilibrium
because if we displace our system,

19
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,510
its potential energy increases
and then it will hold back

20
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,620
to the bottom of the well
in the starting equilibrium position.

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,940
This is a stable situation.

22
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,000
The second example here
is actually the opposite of the first.

23
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,890
We are in a situation
of unstable equilibrium.

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,300
In fact, we are at the top
of the hill in potential energy,

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,740
so if our system is displaced
its potential energy will decrease

26
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,040
and it will keep rolling away
from the equilibrium point

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,830
at the top of the hill.

28
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,190
This is a situation
of unstable equilibrium.

29
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,940
We have a third situation here
where the equilibrium

30
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,200
of our system is indifferent
because the potential energy is flat,

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,390
so we can move it left or right.

32
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,370
Potential energy doesn't change.

33
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,810
This is a situation
of indifferent equilibrium.

34
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,400
The situation can actually be more complex

35
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,990
For instance, we have a case here

36
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,370
where our system sits
at the top of the hill

37
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,220
in potential energy, but in fact,
we notice [that] if our equilibrium is perturbed,

38
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,560
this system will roll down the hill and it
actually will not go very far

39
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,500
because it will end up at the bottom
of a potential well here.

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,570
This is another situation of equilibrium.

41
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,540
This system is really linearly unstable,

42
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,060
but in the end it will be
nonlinearly stable.

43
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,460
The final case, here,
is the opposite of our previous case.

44
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,910
The system, in its initial condition
of equilibrium, is at the bottom

45
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,410
of a potential well, but if we move it,
it may go up to the top of the hill.

46
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,760
Then potential energy decreases
by rolling down the hill.

47
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,150
So this system is linearly stable,
but nonlinearly unstable.

48
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,210
We will consider the example of
instability affected the MHD equilibria,

49
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,300
and therefore we will basically work

50
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,640
on the situation where we are
in this condition, a situation

51
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,340
of unstable equilibrium.

52
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,370
The first example of instability
is the sausage instability in the Z-pinch.

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,690
We remember from the previous lecture —
[that] the Z-pinch is a confinement device,

54
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,700
where we have an axial current, Jz,

55
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,350
and an azimuthal magnetic field, Bθ.

56
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,120
The equilibrium of the Z-pinch
is described by the balance

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,750
between the gradient
in the plasma pressure P,

58
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,270
the magnetic field pressure
Bθ²/2μ₀

59
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,550
and the tension of the magnetic field
lines being wrapped around the surface

60
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,800
of the Z-pinch.

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,870
Now we assume an initial perturbation
in the form of compressions and bulges.

62
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,430
P1 is a point where we
have compressed the plasma.

63
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,580
The total current in the Z-pinch,
I, remains constant.

64
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,580
At this compression point,

65
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,260
the radius of the plasma cross-section

66
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,580
becomes smaller
and therefore Bθ increases.

67
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,880
So the magnetic pressure increases,
which squeezes the plasma further.

68
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,390
So we are further compressing the plasma.

69
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,920
The initial perturbation grows.

70
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,260
Basically, at the point P2,
which is a point of bulging,

71
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,660
we have the opposite,
Bθ decreases,

72
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,540
which then allows the plasma
to expand further.

73
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,390
So the initial perturbation grows,
and the net effect

74
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,030
is the sausage instability.

75
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,110
Now the second example of instability
is the kink instability in the Z-pinch.

76
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,630
We assume an initial perturbation
in the form of bending.

77
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,440
We've pushed up the plasma at P1.

78
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,350
The field lines come closer to each other.

79
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:32,380
Bθ increases, therefore
the magnetic pressure increases,

80
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,780
and this pushes the plasma up.

81
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,190
At P2, the field lines comes apart.

82
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,570
Bθ decreases, the magnetic pressure
decreases, and the plasma

83
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,600
cannot be pushed back down.

84
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,030
So the net effect is the growth
of the initial perturbation.

85
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,500
The plasma is pushed up.

86
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,440
The net effect is the kink instability.

87
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,400
After the example of instability is
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in plasmas

88
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,180
We consider an equilibrium
with the plasma on top of a vacuum region,

89
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,030
subject to gravity.

90
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,090
The interface between the plasma
and the vacuum is perturbed

91
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,350
by a ripple.

92
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,190
There is a drift, induced by gravity,

93
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,730
and this drift leads
to charge separation —

94
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,380
ions on one side,

95
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,780
electrons on the other side.

96
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,450
Charge separation leads
to an electric field E,

97
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,890
and the resulting (E × B) drift
increases the original perturbation.

98
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,080
It pulls the ripple down,
it pulls the ripple up.

99
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,170
So again, the initial perturbation grows.

100
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,710
We are in a situation of instability.

101
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,240
If we reverse this situation,
so if we put the vacuum region on top,

102
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:07,150
or if the direction of g is reversed,
this equilibrium becomes stable.

103
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,680
The most common example
of Rayleigh-Taylor instability is

104
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,720
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in fluids.

105
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,040
Here we have a simulation
that shows the development

106
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,410
of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
when we have a heavy liquid —

107
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,150
water, in blue — that sits
on top of a light liquid — oil,

108
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,530
in yellow, subject to gravity.

109
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,030
We have an initial ripple
at the interface surface

110
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,180
and we see that as a function
of time this ripple is amplified.

111
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,860
We can go back
to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability

112
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,860
in plasma and the centrifugal force
due to the magnetic field's curvature

113
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,810
plays the role of gravity.

114
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,710
This force, Fc, is expressed
by this formula.

115
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,250
You see that it depends on Rc.

116
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,060
This is the radius of curvature
of the magnetic field line.

117
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,600
Here we have two drawings.

118
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,950
In the first case, Rc points
away from the plasma.

119
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,410
So it goes from the heavier fluid
to the light fluid.

120
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,770
This leads to instability.

121
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,060
In fact, this is a situation
that we call a situation

122
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,470
where the magnetic field
has a bad curvature.

123
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,020
The magnetic field is concave
towards the plasma.

124
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,730
The opposite situation
is if Rc points towards the plasma,

125
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:40,350
so from the lighter fluid, the vacuum,
to the heavier fluid, the plasma.

126
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,560
In this case, the equilibrium is stable.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,080
This is a region of good curvature.

128
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,090
The magnetic field is convex
towards the plasma.

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Let's look at the role
of the wall surrounding the plasma

130
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,690
on MHD instability.

131
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,340
You can see here a plasma column,
which has a current J,

132
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,120
and a magnetic field B.

133
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,260
There is an instability that develops
and pushes the plasma

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,430
towards the surrounding ideal wall.

135
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,260
The resistivity of the wall, η, is zero.

136
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,850
The magnetic field
cannot penetrate into the wall.

137
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,290
So we ask ourselves:
can the magnetic field penetrate

138
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,040
inside the plasma
and can the magnetic flux

139
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,920
to [inside] the plasma change?

140
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,370
To answer this question,

141
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,140
we have to study one important property
of ideal MHD, which is

142
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,230
the conservation of the magnetic flux.

143
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,700
The magnetic flux Φ is the flux
of the magnetic field B

144
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,320
through the surface S
that encloses the field line.

145
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,790
These are our field lines.

146
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,320
This is the surface S which is delimited

147
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,930
by a contour C.

148
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,830
Let's describe the time derivative
of the magnetic flux: dΦ/dt.

149
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,530
We can put the time derivative
into the surface integral

150
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,480
because the temporal
and spatial coordinates are independent.

151
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,930
So dΦ/dt is the sum of two terms:

152
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,510
the time derivative of the magnetic field,

153
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,810
∂B/∂t • dS, plus B • the time derivative

154
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,960
of dS, the surface element.

155
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,010
We can study these two terms separately.

156
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,110
We can start with the first one
and we can use Faraday's law.

157
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,370
So we have the integral
over the surface S of ∂B/∂t

158
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,000
is minus the integral [over] the surface S
of the curl of E • ds.

159
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,710
We can now use Stokes' theorem
and express the surface integral

160
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,110
in an integral over the contour C,
delimiting the surface.

161
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,540
Now we can work
on to the second term.

162
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,950
So we are looking at
the time derivative

163
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,940
of the surface element dS.

164
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,870
So at time t1, the surface element
is delimited by this contour, C1,

165
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,210
which moves at time t2
to the front contour, C2.

166
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,490
So if you take a point
on the first contour,

167
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,380
we can have the vector,
dl, and the normal,

168
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,150
so the variation
of the surface element, ds,

169
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:43,360
we can simply see that it is
the cross-product of (vdt × dl).

170
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,970
So we can use this expression for [d/dt of ] dS
in the second term of our integral.

171
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,450
So our surface integral, B • d/dt dS,

172
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,390
becomes the integral over the contour C

173
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,110
or B • (v × dl).

174
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,440
We can now put the two terms
together that we have obtained

175
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,560
for the time derivative

176
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,240
of the magnetic flux, dΦ/dt.

177
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,680
So we have two integrals
over the contour, C.

178
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,470
We can rearrange the terms
in the second integral

179
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,160
and combine it with the first.

180
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,450
What we have here
is that dΦ/dt is minus the integral

181
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,540
over the contour C of
(E + v × B) • dl.

182
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,520
This is the Ohm's and we know

183
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,300
that the (E + v × B)
in ideal MHD is equal to zero.

184
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,430
And so this integral is equal to zero,

185
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,040
which tells us that dΦ/dt
is equal to zero.

186
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,850
As dΦ/dt is equal to zero
in the ideal MHD,

187
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,600
the magnetic flux through every surface
moving with the plasma is constant.

188
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,460
The magnetic flux is therefore frozen
into the plasma in the absence

189
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,780
of plasma resistivity.

190
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,890
We can now go back
to the effect of the wall

191
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,800
on MHD instabilities.

192
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,270
The magnetic field, when the plasma

193
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,050
is pushed towards the wall,
cannot penetrate into the wall,

194
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,000
so the magnetic field
is compressed in the vacuum region

195
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,320
between the plasma and the wall.

196
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,600
The magnetic pressure is increased,
and that pushes the plasma

197
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,890
back towards the center of the device.

198
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,290
This tells us that plasmas
can be stabilized

199
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,840
by a surrounding wall.

200
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,080
However, this effect is limited
by the finite resistivity

201
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,930
of the plasma and of the wall,
and so this effect only lasts

202
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,960
over a finite time scale.

203
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,110
Let's look at some general methods

204
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,850
for general analysis of MHD stability.

205
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,130
For uniform plasmas,
we can perform a Fourier analysis

206
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,600
in space and time.

207
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,610
This corresponds
to a normal mode analysis.

208
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,930
So we assume perturbation in the form

209
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:34,620
of an exponential (ik • x - iωt)

210
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,450
and then we look at the imaginary part
of ω, the wave frequency.

211
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,700
If the imaginary part of ω
is positive, we are in a situation

212
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,260
where the perturbation grows,
so we are in a situation

213
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,920
where an instability develops.

214
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,480
For non-uniform plasmas,
we can cast the MHD equations

215
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,870
into a force balance equation.

216
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,270
We have the mass density
of the fluid element ρM

217
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,650
times d²ξ / dt² .

218
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,850
ξ is a fluid displacement,

219
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,560
and this is equal to a force operator
F(ξ), that represents

220
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,910
the force acting on the fluid element
whose mass density is ρM,

221
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,510
producing a displacement ξ.

222
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,210
We can then perform
a Fourier analysis only in time.

223
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,610
This tells us that -ρMω² ξ

224
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,490
is equal to F — this is
an Eigenvalue equation;

225
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,010
the sign of ω² determines
the stability or instability.

226
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,290
We can also perform
an energy principle analysis.

227
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,380
We can evaluate the equivalent
of the work δW which is

228
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,750
-1/2 the integral

229
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,840
over the plasma volume V of F • ξ.

230
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,690
This corresponds to the change
in the potential energy of the system.

231
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,670
The sign of δW, corresponds
to stability or instability.

232
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,400
We've seen that the plasma
in an MHD equlibrium

233
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,920
and in general can be subject
to many instabilities.

234
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,530
How can we control this instability?

235
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,490
We have two methods.

236
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,120
The first method is
a passive control system.

237
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,770
We use intrinsic
stabilization mechanisms

238
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,340
as we have seen in the case of a wall
surrounding the plasma.

239
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,090
The second method
is an active control system.

240
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,470
We detect the onset
of an instability and apply

241
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:41,100
feedback control schemes in real-time
that act on plasma parameters

242
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,030
and with this feedback control scheme
we can try to stabilize the instability

243
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,020
or limit its development.

244
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,550
Let's summarize
what we've discussed in this lecture.

245
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,800
We've qualitatively
discussed some examples

246
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,830
of instability: the sausage,
the kink, and the Rayleigh-Taylor.

247
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,280
We've see that the wall
surrounding the plasma

248
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,650
can be stabilizing
because of the frozen-in condition

249
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,820
of the magnetic field,
which is valid in ideal MHD.

250
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,180
Then we've seen that the linear stability
of an MHD equilibrum can be studied

251
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,400
using Fourier analysis techniques
or energy considerations.
