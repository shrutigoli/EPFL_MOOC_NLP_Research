00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:09,015
Welcome — welcome 
to the plasma physics course of EPFL.

2
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:12,472
Today we are going to talk
about the single-fluid description

3
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:14,956
of a plasma and the MHD model.

4
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,521
In the past lecture, we have seen
that it's possible to describe

5
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:21,494
the plasma dynamics
with a two-fluid model,

6
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:26,220
basically describing electrons
and ions as two different fluids.

7
00:00:26,222 --> 00:00:29,208
Today we will provide
an even simpler description,

8
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:34,089
one that is able to describe
the plasma dynamics as the evolution

9
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:35,959
of one single fluid.

10
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:40,335
As the first thing with you,
I will briefly recall

11
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:42,698
the main elements of the two-fluid model.

12
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:46,249
Then I will introduce 
the variables that are considered

13
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:49,516
by a one-fluid model and I
will describe this model,

14
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:54,866
and finally I will describe
the typical assumptions that are made

15
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:59,154
in the single-fluid description 
of a plasma to come up

16
00:00:59,154 --> 00:01:02,850
with a magnetohydrodynamic —
MHD — model, that is one

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,111
of the most commonly used models
in plasma physics.

18
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:13,572
So let's briefly recall the main elements
of the two-fluid model.

19
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:19,300
Within the two-fluid model,
the dynamics of each fluid

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,385
is given by a continuity equation —

21
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:32,181
that is, the time derivative
of the particle density

22
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:34,764
is due to the particle flux;

23
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,761
a momentum equation,

24
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:45,289
which states that the time derivative
of the plasma velocity

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,709
is due to the forces that are acting
on this fluid element.

26
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,982
That is the electric force,
magnetic force,

27
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:08,014
pressure forces and friction force.

28
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:13,878
With d/dt we have made
the convective time derivative

29
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:22,558
and the friction forces
are given by the integral

30
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,190
of the collisions terms
of Vlasov into the Boltzmann equation.

31
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,527
The pressure term is given
by a closure equation

32
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,657
that I'm now going to write here.

33
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:49,478
The system has to be coupled
to Maxwell's equations

34
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:56,231
that state that ∇⋅E

35
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:59,797
is equal to ρ/ε0

36
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:03,408
∇⋅B = 0,

37
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:10,189
∇ × E = -∂B/∂t,

38
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:14,552
and ∇ × B (the curl of B) is given by the current

39
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,772
and time derivative of the electric field.

40
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:26,842
The charge density and the current density
are related to the two fluid quantitites

41
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:32,653
by the fact that ρ is given 
by the sum over all species

42
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,793
of the charge of each species
times ns, the density.

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,831
The current density is given
by the sum, over all species,

44
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:49,264
of qs, ns and us.

45
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:56,013
This the two-fluid model
that describes the dynamics

46
00:03:56,013 --> 00:04:01,032
of a plasma, taking into account
the dynamics of electrons and ions

47
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,402
as two different fluids.

48
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:08,970
Starting from the quantities
such as ns, us,

49
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,821
quantities that are relative
to each species,

50
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:14,855
we can actually deduce
the one-fluid quantites

51
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:18,090
that are evolved by the one-fluid model.

52
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:22,967
The first quantity of interest
for the one-fluid description

53
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:25,118
of a plasma is the mass density.

54
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:29,866
We will denote it as ρM.

55
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:35,685
It's a function of space and time
and will be given by the sum

56
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:39,103
over all species of the density

57
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:42,993
of each species times the mass.

58
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:47,375
For example, there is 
one single ion species in our model.

59
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,978
This will be given by the sum
of the electron contribution

60
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:54,386
plus the ion contribution.

61
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:59,540
Another quantity of interest
is the center of mass velocity.

62
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,810
We will denote it with a capital V

63
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:10,059
and it's still a function 
of space and time.

64
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:15,286
It will be given by the ratio
between the velocity

65
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:21,335
of all particle species weighted
according to their density and their mass,

66
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,353
normalized to ρM —

67
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,528
that is, ns ms.

68
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:31,486
The sum is over all species.

69
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:37,559
This, for example, for a plasma
with a single ion species

70
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,803
will be given by the sum

71
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:43,899
of the electron contribution

72
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,971
and the ion contribution
divided by the total mass.

73
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,799
Then there are the quantities
related to the total electric charge

74
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,323
and total electric current.

75
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:04,181
We have somehow already introduced 
those in the previous slide.

76
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:11,296
That will still be called ρ,
that is the sum over all species

77
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:15,603
of ns qs and for a case

78
00:06:15,603 --> 00:06:20,157
of one single ion species
that is ionized only once,

79
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:25,433
this will be given by e(ni-ne).

80
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:31,815
For the current we will have, similarly,
the sum over all species

81
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:34,044
of the current carried by each species.

82
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:40,349
The last quantity that we want 
to introduce is the pressure in the center

83
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,929
of the mass frame.

84
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,913
We first define the pressure
in the center of the mass frame

85
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:51,171
for each species.

86
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:54,894
That is a tensor

87
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:13,149
and differs from the standard definition
of the pressure because the u(s)

88
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:17,292
has been replaced by V,
the center of mass velocity.

89
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:24,688
Starting from the center 
of mass pressure of each species,

90
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:28,474
we can get the total,
the one-fluid variable.

91
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,189
It's total pressure in the center of mass
that is given by the sum,

92
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:37,748
over all species, of Ps^cm.

93
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:44,286
In the case of one single ion species
that will be given by the electron

94
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:46,954
and ion contribution.

95
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:55,541
We now have all the elements
to deduce the one-fluid model of a plasma.

96
00:07:56,878 --> 00:07:59,907
Let me just point out
that in this derivation

97
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:03,627
we will stop at the level
of the momentum equation.

98
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:08,008
For the energy equation,
we will use a simple closure.

99
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:14,533
Let's see how we can deduce
the one-fluid model

100
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,625
that describes the plasma dynamics.

101
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:20,976
To do that we can start
from the continuity equation

102
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:22,911
for the electrons and for the ions.

103
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,212
We can now multiply
the electron continuity equation

104
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:40,440
by me

105
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:44,234
and the ion continuity equation by mi,

106
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:48,029
sum up these two equations,

107
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:52,585
and if we do the calculation,

108
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:54,514
what we obtain is an equation

109
00:08:58,449 --> 00:08:59,876
for the mass density

110
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:04,008
where V is the center of mass velocity.

111
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:09,638
Similarly we can multiply
the electron continuity equation

112
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:14,165
by -e, the electron charge,

113
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:18,004
and the ion continuity equation by e,

114
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:20,942
the charge of the ion species.

115
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,907
Sum them up and what we obtain

116
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:28,306
is an equation for the charge density.

117
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:36,496
We can use a similar approach
to deduce the equation that evolves

118
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:41,616
the plasma center
of mass velocity and the current.

119
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:44,115
The starting points in this case are

120
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:47,476
the electron and ion momentum equations.

121
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:15,543
We can sum up these two equations

122
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,327
and what we obtain is an equation

123
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,674
for the center of mass velocity

124
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,458
that takes into account
the electric force,

125
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,939
the magnetic force

126
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:40,449
and the contribution of the pressure term

127
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:44,769
that is actually written
in terms of the center of mass pressure.

128
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,454
In order to obtain an equation
for the plasma current,

129
00:10:49,454 --> 00:10:54,565
we should multiply
the electron momentum equation

130
00:10:54,565 --> 00:11:01,503
by -1/(e ne)

131
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,336
and the ion momentum equation

132
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:10,046
by 1/e me/(mi ni)

133
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:11,786
and sum them up.

134
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:17,173
Within the hypothesis
that our plasma is quasi-neutral

135
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,839
and we will call that,
the electron and ion density,

136
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,770
which are very close to n.

137
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,936
And also in the hypothesis that me,
the electron mass,

138
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:35,386
is much smaller than the ion mass,

139
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:39,604
and that the current is much smaller

140
00:11:39,604 --> 00:11:42,194
than the current carried out
by each species,

141
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:47,382
we will have an equation
for the electron currents that states

142
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:58,330
that this convective time derivative 
of the electron current

143
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,423
is due to the electric field,
and the (V × B) term,

144
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:05,701
which represent 
basically the contribution

145
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:09,437
of the electromagnetic forces,
a term that is related

146
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:14,761
to the pressure tensor,
and a resistivity term.

147
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,149
We can now summarize
the equations for the one-fluid model.

148
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:24,463
It will be built up
by a mass continuity equation,

149
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,522
a charge continuity equation,

150
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:44,958
a momentum equation,

151
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:52,420
and an equation that states
how the current density evolves.

152
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:54,921
We can call it Ohm's law.

153
00:12:57,286 --> 00:13:00,597
This has to be associated
with a closure equation.

154
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,034
For example, if there are 
sufficient collisions,

155
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,756
then we can assume
that the pressure tensor

156
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:16,306
is actually scalar
and therefore ∂/∂r

157
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,746
[dot] divergence of the pressure tensor

158
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:26,506
becomes the gradient 
of a scalar that we will call P

159
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:32,910
and P will be given
by a state of equation law

160
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:40,059
where γ can be equal to one,
for example, and in this case

161
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:43,089
we have isothermal plasma dynamics,

162
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:50,485
or it can be equal to cp/cv
for an adiabatic motion,

163
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:59,199
or γ can be equal to infinity
in the case of an incompressible flow.

164
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:03,454
The system is then completed
by Maxwell's equations

165
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:11,961
that as usual read as divergence
of E is equal to ρ (divided by ε0),

166
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:15,161
divergence of B = 0,

167
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:19,745
∇×E (curl of E) is equal to -∂B/∂t

168
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:26,353
and ∇×B (curl of B) is equal
to the contribution of the current.

169
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:35,486
What we have just written here
is a closed system of equations

170
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:39,771
that describes the dynamics
of a plasma as the evolution

171
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:41,358
of one single fluid.

172
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:46,232
Even if the model
that we have just described

173
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:51,160
represents a substantial simplification
with respect to the kinetic model

174
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,562
and the two-fluid model,
sometimes it's too complicated

175
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:58,216
and it's not possible to treat it
analytically, numerically.

176
00:14:58,216 --> 00:15:00,833
Therefore some assumptions are done (made)

177
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,527
in order to make 
the problem more tractable.

178
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:07,843
Let's see together —
what are the typical assumptions

179
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:09,188
that are done?

180
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:15,962
There are actually four assumptions
that are done [made].

181
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:27,310
The first assumption 
that is typically made is

182
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,017
the one of negligible electron inertia.

183
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,940
This means in practice to take
the limit of the electron mass

184
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,204
that goes to zero.

185
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:44,299
In other words, what one does is
neglecting this term here.

186
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:51,858
The second assumption is to assume
that the plasma is quasi-neutral,

187
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:58,230
which means to consider phenomena
that occur on scale length

188
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,982
that are much larger than
the Debye length,

189
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:10,594
phenomena that have typical frequencies
much smaller than the plasma frequency

190
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:19,042
and that have a frequency much smaller
than the ion cyclotron frequency.

191
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:25,362
Under this assumption, one can impose
that the charge density

192
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:30,032
with respect to the density
of the electrons

193
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:34,502
is equal to the ratio of the difference

194
00:16:34,502 --> 00:16:37,717
between the electron and the ion density

195
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:40,512
divided by the electron density

196
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:43,883
has to be much smaller than one.

197
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,311
In practice, what this means is
that we can neglect the ρE term

198
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,216
in the momentum equation,

199
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,666
the ∂ρ/∂t term
in the charge continuity equation,

200
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:05,537
and also the Gauss's law becomes

201
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:08,157
an equation that we can not use anymore

202
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:10,514
to evaluate the electric field.

203
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:17,707
The third hypothesis that is done
is to neglect electromagnetic waves —

204
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:22,195
that is, to assume 
that the displacement current

205
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:27,742
is much smaller than the plasma current.

206
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,990
This means in practice
that we can neglect

207
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:37,152
in the Maxwell's equation,
the displacement current.

208
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:42,328
If you look here, what we will have
is that the divergence of j

209
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:45,103
will be equal to zero all the time,

210
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:49,918
as the divergence of the curl of B
is equal to zero all the time.

211
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:55,322
Therefore, this means 
that the divergence of j

212
00:17:56,348 --> 00:18:02,470
is equal to zero, which in practice 
tells us that also this term

213
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,280
in the charge continuity equation
can be neglected.

214
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,985
The last hypothesis we'll do
is to assume that the phenomena

215
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:15,703
that we consider occur
on scale lengths that are

216
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:18,184
much larger than the Larmor radius.

217
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:25,438
This, in other terms, means that
the (V × B) term is much larger

218
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:28,501
than the term due to the pressure.

219
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:36,432
Therefore, in Ohm's law
we can neglect the pressure term.

220
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,906
What you have just obtained is 
the so-called magnetohydrodynamics model,

221
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:45,773
MHD for short.

222
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:51,170
It is one of the most widely used models
to describe the dynamics of a plasma.

223
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,080
You will use it 
throughout the rest of the course.

224
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,047
So, it's important that we write together

225
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:02,259
all the equations 
that constitute the MHD model.

226
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:05,518
The first equation is 
the continuity equation

227
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:07,008
for the mass density.

228
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:16,742
The mass density varies in time

229
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:19,385
according to the particle flux.

230
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:23,906
The second equation is 
the momentum equation,

231
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:38,349
which states that the center
of mass velocity changes

232
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:43,226
because of the (j × B) force
and also the gradient of the pressure.

233
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:51,163
Then we have Ohm's law,
that with the simplification we have done

234
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:55,758
got reduced to E + V × B

235
00:19:55,758 --> 00:19:58,264
is equal to the resistive term.

236
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,899
Then there is a closure equation,

237
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:10,392
which in the simplest form
can be written as d/dt

238
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:13,721
of the pressure

239
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:18,191
times the mass density

240
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:23,444
to the power of -γ,
where γ is the index of the polytropic,

241
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:24,759
equal to zero.

242
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,841
All this has to be coupled
to Maxwell's equations,

243
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,529
that in the simplified form
we are looking at

244
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:35,588
can be reduced

245
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:41,143
to curl of E = -∂B/∂t,

246
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,347
curl of B = μ0 j,

247
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,968
we have neglected the displacement current

248
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:55,862
and divergence of B is equal to zero,
which as Maxwell's equation always [says],

249
00:20:55,862 --> 00:20:59,594
is to be considered
an initial condition of our problem.

250
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:07,854
So how many equations
and how many unknowns do we have?

251
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:09,865
Let's try to summarize this.

252
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:17,376
The unknowns are ρM, V,

253
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:22,762
j, B,

254
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,810
pressure, and the electric field —

255
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:32,284
then, if we count, 14 unknowns —

256
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:41,118
1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 +3 —

257
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:44,329
14 unknowns, and how many equations?

258
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:49,869
We have 1+ 3 + 3

259
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:55,798
+ 1 +3 + 3 — 14 equations.

260
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:02,025
What we have obtained here
is actually a self-consistent model

261
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:05,020
that is able to describe
the plasma dynamics.

262
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:10,913
Let me point out that if the plasma
is sufficiently hot,

263
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:15,428
the resistivity can be very small
and can be neglected.

264
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:20,032
In this case we will talk
about [an] ideal MHD model.

265
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:24,437
Otherwise we will talk
about [a] resistive MHD model.

266
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:32,280
The MHD model is
particularly suited to describe

267
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,240
the global dynamics of a plasma.

268
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,480
For example, it's widely used
to describe the dynamics

269
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,717
of a plasma in devices
that are used to confine plasma

270
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:43,956
for fusion purposes.

271
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,061
Here is the result of one MHD simulation

272
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:52,694
that has been run by our group
here in Lausanne

273
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:57,200
to study the equilibrium magnetic field
in the W7-X experiment.

274
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,399
This machine in Germany is one

275
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:03,870
of the largest experiments 
on Earth and uses

276
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,765
a complex three-dimensional configuration

277
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:10,125
to confine plasma for fusion purposes.

278
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:14,881
Here we've gotten
to the end of this lecture.

279
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:19,581
What we have done today
was to derive one single-fluid model

280
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:21,478
to describe the plasma dynamics.

281
00:23:21,478 --> 00:23:26,489
More particularly, what we have done
was to introduce the one-fluid variables

282
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,169
in the equation that evolves them.

283
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:32,509
Then we have seen that by making
a number of assumptions,

284
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:35,828
particularly by neglecting
electromagnetic waves,

285
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:40,952
Larmor radius effects, electron inertia
and assuming quasi-neutrality,

286
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:45,334
a model, the so-called MHD —
magnetohydrodynamics model —

287
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:49,820
can be deduced, and this is one
of the most fundamental models

288
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,722
used in plasma physics.
