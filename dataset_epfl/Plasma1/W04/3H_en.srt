00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:10,446
Welcome to the course on plasma physics
and application to fusion energy

2
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:12,461
astrophysics and industry.

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,947
My name is Duccio Testa,
and in this lecture

4
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:20,616
we will be discussing plasma waves
in the ideal MHD model.

5
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:26,213
We will start with the general formulation
for the ideal MHD waves

6
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:30,020
and then, we will study
the three classes of waves

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,861
that are supported
by the ideal MHD description

8
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:36,815
of the plasma: the shear Alfvén waves,

9
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:42,643
the fast compressional Alfvén waves,
and the slow magneto-sonic waves.

10
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:47,782
To obtain the general formulation
of ideal MHD waves,

11
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:50,042
we start from the ideal MHD equations.

12
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:55,211
Then we add a small perturbation
to a uniform and static equilibrium,

13
00:00:56,377 --> 00:01:00,723
we linearize the original system
of equations around the equilibrium,

14
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,500
we apply Fourier transform,

15
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,731
and then we obtain
the wave dispersion relation.

16
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,339
We start from the ideal MHD equations

17
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:14,879
and we use them to eliminate j and E.

18
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:22,303
We have here Ampère's law
and the momentum balance equation.

19
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:28,562
We can take j 
from Ampère's law and plug it

20
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:30,802
into the momentum balance equation.

21
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:36,250
With this procedure, we eliminate j.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,103
So what we obtain
is that ρM(dV/dt) is equal

23
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:51,459
to -∇p +1/μ0

24
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,883
[times] the curl of B × B.

25
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:59,498
We have then Faraday's law
and the ideal Ohm's law.

26
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:02,937
We can take the electric field
from the ideal Ohm's law

27
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:05,269
and put it into Faraday's law.

28
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:13,849
So what we have: ∂B/∂t

29
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:17,544
equals the curl of (V × B).

30
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:21,625
We then have the continuity
of the plasma mass

31
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,764
and the equation of state.

32
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:28,560
We can then consider
a uniform and static MHD equilibrium,

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,288
to which we add a small perturbation.

34
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:36,044
The magnetic field,
with an equilibrium term B0,

35
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:37,884
plus its perturbation B1,

36
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:42,961
for the fluid velocity V,
since we consider a static equilibrium,

37
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:45,012
the equilibrium term is zero.

38
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:47,096
We only have the perturbation: V1.

39
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:51,860
For the mass density,
the equilibrium term is a constant,

40
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,807
perturbation ρM1,
and the same for the pressure.

41
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,543
p0 is a constant.

42
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,205
We can then linearize
the initial system of equations

43
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:03,259
around the equilibrium.

44
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:07,771
What we obtain is that ∂B1/∂t

45
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:12,721
is equal to the curl of (V1 × B0).

46
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:16,200
Perturbation, perturbation first order.

47
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:20,205
We do the same
for the continuity equation:

48
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:24,359
∂ρM1/∂t + ρM0

49
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,399
[times] the divergence of V1 = 0.

50
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:30,741
The momentum balance equation:

51
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:34,323
ρM0 dV1/dt

52
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:38,826
= -∇p1 + 1/μ0

53
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:42,263
[times] (∇ × B1) × B0.

54
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:45,821
Then we have the perturbed pressure:

55
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:52,365
p1 = γ (p0/ρM0) ρM1 —

56
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,536
The perturbed mass density.

57
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,081
This factor appears in the last equation:

58
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:01,698
γ (p0/ρM0)

59
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:05,462
is the sound speed, cs² —

60
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:09,462
sound speed, cs = (γ p0/ρM0)^(1/2).

61
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:16,435
So the perturbed pressure, p1,
equals the sound speed squared, cs²

62
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:19,675
times the perturbed mass density ρM1.

63
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:25,453
Now we can apply Fourier transform
in space and time to linearized equations.

64
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:31,172
Our first equations become -ωB̃1

65
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:33,679
— the tilde indicates that we are 
now in Fourier space —

66
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:38,150
k × (Ṽ1 × B0).

67
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,870
For the mass density
we have -ω ρ̃M1

68
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:50,802
+ ρM0 (k • Ṽ1) = 0.

69
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:58,121
We have then,
for the momentum balance equation,

70
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:06,037
= -k cs² ρ̃M1

71
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,996
-ω ρM0 Ṽ1

72
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:10,977
+ (1/μ0) (k × B̃1) × B0.

73
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:14,750
Finally, for the perturbed pressure:

74
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:19,989
p̃1 = cs² ρ̃M1.

75
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:25,245
We can now chose
our geometry for the waves.

76
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,455
Without loss of generality, we can take
the equilibrium magnetic field

77
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,276
to be along the z-axis

78
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:38,486
and take the k vector
in the xz-plane.

79
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,754
We now have two cases.

80
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:44,042
The first case is the case
of transverse waves,

81
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:48,218
where V1 is perpendicular to k.

82
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:50,715
This case is depicted here.

83
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:56,191
It is here, the equilibrium
magnetic field B0 along the z-axis,

84
00:05:56,871 --> 00:06:00,413
the vector k in the xz-plane,

85
00:06:00,883 --> 00:06:04,843
and there is an angle, θ,
between k and B0.

86
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:09,700
The perturbed velocity: V1
in the y direction

87
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,197
perpendicular to k.

88
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,771
The second case is waves
with a longitudinal component

89
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:21,180
where V1 is also in the xz-plane,

90
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,404
which is depicted
in this second figure here.

91
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:28,160
Let's look at transverse waves.

92
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:33,281
V1 [is] only along the y direction,

93
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:36,561
and therefore V1 is perpendicular to k,

94
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:40,344
because k is in the xz-plane.

95
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:44,338
We can now start 
with the equation in Fourier space

96
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,527
for the perturbed mass density.

97
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:55,975
Perturbed mass density: ρ̃M1

98
00:06:55,984 --> 00:07:00,727
= 1/ω ρM0 k • Ṽ1.

99
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:04,159
But k and V are 
perpendicular to each other.

100
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:08,733
Therefore, k and Ṽ are also
perpendicular to each other.

101
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:12,029
So ρ̃M1 = 0.

102
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,144
There is no perturbed mass density.

103
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:18,588
Transverse waves
are non-compressional.

104
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:21,503
We then have two remaining equations

105
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:25,553
that link B̃1y and Ṽ1y.

106
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:40,020
So we end up with these two equations:

107
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,399
ω ρM0 Ṽ1y + kz B0/μ0

108
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,765
[times] B̃1y 
and the second equation:

109
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,173
kz B0 Ṽ1y

110
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:59,241
+ ω B̃1y = 0.

111
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:02,770
We can then combine
these two linearized equations

112
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,310
into a matricial form.

113
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,398
Now we want to obtain
a nontrivial solution

114
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:19,718
which has B̃1y and Ṽ1y,

115
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:21,855
both not equal to zero.

116
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:25,191
We obtain this solution 
by taking the determinant

117
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:27,856
of this two-by-two matrix
to be equal to zero.

118
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:34,624
This leads to the dispersion relation
for the shear Alfvén wave.

119
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:42,009
In this dispersion relation,
there is a term that is very important.

120
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:49,316
This quantity here, B0²/(μ0 ρM0),

121
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:52,830
this is the square 
of the Alfvén speed, cA.

122
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:56,648
We can then cast
this dispersion relation

123
00:08:56,648 --> 00:09:02,470
in a way that we see the Alfvén speed
and the angle between k

124
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,114
and the equilibrium magnetic field.

125
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:08,092
This is the final form
for the dispersion relation

126
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:10,270
of the shear Alfvén wave:

127
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:15,113
ω² = k² cA² cos²θ.

128
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,783
We can now summarize what we 
have found for the shear Alfvén wave.

129
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:23,633
The shear Alfvén waves
are transverse waves.

130
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:27,262
The perturbed velocity V1
is perpendicular to k

131
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,947
and to the equilibrium 
magnetic field, B0.

132
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:33,009
The shear Alfvén wave is noncompressional.

133
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:37,279
The perturbed mass density, ρM1 = 0.

134
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:41,299
The dispersion relation
can be cast in a form:

135
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:45,820
ω² = (k cA)² cos²θ.

136
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:49,997
To give you a bit of a heads-up
of topics that we will discuss

137
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:52,702
later in this course, 
the shear Alfvén wave

138
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:56,690
is important in DT fusion plasma
because the velocity

139
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:02,474
of fusion-born α particles
whose energy at birth is 3.5MeV

140
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:06,348
is super-Alfvénic: 
exceeds the Alfvén speed cA.

141
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,855
Therefore, α's become resonant
with shear Alfvén waves

142
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:12,522
during their slowing down.

143
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:18,892
Shear Alfvén waves are ubiquitous 
in plasma, and in fact they were observed

144
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:22,307
first in space and then in mercury plasmas.

145
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:28,214
Let's look at ideal MHD waves
with a longitudinal component.

146
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:33,346
V1 now has an x and z component,

147
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:37,954
so k • V1 ≠ 0.

148
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:41,927
We can repeat
all the previous calculations

149
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:45,500
to obtain an expression
for the perturbed magnetic field:

150
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,451
B1 = (V1x B0/ω)

151
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:52,157
k × ey.

152
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:58,154
We can continue the analysis,
and we obtain a dispersion relation

153
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:01,465
for the ideal MHD waves
with a longitudinal component.

154
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:08,951
ω⁴ - ω² k² (cA² + cs²) + k² kz² cA² cs² = 0

155
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:13,269
This is our dispersion relation
for ideal MHD waves

156
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:15,298
with a longitudinal component.

157
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:17,253
We see that [we have] a term,

158
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:23,124
that depends on the Alfvén speed cA
and on the sound speed cs

159
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:27,671
and it's in fact
a quadratic relation for ω².

160
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,716
We can solve this equation rather easily.

161
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,414
So we immediately see
that there are two roots

162
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:48,244
of this dispersion relation for ω².

163
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:51,905
We have a root with the plus
and a root with the minus.

164
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:56,942
We can simplify this dispersion relation
because the ratio

165
00:11:56,942 --> 00:12:02,407
between the sound speed cs
and the Alfvén speed cA, squared,

166
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:07,247
is usually much smaller than one
in typical plasma conditions.

167
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:12,116
So we can take only terms
that are first-order

168
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:15,738
in the ratio between cs² and cA².

169
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:30,697
So we end up with this formulation
for the dispersion relation, ω²,

170
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,678
1/2 k² cA²

171
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:37,158
(1 +cs²/cA²),

172
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:39,402
so a first [order] correction in cs,

173
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:44,985
1 ± the two roots for ω²,

174
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:50,432
(1 - (2kz² cs²)/(k² cA²)).

175
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,943
We can now consider the plus root
of the dispersion relation.

176
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:09,243
We can now proceed
with this calculation

177
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:12,903
by summing 1 and the brackets.

178
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,643
We can now take the product
between the two brackets

179
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:26,903
and keep only the terms that are 
linear in the ratio (cs/cA)².

180
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,675
Now we know kz = k cos θ,

181
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:42,369
we can then recast this last term.

182
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:51,424
So this is the final dispersion relation

183
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:54,804
for the plus root of the dispersion relation

184
00:13:54,804 --> 00:13:58,744
of [the] ideal MHD wave
with a longitudinal component.

185
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:03,828
We call this wave 
the fast compressional Alfvén wave.

186
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:05,655
We've seen that it's compressional —

187
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:10,953
k • V(1) ≠ 0 — and it is the fast solution

188
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:14,127
because the phase velocity is cA —

189
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:18,984
the Alfvén speed, that is much larger
than cs, the sound speed.

190
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:23,015
We see the dispersion relation is simply

191
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:28,214
ω₊² = k² cA² 
and that the sound speed

192
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:32,445
and the angle between the k vector
and the equilibrium magnetic field

193
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:34,987
only enters as a small correction.

194
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:40,280
We have worked
through the fast wave solution,

195
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,860
the plus solution.

196
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,301
Now we can take the minus solution.

197
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,985
This will lead us to the slow wave.

198
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,779
We've taken the minus solution here.

199
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,738
We can now work through the algebra.

200
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:09,705
The 1 - 1 term cancels out,
so we only remain

201
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:12,381
with 2 kz² cs²

202
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:14,503
/(k² cA²).

203
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:17,689
(k² cA²) and (k² cA²)
simplifies out.

204
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,474
So what we end up with:

205
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:28,598
ω₋² = kz² cs²

206
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:32,649
and this is why we call 
this wave the slow wave,

207
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,233
because the phase velocity is cs.

208
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,403
That is much smaller than cA.

209
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,746
The wave frequency depends
on the sound speed

210
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:45,105
and the angle between the k vector
and the equilibrium magnetic field.

211
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:48,783
So we call this 
the slow magnetosonic wave —

212
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:52,501
a sound wave that exists
in the presence of a magnetic field.

213
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:57,183
A very useful way to represent the solution
of the wave dispersion relation

214
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,145
for ideal MHD is the surface described

215
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:05,198
by the phase velocity vector ω k /k².

216
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:09,728
We have here on the left
the case for the shear Alfvén wave,

217
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:14,200
which is noncompressional,
the dispersion relation, ω²

218
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,991
= (k cA)² cos² θ.

219
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:23,440
So if we draw this curve, 
what we see is that we obtain

220
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,172
an eight along the axis
of the magnetic field

221
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:32,457
and the effective radius 
of this eight is cA cos θ .

222
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:37,814
In the second case, we have
the dispersion relation for waves

223
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:39,982
which have a longitudinal component.

224
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:43,884
We have an inner figure
that is again another eight.

225
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:46,835
This corresponds 
to the slow magnetosonic wave

226
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:48,596
for which the dispersion relation

227
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:52,359
is ω² = (k cs)² cos² θ.

228
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:55,190
The radius is (cs cosθ),

229
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:58,459
so it's much smaller than (cA cosθ).

230
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:02,617
The outer circle corresponds

231
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:06,792
to the fast compressional Alfvén waves,
for which the dispersion relation

232
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,119
is ω² = k² cA²

233
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,311
when we neglect all correction
due to the sound speed.

234
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:16,541
This is a circle whose radius is cA.

235
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,637
We can now summarize
what we have discussed

236
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:22,210
on ideal MHD waves.

237
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:26,566
The first wave that we discussed
[is the] transverse wave.

238
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:29,964
This is a noncompressional wave,
the shear Alfvén wave.

239
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:34,879
This wave will be discussed
in the concept of burning plasmas.

240
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:41,602
Then we have discussed compressional waves
which have a longitudinal component,

241
00:17:42,482 --> 00:17:44,143
and we found two solutions:

242
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:49,169
the fast compressional Alfvén wave
and the slow magnetosonic wave.
