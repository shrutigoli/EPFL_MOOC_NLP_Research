00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,630
My name is Duccio Testa,
and in this lecture

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,300
we will be discussing plasma waves
in the ideal MHD model.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,900
We will start with the general formulation
for the ideal MHD waves

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,710
and then, we will study
the three classes of waves

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,550
that are supported
by the ideal MHD description

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,500
of the plasma: the shear Alfvén waves,

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,330
the fast compressional Alfvén waves,
and the slow magneto-sonic waves.

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,470
To obtain the general formulation
of ideal MHD waves,

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,730
we start from the ideal MHD equations.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,900
Then we add a small perturbation
to a uniform and static equilibrium,

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,410
we linearize the original system
of equations around the equilibrium,

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,190
we apply Fourier transform,

13
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,420
and then we obtain
the wave dispersion relation.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,020
We start from the ideal MHD equations

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,560
and we use them to eliminate j and E.

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,990
We have here Ampère's law
and the momentum balance equation.

17
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,250
We can take j
from Ampère's law and plug it

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,490
into the momentum balance equation.

19
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,940
With this procedure, we eliminate j.

20
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,790
So what we obtain
is that ρM(dV/dt) is equal

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,140
to -∇p +1/μ0

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,570
[times] the curl of B × B.

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,180
We have then Faraday's law
and the ideal Ohm's law.

24
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,620
We can take the electric field
from the ideal Ohm's law

25
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,950
and put it into Faraday's law.

26
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,530
So what we have: ∂B/∂t

27
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,230
equals the curl of (V × B).

28
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,310
We then have the continuity
of the plasma mass

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,450
and the equation of state.

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,250
We can then consider
a uniform and static MHD equilibrium,

31
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,970
to which we add a small perturbation.

32
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,730
The magnetic field,
with an equilibrium term B0,

33
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,570
plus its perturbation B1,

34
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,650
for the fluid velocity V,
since we consider a static equilibrium,

35
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,700
the equilibrium term is zero.

36
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,780
We only have the perturbation: V1.

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,550
For the mass density,
the equilibrium term is a constant,

38
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,490
perturbation ρM1,
and the same for the pressure.

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,230
p0 is a constant.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,890
We can then linearize
the initial system of equations

41
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,940
around the equilibrium.

42
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,460
What we obtain is that ∂B1/∂t

43
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,410
is equal to the curl of (V1 × B0).

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,890
Perturbation, perturbation first order.

45
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,890
We do the same
for the continuity equation:

46
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,040
∂ρM1/∂t + ρM0

47
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,080
[times] the divergence of V1 = 0.

48
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,430
The momentum balance equation:

49
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,010
ρM0 dV1/dt

50
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,510
= -∇p1 + 1/μ0

51
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,950
[times] (∇ × B1) × B0.

52
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,510
Then we have the perturbed pressure:

53
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:44,050
p1 = γ (p0/ρM0) ρM1 —

54
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,220
The perturbed mass density.

55
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,770
This factor appears in the last equation:

56
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,380
γ (p0/ρM0)

57
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,150
is the sound speed, cs² —

58
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,150
sound speed, cs = (γ p0/ρM0)^(1/2).

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,120
So the perturbed pressure, p1,
equals the sound speed squared, cs²

60
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,360
times the perturbed mass density ρM1.

61
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,140
Now we can apply Fourier transform
in space and time to linearized equations.

62
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,860
Our first equations become -ωB̃1

63
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,360
— the tilde indicates that we are
now in Fourier space —

64
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,840
k × (Ṽ1 × B0).

65
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,560
For the mass density
we have -ω ρ̃M1

66
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,490
+ ρM0 (k • Ṽ1) = 0.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,810
We have then,
for the momentum balance equation,

68
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,680
-ω ρM0 Ṽ1

69
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,720
= -k cs² ρ̃M1

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,660
+ (1/μ0) (k × B̃1) × B0.

71
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,440
Finally, for the perturbed pressure:

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,670
p̃1 = cs² ρ̃M1.

73
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,930
We can now chose
our geometry for the waves.

74
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,140
Without loss of generality, we can take
the equilibrium magnetic field

75
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,960
to be along the z-axis

76
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,170
and take the k vector
in the xz-plane.

77
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,440
We now have two cases.

78
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,730
The first case is the case
of transverse waves,

79
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,900
where V1 is perpendicular to k.

80
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,400
This case is depicted here.

81
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,880
It is here, the equilibrium
magnetic field B0 along the z-axis,

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,100
the vector k in the xz-plane,

83
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,530
and there is an angle, θ,
between k and B0.

84
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,390
The perturbed velocity: V1
in the y direction

85
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,880
perpendicular to k.

86
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,460
The second case is waves
with a longitudinal component

87
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,870
where V1 is also in the xz-plane,

88
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,090
which is depicted
in this second figure here.

89
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,850
Let's look at transverse waves.

90
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,970
V1 [is] only along the y direction,

91
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,250
and therefore V1 is perpendicular to k,

92
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,030
because k is in the xz-plane.

93
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,020
We can now start
with the equation in Fourier space

94
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,210
for the perturbed mass density.

95
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,660
Perturbed mass density: ρ̃M1

96
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,410
= 1/ω ρM0 k • Ṽ1.

97
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,840
But k and V are
perpendicular to each other.

98
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,420
Therefore, k and Ṽ are also
perpendicular to each other.

99
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,710
So ρ̃M1 = 0.

100
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,830
There is no perturbed mass density.

101
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,270
Transverse waves
are non-compressional.

102
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,190
We then have two remaining equations

103
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,240
that link B̃1y and Ṽ1y.

104
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,710
So we end up with these two equations:

105
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,080
ω ρM0 Ṽ1y + kz B0/μ0

106
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,450
[times] B̃1y
and the second equation:

107
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,860
kz B0 Ṽ1y

108
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,930
+ ω B̃1y = 0.

109
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,460
We can then combine
these two linearized equations

110
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,000
into a matricial form.

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,080
Now we want to obtain
a nontrivial solution

112
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,400
which has B̃1y and Ṽ1y,

113
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,540
both not equal to zero.

114
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,880
We obtain this solution
by taking the determinant

115
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,540
of this two-by-two matrix
to be equal to zero.

116
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,310
This leads to the dispersion relation
for the shear Alfvén wave.

117
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,690
In this dispersion relation,
there is a term that is very important.

118
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:41,000
This quantity here, B0²/(μ0 ρM0),

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,520
this is the square
of the Alfvén speed, cA.

120
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,330
We can then cast
this dispersion relation

121
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:54,160
in a way that we see the Alfvén speed
and the angle between k

122
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,800
and the equilibrium magnetic field.

123
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,780
This is the final form
for the dispersion relation

124
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,960
of the shear Alfvén wave:

125
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,800
ω² = k² cA² cos²θ.

126
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,470
We can now summarize what we
have found for the shear Alfvén wave.

127
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,320
The shear Alfvén waves
are transverse waves.

128
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,950
The perturbed velocity V1
is perpendicular to k

129
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,630
and to the equilibrium
magnetic field, B0.

130
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,690
The shear Alfvén wave is noncompressional.

131
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,960
The perturbed mass density, ρM1 = 0.

132
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,980
The dispersion relation
can be cast in a form:

133
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,510
ω² = (k cA)² cos²θ.

134
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,680
To give you a bit of a heads-up
of topics that we will discuss

135
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,390
later in this course,
the shear Alfvén wave

136
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,380
is important in DT fusion plasma
because the velocity

137
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:54,160
of fusion-born α particles
whose energy at birth is 3.5MeV

138
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,030
is super-Alfvénic:
exceeds the Alfvén speed cA.

139
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,540
Therefore, α's become resonant
with shear Alfvén waves

140
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,210
during their slowing down.

141
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,580
Shear Alfvén waves are ubiquitous
in plasma, and in fact they were observed

142
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,990
first in space and then in mercury plasmas.

143
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,900
Let's look at ideal MHD waves
with a longitudinal component.

144
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,030
V1 now has an x and z component,

145
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,640
so k • V1 ≠ 0.

146
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,610
We can repeat
all the previous calculations

147
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,190
to obtain an expression
for the perturbed magnetic field:

148
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,140
B1 = (V1x B0/ω)

149
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,840
k × ey.

150
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,840
We can continue the analysis,
and we obtain a dispersion relation

151
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,150
for the ideal MHD waves
with a longitudinal component.

152
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,640
ω⁴ - ω² k² (cA² + cs²) + k² kz² cA² cs² = 0

153
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,950
This is our dispersion relation
for ideal MHD waves

154
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,980
with a longitudinal component.

155
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,940
We see that [we have] a term,

156
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,810
that depends on the Alfvén speed cA
and on the sound speed cs

157
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,360
and it's in fact
a quadratic relation for ω².

158
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,400
We can solve this equation rather easily.

159
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,100
So we immediately see
that there are two roots

160
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,930
of this dispersion relation for ω².

161
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,590
We have a root with the plus
and a root with the minus.

162
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,630
We can simplify this dispersion relation
because the ratio

163
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:54,090
between the sound speed cs
and the Alfvén speed cA, squared,

164
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,930
is usually much smaller than one
in typical plasma conditions.

165
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,800
So we can take only terms
that are first-order

166
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,420
in the ratio between cs² and cA².

167
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,380
So we end up with this formulation
for the dispersion relation, ω²,

168
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,360
1/2 k² cA²

169
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,840
(1 +cs²/cA²),

170
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,090
so a first [order] correction in cs,

171
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,670
1 ± the two roots for ω²,

172
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,120
(1 - (2kz² cs²)/(k² cA²)).

173
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,630
We can now consider the plus root
of the dispersion relation.

174
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,930
We can now proceed
with this calculation

175
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,590
by summing 1 and the brackets.

176
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,330
We can now take the product
between the two brackets

177
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,590
and keep only the terms that are
linear in the ratio (cs/cA)².

178
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,360
Now we know kz = k cos θ,

179
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,050
we can then recast this last term.

180
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,110
So this is the final dispersion relation

181
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,490
for the plus root of the dispersion relation

182
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,430
of [the] ideal MHD wave
with a longitudinal component.

183
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,510
We call this wave
the fast compressional Alfvén wave.

184
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,340
We've seen that it's compressional —

185
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,640
k • V(1) ≠ 0 — and it is the fast solution

186
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,810
because the phase velocity is cA —

187
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:10,670
the Alfvén speed, that is much larger
than cs, the sound speed.

188
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,700
We see the dispersion relation is simply

189
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,900
ω₊² = k² cA²
and that the sound speed

190
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,130
and the angle between the k vector
and the equilibrium magnetic field

191
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,670
only enters as a small correction.

192
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,970
We have worked
through the fast wave solution,

193
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,550
the plus solution.

194
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,990
Now we can take the minus solution.

195
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,670
This will lead us to the slow wave.

196
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,460
We've taken the minus solution here.

197
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,420
We can now work through the algebra.

198
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,390
The 1 - 1 term cancels out,
so we only remain

199
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,070
with 2 kz² cs²

200
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,190
/(k² cA²).

201
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,370
(k² cA²) and (k² cA²)
simplifies out.

202
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,160
So what we end up with:

203
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,280
ω₋² = kz² cs²

204
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,330
and this is why we call
this wave the slow wave,

205
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,920
because the phase velocity is cs.

206
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,090
That is much smaller than cA.

207
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,430
The wave frequency depends
on the sound speed

208
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,790
and the angle between the k vector
and the equilibrium magnetic field.

209
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,470
So we call this
the slow magnetosonic wave —

210
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,190
a sound wave that exists
in the presence of a magnetic field.

211
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,870
A very useful way to represent the solution
of the wave dispersion relation

212
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,830
for ideal MHD is the surface described

213
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,880
by the phase velocity vector ω k /k².

214
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,410
We have here on the left
the case for the shear Alfvén wave,

215
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,890
which is noncompressional,
the dispersion relation, ω²

216
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,680
= (k cA)² cos² θ.

217
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:15,130
So if we draw this curve,
what we see is that we obtain

218
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,860
an eight along the axis
of the magnetic field

219
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:24,140
and the effective radius
of this eight is cA cos θ .

220
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,500
In the second case, we have
the dispersion relation for waves

221
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,670
which have a longitudinal component.

222
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,570
We have an inner figure
that is again another eight.

223
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,520
This corresponds
to the slow magnetosonic wave

224
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,280
for which the dispersion relation

225
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,040
is ω² = (k cs)² cos² θ.

226
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,880
The radius is (cs cosθ),

227
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,140
so it's much smaller than (cA cosθ).

228
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,300
The outer circle corresponds

229
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,480
to the fast compressional Alfvén waves,
for which the dispersion relation

230
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,800
is ω² = k² cA²

231
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,000
when we neglect all correction
due to the sound speed.

232
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,230
This is a circle whose radius is cA.

233
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,320
We can now summarize
what we have discussed

234
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,900
on ideal MHD waves.

235
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,250
The first wave that we discussed
[is the] transverse wave.

236
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,650
This is a noncompressional wave,
the shear Alfvén wave.

237
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,560
This wave will be discussed
in the concept of burning plasmas.

238
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,290
Then we have discussed compressional waves
which have a longitudinal component,

239
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,830
and we found two solutions:

240
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,850
the fast compressional Alfvén wave
and the slow magnetosonic wave.
