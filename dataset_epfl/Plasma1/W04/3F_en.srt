00:00:05,225 --> 00:00:10,265
Welcome to the Plasma Physics 
course of EPFL.

2
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:16,530
Under which conditions
is a standard fluid in equilibrium?

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,495
That is, under which conditions

4
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:23,752
do the properties of a fluid 
do not vary in time?

5
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:28,250
This typically happens 
when there is a balance

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,490
between the gravitational force
and the forces due to pressure.

7
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:36,487
In plasmas, things are
much more complicated

8
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:40,445
because plasmas are subject
to electromagnetic fields

9
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:42,734
that they have themselves generated.

10
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:48,909
The goal of the present lecture
is to study equilibria in plasmas.

11
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:53,774
This is an extremely important subject
because if you want to confine a plasma,

12
00:00:53,774 --> 00:00:56,901
this plasma has 
to be in equilibrium.

13
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:04,245
We will approach this issue
within the ideal MHD model.

14
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,968
The first thing that we will do
in this module will be

15
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:12,548
to derive the equations
that describe the equilibrium in plasma

16
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:14,911
within the ideal MHD model.

17
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:20,653
Then we will analyze in detail
the most important equation

18
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:25,287
that describes an equilibrium,
that is the force balance equation.

19
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:29,956
We will look at two different kinds
of equilibria that can be present

20
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,645
in plasma — the force-free
and the force-balanced equilibria.

21
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:37,622
Finally, I will talk about two examples

22
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:39,972
of MHD equilibria —

23
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:42,237
the Z-pinch and the θ-pinch.

24
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:47,412
So let's derive together the equations

25
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:52,562
that describe the plasma equilibrium
within the MHD model.

26
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:56,517
I will start by recalling the MHD equations

27
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,517
and then we will simplify those

28
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:03,393
to look at the equilibrium situation.

29
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:09,666
The equations for the MHD model
are the continuity equation,

30
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:15,824
which states that the mass density varies

31
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:18,594
because of the plasma flow;

32
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:21,840
the momentum equation,

33
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:36,565
which states that the fluid moves
because of the j × B and the ∇P forces;

34
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,860
Ohm's Law,

35
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:50,088
which states that the sum
of the electric field

36
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:53,436
plus the V × B terms is equal to ηj

37
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:56,491
which, in the ideal limit,

38
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:59,894
where the plasma resistivity
is equal to zero,

39
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:01,264
is equal to zero;

40
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,949
then a closure equation

41
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:12,383
and then the equations 
for the field — Maxwell's equations.

42
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:21,630
∇ × E = -∂B / ∂t,

43
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:26,395
Ampere's Law, and ∇ · B = 0.

44
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:30,886
From this equations we want to derive

45
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:36,454
the equations that describe
the static equilibrium.

46
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:44,703
That is, we want to reduce
this equation to the limit where

47
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:50,909
the properties of the plasmas
do not vary in time.

48
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:56,555
That is ∂ / ∂t = 0,

49
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,761
equilibrium, in other words.

50
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:02,932
We will look at the case
of static equilibrium

51
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:07,927
that is the case where the velocity

52
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:09,977
of the plasma is equal to zero.

53
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:14,216
Let me say that equilibria
that are not static —

54
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:18,132
where an equilibrium flow 
is present are very interesting.

55
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:22,517
However, for the sake of simplicity,
for this course we will focus

56
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:26,415
our attention only
on the simpler static equilibria.

57
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:31,432
Within this hypothesis, we observe
for the continuity equation

58
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:34,880
that because of ∂ / ∂t = 0,

59
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,741
this goes to zero

60
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:42,987
and as V = 0, this term goes to zero.

61
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:49,756
So the continuity equation
basically reduces, in static equilibrium

62
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,783
condition, to 0 = 0 :
it is always satisfied.

63
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:58,942
For the momentum equation,
we have that this term as V= 0 drops

64
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:07,234
and therefore the momentum equation
becomes a force-balance equation, that is

65
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:13,566
j × B - ∇P = 0.

66
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:18,077
Since the plasma velocity
is equal to zero, we also have

67
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:20,846
that this term is equal to zero.

68
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:24,230
Therefore, for a static
ideal MHD equilibrium,

69
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,911
we have that the electric field
has to be equal to zero.

70
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:36,839
In the hypothesis of ∂ / ∂t = 0
and V = 0, this term goes to zero.

71
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:39,865
So it becomes 0 = 0.

72
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:44,338
Then as the electric field
is equal to zero,

73
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:48,038
this is equal to zero 
and on the other end

74
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:53,514
∂ / ∂t = 0 implies that this
is equal to zero.

75
00:05:55,878 --> 00:06:02,151
This equation has to be kept:
∇ × B = μ₀ j

76
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,049
as well as ∇⋅B =0 .

77
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:11,388
These are the equations
that give the condition

78
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:14,622
for a static ideal MHD equilibrium.

79
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:18,698
Taking out the fact 
that E has to be equal to zero,

80
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:23,192
the three most important equations
to describe the equilibrium

81
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:27,052
are the first one, the force-balance
equation, j × B - ∇P = 0

82
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,498
Ampere's Law, ∇ × B = μ₀ j

83
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:34,495
and ∇⋅B =0.

84
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:40,526
Let's now make a couple of observations
on probably the most important equation

85
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,782
to describe plasma equilibrium —

86
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:46,330
the force-balance equation, j × B = ∇P.

87
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,887
The first observation
that I would like to make

88
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,440
is the following one.

89
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:57,592
If we take the product,
the scalar product

90
00:06:57,592 --> 00:07:02,080
between B and the gradient
of the pressure,

91
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:05,605
which according 
to the force-balance equation

92
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:10,885
is given by B · (j × B),

93
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:16,499
you find that as (j × B)
is perpendicular to B,

94
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:17,994
this is equal to zero.

95
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,654
At the same time, if one tries
to evaluate j · ∇P, one finds

96
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:28,845
that this is also equal to zero.

97
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:35,150
Therefore, if we have a surface
of constant pressure —

98
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,606
an isobaric surface —
along which P is constant,

99
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:48,105
and therefore with respect to which
the ∇P vector is perpendicular,

100
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:54,167
we find that B and j have to be
perpendicular to ∇P

101
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:58,682
and therefore they have to be
tangent to the surface.

102
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:06,824
B and j are tangential

103
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:11,186
to the P = constant surfaces,
the so-called isobaric surfaces.

104
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,368
The second observation 
that I would like to make

105
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:20,188
comes from putting together
the force-balance equation

106
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:22,662
and Ampere's Law.

107
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:33,601
By putting these two together,
what we find is —

108
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:38,143
more precisely, 
by replacing the value of j

109
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,575
in the force-balance equation
with the curl of B we find

110
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:46,628
that 1 /μ₀ (∇ × B)

111
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:49,973
that 1 /μ₀ (∇ × B) × B = ∇P.

112
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:54,648
Now if we try to estimate
the order of magnitude

113
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:59,523
of the terms that are contained
in this left-hand side,

114
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,254
we will find that there are terms

115
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:09,413
of order B² / μ₀,

116
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,606
and over a distance, ℓ.

117
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,531
If we do the same
for the right-hand side,

118
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:21,802
we find that the term present
on the right-hand side

119
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:26,997
is of the order of pressure
divided by scale length ℓ.

120
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:29,174
What is this ℓ?

121
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,495
It's the typical scale length
of the system.

122
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:35,832
We are estimating here
that the spatial derivative

123
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:41,748
of the curl operator can be estimated
as 1 over the typical plasma scale length,

124
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,497
that is, ℓ.

125
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:48,391
In plasma physics we introduce
an extremely important parameter,

126
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:51,468
the so-called plasma β,

127
00:09:56,202 --> 00:10:01,378
which is the ratio between the estimate
of the order of magnitude

128
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:04,042
of the right-hand side of this equation

129
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:08,452
and of the terms at the left-hand side.

130
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:12,856
What is the typical value of this β,

131
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:14,476
of this parameter?

132
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:19,864
β is found to be much, much smaller

133
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:22,768
than 1 in typical laboratory plasmas.

134
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:29,414
In these cases, in fact, 
the plasma is very tenuous.

135
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:33,747
If you want, most of the energy

136
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:36,237
is contained in the magnetic field

137
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:39,379
rather than in the plasma kinetic energy,

138
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,119
but there are also less tenuous plasmas

139
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:47,369
for which β is comparable to one,

140
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:50,009
for example in the Earth's magnetosphere,

141
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:54,539
where the magnetic field
is relatively weak.

142
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,415
Then one can find plasmas
in astrophysical systems,

143
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:01,894
where β can be even larger than one.

144
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:09,706
In this case, in fact, the magnetic field
can be weak, and most of the energy

145
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:12,560
can be in the form of thermal energy.

146
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,360
If β is much, much smaller than one

147
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,777
then this term here
has to be equal to zero.

148
00:11:22,777 --> 00:11:29,033
The terms contained in (∇ × B) × B 
have to balance themselves.

149
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:33,218
This is what we call
force-free equilibria.

150
00:11:34,123 --> 00:11:40,396
Otherwise, we have that the equilibrium
really comes from the balance

151
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:44,449
of both these terms,
the right- and left-hand sides,

152
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:46,617
and therefore one has

153
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:50,883
that 1 / μ₀ (∇ × B) × B = ∇p.

154
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:53,987
These are the force-balanced equilibria.

155
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:58,149
So let's take a look at the properties
of force-free equilibria

156
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,248
and let's take a look at an example.

157
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,866
Actually, as you will see,
such a beautiful structure

158
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:10,155
that you can observe on the Sun's surface
is an example of force-free equilibrium.

159
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:13,375
Force-free equilibria,
as we have just said,

160
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,009
are equilibria for which j × B,

161
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:26,343
which we can write 
in terms of the curl of B,

162
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:29,214
thanks to Ampere's Law,
is equal to zero.

163
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,592
In other words,
force-free equilibria appear

164
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:38,974
when the curl of B

165
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:41,814
is parallel to B.

166
00:12:41,814 --> 00:12:45,854
In this case, in fact, 
the vectoral product is equal to zero.

167
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:50,074
Therefore, ∇ × B has to be equal 
to some function —

168
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:53,242
α, scalar function — times B.

169
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:57,919
It's interesting to take a look
at what the properties are of this α.

170
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:07,399
If we evaluate the divergence
of the curl of B,

171
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,012
this is equal to zero
because of the properties

172
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:12,843
of a vector.

173
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:16,859
Because of this equation, this is equal

174
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:20,742
to the ∇⋅(αB).

175
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:28,158
If we try to evaluate the divergence
of αB, we find that this is

176
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:33,767
equal to α∇·B + B·∇α.

177
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:37,611
This is equal to zero
because of the property

178
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:41,243
of the magnetic field
and therefore we arrive

179
00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:46,712
to the fact that B · ∇α is equal to zero.

180
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:52,836
If we consider surface of α 
equal to constant,

181
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:57,010
we will find that the gradient of α,

182
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:59,955
which is perpendicular to this surface,

183
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:04,955
has to be perpendicular to B
and therefore B has to be

184
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:09,285
tangential to the α 
equal to constant plane.

185
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:13,312
A demonstration similar
to the one I just did

186
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:17,201
will be used in the exercises
to show an interesting property

187
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:19,993
of force-free equilibria,
that is, that the current

188
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,409
is proportional to the magnetic field.

189
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:28,450
Can we give an example
of a force-free equilibrium?

190
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:34,105
We will give it for a relatively 
simple configuration

191
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:37,494
that is the one where there is
cylindrical symmetry.

192
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:43,721
We will consider a situation

193
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:47,741
where the properties of the plasmas

194
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:49,670
and the magnetic field

195
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:59,255
therefore they will depend on the radius,

196
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,194
are cylindrically symmetric,

197
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:02,797
but they won't depend on θ,

198
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:09,693
therefore for which ∂ / ∂θ = 0.

199
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:15,246
In order to better describe
this configuration,

200
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:17,486
we will introduce er,

201
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:22,136
that is, the unitary vector

202
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:25,364
in the r direction, eθ.

203
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:33,063
We won't forget that the properties
can still depend on z

204
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:37,645
where ez is out of the plane.

205
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:43,250
Now one can show
that the equation

206
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,590
∇ × B = αB is satisfied

207
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,622
by a magnetic field
that has the following form:

208
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,034
It has a component
along the θ direction

209
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,587
and a component along the z direction.

210
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,092
with Bθ equal to

211
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:09,653
(B₀ K r) / (1 + k²r²)

212
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,991
where B₀ is a constant
that has the units of a magnetic field,

213
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:21,642
where k is also a constant
that has the units of 1/length

214
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:25,265
and sets the size, the scale length

215
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:28,082
of this equilibrium 
in the radial direction.

216
00:16:28,532 --> 00:16:30,823
Bz is given by

217
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:38,377
B₀ / (1 + k²r²).

218
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:43,014
With a magnetic field of this form,

219
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:47,109
one can readily evaluate 
the value of α,

220
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:54,041
which is found to be equal to μ₀

221
00:16:57,438 --> 00:17:00,678
jz over Bz,

222
00:17:00,678 --> 00:17:05,176
where jz is the current
along the z direction

223
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:09,753
that can be evaluated
by considering Ampere's Law

224
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:12,852
and is equal to

225
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:22,651
r k Bz / (1 + k²r²)².

226
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:27,337
How does such a configuration look?

227
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:32,687
Let's imagine a cylinder
and look at the different radii,

228
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:37,280
the direction of the magnetic field,
in other words we will —

229
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,372
we will look at the magnetic field lines

230
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:54,267
as they lie on these nested
cylindrical surfaces

231
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:59,444
and what we observe at small radii

232
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:02,582
is that the θ component is very small

233
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:06,993
and therefore most of the magnetic field
is in the z direction.

234
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:12,325
Therefore B will be in this direction.

235
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:17,363
At larger radii, this term will grow

236
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:21,904
and we will find something like that.

237
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,404
At even larger radii,
this will grow far more,

238
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:32,125
up to the largest radii,
where Bθ will dominate over Bz.

239
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:35,021
Therefore the magnetic field

240
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:39,721
will be mostly in the θ direction.

241
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:44,814
What we have just drawn is
what is called a flux rope,

242
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:54,287
an MHD equilibrium that is
a underlined, for example,

243
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:59,391
by this nice beautiful structure

244
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:02,064
that we can observe
on the Sun's surface.

245
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:07,689
In this region, in fact,
the plasma β is very small

246
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:13,006
and the equilibrium can be well described
by the force-free equations.

247
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,035
Here, for example, 
you will have a magnetic field

248
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:22,745
that spirals around this flux rope

249
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,870
and it's able to confine the plasma.

250
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:34,317
We have taken a quick look
at properties of force-free equilibria.

251
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:38,467
Now let's concentrate
on force-balanced equilibria.

252
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:41,994
In this case, the force-balance
equation is given by

253
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:52,359
(1 / μ₀) (∇ × B) × B = ∇P.

254
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:59,526
To make some progress, 
we will use a property of vectors

255
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:01,536
that says that

256
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:08,182
this expression here is equal

257
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:12,318
to (B · ∇)B

258
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:17,076
- 1/2∇B².

259
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:24,090
This implies that the expression,
the force-balance equation

260
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,145
that we have written here, 
can be written

261
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:30,344
as the gradient of ( P

262
00:20:31,154 --> 00:20:33,092
plus this term here,

263
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:39,759
B² / 2μ₀) equal 
to the term contained here.

264
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:45,033
How can we interpret this equation here?

265
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:50,244
This will give us a balance
between this term here,

266
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:53,184
that is the plasma pressure,

267
00:20:57,067 --> 00:21:01,312
a term here that we 
can interpret as —

268
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:03,645
which still has 
the dimension of a pressure

269
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:10,765
and that we can interpret as the pressure
associated to the magnetic field,

270
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:12,423
the <i>magnetic pressure</i>,

271
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:18,508
and a term which is present

272
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:21,838
if the B field is curved,

273
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:27,539
something that we can interpret
as the tension of the magnetic field lines.

274
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:36,647
This is the general expression
for an equilibrium.

275
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:39,916
We may consider the simplest case,

276
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,916
as we have seen in the previous slide,

277
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:47,604
the one of a cylindrically 
symmetrical system

278
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,697
with a magnetic field of the form ...

279
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:58,514
and a pressure given by a function of r.

280
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:04,418
In this case, the force-balance equation 
here can be written

281
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:08,518
as d / dr, pressure,

282
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:24,917
and this term, field line tension term,
becomes Bθ² / μ₀r.

283
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:14,221
the sum of Bθ and Bz
in evaluating to B² term,

284
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:30,980
Now by using Ampere's Law we 
can also find what is the expression of j

285
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,220
associated with this magnetic field.

286
00:22:33,922 --> 00:22:38,763
We find, in fact, that j
is equal to the sum

287
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:42,192
of the components along θ and along z

288
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:49,235
with jθ given by the derivative
along the radius of Bz

289
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:54,251
and jz by this expression.

290
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:58,045
As a matter of fact, 
here we have three functions:

291
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,011
P, Bθ and Bz.

292
00:23:07,693 --> 00:23:12,534
Two of these functions 
can be specified arbitrarily.

293
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:21,899
Once you have specified two functions,
the third one can be determined

294
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,141
by using the force-balance equation,

295
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:30,527
of course, subject to the 
appropriate boundary conditions.

296
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,234
We have just derived 
the conditions under which

297
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:48,398
a cylindrically symmetric plasma
is in equilibrium.

298
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:50,971
Now let's take a look at two cases:

299
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,832
the Z-pinch and the θ-pinch,

300
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,000
where the plasma, 
cylindrically symmetrical,

301
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,205
is in equilibrium.

302
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:03,674
In the Z-pinch, which is also called
Bennett's pinch,

303
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:08,759
one assumes that Bz = 0.

304
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,615
This specifies, actually,

305
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:17,481
one of the free functions

306
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:19,040
that we had found,

307
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,027
and therefore that one specified
that the plasma is confined

308
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:27,853
by a magnetic field
that is only in the θ direction.

309
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:35,596
By using the relation
between current and magnetic field

310
00:24:35,596 --> 00:24:38,227
that we have seen in the previous slide,

311
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:51,254
one finds that jθ = 0 and therefore that j

312
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:53,533
is only in the z direction.

313
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:57,949
What we are therefore 
looking at is a configuration

314
00:24:58,602 --> 00:25:03,835
where there is a current
that flows in the z direction

315
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:09,935
and the plasma is confined
by a magnetic field

316
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:13,114
that is in the θ direction.

317
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,620
Therefore, if you want,
it pinches the plasma in the z direction.

318
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:27,875
This configuration we have specified
one of the two free functions

319
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:31,650
and therefore we are left
with one free function.

320
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:35,481
We can therefore specify P

321
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:39,917
or Bθ or jz.

322
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:46,278
Let's take a look at an example
of Z-pinch equilibrium,

323
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:51,646
a simple example, the one
where a uniform current

324
00:25:51,646 --> 00:25:54,966
passes through the plasma
and the current is equal to zero

325
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:58,281
outside the plasma —
therefore, a plasma

326
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:03,922
where jz = jz0

327
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:08,083
inside the plasma
and is equal to zero outside.

328
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:13,231
The total current flow
in the plasma is given by I,

329
00:26:14,276 --> 00:26:16,785
that is the integral over jz

330
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:20,443
over the full plasma cross-section,

331
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:26,022
which is equal to π a² jz0.

332
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:32,547
Having this expression, one can derive Bθ.

333
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:36,937
To do that, one can simply integrate
this expression —

334
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:43,346
if you do these steps, what you obtain
is that Bθ, which is a function of r,

335
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:46,075
is equal to this expression,

336
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:50,121
which can also be written
in terms of I,

337
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:54,311
for r < a

338
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:58,102
and r larger than a.

339
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:04,579
From the force-balanced equation, then,
one can derive the value of P.

340
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:16,969
This has to be subject
to the correct boundary condition,

341
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,515
that is the plasma pressure
has to be equal to zero

342
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:26,057
for r ≥ a, from which one obtains

343
00:27:27,156 --> 00:27:32,701
P(r), which is valid for r < a.

344
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:39,974
Let me say that studying the Z-pinch
is not a purely academic exercise.

345
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:42,971
In fact, among the first machines

346
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:45,271
that were used to make fusion,

347
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:50,177
the Z-pinch had an important role.

348
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:55,222
Nowadays, the Z-pinch still exists
as a source of x-rays.

349
00:27:55,234 --> 00:28:01,006
The plasma, typically,
is made by heavy atoms —

350
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:07,131
is compressed by using the forces
that act on a Z-pinch

351
00:28:07,131 --> 00:28:13,001
and a huge burst of x-rays is produced.

352
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:19,599
An example is shown here with the Z-pinch

353
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,043
at the Sandia National Laboratory
in New Mexico.

354
00:28:24,832 --> 00:28:27,183
We have seen the Z-pinch;

355
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:30,266
there is another simple configuration

356
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:34,447
that we can analyze
in this cylindrically symmetrical case

357
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,138
that is the θ-pinch.

358
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:38,798
In the θ-pinch we impose

359
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:43,284
that the Bθ component is equal to zero.

360
00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:46,894
Therefore, from this equation we find

361
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:50,425
that j is in the eθ direction.

362
00:28:51,457 --> 00:28:53,808
If you want, the situation is reversed

363
00:28:53,808 --> 00:28:55,776
with respect to the Z-pinch.

364
00:28:55,776 --> 00:29:01,090
We have current 
that flows in the θ direction

365
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,449
and a magnetic field
that is in the z direction.

366
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,502
The force-balance equation becomes
something very simple

367
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:28,938
where the contribution
of the field line tension disappears

368
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:31,190
as the magnetic field is straight.

369
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,660
Here we get to the conclusion
of the present module

370
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,640
where we have derived
the equations that describe

371
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,361
the equilibrium in plasmas
within the ideal MHD model.

372
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,294
The first thing that we have observed is

373
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:51,550
that the vectors B and j

374
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,650
are tangential to isobaric surfaces.

375
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,537
Then we have observed
that different kinds of equilibria

376
00:29:59,537 --> 00:30:03,940
can be present in a plasma —
force-free and force-balanced equilibria.

377
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,853
We have given some examples
of these equilibria —

378
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:11,476
the flux rope, the Z-pinch,
and the θ-pinch.

379
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,437
These are relatively simple scenarios,

380
00:30:15,437 --> 00:30:19,275
but let me say that they contain
all the elements to look

381
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:23,985
at the most complicated cases,
such as the Tokamak ,

382
00:30:23,985 --> 00:30:26,405
that are actually used nowadays

383
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:30,470
to confine plasma and reach
the conditions necessary

384
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,451
for fusion reactions to occur.
