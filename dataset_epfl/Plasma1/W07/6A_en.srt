00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:08,289
Welcome to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:11,236
Today we will study the basics
of thermonuclear fusion.

3
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:13,999
We'll look at a case
of fusion energy in general,

4
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,593
and the fusion reactions
and the relevant cross-sections,

5
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,851
and a schematic of a fusion power plant
as imagined today,

6
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:22,481
and the fusion fuels
and their availability,

7
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:25,423
and of course the advantages
that fusion can have.

8
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:29,450
I would like to discuss the case
for fusion energy by starting-

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,881
considering a single parameter
that measures the development

10
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,289
of a nation called
<i>The Human Development Index</i>.

11
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:37,706
This combines three parameters:

12
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:44,541
health, education, and richness, evaluated
per individual, so per capita

13
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:48,547
in terms of the life expectancy,
the number of years at school,

14
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:52,014
and the gross national product per capita.

15
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:56,373
In this plot, the <i>Human Development Index</i>
is represented as a function

16
00:00:56,373 --> 00:01:00,325
of the electricity use per capita again.

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,317
What we notice
is a very striking correlation

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,097
between the two.

19
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:12,024
In other words, in order to develop more,
according to this very simplistic,

20
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:17,194
yet very interesting measure,
countries need to use more electricity.

21
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:22,352
Or better, they need to allow
the individuals to use more electricity

22
00:01:22,352 --> 00:01:23,793
per capita.

23
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:28,592
We also notice that at some point,
corresponding roughly

24
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:31,020
to this vertical dotted line,

25
00:01:31,313 --> 00:01:36,284
there is no need for an increase-
for a further increase in electricity use

26
00:01:36,284 --> 00:01:38,307
per capita to develop.

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,046
This point corresponds roughly
to the average of the Western countries.

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,690
So we want to have an energy source
that is available to all countries

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,469
and in particular, to those that are
on the left-hand side of this graph

30
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:56,196
and therefore need to move on
and move up in their development index.

31
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:01,432
We want an energy source that has no
negative impact on the environment

32
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:03,098
and on the climate.

33
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,946
That is, we want an energy source
that doesn't produce

34
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:09,047
a significant emission
on greenhouse gases such as <i>CO2</i>.

35
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:12,041
Global warming is now accepted
as a scientific fact.

36
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:15,503
We have images here that show examples
of these consequences.

37
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,276
We have the melting of glaciers.
We have an increased frequency

38
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:23,079
of extreme events such as droughts,
floods or heavy storms.

39
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:28,219
Naturally, we want a source of energy
that is safe, that doesn't create

40
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:30,249
any significant risks for the population.

41
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:34,276
We don't want situations like that,
represented in the picture,

42
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:37,640
which is, of course, that of the Fukushima
accident, to happen any more.

43
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:42,461
As I said before, the sources of energy
that we look for must be available

44
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:44,044
equally for all countries.

45
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,562
In particular for the countries
that still need to develop.

46
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:51,874
We want to avoid the situation
in which, as we have today,

47
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:55,182
1.5 billion people
do not have access to electricity.

48
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:58,483
The situation in which, if you
represent the world's map

49
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:01,624
in a way that the size of the countries
are made proportional to the per capita

50
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:05,560
energy usage or is deformed
according to that quantity,

51
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:10,100
well, many countries cannot even
be recognized anymore as you can see here.

52
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,837
Even continents cannot be recognized,

53
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:16,425
almost cannot be recognized
such as Africa here.

54
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:22,996
So to summarize this first part,
we are looking for an energy source

55
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:26,145
that is abundant,
geographically distributed,

56
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:28,622
that does not produce greenhouse gases,

57
00:03:29,614 --> 00:03:32,410
that does not create
major risks for the population,

58
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:36,539
simply, that is compatible
with sustainable development.

59
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:40,254
My point is that such source
does not exist today.

60
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:42,900
And what we'll see
in the rest of the lecture

61
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,590
is that fusion can become part
of the solution to this energy problem.

62
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:51,507
So let us see how fusion works
and its analogies and differences

63
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:52,945
with respect to fission.

64
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:56,322
To start the discussion I plot here
the bonding energy per nucleon

65
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:57,914
as a function of the atomic number.

66
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,966
The curve here has a certain shape

67
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:06,649
which shows a minimum in the center

68
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:10,557
of the plot corresponding
to iron.

69
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:15,022
The nuclear reactions can make us
move along the curve

70
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,628
one way or the other.

71
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:20,976
First way we have to move
is to go down from the right.

72
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:26,572
I say 'go down' because as you
go from large atomic numbers

73
00:04:26,572 --> 00:04:32,167
to smaller atomic numbers on the right
side of the graph, the energy per nucleon

74
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:34,700
is lower and lower.

75
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,205
So if you have a reaction
that takes you on that path

76
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:39,665
that means you can release some energy

77
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:43,371
and that energy that you can release
corresponds to the difference

78
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:45,802
in a vertical axis.

79
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:49,801
So of course that's the way fission works
as represented here on the bottom.

80
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:52,764
Fission works by breaking
a very large nucleus

81
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:56,776
such as that of uranium,
bombarding it by neutrons,

82
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,087
for example,

83
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:01,212
and creating smaller nuclei and energy.

84
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:04,513
Fusion does exactly the opposite.

85
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:10,566
That is, it combines light nuclei
to form slightly heavier nuclei

86
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,127
and therefore goes down in the curve
from left to right at the left-hand side

87
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:16,228
of the graph.

88
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:18,248
And you notice not only
that you gain energy

89
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:21,824
by your course going down in this curve
but also you gain a lot of energy

90
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:24,482
in the sense that the slope
of that curve is very sharp.

91
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:30,263
The example shown on the bottom is that
of deuterium and tritium, two isotopes

92
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:36,224
of hydrogen, which, if combined,
can be give rise to helium

93
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,512
and a neutron, and a lot of energy.

94
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:43,588
Once more, it's a lot of energy because
the steepness of the curve is very large.

95
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:47,272
In fact, fusion is the source of energy
of the stars,

96
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,076
so we know it works in nature.

97
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:53,252
The stars work on the principle
of putting together essentially

98
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:59,061
four protons to form a helium-4
nucleus and, again, energy.

99
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:05,253
The energy production comes from the fact
that the mass of the products

100
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:09,290
of the reactions is slightly lower
than that of the fuels

101
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,576
that enter into the reactions.

102
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:13,807
So that creates a mass defect,
which according to the equation

103
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:18,739
E=mcÂ² coming from the Einstein
relativity, of course,

104
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:20,809
corresponds to energy.

105
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:24,325
To give you an idea of what happens
in the sun, every minute,

106
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,607
a mass that is equivalent
to the Matterhorn mountain,

107
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,589
is converted into energy.

108
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:32,122
Let us look at the fusion reactions
that we can have working on earth

109
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:34,522
in a reactor to produce energy for us.

110
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,025
I have taken three examples here:

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,231
deuterium and tritium that fuse
to produce a helium-4 and a neutron,

112
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:45,025
which you have seen already.

113
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:50,883
Deuterium and helium-3 that fuse
to produce helium-4 and a proton,

114
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:55,166
or deuterium and deuterium, 
that fuse to produce

115
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:59,133
two possible outcomes, 
a helium-3 and a neutron

116
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,557
or a triton and a proton.

117
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:05,299
What we're seeing in the movie here
is the thermal motion

118
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,133
of the particles involved.

119
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:11,430
And that underlies the difficulty
of achieving fusion on earth.

120
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:15,023
The reason for that
is that all these particles

121
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:18,462
that we're dealing with are nuclei
and therefore they're all positively

122
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:21,988
charged and because they have the same
kind of charge they repel each other

123
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:24,059
due to the Coulomb repulsion.

124
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:30,192
They repel each other in a way
that they are kept sufficiently far

125
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:32,105
for fusion reactions not to happen.

126
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,093
Except if the relative motion
of this nuclei is strong enough

127
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:40,488
or the collisions are energetic enough,
that they can come close enough

128
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:42,167
and the nuclear force can take over.

129
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:46,363
So when I say the motion
needs to be fast enough

130
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:48,905
or the collision strong enough,
or energetic enough,

131
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:51,529
I mean that the temperature
has to be large enough.

132
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,846
If the temperature is large enough,
this random motion

133
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:58,097
of the particles is very fast
and therefore collisions

134
00:07:58,097 --> 00:08:00,794
are energetic enough for the nuclei
to approach each other

135
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:05,208
at a distance where nuclear force
can take over and the fusion reactions

136
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,602
can happen.

137
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:11,720
Let's look at this phenomenon
slightly- in a slightly more

138
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,874
detailed way.

139
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:16,844
We have said that the repulsion
comes from the Coulomb potential.

140
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:22,978
So we can calculate the height
of the potential barrier that that forms

141
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:28,815
and we can see in this plot
that that is pretty high.

142
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:32,342
Almost 400 keV in terms of energy.

143
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:34,630
So if you had to go all the way
to the top of the barrier

144
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,787
that we would need to have, about 400 keV
of energy in the relative motion

145
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:43,287
of this nuclei when they are moving
in a random fashion.

146
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:47,320
However, we have an effect that helps us:

147
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:50,586
that is a quantum mechanical
tunneling effect,

148
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:54,714
which tells us that we actually don't need
to go all the way to the top barrier

149
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:58,902
but we can tunnel through the barrier
at much lower levels of energy.

150
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:02,981
So that means we can achieve this passage
through the barrier

151
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:06,456
and then fall into the trap corresponding
to the nuclear force,

152
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:08,685
which would then lead
to the fusion reaction

153
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:12,061
and therefore the energy that's released
as a consequence of it.

154
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:17,705
Energies, or temperatures, of the order
10 to 20 kiloelectron volt [keV],

155
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,163
which is of course, much easier to achieve
than hundreds of kiloelectron volt.

156
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:25,195
Let us look at the fusion reactions
we have available on earth

157
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:26,737
to produce energy.

158
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:29,380
We have seen that there are
three possibilities:

159
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,234
<i>D-T, D-Helium</i>, and <i>D-D</i>.

160
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:37,267
We can quantify the probability for them 
to happen or the difficulty

161
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:42,307
to achieve them, in a sense,
by looking at their cross-section

162
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:45,174
times the velocity average over
the distribution function in a nuclei

163
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:46,985
which means their reactivity.

164
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:51,555
And we notice immediately in this plot
that the easiest of all to achieve

165
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:54,924
is the one that has the largest
cross-section which is the <i>D-T</i> reaction.

166
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,608
And that's why in the rest
of this lecture and in fact,

167
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:02,176
in the rest of the course,
we will focus on this reaction only.

168
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:07,173
One question naturally arises:
Why are we coupling plasma physics

169
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,179
with fusion?

170
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:11,482
Why is plasma physics an essential element
of fusion energy research?

171
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:16,158
Well the answer comes exactly
from the same plot we have just seen,

172
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:20,304
because if we look at that 
scale of temperatures,

173
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:24,852
either in billions of Kelvins
or in kiloelectron volt

174
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:26,129
at the top,

175
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:31,657
we notice that we are in a range of values
that corresponds to a situation

176
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:35,728
which no ordinary matter
can exist in form of either solid

177
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:38,059
or liquid or even gas.

178
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:43,777
Only plasma can exist at these
temperatures of the order of 10 to 100 keV

179
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:47,069
or of the order of hundreds of millions
of Kelvin.

180
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:51,608
So plasma physics is an essential
element of fusion energy research because

181
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:56,213
at the temperatures required for fusion
only the plasma state of matter can exist.

182
00:10:57,121 --> 00:11:00,242
The second question I'd like to
quickly address is:

183
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,736
Why do we speak of <i>thermo</i>nuclear fusion?

184
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:04,831
Why the term <i>thermo-</i>?

185
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:08,349
Well, the answer is in
the plot I show here,

186
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,295
which compares the cross-section
for the Coulomb interactions,

187
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:15,279
which means the interactions are dictated
by the electric force

188
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,196
and the cross-section
for the fusion reactions

189
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:20,374
in the case of D-T here

190
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:21,846
as a function of energy.

191
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:24,476
And we notice that for all the energies

192
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:29,291
there's a huge difference between the two.
The Coulomb interactions

193
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:33,496
have a much higher cross-section
than the fusion collisions.

194
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:37,782
So that means the Coulomb collisions
are much more frequent

195
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,132
than fusion reactions.

196
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:44,223
So if we think of a mono-energetic beam,
well that would be scattered in a plasma

197
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:47,102
before the particles can fuse.

198
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:50,924
So in practice, that also means
that we need to deal

199
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:53,663
with a Maxwellian distribution
which results when-

200
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:55,659
from an equilibrium generated
by Coulomb collisions,

201
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:57,361
a little bit like in a normal gas.

202
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,103
That's why we speak
of thermonuclear fusion.

203
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,481
So let's go back to our reaction
that we have chosen

204
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:08,320
for the first generation of reactors
at least that is, the <i>D-T</i> reaction.

205
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:13,100
Once more, there's the deuterium
and tritium that collide

206
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,175
energetically enough to fuse.

207
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:20,584
Helium nucleus comes up for the reaction
with three and a half MeV of energy

208
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:25,614
and a neutron also comes out
with 14.1 MeV of energy.

209
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:31,196
So the fusion fuels are therefore
deuterium and tritium.

210
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:37,206
Deuterium is about .014%
of the hydrogenic atoms everywhere,

211
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,520
including in the oceans.

212
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:42,939
That corresponds
to about 1.6 grams per liter.

213
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:45,061
So it's relatively easily available.

214
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:48,380
Tritium, on the other hand, 
does not exist in nature

215
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,275
because it's radio-active and short-lived.

216
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:53,019
It's life is about 12-and-a-half years.

217
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:57,720
However, it can be produced from lithium
in a process we call <i>breeding</i>.

218
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:03,226
Lithium, in turn, can be mined or found
in the ocean water in the amount

219
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:06,618
that's about .15 grams per cubic meter.

220
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,023
How is tritium produced from lithium?

221
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,940
There are two possible reactions.

222
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:17,429
The neutrons that come out
from the fusion reaction itself,

223
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:24,775
can react with the lithium that's present
around the plasma, that we will

224
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:27,637
actually install
around the plasma,

225
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:32,008
in two ways: there's a reaction
with lithium-6 on the top

226
00:13:32,008 --> 00:13:35,560
or a reaction with lithium-7
here at the bottom.

227
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,166
We'll concentrate on the first of the two
for the simple reason that

228
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:45,201
despite the fact that the lithium-6
is only about 7% of natural lithium,

229
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:48,882
the cross-section for this reaction,
which implies that it's probability,

230
00:13:48,882 --> 00:13:50,830
is much larger than the other one.

231
00:13:51,118 --> 00:13:55,941
In fact, that's why in the picture
represented here, we only show

232
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:59,173
that possibility, so it's lithium-6
that would react with a neutron.

233
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:01,816
And what would be the by-product
of this reaction?

234
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:06,958
It would be exactly what we want, 
it would be a tritium,

235
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,382
it would be also helium-4
and, in fact, even some energy.

236
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:16,975
So that's how we produce
tritium in a plant.

237
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:23,397
In practice, what we'll do, we will
surround the plasma with a 'blanket'

238
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:24,707
as we call it.

239
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:29,062
That is a system that has,
essentially, lithium in it,

240
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:31,229
so that this nuclear reaction
between the neutrons

241
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:35,853
produced by the nuclear fusion reactions
and lithium can occur.

242
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:39,377
Of course, there are different concepts
and technological details

243
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:46,642
in different approaches -- we see here
a picture from CEA in France --

244
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,058
different concepts for this blanket
for breeding tritium,

245
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,770
but all of them are based, again,
on the presence of lithium.

246
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:59,501
We're now ready to look
at the schematic of a fusion reactor,

247
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,777
at least as we imagine it today.

248
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,961
So from the outside, what I call
the <i>primary fuels</i>,

249
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:12,321
we would have lithium, that will come,
and deuterium, that we injected

250
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:13,405
in the plant.

251
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:21,790
Lithium will go and will stay
in the blanket around our plasma.

252
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,239
Deuterium will be injected
directly in the plasma.

253
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,626
In the core of the plant, of course,
we have the plasma itself

254
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:30,828
which will be hot enough
to produce fusion reactions.

255
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:33,458
And neutrons that are issued
by these fusion reactions,

256
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,910
will react
with the lithium in the blanket

257
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,357
and form tritium.

258
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:42,693
This tritium will be purified
and injected again into the plant.

259
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,885
So no tritium will come in;
no tritium will come out of the plant.

260
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:52,130
What will come in again
will be deuterium and lithium.

261
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:58,298
What will come out will be some helium,
and most importantly, energy.

262
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:03,610
Energy will be collected in the blanket
by a fluid that will exchange heat

263
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,778
and that fluid will make
a conventional turbine work

264
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:15,003
via the usual cycle that we operate
in different kinds of power plants.

265
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:18,915
The result will be some electricity
we inject in the grid.

266
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,993
I'd like to discuss
the advantages of fusion now.

267
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:25,654
First of all, there's a fantastically
high energy density.

268
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,712
And to illustrate that I prepared
a table here with different

269
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:32,030
kinds of fuels for different kinds
of sources of energy

270
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,969
we have available today.

271
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:38,008
And I sort of ranked them in terms
of their specific energy.

272
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:42,402
That's the energy content they have
in terms of megajoule per kilogram (MJ/kg)

273
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,855
so energy per mass.

274
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:49,767
I start with water; I consider a 100 meter
high dam just as a reference.

275
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:54,642
The number that water has
as energy content is very small.

276
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:57,629
It's .001M J/kg.

277
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,800
I'll move on to coal.

278
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:06,135
Coal, of course, needs to be burned
so it needs to give rise to <i>CO2</i> --

279
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:07,610
greenhouse gas and so on.

280
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:11,398
It's specific energy is about 30 MJ/kg.

281
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,566
Oil, same issue of fossil fuels.

282
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:17,064
50 M J/kg.

283
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:19,199
Then we have a huge jump,

284
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,674
because I'm moving to nuclear reactions.

285
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:28,790
First example is that of fission;
I take here Uranium-235

286
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:34,758
instead of 30, 50 or tens of M J/kg
now we have a total game changer.

287
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:38,695
We have 85 millions of M J /kg.

288
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:46,568
In the next step, which is even much
higher than fission itself, is fusion.

289
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:51,951
For D-T, in this example,
we have 350 millions of M J /kg.

290
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:57,679
That's as close as you can get
to just transforming directly

291
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:05,027
all the mass into energy
according to the E=mcÂ² equation,

292
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:11,449
which corresponds to having 90,
9 0 billions of M j/kg.

293
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:14,735
So fusion is as close
as we can get to that number.

294
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:17,748
Fantastically high energy density.

295
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,641
To quantify this in a practical example,

296
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:26,091
as shown in the picture here,
I'd like to take one liter of sea water.

297
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,159
That corresponds to
33 miligrams of deuterium.

298
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:35,168
Then I take 5 grams of lithium-ore,
corresponding to 50 mg of tritium.

299
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:38,243
The energy content in this combination

300
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:42,689
corresponds to the energy content
of almost 400 liters of petrol,

301
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,249
which is more than two barrels.

302
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:51,325
Because of this huge energy density
and because of the amount of fuels

303
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:55,339
that we have available on earth,
fusion is practically inexhaustible

304
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:56,679
in terms of its fuels.

305
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:59,759
The picture here shows
a lithium mine in Nevada

306
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,106
so lithium can be mined
on the earth crust,

307
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:08,877
but both lithium, in fact, and deuterium
can be found in ocean water.

308
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:14,342
Ocean water is everywhere,
almost everywhere, and in large amounts.

309
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:20,330
Two pictures of different oceans here
remind us that ocean water

310
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,435
is very well distributed geographically.

311
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:25,711
For example, as opposed to fossil fuels.

312
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:29,872
So not only are the fuels practically
inexhaustible, but they are also

313
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:32,483
extremely well distributed
geographically.

314
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:36,556
In terms of the environmental impact,

315
00:19:36,556 --> 00:19:40,514
first of all, there's no greenhouse
gas emission from fusion.

316
00:19:40,976 --> 00:19:45,365
There are no waste products
because the by-product of the reaction

317
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:46,886
is simply helium.

318
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:55,112
There is no long-lasting radioactive waste.
Even the activation of the reactor itself

319
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,334
is a relatively minor problem.

320
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:03,038
This is illustrated in this plot
which shows the radioactivity level

321
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:09,200
of the plant after shutdown
is a function of the number of years

322
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,842
after this shutdown for different cases.

323
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,814
We see the red line here
is that of a <i>fission reactor</i>.

324
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:20,883
It's a light water reactor in this case,

325
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:25,123
which stays very high in this curve 
all the way to about 10,000 years

326
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,660
after it's shut down.

327
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,903
Situation of fusion is very different.

328
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:36,076
Even with materials that we have available
today for example the <i>ferritic steel</i>

329
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:38,618
-- this is the yellow curve here --

330
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:41,727
we go down relatively fast
in this radioactivity level.

331
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:45,773
We reach the level of the coal ashes,
so the level at which

332
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:49,522
we really don't worry any more
about the radioactivity of the plant

333
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:53,346
after tens of years as opposed
to tens thousands of years.

334
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:56,760
If you go for more advanced materials
such as vanadium alloys

335
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,266
or silicon carbide composites
for fusion, that level is reached,

336
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:06,062
really, after only very few years
or even reached from the very beginning

337
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:08,856
in the case of silicon carbide composite.

338
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,820
So we have seen that fusion
has a huge energy density,

339
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,103
that its fuels
are practically inexhaustible,

340
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:22,619
that fusion has no bad effect
on the environment.

341
00:21:23,555 --> 00:21:25,179
What about its safety?

342
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:28,304
Well thats also a very, very important
advantage of fusion.

343
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,113
First of all, there is no link
between fusion and nuclear proliferation.

344
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:37,347
Second of all, the concept
of fusion reaction is not based

345
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:40,514
on a chain reaction
so there is no risk of loss of control

346
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:43,970
of the reactions in the sense
there is in a fission reactor.

347
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:47,413
And last but not least, there's always
a very, very small amount

348
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:50,496
of fuel in a reactor at any given time.

349
00:21:50,952 --> 00:21:57,309
We're talking about grams of fuel present
even in a gigawatt level reactor

350
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,887
as illustrated pictorially in the movie
that you're watching on the slide

351
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:10,593
and even in the case of a major accident, 
the release of the fuel

352
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:14,733
would be in such minute amount 
that there would be no risk

353
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,909
for the population, even just around
the reactor site.

354
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,440
In summary, we have seen that fusion works
by putting together four hydrogen nuclei,

355
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:26,964
to create one helium and a lot of energy.

356
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:30,983
Fusion actually works already in nature
because it powers all the stars

357
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,875
in the universe, including our sun.

358
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:37,081
The fusion reactors on earth
will use the D-T reactions.

359
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,053
Even for the D-T reactions,
we need temperatures

360
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:43,417
at which matter exists
only in the plasma state.

361
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:46,898
The primary fuels for fusion
are deuterium and lithium

362
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,782
which are both abundant in the oceans
and the earth crust.

363
00:22:51,322 --> 00:22:54,340
So I believe fusion can provide a solution
to the energy problem

364
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,856
that's compatible
in sustainable development.
