00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,232
Welcome to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:11,433
Today we will continue our discussion
on thermonuclear fusion

3
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,099
by taking a very simple approach

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:16,138
to design the main elements
of a magnetic fusion reactor.

5
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:20,485
We have seen together what
the main elements are for the reactor,

6
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:24,740
but we're now ready to really define
the key design parameters.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,492
The design parameters result from
constraints that are coming

8
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:32,585
from engineering,
but also from nuclear physics.

9
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,745
And this will be combined with the need
to minimize the cost of electricity

10
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:41,783
to lead to a generic,
and very simple design of a reactor.

11
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:45,465
I'd like to start the discussion
by reminding ourselves

12
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:49,582
what the schematic is of a fusion reactor,
at least as we anticipate it today.

13
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:53,574
In general, we have fuels
that come in from outside

14
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:56,048
in the form of deuterium and lithium.

15
00:00:57,187 --> 00:01:00,368
They'll be injected to the system.

16
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:04,123
The deuterium
will be going into the plasma,

17
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:06,566
which will form the core of the reactor.

18
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,321
The lithium will be part of
what we call the <i>blanket</i>.

19
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:12,024
I remind you that the blanket
has two main jobs.

20
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:15,362
First it has to get the heat

21
00:01:15,362 --> 00:01:18,027
from the neutrons issued
by the fusion reactions.

22
00:01:18,887 --> 00:01:20,888
The heat will be collected
in a heat exchanger,

23
00:01:20,888 --> 00:01:24,870
and therefore will be used to generate
electricity by a steam generator.

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,748
And second, the blanket
needs to be producing tritium.

25
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,964
The tritium will be produced
by the reactions between

26
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:37,017
the neutrons issued by
the DT fusion reactions themselves,

27
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:39,937
and the lithium that
will be present in the blanket.

28
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:43,330
So the tritium, once more,
will be only present

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,320
in a closed loop within the reactor,

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,680
it will not come in from outside,
nor will it go out from the reactor.

31
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:55,469
So this is a generic scheme,

32
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,557
with the plasma forming the hot core,
of course, of the whole system,

33
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:04,862
but as we said in previous lectures,
we will concentrate in this course

34
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:07,549
mostly on the magnetic fusion approach,

35
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,333
and that is the approach in which
we confine a plasma using magnetic fields,

36
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,720
so we need to consider
that around the plasma

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,322
not only will there be a blanket,
but it will also be a magnet,

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,610
as illustrated in this 3D view
of a fusion reactor,

39
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,636
a magnet that then will produce the field
with which we'll confine the plasma.

40
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:33,868
We have said in the previous lecture
that the first reactors will operate

41
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:37,426
between what we call <i>breakeven</i>
and what we call <i>ignition</i>.

42
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:41,565
I remind you that breakeven is a situation
in which the fusion power

43
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:46,462
produced by the plasma
is exactly equal to the input power,

44
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:51,429
so the capital Q,
which is the fusion gain, is equal to 1.

45
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:56,299
Ignition is a situation in which there is
no input power from outside at all,

46
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:59,920
and so all the heating from the plasma
comes from the alpha particle produced

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,045
by the fusion reactions themselves,

48
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:04,785
so that corresponds
to a fusion gain of infinity.

49
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:09,870
In terms of the confinement quality,

50
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:16,642
we can quantify that as the product
of the density of the plasma,

51
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:20,955
and the confinement time
for the energy, n times 𝜏E,

52
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:26,908
and for the two situations we have
about 1x10²⁰ m⁻³s for breakeven,

53
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:32,496
and six times that,
that is 6x10²⁰ m⁻³s for ignition,

54
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:35,049
so we'll be in-between these two values.

55
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:39,253
Of course, together with the value n 𝜏E

56
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:43,993
we need to have a temperature
that's large enough

57
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:48,344
for the fusion reactions
to take place, typically 10-15 keV.

58
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:53,678
What are the design goals
we are considering for this exercise?

59
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:56,881
What we like to do is to minimize
the cost of the reactor,

60
00:03:56,881 --> 00:04:00,498
because that will correspond
to minimizing the cost of electricity.

61
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,685
We also like to minimize the requirements

62
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:06,967
that the design imposes
on the plasma performance.

63
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:10,224
We know it's difficult to confine
the energy and the particles

64
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:13,990
in the plasma for a long time,
so we don't want to make it more difficult

65
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,688
by imposing too large values for 𝜏E,

66
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:20,944
the confinement time for the energy.

67
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:23,470
It's also difficult
to hold the plasma stable

68
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:28,548
if the plasma has very large pressure.

69
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:31,614
That is the β of the plasma,

70
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:33,508
which is the ratio
between the plasma pressure

71
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,672
and the magnetic field pressure,

72
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:40,761
has to be as small as we can
from the engineering point of view,

73
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,821
in order not to make it
too difficult for plasma physics.

74
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,270
So these are the goals.

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,897
What we need to optimize are the size
and the geometry of the reactor,

76
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:52,504
and the value of the intensity
of the magnetic field

77
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:54,198
that will provide the confinement.

78
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,830
In a somewhat more sophisticated
part of the exercise,

79
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,125
one can also optimize the combination
of a density temperature

80
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:06,126
and confinement time for the plasma core.

81
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:12,359
And what we need to consider
in this optimization exercise,

82
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:16,654
are the constraints that come in
from physics and engineering.

83
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,806
So we'll start by looking
at the simplified geometry

84
00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:22,736
for our magnetic fusion reactor.

85
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:27,888
We'll consider a toroidal shape,
for example that of a tokamak,

86
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,763
a toroidal shape characterized
by a major radius,

87
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:34,250
that's the radius of the torus.

88
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:40,171
We have the size of the plasma, here,
indicated by <i>a</i>.

89
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:43,501
So let's draw the plasma in red.

90
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:48,086
We have the size
of the blanket and the shield

91
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:50,252
that will surround the plasma,

92
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:54,928
indicated by <i>b</i>, and here in green.

93
00:05:55,208 --> 00:06:02,312
And we have the thickness
of the magnetic field coils, or magnet,

94
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:07,486
that I represent here in purple, <i>c</i>.

95
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:12,531
And notice that I used
a circular cross-section

96
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:16,208
for the plasma and the magnets,
just to keep it simple.

97
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:19,410
The other parameters that I need
to consider are, of course,

98
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,149
the fusion power or the electrical power
that we require for the reactor,

99
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,351
the intensity of the magnetic field,

100
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:29,359
and the plasma parameters that would be
typically: the confinement time,

101
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:32,482
density, temperature and the value of β.

102
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:37,025
What are the constraints?
Let's look at them one by one.

103
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:39,675
First one from
the engineering point of view.

104
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:43,917
We can call that a constraint, it's only
the requirement for the power plant

105
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:47,378
to produce a certain amount
of energy, and power.

106
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:51,834
We may require something like
a GW of electrical power, for example.

107
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:57,264
The second constraint is
the <i>wall loading</i>, as we call it, Lw.

108
00:06:57,523 --> 00:06:59,728
That's the amount of power
we can cope with,

109
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,572
with the materials that face the plasma.

110
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:08,523
Typically that cannot exceed
something like 4 or 5MW per m²,

111
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:12,141
and that power comes from
the plasma losses and the neutrons.

112
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:16,669
We want the magnets to be superconducting,
in order for the recirculating power

113
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,866
in the plant not to be too large,
and in order, of course,

114
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:22,748
to have an optimal production
of energy from our plant.

115
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:24,783
In order for the magnets
to be superconducting,

116
00:07:24,783 --> 00:07:26,071
and to remain superconducting,

117
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,486
they must be below a certain curve

118
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:32,184
in the J, B and T space,

119
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:34,704
<i>J</i> is the current density,
<i>B</i> is the magnetic field intensity,

120
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,971
and <i>T</i> is the temperature, in this case.

121
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:41,157
So in practice, for the materials
that we'd like to use,

122
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:44,265
at least in the first
generations of reactors,

123
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:47,092
that means that at the coil position,

124
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:51,784
the maximum field cannot exceed
something like about 13T.

125
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,759
We also have constraints
from a physics side,

126
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,219
or nuclear physics in particular.

127
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:02,440
We have the value of the fusion rate,

128
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,612
determined by the fusion cross-section,

129
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:07,672
for example the value of temperature
that we're interested in,

130
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:12,017
such as 15keV,
that's a value given by nature,

131
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:15,546
and also we have the various processes

132
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:18,519
that have to happen
in the blanket and in the shield,

133
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,593
which are represented
by cross-sections, as well.

134
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:25,515
The processes are
the neutron multiplication;

135
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:32,165
we need to multiply neutrons
before we breed the tritium,

136
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:34,037
by reacting with lithium.

137
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:37,349
We need to multiply them
because of course we can't just rely

138
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,301
on a one-to-one correspondence
between the number of fusion reactions

139
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:42,566
and the number of tritons
(atoms of T) we'll produce,

140
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:45,779
because there may be losses of neutrons,
there <i>will</i> be losses of neutrons.

141
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:48,204
We need to slow them down,

142
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:54,009
and the reason for that is
that we have to breed tritium

143
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:57,373
by having the neutrons
reacting with lithium,

144
00:08:57,373 --> 00:09:02,705
and the cross-section for such a reaction
is much, much larger at low energies.

145
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:06,657
The plot on the right illustrates that:

146
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:09,983
if I take the cross-section here,

147
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:14,680
that I'm highlighting
with my blue pen in blue.

148
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,322
This is the cross-section from
breeding tritium by reacting with Li-6.

149
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,379
You can notice that
as I go down in energy,

150
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,699
this cross-section increases
very significantly.

151
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,564
In fact, I can keep going down in energy

152
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:29,469
and the cross-section
will become much, much larger,

153
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:32,335
So I need to slow down
the neutrons in order to arrive

154
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:36,393
at an optimal breeding of the tritium.

155
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:41,199
The other thing I notice in this plot,
I'd like to remind you of that,

156
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:46,782
is that if I consider
the breeding reaction with Li-7,

157
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,835
which is this cross-section,

158
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,739
the value of the cross-section
is much, much lower than for Li-6,

159
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:57,632
so we'll only consider Li-6,
and we in fact probably don't even need

160
00:09:57,632 --> 00:10:03,470
to enrich lithium in the actual
production of the blanket,

161
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,839
because of such a huge difference
between the two cross-sections.

162
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,907
So once we have slowed down the neutrons,
--of course we need to do it in breeding,

163
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:17,222
but we don't have to forget that we need
to shield the superconducting coils,

164
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:20,089
and in fact the rest of the plant,
and the rest of the environment,

165
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:24,345
from the neutrons
issued by the nuclear reactions.

166
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:25,665
So these are the four jobs

167
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:30,144
that the blanket and shield elements
need to perform.

168
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:35,663
Let's look at them one-by-one,
and also in a quantitative way,

169
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:39,347
to evaluate the thickness
that we need for each process.

170
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:44,625
Here again I put the schematic view
of the blanket and shield,

171
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:48,605
the different layers that do
the different tasks are indicated,

172
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:50,810
but I'd like to underline
that in practice, of course,

173
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,728
and in engineering design
for actual reactors,

174
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:56,954
the different layers would be combined.

175
00:10:57,512 --> 00:10:59,923
So the thickness that's needed
for each process,

176
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:03,483
as in fact in all collisional processes,

177
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:06,648
can be evaluated by 1 over the number density

178
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:10,853
of the target that provides the process,

179
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,349
times the cross section that represents

180
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:14,764
the probability of occurrence
of that process.

181
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:20,358
The first process we need to evaluate
is the neutron multiplication.

182
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:23,273
We can take the example of beryllium (Be),

183
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:26,969
beryllium is a neutron multiplier
that's used in a variety of applications.

184
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,784
So the thickness that we need
for this process

185
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:31,784
is given by 1 over the density
of beryllium,

186
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:35,012
times the cross-section
that represents this process.

187
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:38,738
So if we take the values
for the density and the cross-section,

188
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:43,148
we come out with a relatively
small thickness of about 13 cm.

189
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,596
As we said before,
we need to slow down the neutrons

190
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:50,171
in order for the breeding
to be more efficient,

191
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:55,494
so we can use lithium itself,
not only for breeding tritium,

192
00:11:55,494 --> 00:11:59,099
but also for slowing down neutrons,
so we can evaluate

193
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:02,279
the length with which this
slowing-down process will take place

194
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,267
as one over the density of the lithium,

195
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:07,365
times the slowing-down cross-section,

196
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:13,099
which is about one barn,
or 10⁻²⁸ square meters.

197
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:18,607
So that is corresponding to about 20 cm,

198
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,942
a value that's not insignificant,

199
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:26,714
but again not unrealistically mountable

200
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:30,406
in a blanket, in a practical reactor.

201
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:35,258
Third process is the breeding of tritium,
finally, with slowed-down neutrons,

202
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:37,726
so suppose we are able
to go down to room temperature,

203
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:41,593
which is about one-fortieth of an eV,

204
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:44,759
and here I consider lithium
in its natural composition,

205
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,949
so I don't enrich
the lithium blanket with Li-6.

206
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:51,631
So Li-6 is only 7.5%,

207
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:55,925
so the thickness
is calculated in the usual way,

208
00:12:55,925 --> 00:13:01,984
one over the density of Li-6
times the breeding cross-section,

209
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:06,418
and for the density of Li-6 I then,
I take the density of lithium

210
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,224
times 6 itself, as if it was pure,

211
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:14,165
times the isotopic fraction,
so that's 7.5%.

212
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,641
But as said
a couple of times already,

213
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:22,023
but now underlined
by the quantitative factors here,

214
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:29,003
the cross-section for the breeding
is so large at these room temperatures

215
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:34,633
that even 7.5% of Li-6

216
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:38,718
doesn't add a significant
thickness to my blanket

217
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:43,382
for the tritium breeding to take place,
so that's only about .2 cm.

218
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:48,920
So the key here is that the breeding
is actually relatively easy,

219
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:52,576
as long as we have slowed down
the neutrons significantly.

220
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:55,098
Finally, we need to shield the coils

221
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:58,938
and the rest of the plant
from the neutrons,

222
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:05,987
and that in fact is the task that imposes
the largest of the thicknesses.

223
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,616
For example, let's say we want
to reduce the flux by a factor of 100,

224
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,866
so we only allow 1% of the neutrons
issued by fusion reactions

225
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:17,212
to arrive to the coil surfaces,

226
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:23,626
so the intensity of the neutron flux
is represented by <i>I</i> here,

227
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:27,407
is going down exponentially
with the distance,

228
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:31,241
and the characteristic length
in the exponent

229
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:35,609
is a combination of different processes,
but we can assume is dominated

230
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,534
by the slowing-down process,
as we have seen before.

231
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:40,824
So if you take that length,

232
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:45,045
and we impose that the intensity
goes down by a factor 100,

233
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:51,286
we get the shielding thickness
which is the log, or natural log

234
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:55,495
of 100 times the slowing-down thickness
we calculated before,

235
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,110
that's about 1 meter,
so really that's the dominant part

236
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,812
of the thickness that we have found

237
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:05,137
in this evaluation of the need for
the blanket and shield

238
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,852
to do all the four tasks
that they are required to do in a reactor.

239
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:14,133
The total thickness is therefore b,
equal to the thickness required

240
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:18,216
for multiplying neutrons,
only a few centimeters,

241
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:22,363
the thickness required
to slow down neutrons

242
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:25,974
that's significant, it's about 20 cm.

243
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:31,510
The thickness needed to breed tritium
with the slowed-down neutrons,

244
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,972
and that's almost negligible,
it's a fraction of a centimeter,

245
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:39,249
and the thickness needed
to shield the coils from the neutron flux,

246
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:40,994
and that, in fact, is the dominant factor.

247
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:45,490
So we get about 1.35 m of thickness
for the blanket and shield.

248
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:49,339
However, considering again that
the different layers are combined,

249
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,396
and that this exercise aims
at providing only a rough estimate,

250
00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:57,089
we can assume a slightly lower value,
say of about 1.2 meters.

251
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:02,667
We can now move to the minimization
of the cost of electricity,

252
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:06,571
and we notice that the cost of electricity
in a fusion power plant

253
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:10,844
will be proportional
to the capital cost for the reactor.

254
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:14,111
That's similar to the situation
of fission plants, in fact,

255
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,742
where the operational costs
and the costs of the fuels

256
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:22,656
are much lower than the capital investment
in building the reactor.

257
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:25,510
So when we want to minimize
the cost of electricity

258
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,528
we can minimize the reactor cost.

259
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,243
Of course we have to minimize
the reactor cost per unit power,

260
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:34,999
but in a complex system
that is actually corresponding

261
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,717
to minimizing the volume
of the complex systems

262
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:39,920
divided by the unit power.

263
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,750
So let's evaluate that.

264
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:46,134
The volume of the complex system per power

265
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,951
is given by the volume of everything
in my reactor except the plasma,

266
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:55,661
because the plasma is essentially
only very few particles

267
00:16:55,661 --> 00:17:00,521
that we put in a vacuum,
and they will be ionized,

268
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,071
so it is not something we build
with high technology.

269
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,297
So I need to evaluate the volume

270
00:17:08,297 --> 00:17:11,183
of the system overall,

271
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:13,172
minus the volume of the plasma.

272
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:20,064
So that's 2𝜋R₀, which is
the circumference of the torus,

273
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:24,371
times 𝜋, times [(a + b + c)² - a²]

274
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:27,223
and of course we need to divide that
by the electrical power

275
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:31,318
produced by the reactor.
And the electrical power is equal to...

276
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:38,181
to 1/4, times the efficiency (ηt) with which

277
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:41,252
we transform fusion power
into electricity,

278
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:45,901
times the energy produced
in each reaction,

279
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:48,415
so that's the energy of the alphas (Eα),
the energy of the neutrons (En),

280
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:53,381
and the energy produced in the tritium
breeding reaction in the blanket (Eli),

281
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:59,334
with Li-6, times n²,

282
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:03,073
the density squared,
the fusion reaction rate (<σv>DT),

283
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:06,105
and, of course, the plasma volume.

284
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:08,915
Now we use the constraint
on the wall loading

285
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:12,772
to get the value of the major radius R₀

286
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:19,219
And the way to use that is to take
the maximum wall loading we can accept,

287
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,915
times the area of the plasma,

288
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:26,873
and that should be equal to
the power in the plasma.

289
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,846
Here I only take the neutron power,

290
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:33,484
because I consider that as
the only unavoidable part

291
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:36,115
of the power that will go onto the wall,

292
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,730
and of course it's an assumption
to simplify the calculations.

293
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:45,359
Now we know that the neutron power
is equal to the fusion power,

294
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,036
which is the electrical power
produced by the plant,

295
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:52,230
divided by the efficiency
with which the fusion power

296
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,996
is transforming into electricity,

297
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:57,576
times the fraction of the energy
in each reaction

298
00:18:57,576 --> 00:19:00,074
that's associated with the neutrons,

299
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:07,028
so En divided by E𝛼 + En + Eli .

300
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:10,203
So let's go on with the evaluation

301
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:13,939
of the product of the maximum
wall loading times the surface.

302
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,751
Again, the maximum wall loading
times 2𝜋a 2𝜋R₀

303
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:28,571
which is the surface of the plasma,
is equal to the neutron power.

304
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,976
So we can extract R₀

305
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:40,163
So R₀ is P over ηt

306
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:43,719
times the fraction of the energy
that's in the neutrons,

307
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:50,039
divided by 4𝜋² times
the radius of the plasma,

308
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,818
times the maximum wall loading
we can cope with.

309
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:57,172
Now these are numbers that we know,

310
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:02,352
and we can assume a value
for the thermal efficiency ηt,

311
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:06,165
let's say we take 40% for ηt,

312
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:10,301
so we get to value for R₀

313
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:13,755
the major radius of the plasma,
which is about .04,

314
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,761
times the electrical power of the plant,

315
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:18,798
divided by the radius of the plasma,

316
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:22,281
and the maximum wall loading
that we can tolerate.

317
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:25,515
We can now insert the value
of R₀ we have just found,

318
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,064
in the ratio we need to minimize,

319
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:30,610
that is the ratio between
the volume and the power.

320
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:40,959
So this ratio is now 2𝜋²
divided by the power,

321
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:43,188
times the geometrical factor,

322
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,372
times R₀ expressed

323
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:52,302
as .04 PE / ( a Lw^max).

324
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:55,441
If I just put the constants together,

325
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:58,579
I get

326
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:02,632
.8 ( (a + b + c)² - a²)

327
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:05,873
divided by ( a Lw^max),

328
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:11,407
and I notice that
the electrical power, PE,

329
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,462
has been simplified.

330
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,036
This is the quantity to minimize,

331
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:22,474
and I notice that a key parameter
in the whole exercise

332
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:26,524
is and will be the maximum wall loading,

333
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:29,453
so it's a very simple minimization,
of course, in terms

334
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:33,654
of the maximum wall loading -
The more wall loading we tolerate,

335
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:37,698
the better off we will be
with the reactor design,

336
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:42,588
in the sense that we'll be
automatically minimizing the volume

337
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:46,215
of the complex system, that is
the cost per unit power.

338
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:48,497
Now we are ready to continue
with the determination

339
00:21:48,497 --> 00:21:52,515
of the parameters of the reactor,
because b we know,

340
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:57,214
b is determined already
from the blanket physics.

341
00:21:57,636 --> 00:22:00,772
We need to find now a and c,

342
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:06,368
that is the size of the plasma,
and the size of the magnet.

343
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:09,897
In terms of the thickness of the magnet,

344
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:13,548
here I remind you
what we're talking about,

345
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:17,484
in a more realistic situation
than our schematic drawing.

346
00:22:17,484 --> 00:22:22,839
This in fact is the magnet
designed for ITER,

347
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:28,182
so the thickness is really
the term c here.

348
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:33,292
We would like that to be minimum,
but we would like it to be compatible

349
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:38,385
with the maximum allowed stress
on the structure of the magnet itself,

350
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:41,182
stress that comes from the JxB force.

351
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:45,158
In the magnet, of course
there will be current, and that will flow,

352
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:49,989
and this current will produce
a magnetic field

353
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:53,521
with which it will interact

354
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:56,589
to produce a JxB force.

355
00:22:56,589 --> 00:22:59,529
This is the force that
is possible for the stress.

356
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:03,048
If we do a simple calculation,
which we don't report here,

357
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,952
using only the tensile part of the stress,

358
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:10,768
we obtain a value of c, indicated here,

359
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:16,212
related to a parameter 𝛼,
and related to a and b,

360
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:20,876
so related to the other two geometrical
parameters we discussed already.

361
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:25,430
The parameter 𝛼 contains, essentially,

362
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,840
the intensity of the field
at the coil, squared,

363
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,821
divided by the maximum stress
that we can tolerate (σ_max)

364
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:35,348
for the integrity of the coil itself.

365
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:40,974
Now we can actually choose
the intensity of the field at the coil,

366
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:45,474
just observing that it is difficult
for the plasma to reach high β,

367
00:23:46,616 --> 00:23:50,987
so if we don't want to make it
too difficult for the plasma side,

368
00:23:50,987 --> 00:23:53,832
we need to take the maximum field
we can have at the coil,

369
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,265
so the pressure for the plasma,

370
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:01,434
it will be easier to have that high enough

371
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:04,721
without violating
stability limits, for example,

372
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:07,894
because that will correspond
to large values of β.

373
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:11,738
So we take the maximum field
at the coil that we can have

374
00:24:11,738 --> 00:24:14,003
in order for the coil
to remain superconducting,

375
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:17,932
as we said before, that's about 13 T,

376
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:21,657
at least in the magnets
that we can consider today.

377
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:26,224
So we take a maximum value for Bcoil.

378
00:24:27,762 --> 00:24:31,138
We know that typically the maximum stress

379
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,798
we can tolerate
is of the order of 200 MPa,

380
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:36,998
so we insert that
into the expression for 𝛼,

381
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:39,840
and we get a value of 𝛼 that's about .1

382
00:24:40,442 --> 00:24:41,961
So with that we calculate c,

383
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:49,135
and that gives c = .22 (a + b)

384
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:54,573
So we have determined b
from blanket physics,

385
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:59,997
we have expressed c in terms of a and b

386
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:03,373
from considerations on the magnet,

387
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:07,979
now we go back to our minimization
of the cost of electricity to evaluate a.

388
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:10,994
We write again the quantity
we want to minimize,

389
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:14,294
that's the volume of the complex
system divided by the power,

390
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:19,325
so we have written exactly what
we have found before,

391
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:24,140
except that instead of a c,
we have put what we had just derived

392
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,665
for the magnet thickness,
that is .22(a + b).

393
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:33,077
And by putting the numbers,
and developing the square,

394
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:37,961
we get approximately .4 divided by a
times the maximum wall loading,

395
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:42,987
times (a² + 6ab + 3b²)

396
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,730
Just divide by a,

397
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:51,233
and we obtain the very simple expression,
in terms of a and b.

398
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:57,571
We define the function of a
as f(a) = a + 6b + 3b²/a

399
00:25:57,571 --> 00:26:00,002
that is the parenthesis we have here,

400
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:02,438
because that is the function
we need to minimize.

401
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:07,020
So in a minimum of f(a) is what we want.

402
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,426
That's a trivial calculation,

403
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:16,312
so it's 1- 3b²/a²,
and that has to be equal to 0,

404
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:23,527
which gives that a has to be equal
to the square root of 3, times b.

405
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:29,896
So this minimization tells us
what the value of a should be,

406
00:26:29,896 --> 00:26:32,536
in terms of the value of b.

407
00:26:33,581 --> 00:26:39,664
c we had already, it's .22(a + b),

408
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:48,622
so that's .22 times the square root
of 3 plus 1, times b, which is about .6b

409
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:52,439
So we have everything now,
and we can put the numbers.

410
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:55,862
b is equal to about 1.2 meters,

411
00:26:57,726 --> 00:26:59,285
blanket thickness.

412
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:05,038
a is about 2 meters,
a little more, 2.1 meters.

413
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:07,759
That's the radius of the plasma.

414
00:27:08,265 --> 00:27:12,949
c, the thickness of the magnet,
is about .7 meters.

415
00:27:15,124 --> 00:27:19,736
We are now ready to put down numbers
for the resulting reactor geometry,

416
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:22,844
and even the plasma parameters,
the main plasma parameters.

417
00:27:23,806 --> 00:27:28,013
Major radius R₀ = .04

418
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:31,863
times the electrical power
that we want,

419
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:35,115
divided by the plasma radius,
that we now know,

420
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:38,766
and also divided by
the maximum wall loading.

421
00:27:39,132 --> 00:27:42,008
Let's take two numbers,
for these two parameters.

422
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:45,471
Let's take 1GW for the electrical power,

423
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:47,369
as we said at the beginning,

424
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:52,987
and let's take 4.5 MW per square meter
for the maximum wall loading.

425
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:59,432
So that will allow us
to calculate the value

426
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:03,282
of the major radius
of our plant, or tokamak.

427
00:28:08,473 --> 00:28:13,140
So we have 1GW on the top,

428
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,192
4.5 MW per square meter at the bottom,

429
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:19,846
2.1 meters, which is
the value of a we found before,

430
00:28:19,846 --> 00:28:26,205
and a resullt is slightly
more than four meters.

431
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:30,291
We can therefore evaluate
the plasma surface,

432
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:35,577
that's 4𝜋²R₀a

433
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:40,349
and that's about 350 m².

434
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,470
It's interesting also
to evaluate the plasma volume,

435
00:28:47,547 --> 00:28:55,306
it's 2𝜋R₀ times 𝜋a²,
that's about 365 m³.

436
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:59,291
So what's the power density
in such plasma?

437
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:04,278
That's the power in the alphas,
plus the power in the neutrons,

438
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:06,436
divided by the volume.

439
00:29:06,436 --> 00:29:12,668
If I put in the numbers I obtain
something like 6 MW per m³.

440
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:15,577
The next parameter we'd like to calculate,

441
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:19,912
it's a key parameter
for plasma physics, that is β.

442
00:29:19,912 --> 00:29:23,848
But for that we need the value
of the magnetic field

443
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:28,525
in the plasma, which I call B₀

444
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:33,992
that's B at the center of the plasma,

445
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:39,372
which is the value of the radial position
equal to the major radius.

446
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:45,733
How do I calculate that?
I know that the field scales as 1/R,

447
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,763
and I also know that the field at the coil

448
00:29:49,763 --> 00:29:53,813
has its maximum value
that we took of about 13T.

449
00:29:56,473 --> 00:30:00,633
So we can just evaluate B₀

450
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:06,480
as the Bmax times the radius

451
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,381
at which I have my coil,
divided by the radius of the torus,

452
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:15,543
that's about 2.7T.

453
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:18,461
If I just represent
what we've done graphically,

454
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,445
we know the field scales as 1/R,

455
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:29,527
we know the field at the coil,

456
00:30:30,258 --> 00:30:36,643
the radius of the coil,
position of the coil is R₀- (a + b),

457
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:43,190
and we calculate the value of the field,

458
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,677
which we call B₀ at R₀.

459
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:50,631
If I go on the layout of the tokamak,

460
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:56,169
that implies knowing
the field here at the coil,

461
00:30:58,576 --> 00:31:01,327
and going down as 1/R,

462
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:06,352
and finding B₀ where
the center of the plasma is.

463
00:31:06,554 --> 00:31:11,232
So with this value of 2.7T
we can evaluate β

464
00:31:11,232 --> 00:31:14,591
by assuming a confinement time
of about two seconds,

465
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:18,207
density of about 10²⁰ per m³,

466
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:20,486
and a temperature of about 15 keV.

467
00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:27,294
β is equal to nT divided by B₀²/2μ₀

468
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:32,791
and if I put the numbers,
I get a value of about 8%.

469
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:36,175
In summary, we have seen together,

470
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:39,028
that a minimization
of the cost of a reactor,

471
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:43,688
together with constraints that come
from nuclear physics and engineering,

472
00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:46,423
can lead, even in a very simple approach,

473
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:50,486
to a general definition
of magnetic fusion reactor design

474
00:31:50,486 --> 00:31:56,364
that is capable of producing
about a 1GW of electrical power.

475
00:31:56,858 --> 00:31:59,647
We noticed together
that one of the key parameters,

476
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:03,855
perhaps the most important parameters,
is the wall loading we can tolerate,

477
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,762
that is the maximum amount
of power per square meter

478
00:32:06,762 --> 00:32:10,199
that the surfaces
that see the plasma first

479
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,333
can tolerate without being destroyed.

480
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:18,048
We have defined together
the reactor geometry,

481
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:20,534
and even the plasma parameters,
or the main plasma parameters

482
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:22,252
that the reactor needs to have.

483
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:28,043
We noticed that the size of the reactor
cannot be that small,

484
00:32:28,043 --> 00:32:30,672
so we can't really have a tabletop reactor

485
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:33,168
if we want the reactor
to be self-sufficient

486
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,007
in terms of the production of tritium,

487
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:37,343
and that size is dictated
by the size of the blanket,

488
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:40,643
we found something like 1.2 m.

489
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:45,612
So for the challenges that
this design poses to the plasma,

490
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:48,250
we have summarized them
in a few parameters.

491
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:55,382
We need to have a fusion plasma of about
10²⁰ per m³ of density that's produced.

492
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:58,995
It has to be heated up to about 15KeV.

493
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:01,725
It has to be confined for long enough,

494
00:33:02,245 --> 00:33:05,056
about a couple of seconds
of confinement time for the energy,

495
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:10,080
and it has to be maintained stable,
with the plasma β, that is a ratio

496
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,424
of the plasma pressure to
the magnetic field pressure of about 8%.

497
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,758
These are the challenges
that plasma physics need to face

498
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:21,063
in order for this reactor to comply with
the engineering and physics constraints,

499
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:25,773
and produce a significant amount
of fusion power and electrical power.
