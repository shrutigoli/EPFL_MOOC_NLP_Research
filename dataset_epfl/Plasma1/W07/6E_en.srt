00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:09,051
Welcome to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,870
In the last lecture,
we have derived together

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,216
a very simple design of a fusion reactor

4
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:15,253
based on the magnetic
confinement approach.

5
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:16,951
We have seen that,

6
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:21,188
in our minimization of the cost
and maximization of the output power,

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,080
one key parameter was standing out,

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,724
and that was the wall loading
that we can tolerate.

9
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:32,426
That is, the maximum power
that the plasma-facing walls can withstand

10
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:33,762
before being damaged.

11
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:35,868
That's no wonder because, of course,

12
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:37,566
what we're trying to do
in a fusion reactor

13
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:42,279
is to trap matter that's hotter
than at the surface of the sun

14
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:46,806
into a material object,
which is the reactor itself.

15
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,656
Today we will explore,
a little bit, this question

16
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:54,350
of the interaction between the plasma
and the surrounding walls in the reactor

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,805
by looking at the requirements
of the reactor first wall,

18
00:00:57,805 --> 00:01:01,293
by looking at the concepts
of limiters and divertors,

19
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:05,326
by defining the scrape off layer
and seeing what its characteristics are,

20
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:10,690
by looking at the advantages
of the divertor concept,

21
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,810
and why we are actually pursuing that
as a possible solution.

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,907
We will also explore
what the plasma facing materials are

23
00:01:18,907 --> 00:01:21,323
that are foreseen for ITER,

24
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:25,586
and what the challenges are that remain
for the divertors to be optimized.

25
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:29,279
And in doing that, we'll illustrate
a few ideas on how to go forward,

26
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:32,725
and propose innovative
divertor configurations.

27
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:37,074
First of all, the reactor first wall
has to withstand

28
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:39,377
very large heat fluxes on the material.

29
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:44,343
Has to withstand, in a sense,
that erosion has to be very limited

30
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:46,156
and there has to be no melting.

31
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:51,695
These pictures give you an idea
of what the fusion reactor compares to.

32
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:59,200
We have seen that we to have about 5, say,
over to 10 MW per m² in the reactor.

33
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:02,524
What object can we compare that to?

34
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:06,922
In the pictures here, we see objects
that are normally subject

35
00:02:06,922 --> 00:02:11,001
to power fluxes of the order
of a megawatt per m²:

36
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,942
so much less than the fusion reactor.

37
00:02:12,942 --> 00:02:15,606
That is the case of a fission reactor;

38
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:18,466
that is the case of a large turbine;

39
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:23,336
and that is the case of a spacecraft
re-entering the atmosphere.

40
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:26,949
We go to a different, kind of,
order of magnitude,

41
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:29,126
and that's even more difficult
than the fusion reactor,

42
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:33,209
when we go to the surfaces
that are exposed to fluxes

43
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,932
of the order of 80 MW per m²
when a rocket departs.

44
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,449
The reactor first wall
has to keep the plasma pure.

45
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:46,504
That is very important,
for two reasons.

46
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:48,604
If we inject impurities
into the plasma volume,

47
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:51,675
we have dilution of the plasma fuels.

48
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:56,043
That is, we replace the ions
with which we want to achieve fusion

49
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,243
by ions that don't achieve
any result for us.

50
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,579
And also, if we inject impurities
in the plasma,

51
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:07,963
they radiate mainly by line radiation,
if impurities are not fully ionized,

52
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:09,796
or by bremsstrahlung radiation.

53
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:12,485
And as we have seen together,

54
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:16,811
the bremsstrahlung radiation
depends on the charge

55
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:20,200
and atomic number of the impurity.

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,505
So if we look at the curve that shows
the minimum ignition temperature

57
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:29,639
as a function
of the impurity concentration,

58
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,416
we can see that that temperature,
which is calculated here

59
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,776
just using the bremsstrahlung
as a loss channel

60
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:39,736
-- we know this is an optimistic view --
but, even with that,

61
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:43,818
the impurity concentration influences
that minimum temperature,

62
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:47,426
of course making it-
going up, as the concentration goes up.

63
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:52,415
But even more importantly, we notice here
that that curve changes dramatically

64
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:56,138
as you go from low Z impurities
-- this is the case of carbon --

65
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:58,485
to high Z, such as iron and molybdenum.

66
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:02,680
So you have to avoid the injection
of impurities in the core,

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,983
in particular, of high Z impurities.

68
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:11,156
The reactor first wall has to, also,
minimize the retention of tritium.

69
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:14,543
Tritium is co-deposited with carbon,

70
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:18,528
if we are in the presence
of a carbon-based wall,

71
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,264
and stays there.

72
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:22,988
So that's, of course, unacceptable
for a fusion reactor.

73
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:26,359
In this pictorial view on the left,

74
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:30,374
we see the mechanism with which
the tritium is trapped on the surfaces,

75
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:34,078
and, more importantly,
on the right-hand side here,

76
00:04:34,078 --> 00:04:38,934
we see the retained amount
of tritium in a wall

77
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:43,199
as a function of time
of plasma, in a sense.

78
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,322
This is the case of ITER.

79
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:48,486
Maybe you represent it
as a function of time for the plasma,

80
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:53,711
or as a function of these charges in ITER
taken of a duration of 400 seconds.

81
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:57,862
And what we see here
is that we have a level

82
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:02,998
which we cannot overcome,
which is 700 grams.

83
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:06,816
That's the level that we can afford having
of tritium, of course,

84
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:10,744
trapped in the wall of the reactor;
we cannot go above that.

85
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:14,593
But, actually, if we have
an all-carbon-based wall,

86
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:18,582
we do go above that,
and we do go above that quite quickly,

87
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:21,933
only after a few hundreds
of ITER discharges.

88
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,843
So that's not possible.

89
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:27,851
So we need to go
to the other options here.

90
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:30,150
In particular, if we look
at the red stripe here,

91
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,482
that indicates the situation in which
we have materials

92
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:36,302
that all are tungsten-based.

93
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:40,337
And with these materials,
we never go above that level,

94
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:45,013
even if we have 25,000 discharges
of ITER, at 400 seconds.

95
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:48,092
So that's a situation that's compatible
with the requirements

96
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:51,219
for the inventory of tritium
in the plasma walls.

97
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:53,867
So to briefly recap:

98
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:58,152
we have seen that the wall
has to withstand large heat fluxes;

99
00:05:58,152 --> 00:06:01,928
and, of course, to exhaust
both the fusion produced

100
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,962
and the external heating power;

101
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:07,545
it has to keep the plasma pure,
and it has to minimize tritium retention.

102
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:09,754
There are other constraints:

103
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:12,565
the walls must minimize
production of dust,

104
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:15,497
which can create a very large perturbation
at the edge of the plasma,

105
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:17,581
and therefore affect
the fusion performance.

106
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:22,235
It has to be compatible with providing
the containment for vacuum,

107
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,860
and it has to be compatible
with fueling the plasma

108
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,704
-- that is, injecting the particles
that need to be forming the plasma fuels,

109
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:31,058
once they're ionized.

110
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:35,464
And finally, it has to, also, contribute
to pumping the helium ashes.

111
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:39,007
This is the helium that has been produced
by the fusion reaction.

112
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:42,073
It has given, in the form of α particles,
of course, its energy

113
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:43,811
to the fuel ions themselves.

114
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:46,166
So this is something
that we need to take out,

115
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,978
once it has given its energy.

116
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,273
Currently, there are
two possible configurations

117
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:57,022
for the part of the plasma
that is close to the wall:

118
00:06:57,022 --> 00:06:59,495
what we call the <i>limiter</i>,
and what we call the <i>divertor</i>.

119
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:08,656
The question is that you have to define
very well a specific area of the walls

120
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:10,830
that is in direct contact with the plasma.

121
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,929
That area is the one that will have
to take the power

122
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:17,565
that's carried by the particles
issued from the plasma,

123
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:21,992
and that's not being radiated
before it arrives at the wall.

124
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:25,674
So the limiter configuration
is shown on the left.

125
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:31,660
We have a set of, in this case,
concentric field lines.

126
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,958
They represent the flux surfaces
in the plasma.

127
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:39,769
And the outer part of them
intercepts a material surface.

128
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:42,386
This is just, of course,
an abstract representation,

129
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:44,760
but it's superimposed
on an actual realization

130
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,993
of a limiter configuration, which is
in the Tore Supra tokamak in France.

131
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:51,754
The limiter is quite large, in this case,

132
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:58,150
so the portion of the plasma
that's all the way to the outside

133
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,512
actually directly touches
this material surface.

134
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:05,099
So the plasma is <i>limited</i>, we say,
on that material surface.

135
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:08,793
On the right-hand side, we have
a picture of JET,

136
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:11,696
which is an example of a tokamak
that has a divertor.

137
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:17,429
A divertor is a magnetic configuration
that provides a null point here

138
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,926
for the poloidal field.

139
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:23,214
We call this the <i>X-point</i>,

140
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:27,307
because, of course, it can be seen
as an X figure.

141
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:31,341
And by doing that,
we have, basically, a separation

142
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:37,259
between the flux surfaces inside
that are not touching any material surface

143
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,309
and the lines that go around,

144
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,817
that now are the only ones
that actually touch a material surface.

145
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,704
So we really have
a much clearer separation

146
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:47,916
between confined core
and edge of the plasma.

147
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,888
The X-point, of course,
needs to be achieved

148
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:53,009
with specific magnetic coils.

149
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:55,016
In the case of JET,
they are inside the vessel;

150
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:57,154
in the case of ITER,
they will be outside the vessel.

151
00:08:57,154 --> 00:09:00,908
And they have to provide, again,
a null point for the poloidal field

152
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,604
which is the X-point.

153
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:07,829
In this image, we also see
the light emitted by the plasma

154
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:10,396
when it's run in the configuration
of an X-point.

155
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:15,551
And you can see, at the bottom here,
we have a so-called divertor chamber

156
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:21,033
which is corresponding to this region,
these two regions here, on the picture.

157
00:09:23,473 --> 00:09:27,406
Let's consider, now, what we call
the <i>scrape off layer</i>, or SOL.

158
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:28,935
This is the outer layer of the plasma

159
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,388
that's in direct contact
with the material wall.

160
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:33,412
It plays a very important role,

161
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:39,224
because it determines, really, the effect
of the plasma on the wall itself,

162
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:43,887
and it also has influences on the plasma
core behavior, in some circumstances.

163
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:47,076
The thickness of the SOL results
from a balance

164
00:09:47,076 --> 00:09:49,605
between cross-field and parallel dynamics.

165
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:53,444
And we can estimate that for a simple case
of a limiter configuration,

166
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:54,736
in a circular plasma.

167
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:58,032
So this is the sketch
I'd like to concentrate on.

168
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:02,214
This orange stripe
is my scrape off layer.

169
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:07,418
It will touch the material surface,

170
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:10,512
and that's where the parallel flow
will play a role

171
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:14,940
in the sense that the flow
along the poloidal field lines

172
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,716
will actually impinge
on the limiter there.

173
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,968
The thickness of that channel,
if you like, is 𝐿sol,

174
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:25,800
so my thickness of the SOL-

175
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,256
of this scrape off layer
that I would like to estimate.

176
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,452
And that has to be compensated
-- that has to be fed, in a sense --

177
00:10:31,452 --> 00:10:38,107
by the perpendicular flux
coming from the simple Fick's law.

178
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:43,111
So that's the cross-field transport
due to the gradient of the density

179
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:45,730
times a diffusion coefficient, 𝐷.

180
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,842
So let me do the simple calculations.

181
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:51,948
So I consider the flux, 𝚪ᵣ ,

182
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:55,008
times the surface
over which it takes place,

183
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:58,704
which is 2πa 2πR₀

184
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:03,550
That has to be equal to 2 times...

185
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,573
-- and the factor of 2
comes from the fact

186
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:07,545
that we're coming from both sides --

187
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:15,965
2 n cs Lsol 2πR₀

188
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:23,440
because (Lsol 2πR₀) is my surface for
the calculation of this parallel flux.

189
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,609
I'd like to make
a couple of comments here.

190
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:29,536
First, I remind you that cs
is the ion sound speed.

191
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:32,759
As you have seen in a previous lecture,

192
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,227
this is the characteristic speed
with which the ions move

193
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,528
to a material surface
that faces the plasma.

194
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:39,906
They do that under the influence

195
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:42,221
of a nonlinear electrostatic
potential structure,

196
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:43,884
which we call the <i>sheath</i>,

197
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:46,999
that the plasma itself develops
to maintain quasi-neutrality.

198
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,950
Second, I draw your attention to the fact

199
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,827
that I have significantly
simplified this formula.

200
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,986
I say that the plasma is outflowing

201
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:57,557
at the velocity of the order of cs
to the vessel wall.

202
00:11:57,557 --> 00:12:01,684
In reality, the plasma is flowing at cs
in a direction along the magnetic field.

203
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:04,848
So in the calculation, in principle,

204
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,157
while we need to introduce the angle
of a magnetic field

205
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:09,439
that goes back to the wall, say ⍺,

206
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:13,406
and write that the outflow velocity
is cs sin ⍺.

207
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:18,147
However, in this estimate of the order
of magnitude of the SOL width,

208
00:12:18,147 --> 00:12:22,000
we neglect this, taking a value
of the sin ⍺ order 1.

209
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,055
So I simplify the factors
that are identical

210
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:27,532
on the left and on the right,

211
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:34,825
and I write πaD, times the gradient of
the density in the radial direction

212
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:38,571
is equal to (n cs) times the thickness
of the scrape off layer.

213
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:42,715
But the gradient in the radial
direction can be estimated

214
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:45,750
simply just like the density
over the scale length

215
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,036
over the density variation: Lsol

216
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,539
So the density is assumed vary
over a scale length

217
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:58,002
that corresponds to the thickness
of the scrape off layer itself.

218
00:12:58,002 --> 00:12:59,225
So we can write...

219
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:07,859
πa D (n / Lsol)

220
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:12,961
and that's approximately equal
to n cs Lsol

221
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:16,426
So the density goes away,

222
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:19,968
and we can estimate the thickness
of the scrape off layer.

223
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:27,642
which is the square root
of πa D/cs.

224
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:30,703
We can take typical numbers,
for example, for ITER,

225
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:34,902
with an empirical value for D,
the particle diffusion coefficient,

226
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:37,444
typically of the order
of 1 m² per second,

227
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:40,349
and come up with something
of the order of a centimeter.

228
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:41,683
So that's very small.

229
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,704
That means that we have a very 
thin layer around the plasma

230
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,955
that is in direct contact
with the material wall,

231
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:52,752
and that thin layer will carry
a lot of power to a very small surface.

232
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:57,033
Let's look specifically at the advantages
of divertor concept,

233
00:13:57,033 --> 00:14:00,066
which is the concept
that we are now following and using

234
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:02,965
for all present and future devices
we have in mind.

235
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:07,403
First of all, there's a very long
connection length parallel to B,

236
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,737
and that is the length,
the effective length,

237
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:11,120
of the field lines,

238
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,544
that the particles see
as they approach the X-point.

239
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:20,438
So if we represent the X-point,
as we have done before

240
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:23,588
in a 2-D configuration,
that's poloidal cut,

241
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:28,069
I need to try and draw the 3-D field lines
that correspond to that.

242
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:32,910
The field lines will start to go around,
and around, and around,

243
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,905
for a long distance,
because of the toroidal field,

244
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:41,011
before they can actually reach the target.

245
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:45,848
So for ITER, for example, that length
is about 150 meters.

246
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:52,448
The fact that it is so long
gives us, in a sense, a lot of time

247
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:57,247
to reduce the power flux
that arrives to the target.

248
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:03,633
That also enables me to have gradient
of temperature in the parallel direction.

249
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:07,602
So if I go down this way, say,

250
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:12,140
and I plot, say,
the temperature in this axis,

251
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,594
the temperature will not be uniform,
but it actually will go down.

252
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:19,486
So that means, as I approach
the target place,

253
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,323
I can have a colder and colder plasma.

254
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:27,142
And I will be able,
in a well-designed configuration,

255
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:30,101
to have pretty low temperature
in the divertor chamber,

256
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,720
of the order of only a few eVs,

257
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,915
although I have thermonuclear
temperatures in the core of the plasma,

258
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:38,035
and much higher temperatures,
of course, upstream of that.

259
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,474
Following up on the advantages
of divertor concept,

260
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,759
because we're able 
to reduce the temperature,

261
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,969
we're also able to reduce the erosion
and impurity production

262
00:15:47,969 --> 00:15:51,197
by a number of effects, including
the physical sputtering by the ions --

263
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:55,342
so the fact that the ions impinge
on the surface with their energy,

264
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:57,850
and extract atoms from the surface.

265
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,823
We can also reduce
the chemical sputtering by the ions --

266
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:04,456
the ions that impinge on the surface
can create a chemical composite.

267
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:07,185
It can also reduce the neutral impact

268
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:10,733
-- that is, the number
of charge exchange collisions --

269
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,500
with this reduced temperature.

270
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,208
The configuration will enable us, also,

271
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,213
to reduce the transfer of impurities
back to the main chamber.

272
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:24,453
That is a key element in the need
for plasma to be maintained pure.

273
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:30,623
It has also been noticed experimentally,
that in the presence of an X-point

274
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,549
-- that is, in the presence
of a divertor configuration --

275
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:36,890
it's easier to access
what we call 'high confinement regimes.'

276
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,902
These are regimes in which
the edge of the plasma,

277
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:45,279
we notice that the turbulence decreases,
and therefore the confinement improves.

278
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,476
The decrease of the turbulence
is represented here,

279
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:51,956
in this sequence of images
taken at the very edge of the plasma,

280
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:58,170
in which you see that,
in some circumstances, there are bubbles

281
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,285
-- sometimes we will refer
to them as <i>blobs</i> --

282
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:05,000
that take particles and energies
out quite effectively.

283
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,815
But in the presence of an X-point,

284
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,742
we can create
what's called a <i>transport barrier</i>

285
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:10,755
-- that is, a region
of very quiescent plasma --

286
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:16,783
that, in fact, makes it very difficult
to particles and energy to go across it.

287
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:20,984
The profiles that result
are significantly improved,

288
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:21,985
in the sense of fusion.

289
00:17:21,985 --> 00:17:25,657
Let me just draw them
in a completely qualitative way.

290
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:30,117
This is a situation in which we have
what we call the <i>L-mode</i>

291
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,101
so still a turbulent edge.

292
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:37,012
And if I have a situation
in which I manage

293
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:41,985
to create a divertor configuration
<i>and</i> to create this transport barrier,

294
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:44,405
which again is possible,
and actually easy,

295
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:46,802
relatively easy, in the presence
of a divertor configuration,

296
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:49,074
then I jump up in my profile,

297
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:52,568
I have a very steep gradient,

298
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:55,946
and I have a much higher
value of pressure.

299
00:17:55,946 --> 00:18:00,296
This is a profile of a pressure,
and that's called <i>H-mode</i>,

300
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,643
for <i>high confinement mode</i>,

301
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:05,548
as opposed to L-mode,
for low confinement mode,

302
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,058
that we have seen before.

303
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:10,960
Still, in both cases,
we had the pressure

304
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,303
represented as a function
of the radial direction.

305
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:21,486
So, divertor configuration makes it easier
to access the high confinement regime,

306
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:26,570
which makes us gain, significantly,
performance in the plasma,

307
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,446
in the sense of fusion power
that can be produced.

308
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:35,478
The divertor creates a region
of relatively large pressure,

309
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:42,864
and that makes it easy, or easier,
for the pumps to function in that region,

310
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:44,466
and therefore to exhaust the particles

311
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:47,163
that need to be taken out
of the plasma volume.

312
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:53,231
I can also install cryopumps
around the diverter chamber

313
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:59,814
and extract these particles effectively,

314
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:03,096
on the other side
of the divertor target plates.

315
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,517
This is the design of the ITER divertor,

316
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:10,131
and the ITER, specifically,
set up for cryopumping.

317
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:19,008
So, divertor allows plasma
to be cold close to the walls,

318
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:21,167
in that specific area.

319
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:22,877
And if the plasma is cold

320
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:27,830
-- say it's of the order of a few eVs,
in terms of temperature; say 5eV --

321
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,661
that means that the ionization
cross-section becomes smaller

322
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:34,077
than the charge exchange cross-section,

323
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:40,381
which makes it easy for energy
to be transferred from ions to neutrals.

324
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:41,771
And the neutrals help a lot,

325
00:19:41,771 --> 00:19:43,626
because they spread the power
deposition,

326
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:46,088
forming what we call
a neutral cushion.

327
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:51,730
That reduces further the temperature
of the plasma in the divertor chamber,

328
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,904
and the recombination
between electron and ions can happen

329
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,099
over an entire volume
that is close to the target,

330
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,286
but not on the surface, necessarily.

331
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:06,715
That reduces the flux of energy
to the target even further,

332
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:09,940
because most of the power will,
therefore, be dissipated by radiation

333
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,800
before the plasma reaches the target.

334
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,782
So this plasma detachment is a situation

335
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:18,750
in which we would like, really, to be
for ITER and for the fusion reactors,

336
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,854
because that's where we limit the power
that directly goes to the target

337
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:26,679
as we radiate it before the plasma
arrives to the target.

338
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:30,667
And that radiation is visualized
in this image,

339
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:34,095
and that is really concentrated
around the X-point,

340
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:36,061
in our divertor configuration.

341
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:43,355
And sort of to give numbers
to this power balance,

342
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,317
here I take the case of ITER.

343
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:52,295
As we said, we like to exhaust,
effectively, heating power and particles.

344
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,468
And in this case, there's a lot
of the heat exhaust

345
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:59,708
that takes place via radiation.

346
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,435
So say I inject 150 MW,

347
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:06,376
both from ⍺-particle heating
and from auxiliary heating from outside.

348
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:07,975
Of course, we're not at ignition,

349
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,326
so we still have some external heating
of the plasma.

350
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:13,812
And in a typical ITER case
that we foresee,

351
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:18,297
we will radiate from the core
about 50 MW of those 150,

352
00:21:18,297 --> 00:21:22,169
and in a divertor,
if we manage to detach it,

353
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:27,500
will radiate, say,
about 70 MW of the remaining 100.

354
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,355
And only about 30 MW will go
directly to the wall.

355
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:36,032
So if we have about three,
four m² of plasma wall area

356
00:21:36,032 --> 00:21:38,821
that can be, as we call it,
<i>wetted</i> by that power,

357
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:45,456
that means that the power
to the wall will be giving a flux

358
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:49,237
that will be no more
than 10 MW per m².

359
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:53,151
So we are, really, in a region
that can be managed.

360
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:55,642
If we don't radiate this amount,

361
00:21:55,642 --> 00:22:01,977
if we don't radiate this 60 or 70 MW
in a divertor on the scrape off layer,

362
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:03,563
well, we will exceed this amount,

363
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:08,019
and therefore we will damage the divertor
target plates very, very quickly.

364
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:13,913
So let me briefly discuss
the choice of the materials

365
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:15,660
for the first wall for ITER.

366
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:18,191
This choice now is definitive.

367
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:22,846
The ITER divertor will be entirely made-
be made of tungsten.

368
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:27,091
Tungsten is high-Z material, but
it has a high threshold for sputtering,

369
00:22:27,091 --> 00:22:29,566
so only very, very, very small amounts

370
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:33,311
will be actually injected
into the plasma core.

371
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:38,856
And it has a big advantage
of having very low tritium retention.

372
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:45,647
So that's the material for the divertor.

373
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:50,023
The rest of the walls

374
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:54,862
-- all the walls outside
the divertor chamber --

375
00:22:54,862 --> 00:22:56,241
will be made of beryllium.

376
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,731
Beryllium is a metal with
relatively low Z,

377
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:05,615
so even if some atoms
are injected into the plasma core,

378
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:07,939
they'll radiate much less
than the tungsten,

379
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:10,549
and dilute the plasma much less, as well.

380
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,655
It also has a relatively low
tritium retention,

381
00:23:13,655 --> 00:23:16,001
and in addition,
it's a very good oxygen getter

382
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:18,744
to pump the remaining oxygen
from the chamber.

383
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:21,686
This combination of materials
is chosen also

384
00:23:21,686 --> 00:23:25,430
to minimize the deterioration
of the thermo-mechanical properties

385
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,690
under the radiation
of the fusion-generated neutrons.

386
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,507
So all of this seems to work well.

387
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:36,747
Nevertheless, there are challenges
that we're still facing

388
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:39,425
for the divertor, in particular,
in view of ITER

389
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:44,500
and of the other following burning plasma
experiments and demonstration reactors.

390
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,762
And perhaps the most important
element to discuss

391
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,297
is that of <i>transients</i>.

392
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:54,079
These are events that are,
so-called, <i>off-normal</i>,

393
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:59,393
so that are coming on top
of the steady-state load to the wall.

394
00:24:00,503 --> 00:24:04,944
First, are what we call
the <i>Edge Localized Modes</i>, or <i>ELM</i>s.

395
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:09,135
These are instabilities that are generated
by the very large edge gradients

396
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:11,069
which we obtained
in the high-confinement regime.

397
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:13,443
This is a picture of a pressure profile.

398
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:16,582
You can see that at the edge,
you have a very steep gradient.

399
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:18,578
Very steep gradients is equivalent

400
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:21,738
to very large thermodynamic potential
for driving instabilities,

401
00:24:21,738 --> 00:24:27,072
and this instability will happen,
and happen in a very short timescale,

402
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:32,110
generating violent bursts of energy
and particles to the wall --

403
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,812
that is, large thermal loads.

404
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:38,432
And if we extrapolate what we know
of ELMs today to ITER,

405
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:45,790
we expect something like 15MJ of energy
expelled in a single event --

406
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,254
in an event that lasts
a fraction of a millisecond,

407
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:54,056
and that is going to wet an area
of a few m².

408
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:57,735
So that is an enormous amount
of power per m².

409
00:24:57,735 --> 00:25:00,401
It's about 10GW per m².

410
00:25:01,011 --> 00:25:05,707
And even if you evaluate
materials like tungsten,

411
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:12,844
the surface temperature will go up
very significantly, to about 6000°C,

412
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:20,338
over a layer that's not infinitely thin,
but is about 0.1, 0.2mm.

413
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:21,965
That means the metal will melt.

414
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:25,094
So this is something we,
of course, must avoid.

415
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:34,304
Second example of these transient events
is what we call a <i>disruption</i>.

416
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:38,001
A disruption is a sudden loss
of plasma control

417
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:41,440
that leads to the plasma being terminated
over a very short timescale,

418
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,449
and sort of impinging on the wall.

419
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:48,925
And that generates a very large deposition
of energy on the walls, of course.

420
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:55,763
The image here is a thermographic image
of the JET vessel during a disruption,

421
00:25:55,763 --> 00:26:00,461
and you can see that there are
specific areas inside the vessel

422
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:05,650
that are made very hot
by the energy deposited by the disruption.

423
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,105
And you can also see an image here

424
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:10,953
that visualizes the consequences
that the disruption can have.

425
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:13,653
This is the melting
of a very thick piece of Inconel,

426
00:26:13,653 --> 00:26:17,312
which is a very resistant, special steel.

427
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:21,381
In ITER, we anticipate that 
a disruption can lead

428
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:26,971
to peak energy densities
in a divertor region of 5-20MJ per m²,

429
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:31,861
over short timescales:
again, 1-3 milliseconds.

430
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:37,294
And if we have these, the lifetime
of the divertor will be exceeded

431
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:39,489
in a few hundreds of these disruptions.

432
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:42,821
So we must avoid having these events.

433
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:50,010
We simulate in plasma devices
that are simpler than tokamaks

434
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,994
what happens to materials that are facing
these kinds of thermal loads from plasma.

435
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:57,394
This is an example
from the QSPA facility

436
00:26:57,394 --> 00:27:01,836
in which the tungsten was exposed
to about a hundred plasma pulses

437
00:27:01,836 --> 00:27:06,014
that are simulating ELMs of 1.5 MJ per m².

438
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:12,776
You can see, of course, very clearly
the damage that this tungsten feels-

439
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:17,771
this tungsten has to withstand.

440
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,117
In fact, we don't have materials
that can last for a sufficiently long time

441
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:27,679
under these thermal loads.

442
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:30,509
So that means that,
from the material side, we need to evolve.

443
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:32,807
But we also need to evolve
in our capability

444
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:37,107
of avoiding these transients,
or mitigating the effects of them.

445
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:44,865
I'd like to conclude the discussion
by just highlighting briefly,

446
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:48,743
that there are also new ideas, as far as
the configuration of the divertor,

447
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:53,018
ideas that are explored not for ITER,
which is already designed,

448
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:56,003
but for the steps beyond ITER,
in particular, for DEMO,

449
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:59,452
which is a step that will demonstrate
the economical feasibility of fusion,

450
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:02,251
not just the scientific
and technological feasibility.

451
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:06,921
The requirements for the divertor of ITER,

452
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:10,647
and for the plasma wall interaction
of ITER in general,

453
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:14,329
are, of course, valid, and even stronger
for the steps following ITER.

454
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:17,483
Again, we have to limit
the material erosion;

455
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:20,574
we have to increase the relative power
as much as we can.

456
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,088
That means we have to have
a detached plasma,

457
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:26,054
and we have to maintain
the plasma core very pure.

458
00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:30,714
In order to do that
in more and more stringent situations,

459
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:33,781
such as that of a DEMO reactor,

460
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:37,975
we are exploring, essentially,
three possibilities,

461
00:28:37,975 --> 00:28:41,257
or three kinds of possibilities.

462
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:43,733
We may have a liquid metal wall.

463
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:50,146
So there would be a thin layer of wall
that will circulate around the plasma,

464
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:54,199
-- for example, lithium --
that will take away particles and heat.

465
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:58,101
Or, we can have
special magnetic configurations

466
00:28:58,101 --> 00:29:00,221
that are issued
from the conventional divertor,

467
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:03,001
the configuration we have explored
together in this lecture.

468
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:05,983
One is the so-called <i>Super-X.</i>

469
00:29:06,623 --> 00:29:08,329
A picture of it is here.

470
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,109
This is the design
for the MAST-upgrade facility,

471
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:13,683
in Culham, UK.

472
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:18,088
Super-X consists of an expansion

473
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:21,303
of the divertor target chamber,
in a sense.

474
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:26,121
So it's a clever way of designing
the detail of the divertor chamber

475
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:29,147
so that, in fact,
one of the legs of the divertor

476
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:33,985
is effectively not only longer,
but also of much higher volume.

477
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:36,898
And much higher volume means
that you can radiate more easily the power

478
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:38,975
before the plasma reaches the target.

479
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:45,225
Another option is so-called <i>snowflake</i>,
which we have pioneered in Lausanne

480
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:48,303
on the tokamak TCV,
where it was first demonstrated.

481
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,842
The snowflake is, perhaps,
even a simpler idea.

482
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:53,611
So the divertor,
instead of having two legs

483
00:29:53,611 --> 00:29:59,964
to carry the power away from the core,
it has four legs,

484
00:30:00,854 --> 00:30:04,756
which means that you have
more possibilities for plasma exhaust.

485
00:30:04,756 --> 00:30:11,436
You also have a longer connection length,
and the region around the X-point,

486
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:14,952
which is more complex,
and it may radiate more,

487
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:19,453
and may also lead to a different
stability property for the plasma,

488
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:24,240
with respect in particular to the edge,
violent instabilities we have seen before.

489
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,771
So these are concepts
that are being explored.

490
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:31,723
It's not clear that they will be
advantageous over what we know today,

491
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:33,953
which I can refer to
as a conventional divertor,

492
00:30:33,953 --> 00:30:37,755
but we need to explore these, because
the challenges we have seen together

493
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:41,579
are really, very, very demanding
for the future devices.

494
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:46,348
To summarize, we have seen
that the reactor first wall

495
00:30:46,348 --> 00:30:49,361
must satisfy a number
of very stringent requirements.

496
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:53,482
We have seen that the divertor concept
is the one adopted commonly,

497
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:56,465
because it has several advantages
over the limited concept.

498
00:30:57,468 --> 00:30:58,966
New divertor configurations

499
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:02,390
and innovative schemes
for constructing a divertor

500
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,576
are being explored, in particular,
for the steps beyond ITER,

501
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:08,227
that is DEMO and the reactors.

502
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:13,950
The plasma wall interaction is the result
of a very intricate combination

503
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,127
of plasma physics, atomic physics,
and materials physics.

504
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:22,394
In the next module we will look, in fact,
at some aspects of this materials physics,

505
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,275
and the issues associated
with the functional

506
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:26,365
and structural materials for reactors.
