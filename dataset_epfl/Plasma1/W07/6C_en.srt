00:00:05,787 --> 00:00:08,687
Welcome to the course 
on Plasma Physics and applications.

2
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:11,674
Today, we will continue our discussion
on thermonuclear fusion.

3
00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:14,542
We will study the two approaches
that are possible on earth

4
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,064
to confine a plasma

5
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:18,261
and satisfy the conditions 
that are necessary

6
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:20,492
to make a fusion reactor work.

7
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:22,689
These two approaches
are an inertial confinement

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,115
and the a magnetic confinement.

9
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:27,678
For inertial, we'll look at 
the energy balance,

10
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:30,214
we'll look at the effect
of the pellet compression

11
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:31,777
and the rocket effect.

12
00:00:31,777 --> 00:00:33,995
We'll look at two possibilities
of driving a pellet:

13
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:36,127
direct and indirect drive.

14
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:38,308
We'll also briefly investigate 
the challenges

15
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:41,782
that physics and engineering impose
to this approach.

16
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:43,511
For magnetic confinement,

17
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:46,436
we'll look at linear 
and toroidal devices,

18
00:00:46,436 --> 00:00:49,934
their difference and similarities.

19
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:51,872
We'll look at the tokamak concept

20
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:54,352
and we'll briefly illustrate the progress
that we are achieving

21
00:00:54,352 --> 00:00:55,905
towards a burning plasma.

22
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:58,074
We have calculated together

23
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:01,650
that in order to achieve fusion
in a reactor,

24
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,663
we need to satisfy two conditions
at the same time.

25
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:09,578
We need to have a temperature
that's about 10keV or higher,

26
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:12,824
and we need to have a confinement quality,

27
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:15,050
measured by the product of the density

28
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,397
times the confinement time
of the energy in our plasma

29
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:24,314
that is at least of the order 10²°
per cubic meter (m⁻³) times seconds (s).

30
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,354
If we exclude the possibility of
confining a plasma by gravitation,

31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,277
which is of course impractical on earth,

32
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:34,203
we have two possibilities.

33
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:36,434
We have the magnetic confinement,

34
00:01:36,434 --> 00:01:41,399
which will be based on the use
of magnetic fields

35
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,737
to trap the charged particles 
that form a plasma,

36
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,452
or the inertial confinement

37
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:50,801
which is based on the use of small pellets

38
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:55,857
which we'll make implode
by a large energy flux

39
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:58,113
that will injected on their surfaces.

40
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,808
For magnetic confinement,

41
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,758
we can reach relatively large 
confinement times,

42
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:03,901
of the order of a second,

43
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:08,216
which implies that the densities 
that we'll need

44
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:11,313
to satisfy the criterion for fusion
will not be too large,

45
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:13,075
in fact they will be much smaller

46
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:16,431
than the density of the air 
that we breathe, for example.

47
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,908
Typically in the order of 10²°m⁻³

48
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:21,915
In the inertial confinement approach,

49
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:24,855
which will be the one 
we discuss first today,

50
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:28,663
we can only achieve very short 
confinement times for the energy,

51
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:30,955
let's say, of the order of a nanosecond.

52
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:34,730
That implies that we need 
to really reach extremely large densities

53
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,777
of the order 10³¹m⁻³ .

54
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:41,183
That is much higher than the density
of solid material.

55
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:44,310
Let's start our discussion
with the basic principles

56
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,467
of inertial confinement fusion (ICF).

57
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:49,813
Let's look at the confinement time first.

58
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:55,963
For that, we can consider the time 
for the ions to fly out of the pellet.

59
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:58,691
We can call that τi,

60
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:04,584
and evaluate it as the size of the pellet,
it's radius, divided by the typical speed

61
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,935
which the ions 
will move inside the pellet.

62
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:08,734
That is the speed of sound (cs).

63
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:13,515
cs is evaluated by the square root
of the temperature

64
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,157
divided by the ion mass.

65
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:19,018
This is the confinement time for particles.

66
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:21,587
Now we have to compare that
to the time that it takes

67
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:25,769
for a certain energy flux 
to heat the pellet.

68
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:27,473
To look at heating,

69
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:33,185
in particular the heating time by power
that's deposited on the pellet surface

70
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:35,760
by an energy flux F.

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,345
Let's call this time τh (for heating),

72
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,449
and let's express it in a formula.

73
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,613
The [heating] time is given by the energy in the pellet

74
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:54,081
divided by the power deposited
on the surface of the pellet.

75
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,790
The energy in the pellet

76
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,220
is the energy density of the plasma
in the pellet, times its volume.

77
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:05,829
So we have 3 n times the temperature,
times the volume of the pellet

78
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:12,975
which will assume to be 
a spherical shape, 4/3 π R³.

79
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:17,738
divided by the energy flux F,

80
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:22,616
times the surface of the pellet
which is 4πR².

81
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:28,271
We can simplify the different terms
and end up with a simple expression

82
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:33,178
which n times T, times the size
or the radius of the pellet (R),

83
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:35,294
divided by the energy flux, F.

84
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:40,959
Obviously, we need to have a heating time
that's shorter than the confinement time.

85
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:46,634
The condition is that τh 
is smaller that τi.

86
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:53,538
Let's translate it into a formula
for -- in particular into a condition --

87
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:56,281
for the energy flux, F.

88
00:04:56,281 --> 00:05:08,497
So let's write nT R/F smaller than
the confinement time, R/ ( √T/ √mi)

89
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:20,104
and express this in terms of F
which therefore needs to be larger than n T

90
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:23,204
times the square root of (T/mi).

91
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:26,560
And we note that in this condition,

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,856
the size of the pellet 
does not enter anymore.

93
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:34,236
I remind you that here I have assumed
no compression effects,

94
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:38,960
just heating on the surface of the pellet
by an energy flux <i>F</i>.

95
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,461
Let's take a numerical example:

96
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:45,620
typically we consider a temperature for 
fusion of about 10keV,

97
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,624
let's take the density 
of solid deuterium for n;

98
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:57,341
If put the numbers, this gives me a value
of F that needs to be larger

99
00:05:57,341 --> 00:06:07,179
than about 5. 10¹⁹W/m²
which is of course a very large value.

100
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,750
The hope to achieve that 
is only perhaps via lasers

101
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,579
or heavy ion beams.

102
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:17,278
Having seen the basic principles
for inertial confinement,

103
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:20,852
we are now ready to evaluate 
the energy balance.

104
00:06:20,852 --> 00:06:24,812
We have a laser, chararacterized
by your certain energy, El

105
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:27,748
that is injected onto a pellet.

106
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:31,023
There will be a certain efficiency
with which laser energy

107
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,570
will be transformed into 
the pellet thermal content.

108
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:41,414
So the thermal energy in the pellet
will be equal to the laser energy

109
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:44,834
times this efficiency
which we can call εc (epsilon c)

110
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:53,724
This will lead to heating
and hopefully fusion energy production.

111
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:58,313
The pellet will therefore 
produce an energy Ef

112
00:06:58,313 --> 00:07:01,924
via diffusion reactions 
that will be happening in its core.

113
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:09,281
This fusion energy Ef is used 
to create electricity for energy production.

114
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:15,478
Let's call the energy for electricity Ee,

115
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:18,857
and of course for this process
there's a finite efficiency as well.

116
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:23,617
Let's call that epsilon thermal
εth

117
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:28,924
Ee = Ef εth

118
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:33,025
Of course this Ee
will give energy production

119
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:35,371
for the outside world if your like,

120
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:40,392
but also part of it will be used 
to drive the laser.

121
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:45,968
So the laser energy (El) will be equal to
a certain conversion efficiency

122
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:48,890
which we can call εl (epsilon-sub-l)

123
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,334
times the electrical energy 
that would be used to drive it.

124
00:07:53,504 --> 00:08:01,248
Now, of course not all fusion energy
will be used to create electrical energy

125
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,512
because of the final conversion efficiency

126
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:07,154
and not all electrical energy
would be used to drive the laser.

127
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,380
We'd only have a fraction of it 
in principle,

128
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,007
that would be Ee times a factor
which we can call Frecirc

129
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:24,132
which is the fraction of energy
that is recirculated to run the reactor,

130
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:26,193
mostly for plasma heating.

131
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:29,615
So we now have the complete loop
for our energy balance

132
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:33,011
and we can evaluate
what the different conditions are

133
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:36,398
in the practical situations 
for a fusion reactor.

134
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:42,041
Here we see the same loop
drawn in a more schematic way

135
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,129
and what we do is that 
we develop the relations

136
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,817
between the different steps.

137
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,949
In this situation we consider 
the worst case scenario

138
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:52,170
that is we recirculate 100% of the power
or the energy.

139
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,730
We need to express the pellet size 
as function Eth,

140
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,636
therefore as a function 
of the laser energy (El),

141
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:01,845
we consider our usual temperature 
for fusion of about 10keV,

142
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:04,656
and the relevant value 
of diffusion cross section times velocity

143
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:07,398
for the DT reaction.

144
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:11,208
And if we introduce a reference value
n0 for the density

145
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,413
which is the density of solid deuterium

146
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:16,474
and the confinement times for the ions
that we have calculated before.

147
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:18,529
We have a very compact expression

148
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:25,988
that relates the densities of the pellet
to the laser energy

149
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:29,749
that is required to satisfy our criterion,

150
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:32,866
and the efficiencies 
of the different steps

151
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:34,128
that we have discussed.

152
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:39,990
This expression is numerically correct
if we consider the energy in megajoules.

153
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:44,160
Using this expression now, 
we can put some numbers.

154
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:48,259
and evaluate a driver energy
that's needed for a situation

155
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:54,285
in which we consider the density n=n0,
that is the density of solid deuterium.

156
00:09:55,005 --> 00:10:00,701
We consider the efficiency εc 
to be about 10%,

157
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,106
efficience εl to be about 5%,

158
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:05,021
that's the efficiency with which
the electricity

159
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,617
is translating into laser power,

160
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:12,454
and the efficiency εth, 
which is the efficiency

161
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:17,176
of the transformation of fusion power
into electricity of about 40%.

162
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:23,029
The number we reach for the laser,
for the driver energy in general

163
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,929
is very, very large, it's 10¹⁵J.

164
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:30,242
That's about 50 times the Hiroshima bomb

165
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:34,505
and if we consider the pellet size
of the order, a few millimeters,

166
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:36,089
that's really a very large number.

167
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:41,233
And in fact this is orders of magnitude more
than we can achieve

168
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:47,161
in the laser pulses today
which is about 2-3 megajoules.

169
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:52,738
To reduce this value 
of the needed laser energy,

170
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:55,154
we must increase the efficiencies.

171
00:10:55,154 --> 00:11:01,826
But we also must increase the ratio n/n0,
that means we must compress the pellet.

172
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:05,443
So let's take slightly more 
optimistic numbers:

173
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:10,978
an efficiency εc of 20%,
an efficiency εl of about 8%,

174
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:15,757
we keep εth 
to about 40%,

175
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:18,089
and then we do the exercise
the other way around.

176
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:23,877
So we impose that El be 2 megajoules
which is what we can achieve today.

177
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:26,082
What do we need for n?

178
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:33,070
Well, we reach a value of n
that must be about 3000 times n0.

179
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,618
So the density must be 3000 times
the density of solid deuterium.

180
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,599
That means we have to achieve a pressure

181
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:44,597
that is 3000 times n0 
times the temperature

182
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:54,634
and if we put the numbers, that corresponds
to about 2x10¹⁷ Newtons per square meter,

183
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:57,380
which again is a gigantic pressure.

184
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,836
If we consider the laser pressure,

185
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:04,533
that is the pressure generated 
from the laser beam

186
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,576
given a certain energy flux F

187
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:10,492
for the most powerful laser beams
we can create today,

188
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:17,158
and that is calculated simply by dividing
the energy flux F by the speed of light,

189
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:20,592
that's about five orders 
of magnitude smaller.

190
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:23,249
So we are really far away 
from what we need to achieve

191
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:26,966
to satisfy the condition 
for the pellet to fuse.

192
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:31,462
The question is how to boost 
this pressure.

193
00:12:31,462 --> 00:12:33,257
Here's a simple idea.

194
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:37,702
We can generate an implosion
by ablating matter at the pellet surface.

195
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:44,819
If we have our pellet, we have a layer,
at the edge of it, which can be ablated

196
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:50,118
for example, by launching onto it
a very large amount of energy.

197
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:52,883
By rocket effect,

198
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:55,010
that is by conservation of momentum,

199
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,377
there will be an inward motion
of the first layers

200
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:01,040
inside the ablated matter.

201
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,784
This is the rocket effect.

202
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:06,052
The pressure that results
can be calculated

203
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,136
with a very simple model.

204
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:10,067
Let's call this Procket.

205
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:15,664
The pressure is equal to the variation
of the momentum (mv) with time,

206
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:17,380
divided by the surface.

207
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,909
We assume that v
can be considered constant

208
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:24,202
so the momentum varies
because the mass varies

209
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:25,988
not because the velocity varies,

210
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:31,457
so that is equal to v dm/dt
over the surface that we would call S.

211
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:37,441
We will consider the energy flux F,
that is the power divided by the surface

212
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:42,162
and the power is the variation
in time of the energy

213
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:45,677
which is the kinetic energy 
of the matter in the pellet,

214
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:47,057
divided by the surface <i>S</i>.

215
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:51,620
Again, we consider that the velocity
can be assumed to be roughly constant,

216
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,931
so I take 1/2 v² out of the derivative

217
00:13:56,931 --> 00:14:02,216
and we have 1/2 v² over S
times the variation of mass with time.

218
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,795
That gives me a variation of mass 
with time dm/dt,

219
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:09,981
that's equal to 2 S F / v².

220
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:16,832
That I can use in the expression
for the rocket effect pressure, or Procket

221
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:21,097
which given by v/S dm/dt

222
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:26,577
so that is v/S 2SF/v².

223
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:32,569
The surface of the pellet cancels out
and I'm left, simplifying also v² with v,

224
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:36,034
I'm left with just 2F/v.

225
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:41,913
So, we can now compare what we have achieved
in terms of pressure by this rocket effect,

226
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:45,117
and the pressure that comes simply 
from the light impinging on the surface,

227
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,737
which we called Plaser before,

228
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:54,005
let's take the ratio of the two
and that is 2F/v c/F.

229
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,969
So, for the same energy flux F,

230
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:59,669
we a ratio that's two times the ratio
of the speed of light,

231
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,054
divided by the velocity

232
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:04,068
of the motion of the particles 
at the pellet surface.

233
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:07,179
So that is of course much, 
much bigger than 1

234
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:11,443
as the velocity is much smaller than c.

235
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:17,323
So that's how we boost the pressure
in the pellet by this rocket effect idea.

236
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:21,301
There are a few additional effects
that we need consider:

237
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:24,839
two that are positive 
that is they help us

238
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,259
achieving higher pressure 
and higher temperature in the core,

239
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,426
and two that are a little
bit difficult to deal with.

240
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:34,046
First of all, the pressure 
from the rocket effect is helped

241
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:36,557
by the inward propagation 
of the shockwave

242
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:38,653
and this is produced at the surface,

243
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:45,465
assuming that this shock wave really goes
to the center in a symmetric way.

244
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:49,938
Second, as the core is heated,
fusion reactions will start

245
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:53,393
and the alpha (α) heating that is 
the consequence of the fusion reactions

246
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:55,409
will start to help as well.

247
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:58,978
However, for this to work, 
we need to make sure that the pellet size

248
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:04,316
be larger than the collision mean free path
for the alphas inside it.

249
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:08,096
So we need a pellet size 
that's in the order of a few millimeters at least.

250
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:13,157
The other two effects are a little bit 
more difficult to deal with

251
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,809
and that they're not helping us.

252
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,469
First, we have instabilities in the interaction
between the laser and the plasma,

253
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:23,434
and this imposes a limit
to the laser intensity.

254
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:27,557
Second, the density itself 
cannot be too high,

255
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:31,633
otherwise the laser beam will be reflected
by the plasma frequency cut-off

256
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:35,758
that we have learned about 
in previous classes, ωp (omega p).

257
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:41,289
We're ready now to summarize
the sequence of events in inertial fusion.

258
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:45,122
First of all, we have what we call
the <i>radiation</i> phase.

259
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:51,370
The laser beam heats the surface
and forms a plasma.

260
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,117
The second phase is the <i>blow-off</i> phase

261
00:16:54,182 --> 00:16:58,357
which is this rocket effect that
we have discovered together.

262
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:02,681
The surface material is blown off
and by conservation momentum

263
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:05,361
the rest is pushed over the center.

264
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:09,278
The third phase is therefore
the <i>implosion</i> phase.

265
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,145
And with implosion comes 
the compression of the core

266
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:13,829
to very high density.

267
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,589
And the fourth phase, 
if everything works fine,

268
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:21,030
is the <i>thermonuclear</i> burn
of the compressed fuel.

269
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:27,953
Let us now briefly discuss the challenges,
that physics poses to this approach.

270
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,405
First of all the core must not be heated

271
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:34,439
before the shock wave arrives
and compresses it.

272
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:38,687
That implies that the design of the pellet
needs to be really carefully done.

273
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:43,291
It also implies that the timing
of the laser pulse is very delicate.

274
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,504
Second, there is the question
of the hydrodynamical stability

275
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:51,887
of the pellet itself. That imposes a
very high degree of symmetry in the pellet

276
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,428
as well as in the drive,

277
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:58,724
therefore in practice a very, 
very delicate question

278
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:01,172
of aligning the beams onto the pellet.

279
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:09,191
The simulation shown here indicates 
a mixing from the core material

280
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:12,679
that is formed by the DT fuel 
and the outer material

281
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,307
due to a so-called 
Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

282
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,929
Two approaches are taken
to drive the pellet:

283
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:21,689
direct and indirect drive.

284
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:24,896
The direct drive 
is shown here on the left.

285
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:29,100
This is the simpler of the two,
conceptually.

286
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,089
We really have just the pellet

287
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:35,929
on which we inject 
in an as symmetric fashion as possible

288
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:37,840
all the laser beams.

289
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:41,099
The pellet construction 
is relatively complicated.

290
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,783
there is an ablator, low-density around,

291
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:46,912
there's a solid or liquid fuel,

292
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:51,212
and there's a gas at the vapor pressure
of the solid or the liquid fuel.

293
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:56,008
The pellet size, here shown
compared to a human eye,

294
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:58,362
is in the order of a millimeter.

295
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:00,968
This is the direct drive.

296
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:06,064
The second option is a clever idea
that came about

297
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:09,588
to actually lower the requirements
on the symmetry

298
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:11,497
of the laser injections onto the pellet.

299
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:13,892
And that's the so called indirect drive.

300
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:15,584
The idea is the following:

301
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:19,540
instead of just having the laser beams
impinging on the pellet itself,

302
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,828
we have a very small, little chamber
around it, called a hohlraum,

303
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:27,519
bigger than the pellet itself of course,

304
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,924
but still a relatively small size
of a centimeter or so.

305
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,434
This is the image of one version again
compared to a human eye.

306
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:39,903
What does this holhraum do?

307
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:44,866
Well, it receives the laser beams
through two holes.

308
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:49,062
It acts like a black body radiator
of x-rays

309
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,898
because the laser beams are so powerful
that by heating the surfaces

310
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:53,585
of these holhraum inside,

311
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:57,082
which are made typically 
of a high Z material like gold,

312
00:19:57,082 --> 00:20:00,602
this surfaces emit x-rays.

313
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:06,418
An advantage is that this x-ray bath
in which the pellet is embedded

314
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:11,140
is more symmetric than the injection
of the lasers themselves.

315
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,802
It reduces the conditions
on the symmetry for the beams.

316
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:24,807
The image shown on this slide
is that of the National Ignition Facility

317
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:29,095
which is the largest operating experiment
on inertial fusion, and that's located

318
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,103
at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratoty
in California, US.

319
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:39,886
It shows you how big the facility 
of this kind is.

320
00:20:39,886 --> 00:20:47,546
This system has 192 lasers 
for a record energy in a pulse

321
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:52,826
of about 2 megajoules, and a power
of about 500 terawatts.

322
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:57,138
These are lasers in the UV regime 
at 352 nano meters of wavelength.

323
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:01,047
You see in this picture 
all the amplifiers for the lasers.

324
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:03,743
You see the beam steering optics here,

325
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:07,346
which is of the order of 300 meter length,

326
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,500
and at the end you see 
the vacuum chamber

327
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,264
which contains the pellet,

328
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:18,421
which is kept in place 
by a special positioning sytem

329
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:22,045
and of course occupies a very small volume
of the vacuum chamber at the end.

330
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:27,491
Let us now discuss a few
of the engineering challenges

331
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,769
that this approach entails.

332
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,028
First of all, we need to address 
the question of the efficiency cost

333
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:36,440
and reliability of the high energy driver,
for example, the lasers.

334
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,417
Second, we need to solve the question
of the materials

335
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:42,015
for the first wall of vacuum chamber.

336
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:45,802
Third, and this is perhaps
the most difficult ones,

337
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:51,679
we need to address the issue of complexity
and therefore cost of the capsule,

338
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,844
the pellet itself and the hohlraum
in the case of the indirect drive.

339
00:21:55,844 --> 00:22:00,943
At present these elements cost orders
of magnitude more than that they need to cost

340
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:03,635
if we want the reactor to be economical.

341
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:09,190
And last but not the least is the issue
of going from a single to repetitive pulses.

342
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,307
A reactor will need to operate 
with a few hertz of a pulsed rate

343
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:15,447
in order to be economical 
and produce power.

344
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:19,305
Having seen some of the problems
of inertial confinement

345
00:22:19,347 --> 00:22:23,119
and some of the elements 
of its basic principles,

346
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,039
we're now ready to move 
to the second approach

347
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,136
that we can have on earth to get
a plasma confined in the given region

348
00:22:31,305 --> 00:22:34,550
and therefore produce a fusion reactor.

349
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,961
That is the approach 
of magnetic confinement

350
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:41,137
based on the fact that the plasma
is made by charged particles,

351
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:42,014
ions and electrons,

352
00:22:42,014 --> 00:22:43,881
then they are subject 
to electromagnetic force,

353
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:46,898
and particular, they tend 
to rotate and gyrate around

354
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:47,953
magnetic field lines.

355
00:22:47,953 --> 00:22:50,662
This approach allows us 
to have confinement times

356
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:53,430
that are macroscopic 
of the order of seconds

357
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:59,709
which means we can afford densities
that are relatively low,

358
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,332
the order 10²° per cubic meters,

359
00:23:01,332 --> 00:23:05,013
much lower than the densities
of the air that we breathe.

360
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:07,758
As illustrated in this little movie,

361
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:11,605
this approach is based on 
a very simple principle

362
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:15,577
that is, the charged particles
that make up the plasma

363
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:19,433
are subject to the electromagnetic forces
in particular to the magnetic force

364
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:22,873
that holds them 
to the magnetic field lines

365
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:25,133
in their gyromotion around them.

366
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:30,011
Without field of course, 
the particles will hit the wall

367
00:23:30,097 --> 00:23:33,288
of our reactor immediately and get lost,
and the plasma will disappear.

368
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:37,125
With the field, they will be contained
in the volume for enough time.

369
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,957
The idea of magnetic confinement
was declined since the early times

370
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:44,546
into different kinds of schemes.

371
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:47,837
First of all, came the linear devices,

372
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:53,502
in which the plasma was confined
around magnetic fields lines

373
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:55,437
producing linear configurations,

374
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:59,337
but of course, in this situation, 
you would have a problem

375
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:03,178
with the two ends of the device itself.

376
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:08,455
So, early enough of course came also
the idea of having a plasma

377
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:13,002
made into a toroidal configuration.

378
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:16,566
This toroidal configuration 
can take different forms

379
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:20,794
and different details in its concept.

380
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:25,143
We'll look at a very simple approach next.

381
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:27,662
So let's take a simple toroidal field.

382
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:35,295
SImple toroidal field implies,
if we close a toroidal machine,

383
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:38,510
implies that there is a certain curvature
of the field lines

384
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,706
and there is also a certain gradient
of the intensity of the field.

385
00:24:41,706 --> 00:24:44,479
These two things lead to drifts

386
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:46,903
as you have learned in the first part
of the course,

387
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,255
that separate positive 
and negative charges.

388
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:52,519
In this example, we have 
the positive charges on the top,

389
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,634
and the negative charges at the bottom.

390
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:59,106
When you separate charges,
you create an electric field, <i>E,</i>

391
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:02,899
and that will act, together 
with the ambient magnetic field

392
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:05,734
which is toroidal in this case.

393
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:09,983
It (E) will combine with that (B) 
to create an (E x B) drift

394
00:25:09,983 --> 00:25:13,114
that will take all the plasma out

395
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:17,750
irrespective of the charges 
of the particles that compose it.

396
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,626
So, very, very soon, 
we will lose the plasma to the outside

397
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:25,802
in a purely toroidal device.
(i.e. in a device with a purely toroidal B)

398
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:30,042
The idea therefore 
is to avoid charge separation

399
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:32,491
by imposing a poloidal field,

400
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:36,171
so that the particles can sample
in their motion regions with opposite drifts

401
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:38,262
and on average have no net drift.

402
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:40,409
In the case of a tokamak configuration,

403
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:45,219
the poloidal field is produced
by a plasma current, which is this, Jt.

404
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:48,488
However, another relatively 
minor problem arises

405
00:25:48,904 --> 00:25:52,247
this plasma current 
going around toroidally,

406
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:54,307
is subject to the so-called hoop force

407
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:58,143
which tends to move the current filaments
that is the plasma itself

408
00:25:58,143 --> 00:26:02,480
all the way outside on both sides,
and all the sides in fact.

409
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,251
How to avoid the hoop force?

410
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:05,928
To avoid the hood force 
or to counter balance it,

411
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:11,625
we add a vertical field, 
indicated here as Bz in green,

412
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,448
and with the presence of Bz,

413
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:19,543
this hoop force can be actually 
counterbalanced completely.

414
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:23,967
Here we summarize the different elements
of this tokomak concept.

415
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:31,799
We have the toroidal field coils in blue.
They generate a toroidal magnetic field,

416
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:41,586
we have a plasma current here in green,
which generates a poloidal magnetic field.

417
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:45,526
Therefore the sum of the two
will give a helical magnetic field around,

418
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:49,122
so that particles will experience
inward and outward drifts,

419
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:52,666
and on average experience in fact 
no net drift and be confined.

420
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:57,410
And in addition we have so-called
outer poloidal field coils

421
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,551
that produce the vertical field
to counteract the hoop force

422
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:06,883
and also can produce field 
for plasma positioning and shaping.

423
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:13,550
The one thing we still need to clarify
is how to drive the current in the plasma.

424
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,658
Well, that's the idea of the tokamak,

425
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:20,931
-- one of the ideas of the tokamak--
that is to use a transformer

426
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:25,055
in which the plasma acts as 
a secondary circuit,

427
00:27:25,055 --> 00:27:31,231
the primary circuit being a coil
that's inside the core of the tokamak.

428
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:38,014
If we swing the flux in this coil
by changing the current in the coils,

429
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:42,430
we can induce by Faraday's Law,
a current in the plasma

430
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,730
which again in turn will produce
the poloidal field that we need.

431
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:50,951
And this little movie summarizes
what we have just said.

432
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:54,958
Here are the set of toroidal field coils
producing a toroidal field.

433
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:59,821
[The] poloidal field is produced 
by the plasma current,

434
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:02,454
created by transformer action,

435
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:08,244
and the helical field then traps particles
as illustrated by having them go around

436
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:11,028
the torus in-out, in-out.

437
00:28:11,028 --> 00:28:13,899
An additional set of coils
will produce the vertical field

438
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:18,039
to counteract the hoop force
and to shape the plasma.

439
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,832
The picture which we end this movie

440
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:22,832
is that of the largest tokamak 
existing so far,

441
00:28:22,832 --> 00:28:27,611
that is the JET Tokamak in Europe,
in England, close to Oxford.

442
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:30,980
The progress in 
magnetic confinement fusion

443
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,888
using the tokamak concept primarily
has been fantastic.

444
00:28:36,888 --> 00:28:38,481
If you look at this progress

445
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:41,092
in terms of the temperature achieved
for the plasma,

446
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:42,972
here illustrated on the vertical axis,

447
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:45,370
as a function of what I call here
the <i>Fusion Performance</i>

448
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,930
which is the product of the density
times confinement time

449
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,334
our famous n τe,

450
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:53,813
times the temperature,

451
00:28:53,813 --> 00:28:56,190
we see that the different generations

452
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,978
have really made significant jumps
into this graph.

453
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:03,514
The tokamak concept
was developed in the 60s,

454
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:09,946
very soon in the 70s, 
we reached temperatures

455
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:15,714
of the order of 50 
or even 100 millions of degrees,

456
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:22,479
so temperatures that were already taking us
in the fusion conditions for that part.

457
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:26,397
What was still to be done, 
- and somewhat is still to be done-,

458
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,930
is to obtain those temperatures

459
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:32,446
at very large values of confinement 
times and densities.

460
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:37,426
The second generation in the 80s
made a significant jump,

461
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:40,978
not so much in temperatures, but again
in intensity and confinement time.

462
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:46,257
And the third generation, 
which we achieved almost breakeven,

463
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:49,222
typically in two machines:

464
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:53,083
an American machine, TFTR, 
and in the European machines JET

465
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,355
which we have just seen,

466
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:57,263
and a richer picture 
is actually reproduced on this graph.

467
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:02,955
This breakeven conditions were approached
by having very significant increase

468
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:04,586
in confinement time.

469
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:07,094
What we still need to do 
is to make the jump

470
00:30:07,094 --> 00:30:12,303
from Q slightly lower than 1,
where Q is the fusion gain,

471
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:14,606
again fusion power divided by input power,

472
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:19,299
into the regime of a burning plasma
with Q larger than 5.

473
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:22,292
And that's what we intend to do 
with the ITER project

474
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:25,731
which aims at obtaining about 10 for Q

475
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:29,309
and of course for the reactor values 
of capital Q

476
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,786
that are in a range of 30 to 40.

477
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:37,983
Let's say a few words about ITER
which will be the first burning plasma.

478
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:41,091
You see here 
the construction site for ITER,

479
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:45,147
which is located in the south 
of France, Cadarache.

480
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:47,983
ITER is the result of a very large 
international collaboration

481
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:54,716
involving several partners representing
about 80% of the world population.

482
00:30:54,716 --> 00:31:00,895
You see here the pit in which
the tokamak will be constructed

483
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:05,284
and you see on the right the layout
of the tokamak itself,

484
00:31:05,284 --> 00:31:08,291
with all the systems 
we have discussed today

485
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:13,204
and of course much more ancillaries
to make the system work overall.

486
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,758
You'll also notice the size of the plant

487
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:21,119
as compared to the typical size
of a human person here.

488
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:28,767
ITER will be aiming at providing
a fusion gain, capital Q of 10 or more,

489
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:31,906
a fusion power of about half a gigawatt

490
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:34,744
for a duration of several hundreds 
of seconds.

491
00:31:34,744 --> 00:31:36,995
It will therefore be 
the first demonstration

492
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,240
of the scientific 
and technological feasibility of fusion

493
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,351
and of its safety.

494
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:45,414
We can now summarize the lecture.

495
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:49,867
We have seen today that we have two 
approaches on earth to reach the conditions

496
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,946
that are necessary 
for a fusion reactor to work:

497
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:54,216
inertial and magnetic.

498
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:58,228
For inertial confinement, we have seen
that the efficiency of the driver

499
00:31:58,228 --> 00:32:02,335
and of its conversion to pellet energy,
and heating are crucial.

500
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:07,252
The implosion of the pellet 
can be helped by the rocket effect.

501
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:12,118
We have seen that 
the indirect drive can help,

502
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,023
improving the symmetry of the implosion.

503
00:32:15,023 --> 00:32:17,055
We have also noticed 
that there are challenges

504
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:19,519
on the physics side and on
the engineering side.

505
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,959
On the physics side,

506
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,798
the heating of the core
and the stability of the pellet

507
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:24,569
are the most important ones.

508
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,275
On the engineering side,

509
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:29,419
we need to really address the issue
of the cost of the pellet

510
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:32,734
and of the repetition rate
of the pulses.

511
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:36,663
We have introduced the concept 
of magnetic confinement

512
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,219
based on magnetic fields
to hold the plasma together

513
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:41,671
in a cleverly designed cage.

514
00:32:41,671 --> 00:32:44,323
We have seen that toroidal devices
are needed

515
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:46,666
for this cage to be efficient,

516
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:50,975
and we have mentioned 
and briefly introduced the ITER project

517
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:54,839
which will be the one to provide us
with burning plasmas,

518
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,443
and therefore the one 
that will demonstrate

519
00:32:56,443 --> 00:33:00,054
that fusion is feasible
both scientifically and technologically,

520
00:33:00,054 --> 00:33:01,594
and that it is safe.

521
00:33:01,594 --> 00:33:04,238
In terms of magnetic confinement,

522
00:33:04,238 --> 00:33:09,099
we did not go into much depth
because we will concentrate on it

523
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:12,199
in several lectures 
in the rest of this course.
