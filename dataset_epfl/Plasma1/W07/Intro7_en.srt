00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:02,659
This lecture starts
the third part of the course

2
00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:04,929
in which we will discuss
one of the main applications

3
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:07,220
of plasma physics: fusion energy.

4
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:10,001
Fusion energy is a possible solution

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:13,715
of one of the most formidable challenges
faced by mankind today,

6
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:17,642
that of finding a source of energy
that is safe, abundant, available to all,

7
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,933
and compatible with
sustainable development.

8
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:23,612
This lecture, which I have
the pleasure to teach myself,

9
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:25,671
provides a general introduction to fusion,

10
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:28,600
starting from the basic
reactions and processes,

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,698
and continuing with the calculation
of the power balance in reactors.

12
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,726
We will then discuss
the two possible approaches

13
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:36,522
to trap plasmas in the reactor

14
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:38,424
and obtain fusion energy on earth:

15
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:40,721
magnetic and inertia confinement.

16
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:44,087
Focusing on a magnetic
confinement approach,

17
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:46,856
we will then design
the main elements of a reactor,

18
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:49,867
taking into account both physics
and engineered constraints.

19
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:54,625
We will finally discuss two of
the main challenges for fusion reactors,

20
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:58,050
at the interface between
plasma physics and material science,

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,106
that of the interaction between
the plasma and its surrounding walls.

22
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:03,163
A very difficult question,
as you can imagine,

23
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,081
as matter that is much hotter
than that of the surface of the sun

24
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:09,126
is only a few centimeters away
from material surfaces.

25
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:13,734
And that of the structural materials,
for present and future fusion reactors.
