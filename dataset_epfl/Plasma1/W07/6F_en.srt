1
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:08,909
Welcome to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,901
In the last lecture we have seen

3
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:13,168
elements of the plasma wall
interaction problem.

4
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:14,496
We have seen how important

5
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:16,758
is the choice of
the first wall materials.

6
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:19,356
Today, still in a simple way,

7
00:00:19,356 --> 00:00:21,600
we will look at each of
the structural materials

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,630
for fusion reactors.

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,116
We will look at the requirements
of these materials to satisfy.

10
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:31,166
We will look at a small comparison
between fusion and fission materials

11
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:35,337
and the constraints that both cases
have to satisfy,

12
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:37,039
have to withstand.

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,411
We will look at the effects
of the high-energy neutrons

14
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:42,577
that are issued by the fusion reactions

15
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:45,015
and the evolution of
the material properties

16
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:48,063
under the neutron irradiation
at these energies.

17
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:50,380
We'll look at the
candidate structural materials

18
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,666
we have in mind for constructing 
the first reactors.

19
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,225
And finally, how to test fusion materials

20
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:59,154
and why we need
to test fusion materials today.

21
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:02,889
First of all, reactor materials
have to withstand

22
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:06,185
a very large flux
of high-energy neutrons,

23
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:09,751
particularly 14.1 MeV neutrons.

24
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:12,941
For example, in DEMO,
we expect a flux

25
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:17,859
between 10¹⁹ and 10²⁰ 
neutrons per square meter per second.

26
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:22,441
If we translate that into a fluence
that is an integrated value,

27
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,703
in this case we express that

28
00:01:24,703 --> 00:01:30,393
as a power times a time per unit surface,

29
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:34,506
we have something like
five megawatts year per square meter.

30
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:38,394
That's a very very large value
compared to the machines we have today.

31
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:44,439
As we have said in the lecture
that introduced fusion in general

32
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,302
and particularly its advantages,

33
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:51,286
the reactor materials must have
as low activation as possible

34
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:54,744
because that's one of the key advantages
of fusion with respect to fission.

35
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:58,226
This is the same plot we have seen
at that lecture,

36
00:01:58,226 --> 00:02:01,402
representing the radioactivity of a plant

37
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:04,752
as a function of the number of years
after it's shut down.

38
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:06,563
Now remember that we said that

39
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:10,204
the nuclear fission light-water reactor

40
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:13,934
will be remaining at
a very high level of radioactivity

41
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,281
for thousands of years
after it's shut down.

42
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:21,036
That would be incompatible
with a sustainable development approach.

43
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:22,282
Fusion would have the advantage

44
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:26,143
that activation would be
much, much more short-lived.

45
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:30,326
For materials that we know today,
ferrritic steel, for example,

46
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:34,361
we would have hundreds of years
or even less

47
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:38,607
for the radioactivity to reach the levels
equivalent to coal ashes.

48
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:41,868
But, if we need to reduce 
the activation even further

49
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:44,415
we need to go to more advanced materials.

50
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:47,820
And that's where the quest is on

51
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,622
for the future generations
of fusion reactors.

52
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:55,380
For example, vanadium alloys in this plot
or silicon carbide composites,

53
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,486
in which case, the problem of radioactivity
after the shut down of the plant

54
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:00,831
is completely removed.

55
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:06,231
The reactor materials have to operate
at the highest possible temperature

56
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:10,319
simply based on the
quest for the thermal efficiency.

57
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,928
We all remember that
the idealized Carnot cycle

58
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,738
has an efficiency
which is one minus the ratio

59
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:20,651
of the cold and hot
reservoirs temperatures.

60
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:26,821
And of course the hot temperature, here,
is that of the coolant

61
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:29,469
which is embedded in
the structural materials

62
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:34,439
of the fusion plant that are 
incorporated in the blanket.

63
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,996
So, the higher the temperature,
the more efficient the reactor will be.

64
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:43,594
Let's look briefly at a comparison
between fusion and fission.

65
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:48,906
Fission has a hot core,
which is the fuel,

66
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:52,342
for example UO₂
in this plot,

67
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:55,004
surrounded by the moderator
and the coolant.

68
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:58,774
And the power fluxes that we are
typically encountering

69
00:03:58,774 --> 00:03:59,854
in a fission reactor,

70
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:03,707
first of all, they are steady states
so they are stable in time,

71
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:05,454
they don't vary,

72
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,688
and second of all, they are of
the order of 1MW/m².

73
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:13,118
Fusion, on the other hand,
has the problem that the power fluxes

74
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:16,122
are, even in steady state,
much higher,

75
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,594
typically an order of magnitude higher.

76
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:22,169
But also, fusion has these
violent events, or transients,

77
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,425
that we have discussed
in the previous lecture

78
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:29,026
that can reach thousands of MW/m²,

79
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:33,606
a gigawatt per square meter (1 GW/m²,)
in terms of the wall loading.

80
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,291
These are very short-lived,
nevertheless very dangerous

81
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,099
for the integrity of the materials.

82
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:44,382
The second main difference
between fusion and fission

83
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:46,583
in terms of the materials,

84
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:51,493
is that the spectrum of the neutrons
is quite different.

85
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:53,448
So in fission,

86
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:56,363
if we take the average
of the neutron energy,

87
00:04:56,363 --> 00:05:00,570
typically of the order of 2 MeV,

88
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,300
whereas in fusion, as we know,
the neutrons are produced at 14.1 MeV,

89
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,378
from the DT reaction.
So we have a much higher energy.

90
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:16,528
Much higher energy for the neutrons,
which translates into a higher activation,

91
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,627
but, even more important,

92
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:22,562
to a higher degradation
of the material properties.

93
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:27,610
Let's evaluate very simply,
first, the mechanical effects

94
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,924
of the neutrons, that they can have
on the material atoms in the lattice,

95
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:39,782
So, take a neutron of energy En
that hits an atom of mass M,

96
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,173
which is at rest in the lattice.

97
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:45,383
We consider sort of a 1D situation,

98
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:47,988
that's my neutron,

99
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,188
we have a velocity that is associated
with its energy,

100
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:59,624
and it will hit an atom M,
I draw it bigger

101
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:02,867
because the atom will be, of course,
of a larger mass

102
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:05,598
that we suppose to be
at rest in the lattice.

103
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,171
And now we evaluate,

104
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:11,266
based on a very simple theory
of elastic collisions,

105
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:14,771
that is, collisions that conserve energy
and momentum,

106
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:19,405
the maximum energy transfer
in this event.

107
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:24,858
So the maximum energy transfer,
let's call it Emax,

108
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:29,447
is given by the energy of the neutron
times four times the product of the masses

109
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:31,879
divided by the square
of the sum of the masses.

110
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,848
This is really simple
elastic collisions theory.

111
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:36,964
Now, the mass of the neutron
is much smaller

112
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:39,629
than the mass of our atom,

113
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,469
so we can write that's equal to En,
energy of the neutron,

114
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,114
times four times its mass
divided by the mass of the atom.

115
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,988
Let's take now numbers, examples.

116
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:54,538
I'll take Iron, so M

117
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:58,100
is 56 atomic mass units (amu)

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,602
and I'll take a neutron
issued by a fusion reaction,

119
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:05,648
that is a neutron
with an energy of 14.1 MeV.

120
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:09,047
The max energy transfer, Emax,

121
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:13,486
will be 14.1 x 10⁶,

122
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:18,486
times 4 divided by 56,
that's about 1 MeV.

123
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,711
We notice this energy is very large,

124
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:24,848
and it is, indeed, much higher

125
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:28,226
than the so-called Wigner energy,

126
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:33,386
which is typically about 25 eV.

127
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:38,865
This Wigner energy is the threshold value

128
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:43,229
for the energy at which we have
a displacement of an atom.

129
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,779
So this is the <i>threshold
displacement energy</i>.

130
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:53,536
So that means that the Iron atom

131
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:56,836
will be displaced
and ejected from the lattice.

132
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:13,201
And because this energy
that is exchanged in a collision

133
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:17,431
is much larger than the Wigner energy,
much, much larger,

134
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:22,231
this primary atom that is displaced,
called the <i>primary knock-on atom</i>,

135
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:25,757
will initiate a series
of other knock-on events.

136
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:28,822
And that will lead to what we call
an atomic displacement cascade.

137
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:33,629
So it's sort of a shower
of displacements across my material.

138
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:37,511
And this is shown
in the simulation here.

139
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:38,987
So the result is that we have

140
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:42,662
a series of so-called
<i>point structure defects</i>

141
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:46,191
because the ejected atom
will leave behind a vacancy,

142
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:51,411
that is, a hole, there.

143
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:58,868
And it will go somewhere
where it doesn't belong to,

144
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,409
and that somewhere is called
an <i>interstitial location</i>.

145
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:08,447
The pair formed by the vacancy
and interstitial location

146
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,503
is called a <i>Frenkel pair</i>.

147
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:14,932
Now this sort of effect,
I can call it damage

148
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:18,666
because it damages the 
properties of the material

149
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:23,476
is quantified in a unit called <i>dpa</i>,
or displacements per atom.

150
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:26,364
So this is the average number
of displacements

151
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:29,320
that the atom undergoes
under the irradiation.

152
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,888
That was sort of the mechanical effect
of the neutron

153
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:36,629
hitting the atoms in the lattice,

154
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:38,902
but the neutron will also cause
nuclear reactions,

155
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:40,885
in particular transmutations.

156
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:48,265
These reactions will generate impurities
in the form of helium or hydrogen gas.

157
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:53,570
And the creation of gas
inside the material lattice

158
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,960
will result in embrittlement,

159
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,278
embrittlement of grain boundaries,
in particular,

160
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:01,055
and swelling of the voids.

161
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:04,240
So here the problem is
the generation

162
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,472
of helium and hydrogen impurities,

163
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:11,100
and so this effect is quantified
in atomic parts-per-million

164
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,813
of helium or hydrogen, or <i>appm</i>.

165
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:17,153
So we have the displacement per atom,

166
00:10:17,153 --> 00:10:21,709
<i>dpa</i>, that quantifies the mechanical damage

167
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:26,167
and atomic parts-per-million
resulting from the nuclear reactions

168
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:31,147
of helium or hydrogen
that quantify the effect of transmutations.

169
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:37,961
So we do have important modifications
of the microstructure

170
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:39,700
and these modifications

171
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,833
will lead to a significant degradation
of the macroscopic properties,

172
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,964
chemical, physical, and mechanical.

173
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:51,745
Here is again a figure that represents
a sequence of possible events,

174
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:54,258
the creation of a Frenkel pair,

175
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:57,734
that is, a vacancy
and an interstitial location,

176
00:10:57,734 --> 00:11:00,040
and a transmutation

177
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,678
and also the migration of these defects
across my lattice.

178
00:11:04,678 --> 00:11:07,384
And just to give you an example
of orders of magnitude

179
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:09,549
of the numbers involved
in a fusion reactor,

180
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:15,069
let's take a fusion reactor
with a fusion power of 3GW.

181
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:20,612
That will lead to
a neutron irradiation effect

182
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:25,310
of say, 20 to 30 dpa per year in steels.

183
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,219
And just to compare that
to what we are about to see in ITER,

184
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:36,806
ITER at the end of its lifetime
will only reach a few dpa.

185
00:11:36,806 --> 00:11:39,956
So this is really a completely 
different situation,

186
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:44,622
that of an actual fusion reactor,
much, much higher radiation

187
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:48,904
of neutrons and therefore
much, much more severe effects.

188
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:52,495
In terms of the creation
of helium and hydrogen

189
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:55,035
in the reactor of that kind
we will expect something like

190
00:11:55,035 --> 00:12:00,755
10 to 15 appm of helium per dpa
and 40 to 50 appm of hydrogen per dpa.

191
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:03,760
We notice of course that dpa's
and appm's are related

192
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,508
which complicates the dynamics
of the whole process,

193
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:11,212
or the whole set of processes

194
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:17,692
and also makes it difficult to really
calculate and simulate <i>a priori</i>

195
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:19,473
what the effects can be.

196
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,439
I also notice that these ratios
of appm's to dpa's

197
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:25,906
are much higher in fusion
than in fission.

198
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,602
So in terms of the macroscopic
material properties

199
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:34,382
the 14 MeV neutrons will change,
first of all, the chemical composition,

200
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:36,899
will change the physical properties
of the material,

201
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,392
this is very important for material
that has to perform a certain function.

202
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:44,766
For example, the electrical conductivity
will be decreased

203
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:48,301
as well as the thermal conductivity,
typically for surrounding materials.

204
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:52,764
So this is something to be aware of
when designing pieces

205
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:56,994
that have to accomplish
a particular function in the reaction.

206
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:02,780
At least as importantly,
the flux of 14 MeV neutrons

207
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,067
will also influence mechanical properties.

208
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:08,040
This is very important
for structural materials, of course.

209
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,744
There will be a loss of creep strength,

210
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:18,484
that is, the resilience
to long-time scale deformations.

211
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:21,319
There will be a change
in the transition temperature

212
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:23,065
between ductile and brittle,

213
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:28,051
and there will be, in general,
a very severe effect of embrittlement.

214
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:30,536
For example, there will be hardening.

215
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:33,260
Hardening is represented here
in this plot

216
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,470
as the result of the change
in the slope of the curve

217
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,011
of stress versus strain.

218
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:46,991
There will be a loss of ductility,
which is represented by this arrow here.

219
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:54,057
So this is the shortening
of the plastic region for the deformation,

220
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:58,451
and therefore a loss
of the toughness to fractures,

221
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,587
so the fracture limit will come down
in terms of the value of the strain.

222
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:07,367
So this is a set of very severe effects
on the mechanical properties

223
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:08,829
of the material.

224
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,959
There will also be actually 
a literal change of dimensions

225
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,077
of the mechanical pieces.

226
00:14:17,077 --> 00:14:18,948
There will be swelling
due to the radiation,

227
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:20,596
due to the bubbles
that will be created

228
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:23,321
inside the lattice
due to the generation of gas.

229
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,022
There will be so-called irradiation creep,

230
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:30,477
this is a slow deformation under
irradiation of neutrons.

231
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:36,967
And all of this will alter
the physical structure of the materials.

232
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:40,416
So let's go to the possible choices
that we have

233
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,745
for the materials for fusion.

234
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:45,889
We have said we want
a low activation material,

235
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:48,180
so we have to have
low activation elements

236
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,507
in the chemical composition
of our candidate structure materials.

237
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:55,177
For example; iron, chromium, vanadium,

238
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:59,002
titanium, tungsten, silicon, and carbon.

239
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:05,072
We also have to consider safety,
waste disposal, and performance,

240
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,929
both in terms of mechanical
and thermal considerations

241
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:10,721
in order to make our choice.

242
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:15,576
So if we consider all of that
the leading candidates for DEMO

243
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:18,704
and for the reactors are listed here.

244
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:23,335
So we have the reduced activation
ferritic/martensitic steels

245
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:25,002
as possible candidates,

246
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:29,181
something we are already
quite close to achieving,

247
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,658
really good properties,

248
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:32,660
vanadium alloys, a little more advanced,

249
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,614
tungsten alloys
and silicon carbide composites

250
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:38,425
would be the lowest
in terms of the activation

251
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:39,813
under neutron irradiation,

252
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,426
so it would be the preferable solution,
in long-term, at least.

253
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,846
I'd like to comment on the need
to test materials for fusion.

254
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:51,462
Because of what we have seen
at the beginning of this lecture,

255
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:55,425
that is, the fact that in fusion
the spectrum of the neutrons

256
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:57,416
is very different
from that of fission

257
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,641
and also the flux
and fluence are very different.

258
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:05,121
We have very little, if none,
experimental knowledge

259
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,921
of materials' behavior
in conditions that are equivalent

260
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:11,051
to what we expect
for a fusion reactor.

261
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:15,795
I'd like to highlight that
in the plot here

262
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:23,055
where we show the set of possible
tests that have been done

263
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:27,002
or will be done in materials

264
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:33,762
on the axis in vertical of appm in helium
and horizontal on dpa.

265
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:38,603
Now we notice ITER is here in green,

266
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:44,053
but the fusion reactor will work
in a very different set of conditions.

267
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:47,818
There will be a huge factor
in the appm in Helium

268
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:50,153
and a huge fhctor in the dpa.

269
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:54,331
So even when we learn
something from ITER

270
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:58,016
in terms of the materials properties
and the neutron irradiation from fusion,

271
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,606
we'll be really very far from 
being in a regime

272
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:02,802
that's of relevance for the reactor.

273
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,745
And the point that's often made
by materials scientists

274
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:08,787
is that the extrapolation
from current conditions to fusion regime

275
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:12,750
is much larger, much bigger of a jump,

276
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,592
than it is for the core plasma parameters.

277
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:22,126
So we are much further away
from knowing the properties and materials

278
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:23,836
and the neutron irradiation in fusion

279
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:28,147
than we are from knowing
the properties of the core plasma

280
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:32,397
based on present experiments
and present experimental knowledge.

281
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:40,245
Which is why, I think, it's fair to say
that we universally recognize the need

282
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:43,591
to go expeditiously toward
tests of materials for fusion.

283
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:45,451
There are two approaches
that can be taken,

284
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:47,836
in fact can be taken in parallel.

285
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:50,738
We can think of
volumetric neutron sources,

286
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:54,790
for example, fusion tokamaks
that don't need necessarily

287
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,799
to have a high gain,

288
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,816
because all they need to do
is to produce a large neutron flux.

289
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:04,084
Of course, of the same spectrum
as you anticipate for the reactor,

290
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,478
that is, neutrons produced by DT.

291
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:10,621
This is something we refer to
as components test facility,

292
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:12,684
there are several ideas
and several designs

293
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:15,193
that have already been considered
around the world.

294
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:17,896
And in parellel with that
we can actually consider

295
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,437
facilities based on accelerators.

296
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:25,660
An example of that is
the international IFMIF project

297
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,205
that's under design and discussion.

298
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:33,650
This is an accelerator-based
test facility,

299
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,308
you can see the size of it,
this is a human being,

300
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:41,375
very very small compared to
the overall size of the installation.

301
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:47,075
The main part of this facility here
is the accelerator,

302
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:53,234
which accelerates 
a beam of deuterium ions.

303
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:58,434
That beam is then made to impinge
on the liquid lithium target

304
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:03,392
which will therefore generate
neutrons of a similar spectrum

305
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,828
to those that we anticipate
for the DT reactors.

306
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:11,995
An interesting issue is that there will be
only a very small volume

307
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:13,459
that will be subject to the irradiation,

308
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:17,236
irradiation levels that are, say,
reactor-relevant.

309
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:21,515
So a volume that will go up to
20 dpa or so per year,

310
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:23,906
after a year of full operation, 
by the way,

311
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:26,403
will be less than a liter,
will be typically half a liter.

312
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:30,453
And so there actually is 
sort of a scientific discipline

313
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:33,598
that will teach us how to
extrapolate the results

314
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:37,160
obtained in such a small volume,
with specimens that are very small

315
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,460
as in this example in the picture,

316
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:46,530
to the behavior of a very large
structural material construction

317
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,645
such as that that we need for
the fusion reactor.

318
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:53,105
This is so-called <i>small specimen
test technology</i>.

319
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:58,321
In summary, we have had
a relatively simplistic

320
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:01,128
and quick discussion
of the problem of materials in fusion.

321
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:05,594
Nevertheless, we have been able
to identify a few key elements.

322
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:10,402
Fusion materials really must satisfy
a number of stringent requirements.

323
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:12,903
The material properties
are severely affected

324
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:15,957
by the irradiation of the neutrons
issued by the fusion reactions,

325
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:21,887
that is, neutrons at high energy,
with 14.1 MeV of energy.

326
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,622
We also underlined the fact
that our experimental knowledge

327
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:29,740
of the effects of these neutrons
on materials is very incomplete.

328
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,250
And therefore we need to
really move quickly

329
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,495
towards the phase in which we test
the properties of the candidate materials

330
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:38,325
that we foresee for the fusion reactors.

331
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:41,658
In both the previous lecture
and this lecture

332
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:45,652
we underlined the fact
that I like to conclude this lecture with,

333
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:46,741
and that is;

334
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:49,254
materials science plays
an absolutely crucial role

335
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:51,664
in fusion energy research in general.
