00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,885
Welcome to the course on Plasma Physics 
and Applications.

2
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,458
Today, we will explore 
thermonuclear fusion

3
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:15,776
a little bit more by looking at 
the power balance in a reactor

4
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:18,367
and the conditions for 
the reactor to operate.

5
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,622
In particular, we will explore how 
to calculate the fusion power density,

6
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,296
the losses in a fusion reactor, 
and the balance between

7
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:27,147
energy production and losses.

8
00:00:27,147 --> 00:00:30,304
We'll derive the conditions from 
breakeven and ignition.

9
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:33,970
And finally we will define 
the fusion energy gain

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,498
and we'll really clarify the conditions 
under which the energy production

11
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:40,526
can be obtained for a fusion reactor.

12
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:46,482
As a reminder of what we have discussed 
in a previous course,

13
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:51,700
here I have reported the same picture 
we have shown with a D-T reaction.

14
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,046
A D-T reaction has the 
largest cross section

15
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:57,259
at not too large temperatures,
which means that's the one we chose

16
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,404
for operating the first generation 
of fusion reactor.

17
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:04,100
Each reaction gives an energy 
that's the sum of

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,247
the alpha particle energy of 3.5MeV

19
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:11,902
and that of the neutron at 14MeV 
for a total of 17.6MeV.

20
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:17,597
We can look at the fusion power density 
from such reaction.

21
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:21,477
If we take a particular 
relative velocity, v,

22
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:24,148
that is a particular energy 
in the collision

23
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:26,490
between the deuterium 
and tritium nuclei,

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,358
we can evaluate the number of reactions 
per second per volume

25
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:36,497
and multiply that times the energy 
for one reaction to get the power density

26
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,396
that comes from the D-T reactions.

27
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:43,348
This is the expression in here where 
we underline the fact that

28
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:47,840
we have a dependence upon the velocity 
in the different terms

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,284
and therefore the overall result 
is still a function of velocity or energy.

30
00:01:53,253 --> 00:01:55,944
To get the fusion power density 
in the whole plasma

31
00:01:55,944 --> 00:02:00,587
we need to integrate over the distribution
of velocities of Deuterium and Tritium.

32
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,305
We do that by assuming that 
the plasma is neutral,

33
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:09,002
that is, the density of the Deuterium 
and Tritium nuclei

34
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:12,992
correspond each to half of 
the electron density,

35
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:16,373
which we will refer to as just <i>n</i>.

36
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:19,747
We also neglect impurities 
and we neglect the effect

37
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:22,041
of the alpha particle density.

38
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:24,980
The density that is of the alpha particles 
that are produced by

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,050
the fusion reactions themselves.

40
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:31,858
We neglect that effect on 
the overall charge balance in the plasma.

41
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:36,257
We therefore come up 
with an expression

42
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,797
which gives us the fusion power density,

43
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:42,227
now not a function of velocity 
or energy anymore

44
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:44,547
but it's an overall property 
of the plasma,

45
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:50,560
which is then given by the reactivity 
integrated over velocity.

46
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,569
The integration, again, is given by 
this symbol that we see here

47
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:01,350
and we replace the electron density 
we come up with a general expression

48
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:07,290
that contains just the electron density 
<i>n</i> squared, the fusion reactivity

49
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,627
for of course the D-T fusion reaction 
that we consider throughout the course

50
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:16,512
and the energy provided 
by a single reaction, which is ΔEf.

51
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,511
Before proceeding to more complicated 
power balance exercises,

52
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:26,178
I'd like to just do a brief 
numerical exercise.

53
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:31,342
Here we consider the curve 
for the reaction rate

54
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:33,556
calculated for a maxwellian distribution,

55
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:37,864
in fact for two maxwellian distributions 
for both Deuterium and Tritium.

56
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:40,011
This curve is given here

57
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:45,261
and it's expressed as a function 
of temperature of the plasma.

58
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:48,990
We suppose to have plasma at 20keV

59
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:54,071
and the density of 5 times 10 ²⁰ 
per cubic meter.

60
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:59,165
So we look up the curve 
that's plotted here for 20keV.

61
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:04,813
It's this line, and we consider the value that

62
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:07,937
corresponds to that temperature for <σv>.

63
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:14,031
That value is about 4 times 10⁻²²

64
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:19,243
in terms of meters 
to the third power per second.

65
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:23,388
So the question we want to address 
in this simple numerical exercise

66
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,280
is how much of a plasma or in other words,

67
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,842
how big a volume do we need 
to produce 1GW of fusion power?

68
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:36,423
To calculate that we take this value 
that we have just identified graphically,

69
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:43,171
for the <σv> for D-T at 20keV 
of temperature.

70
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,296
We have said that is about

71
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:49,865
4 times 10⁻²² meter 
to the third per second

72
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:53,825
and we can then evaluate the volume, 
which is the fusion power

73
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,994
divided by the fusion power density.

74
00:04:57,514 --> 00:05:02,495
We have chosen a reactor that produces 
1GW of fusion power.

75
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,102
So that's 10⁹ joules per second.

76
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:10,045
And of course we have to divide 
that by the fusion power density

77
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:13,832
that's given by the expression 
we have considered before.

78
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:19,061
We can proceed in 
this numerical evaluation

79
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,791
and put the numbers for our example.

80
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,772
So I have replaced all the values

81
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:28,835
for the expression 
for the fusion power density.

82
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:31,429
We can now simplify the expression

83
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:34,800
at least in terms of 
the measurement units.

84
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:45,564
And we find our final result which is 
about 14 cubic meters.

85
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:52,412
So to produce 1GW of fusion power 
in a plasma of about 20keV

86
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:55,962
with 5 times 10²⁰ 
per cubic meter of density

87
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:59,529
we need about 14 cubic meters of plasma.

88
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:02,553
That's an absolute reasonable volume.

89
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:06,444
It's not gigantic, nor is it microscopic.

90
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:10,550
So this is giving us confidence 
that we can proceed in our balance

91
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,747
between the power production by fusion

92
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:16,227
and the losses can come up 
with a condition

93
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:18,512
for a fusion reactor to operate.

94
00:06:19,351 --> 00:06:22,465
Let's start with some 
general considerations.

95
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:27,153
In steady state, the sum of the power 
that we inject into the plasma

96
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,851
from outside and that is produced 
and kept in the plasma

97
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:34,175
must be equal to the losses.

98
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:37,679
So that means that 
the heating of the plasma is equal

99
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:40,333
to the losses from the plasma.

100
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,722
The heating from the plasma comes 
from what we inject from outside

101
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,609
and what the fusion reactions give

102
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:51,597
in terms of by-products that 
are kept inside the plasma

103
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,739
and that is the alpha particles.

104
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:57,087
What kind of losses do we have?

105
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:59,230
We have two kinds of losses.

106
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,663
We can consider that the plasma 
is made of charged particles

107
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:04,076
that are subject to acceleration.

108
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:07,126
So there are radiative losses.

109
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:14,512
But the plasma is also a fluid 
that's subject to direct losses,

110
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:17,593
like convection and conduction.

111
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:22,896
So if I want to complete my little picture
here with the overall balance,

112
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:26,225
I need to consider that in 
the core of the plasma

113
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:30,051
we have the alpha heating, Pα,

114
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:37,765
and that, coming from outside, 
we also have the input power

115
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:44,186
heating that we produce from outside 
and inject into the plasma.

116
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:48,556
So this is now the power balance 
with two kinds of losses,

117
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:52,880
radiative and direct 
and the two sources of heating

118
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,111
for the plasma.

119
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,193
Again, in power from outside 
and the alpha particle power

120
00:07:58,193 --> 00:08:00,957
from the fusion reaction themselves.

121
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:05,868
Let's look a little bit more in detail 
at the radiative losses.

122
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,544
Radiative losses are in 
the form of bremsstrahlung,

123
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:15,464
this is the radiation that is produced 
by the acceleration of electrons

124
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:19,158
in the field created by ions 
or by other electrons.

125
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:26,227
The radiative power by bremsstrahlung 
can be expressed or at least it's density,

126
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:30,618
that is the power by the volume, 
can be expressed in terms of

127
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:35,116
a simple expression proportional 
to the square of the density

128
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:40,666
to the square root of the temperature 
and to a parameter called <i>Zeff</i>

129
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:47,731
which is defined here, which basically 
describes the average charge state

130
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:49,884
of the ions in the plasma.

131
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:53,282
For thermonuclear temperatures, 
the bremsstrahlung radiation

132
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,566
is in a range of X-rays 
to which the plasma

133
00:08:56,676 --> 00:09:01,020
and the vessel that contains the plasma 
are mostly transparent

134
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,597
and that's why we consider 
this as a net loss.

135
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:07,847
The spectrum of the radiation by
bremsstrahlung is indicated here

136
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:14,322
and we see that for example for 
30keV, it is in the range of X-rays.

137
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:22,766
Having seen what the radiative losses are,
we can look now at the direct losses

138
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:24,477
in the fusion reactor.

139
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:27,651
These are the conductive 
and convective losses.

140
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,391
In fact, we can describe them 
in a very simple way

141
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:34,919
using a single parameter called 
"energy confinement time", τE,

142
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:38,151
which is the characteristic time 
over which the energy is transported

143
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:39,744
outside the plasma.

144
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:45,162
If we assume equipartition of energy 
between the ion and electron species,

145
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:51,710
meaning that each species 
has an average energy of 3/2T

146
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:58,311
the volume is at the denominator in order 
to calculate the power density

147
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:03,985
for the losses and the expression 
is therefore simply given

148
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:08,605
by the energy content of the plasma
[divided] by the volume,

149
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:13,810
divided by this confinement time, τE, 
which is actually defined

150
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,795
through this equality.

151
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:21,834
The energy density of the plasma 
is simply the product of density

152
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:27,170
and temperature times 3
and so it is 3n T / τE

153
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,413
as an overall estimate for 
the direct losses from the plasma.

154
00:10:33,577 --> 00:10:37,518
We are now ready to calculate 
the power balance in a fusion reactor.

155
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,208
Let's do that by defining first

156
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:44,516
a physics fusion gain.

157
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:47,372
We refer to that as capital Q.

158
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:51,708
That's the ratio between the fusion power 
and the input power.

159
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:56,598
Naturally a reactor can only work 
if Q is larger than one.

160
00:10:56,598 --> 00:11:00,444
That is if we gain power from the system.

161
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:06,274
The frontier that is the value 
of Q equal to one

162
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:07,922
is called the <i>breakeven</i>.

163
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,737
So that's the situation in which

164
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:14,355
fusion power and input power
are identical.

165
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:19,755
Let's evaluate this condition 
for the value of Q to be larger

166
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,245
or equal to one.

167
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,809
As the sum of the input power 
from outside the reactor

168
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,798
and the alpha particle power 
has to be equal to the losses.

169
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:34,026
I can replace <i>Pin</i> by the difference 
between the losses

170
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,784
and the alpha particle power.

171
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:40,295
Here I have a specifically indicated 
the two kinds of losses.

172
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:43,120
The direct losses: convection 
and conduction.

173
00:11:43,513 --> 00:11:45,373
And the bremsstrahlung losses.

174
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:50,581
Now we can replace the expressions 
that we have derived before

175
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,112
in this ratio.

176
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:07,208
Notice that in the expression 
for total fusion power,

177
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:11,900
the energy gained per reaction 
is the total ΔEF

178
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,116
while in the expression for 
the alpha particle power

179
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:19,424
all the other terms are the same 
but the energy gain per reaction

180
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:22,628
is of course only the power carried 
by the α, ΔEα.

181
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:26,069
Let's simplify this expression 
a little bit.

182
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:35,231
And write n τE in front of all 
the other terms.

183
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:49,873
I notice that the sum of 
the total energy output

184
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:53,831
of a single reaction 
and the alpha particle output

185
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:57,684
of a single reaction appears here
but we know that

186
00:12:57,906 --> 00:13:02,595
the total energy output of 
a single reaction is about five times

187
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:05,902
the energy carried by the alpha.

188
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,601
So I can write this as ΔEF

189
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:12,481
times 1 + ⅕ which of course is

190
00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:14,924
6/5 ΔEF.

191
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,707
I can therefore write n τE

192
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:21,440
in a more compact way

193
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:26,126
and impose that it 
be equal or bigger than

194
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,260
12 times the temperature divided 
by 6/5 times the reaction rate

195
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:34,639
times the energy produced in 
a single reaction

196
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:37,277
minus the bremsstrahlung term.

197
00:13:38,596 --> 00:13:41,326
This is the first expression that tells us

198
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:47,804
how good the quality of the confinement 
needs to be at least in a situation

199
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:52,614
in which we start gaining energy 
from a fusion reactor.

200
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,430
That expression is a little bit 
complicated still,

201
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,715
so let's simplify it 
by observing the following.

202
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:06,089
At temperatures that 
are significantly larger than 1keV,

203
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:09,393
that is temperatures that are of interest
for our thermonuclear burn,

204
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:15,079
the bremsstrahlung term becomes 
very small compared to the other term.

205
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:21,408
So that we can neglect it all together 
and write n τE

206
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:28,732
equal or larger than 12T divided by 
the usual fusion power production term.

207
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:33,383
We can simplify this expression 
and come up with a very simple expression

208
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:37,096
that is 10 times the temperature,
divided by <σv>

209
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:39,509
times the energy of a single reaction.

210
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:41,835
We can call this 1/f(T).

211
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:44,984
Having defined the function 
of temperature,

212
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,187
and I'd like to underline the fact 
that it is depending on temperature,

213
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:52,205
which is <σv>, which itself is 
a function of temperature,

214
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,744
times the energy of a reaction,
divided by 10 T.

215
00:14:55,654 --> 00:14:58,918
We can represent this 
condition graphically.

216
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:05,575
Plotting n τE on the vertical axis

217
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,686
and the temperature 
on the horizontal axis.

218
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,735
The function 1/ f(T) is represented 
by this red curve.

219
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:17,972
That corresponds to the Q = 1 situation or

220
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,367
breakeven situation.

221
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:27,027
So reactors can have a hope to work 
in a region in green here

222
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,755
at both that line.

223
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:35,038
If we take a typical value on this curve, 
we have about 10²⁰

224
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:39,679
per cubic meter times second 
in terms of n τE

225
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,152
and about 10keV of temperature.

226
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:46,713
So we have to do better than 
the combination of these two values

227
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:51,599
in order to be in a region where 
the reactor can work.

228
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:57,892
In actual reactors, of course breakeven 
must be exceeded

229
00:15:57,892 --> 00:16:01,144
because the efficiency conversions 
of fusion power into electricity

230
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:03,905
and the efficiency of conversion of 
electricity into plasma heating

231
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:07,031
they're both less than 100 percent.

232
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:13,844
Let's look at the ultimate limit, 
which we refer to as <i>ignition</i>.

233
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,332
That's the limit at which all 
the plasma heating is provided

234
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:20,626
by the fusion alphas and no external power
is needed to sustain the reactions.

235
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,420
In a quantitative manner 
we can define that as Q

236
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,834
which is the ratio of fusion power 
to input power as going to infinity

237
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:34,497
or as the input power goes to zero.

238
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:38,290
Let's translate this into 
an expression for n τE.

239
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,186
So we have Pin equals zero,

240
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:46,102
that means that Pα must be 
larger than the losses

241
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:53,178
which we have said can be represented
only by the direct loss term

242
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:55,897
as we can neglect bremsstrahlung.

243
00:16:56,445 --> 00:16:58,950
So we can write the expression for Pα

244
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:05,051
and impose that it be larger 
than the losses by direct losses,

245
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:08,685
which are given by 3nT divided 
by the confinement time.

246
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,190
So that means I can write n τE

247
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:20,025
at ignition and impose that it 
be larger than 12 times the temperature

248
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,316
divided by <σv> times the energy 
that the alpha particles

249
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:29,110
carry after a fusion reaction.

250
00:17:30,462 --> 00:17:35,307
We notice that that is 
6/f( T)

251
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:38,457
where f(T) was the function 
that described breakeven

252
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:42,214
introduced before,
which we can write six times

253
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:45,947
the condition from breakeven 
in terms of n τE.

254
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:55,055
In practice a reactor can and will work 
between breakeven and ignition.

255
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:00,208
That is between one and infinity 
for the value of the fusion gain Q.

256
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,131
So if we look at the graph here, 
we have two curves.

257
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:06,573
The red curve corresponds to ignition.

258
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,005
The blue curve corresponds to breakeven.

259
00:18:12,844 --> 00:18:14,609
And the reactor will operate in between,

260
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,785
in this green region.

261
00:18:17,957 --> 00:18:20,548
If we define the fraction 
of alpha particle heating,

262
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:24,630
that is the fraction between 
the heating from the alphas

263
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,072
to the total heating of the plasma

264
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:31,081
that corresponds to about Q over Q + 5,

265
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:33,140
this expression.

266
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,448
So if you want the alpha particle heating 
to dominate over the total heating

267
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,539
and that is what we originally 
refer to as the <i>burning plasma</i>,

268
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:43,451
that is achieved for Q larger than five.

269
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,753
Finally we need to look at 
the reality of a reactor.

270
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:53,838
We have finite conversion efficiencies 
and to account for those

271
00:18:53,838 --> 00:18:59,390
we actually define a value of gain, 
which is referred to as

272
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,986
the <i>engineering gain</i>, Q sub E

273
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:07,461
and we define it as the ratio 
between the net electric power out

274
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:09,828
to the net electric power in.

275
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:14,740
Or Pout(E) (in engineering terms) minus 
Pin(E) (in engineering terms)

276
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,183
divided by Pin(E) (in engineering terms).

277
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:22,101
Now the Pin(E) 
corresponds to the power

278
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:25,248
that goes in the plasma
divided by the efficiency,

279
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:30,158
which we call ηe of the conversion 
of the electrical power

280
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:32,250
into the plasma heating.

281
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,461
We also have to consider that 
the conversion of fusion power

282
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:38,840
to electricity is not 
100 percent efficient,

283
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,242
therefore we evaluate that

284
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:47,864
as follows: Pout will be 
a finite efficiency term,

285
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,261
ηt, times the input power

286
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,147
plus the fusion power.

287
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:59,035
So let's elaborate on this engineering QE.

288
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:09,153
QE is equal to ηt (Pf + Pin) 
- Pin/ηe.

289
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:14,711
These two terms are respectively 
the output power in engineering terms (Pout(E))

290
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:16,963
and the input power in engineering terms (Pin(E))

291
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:20,013
divided by the input power 
engineering terms (Pin(E)).

292
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:25,509
That is equal to the product of 
the two efficiencies,

293
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:31,002
times the total power, minus 
input power, divided by the input power.

294
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:35,018
We define an overall efficiency η

295
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:37,720
as the product of the two efficiencies.

296
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:40,896
So that we can simplify the expression

297
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:45,327
and use the definition of the fusion 
capital Q, the fusion gain,

298
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:51,980
to get a final expression that relates 
the engineering gain to the fusion gain

299
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,560
via, of course, the overall efficiencies 
of the two processes

300
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,953
combined into a single parameter η.

301
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:02,355
We can represent this relationship 
in a graphic term.

302
00:21:04,227 --> 00:21:08,870
And plot the gain as a function of what 
we refer to as the <i>triple product</i>,

303
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,366
the product of n times 
the confinement times

304
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:13,612
times the temperature.
(n τE T)

305
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:16,240
There is a value at which

306
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:21,655
this gain will go to infinity 
that corresponds to ignition

307
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:26,135
and we can compare the two curves 
in a qualitative fashion.

308
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:28,635
The physics fusion gain

309
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:31,468
and the engineering fusion gain,

310
00:21:31,982 --> 00:21:34,574
which would be significantly lower.

311
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,975
Let's conclude with a numeric example.

312
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:44,661
I take a reasonably optimistic
set of values,

313
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:49,551
I take 70% for the conversion 
efficiency of electrical power

314
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:54,299
into plasma heating and 40% 
for the conversion efficiency

315
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,926
of fusion power into electricity.

316
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,072
That means the product of 
the two is 28%

317
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:09,232
and QE corresponds to .28 times 
the physics gain Q

318
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:10,796
minus .72

319
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:12,529
For example,

320
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,420
if I have an engineering Q of about 10

321
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,014
that corresponds to or in fact needs

322
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,973
a physics gain

323
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:26,149
of about 40.

324
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:31,333
Vice versa, if I have a value 
of the physics gain

325
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:40,414
that is Q = 10, that corresponds 
to an engineering gain of about 2.

326
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:47,814
So we have seen that we need 
for a reactor to work two conditions

327
00:22:47,814 --> 00:22:49,965
to be satisfied at the same time:

328
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:54,071
the product n τE, 
where τE is a confinement time

329
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:57,702
and n is the density, must be 
of the order of 10²⁰

330
00:22:57,702 --> 00:22:59,385
per cubic meter second,

331
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:05,553
--at least of that order-- and the temperature
has to be at least of about 10keV.

332
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:11,249
We have three ways to achieve 
these conditions or three possible ways

333
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:12,850
to achieve these conditions.

334
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,389
First of all, we have the 
gravitational confinement.

335
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:18,028
That's the way the stars work, 
like the sun.

336
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:21,555
They hold the plasma together 
by gravitational forces.

337
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:24,629
That's very impractical on earth, 
of course.

338
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:28,421
And we have two possibilities 
for a reactor.

339
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:31,781
We have the possibility of 
magnetic confinement

340
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:37,305
which corresponds to a density of 
about 10²⁰ per cubic meter,

341
00:23:38,404 --> 00:23:42,544
very small amount of particles 
in fact in space there

342
00:23:43,217 --> 00:23:45,823
but because their product has to be

343
00:23:45,823 --> 00:23:48,899
about 10²⁰ per cubic meter times second,

344
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:52,785
that means having a confinement time 
for the energy of about one second

345
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:55,516
and this confinement scheme 
which we'll discuss in the next lecture,

346
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:58,046
of course is based on the usage 
of magnetic fields

347
00:23:58,046 --> 00:24:02,664
to trap the particles of the plasma 
in a given volume.

348
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,951
The sort of opposite approach 
is that of a inertial confinement

349
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:10,034
where the density would be pushed 
to very very large values,

350
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:14,275
typically 10³⁰, 10³¹ per cubic meter

351
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:16,562
which means that the confinement time

352
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:20,936
can be very small like 10⁻⁹ seconds (1 nanosecond)

353
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:24,041
yet to have a product that 
would make it work.

354
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,429
This inertia confinement, again, 
will be discussed in the next lecture

355
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:31,899
and it's based on very 
small pellets that are

356
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:36,877
made to implode via a very large 
deposition of power on their surface.

357
00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:42,798
In summary, we have seen that we can 
evaluate the fusion power density

358
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,369
on the basis of plasma density 
and temperature

359
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:47,969
using the fusion reaction rate <σv>.

360
00:24:49,352 --> 00:24:54,039
We can evaluate the power losses, 
which are dominated by direct losses.

361
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,971
That is conductive and convective.

362
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,440
And they're quantified by 
a single parameter

363
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,564
called the confinement time τE.

364
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:04,253
We also demonstrated that 
the net power production,

365
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,913
that's all we want from fusion reactor,

366
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:09,322
requires a physics fusion gain 
larger than 20

367
00:25:09,322 --> 00:25:14,203
and that is between the breakeven 
condition where Q = 1

368
00:25:14,203 --> 00:25:16,899
and the ignition condition 
where Q equals infinity.
