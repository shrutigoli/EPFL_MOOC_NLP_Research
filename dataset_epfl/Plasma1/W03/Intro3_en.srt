1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:04,956
While quite accurate, the kinetic model
that has been introduced in lecture 2

2
00:00:04,956 --> 00:00:07,170
is in many cases too complicated,

3
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:10,328
both from the analytical
and the numerical point of view,

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,181
to study the dynamics of a plasma
in an actual situation.

5
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:17,575
For this reason, simpler models
based on the fluid set of equations

6
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:19,083
have been derived.

7
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,333
They have been derived
from the kinetic model.

8
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,829
These models still constitute today
the workhorse for the investigation

9
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:26,292
of plasma dynamics.

10
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:31,019
The advantage of the fluid models is
that they have a lower dimensionality.

11
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:33,919
The description of the plasma dynamics

12
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:37,051
passes from being 
a six-dimensional description

13
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,300
to a three-dimensional investigation.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,439
This ultimately allows
a deeper understanding

15
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,099
of the physics model
and more accessible plasma simulations.

16
00:00:46,956 --> 00:00:50,187
Two models of the plasma dynamics
will be presented in this lecture:

17
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:53,904
First, the two-fluid model,
which is based on treating electrons

18
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,785
and ions as two separate fluids;

19
00:00:56,495 --> 00:01:02,183
second, the so-called magnetohydrodynamics
or MHD model, which describes

20
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:05,144
the plasma dynamics
as the evolution of a single fluid.

21
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:09,362
We will learn how to formally derive
both models and we will see

22
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:12,622
some applications focusing
on the waves that these models predict.

23
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,838
The lecture will span over two weeks

24
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:19,866
and will be given by Professor Paolo Ricci,
head of the theory group at CRPP,

25
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:22,732
and by Dr. Duccio Testa,
a researcher working

26
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:24,753
at CRPP on the TCV tokamak.
