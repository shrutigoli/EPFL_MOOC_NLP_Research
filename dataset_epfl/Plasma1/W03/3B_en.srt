1
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:06,881
Welcome.

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,965
Welcome to the 
Plasma Physics course of EPFL.

3
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,284
In the past module,
we have deduced the two-fluid equation.

4
00:00:15,284 --> 00:00:19,403
In the present one, we will deduce
the two-fluid dispersion relation.

5
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:24,091
That is, the relation between the
frequency and the wave number of the waves

6
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:27,328
and instability that are described
by the two-fluid model.

7
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:31,282
In order to do that,
the first thing that I will do with you

8
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:36,143
is to recall the main elements
of the linearization

9
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:38,484
and the Fourier mode analysis.

10
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:43,266
Then we will linearize
and Fourier transform

11
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:46,973
both Maxwell equations
and the two-fluid equations.

12
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:52,183
And at that point, we will deduce together
the two-fluid dispersion relation.

13
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:58,028
So let's recall together very briefly,
the main elements of

14
00:00:58,028 --> 00:01:00,579
linearization Fourier mode analysis,

15
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:05,956
something that we have already applied
within the kinetic model of plasmas.

16
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:11,336
Our goal is to study the evolution of
small amplitude perturbations

17
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:13,355
on top of an equilibrium.

18
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:18,276
Let's take an example
to one of the continuity equation.

19
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:21,619
This says that the time derivative
of the density

20
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:24,433
is due to the divergence of the flux.

21
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:28,705
In order to study the evolution
of small amplitude perturbations

22
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:32,467
on top of the equilibrium,
the first thing that we have to do

23
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:37,995
is to separate the equilibrium quantities
and the small perturbations.

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,338
Basically, we will write the density,
for example,

25
00:01:42,924 --> 00:01:45,600
which is a function of space and time,

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:54,452
as the sum of n₀, a constant
which does not depend on space nor time,

27
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:57,744
plus a perturbation n₁(r,t)

28
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:00,173
and as we are dealing
with small perturbations,

29
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:05,994
we will assume that n₁(r,t) is much,
much smaller than n₀.

30
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:10,989
Similarly for the velocity,
we will say that this is given

31
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,026
by an equilibrium quantity u₀
plus the perturbation u₁(r,t),

32
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:21,652
Now, if we look at the case
of static equilibrium,

33
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:25,206
we will have that this u₀
will be equal to zero.

34
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:33,068
And therefore, u will only be given
by this small perturbed velocity, u₁(r,t).

35
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,451
The second step we do
is linearizing the equation,

36
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:41,018
retaining only the leading order terms.

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,455
The idea is to replace n with
n₀ + n₁(r,t),

38
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:51,886
and the u with u₀ + u₁(r,t).

39
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,494
Now again, in the case of
static equilibrium,

40
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:03,369
we can put u₀ equal to zero

41
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:08,515
and that equation we have just written
becomes ∂n₀/∂t

42
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:13,683
by expliciting this time derivative,
∂n₁/∂t,

43
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:21,875
and then we will have -taking u₀ = 0,
∇⋅(n₀ u₁) ...,

44
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:27,535
and ... ∇⋅(n₁ u₁) = 0

45
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:33,388
Now n₀ does not depend on time
nor on space, so this is equal to zero.

46
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:39,974
Here we have a n₁ term,
we have n₀ u₁,

47
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:44,771
and here we have a term
that is the product of two quantities

48
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:51,912
that are perturbed quantities,
and therefore which is much smaller

49
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:55,949
than the other two terms
that we are retaining.

50
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:02,026
It's quadratic in terms of
the perturbed quantities

51
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:07,036
while these terms are linear
in the perturbed quantities.

52
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:11,309
This is therefore, in other terms,
a higher order term,

53
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:14,046
and therefore can be neglected.

54
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:21,544
What we come up with is an equation
that relates ∂n₁/∂t

55
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:26,754
-with taking n₀ constant out,

56
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:30,980
... n₀ ∇⋅u₁ = 0.

57
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:36,336
At this point we can apply
our Fourier analysis.

58
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:42,786
We write, in fact, that n₁(r,t),
which is a function of space and time,

59
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:48,032
is given by the integral
of the Fourier modes.

60
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:53,511
Therefore it will be given by the double
integral over all wavenumbers,

61
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:59,433
all frequencies of the Fourier transform,
which I will denote with a <i>tilde</i>, of

62
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:13,023
ñ₁(K,ω) exp {i (K ⋅ r - ωt) }

63
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:19,036
The advantage of doing that is that
by Fourier transforming, operators

64
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:25,378
like the nabla (∇) operator
will become very easy in Fourier space.

65
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:29,856
For example,
∇ becomes the operator i K⋅

66
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:36,421
and ∂/∂t becomes the -iω operator,

67
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:40,880
it implies that by
Fourier transforming this equation

68
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,781
and looking at the evolution
of each Fourier mode,

69
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:50,805
as each Fourier mode
is independent from all the others,

70
00:05:50,805 --> 00:06:08,039
we get that 
-iω ñ₁ + n₀ i K⋅ũ₁= 0

71
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:13,725
which is the equation that relates the 
Fourier modes ñ₁(K,ω) and ũ₁(K,ω).

72
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:20,221
We are now ready to linearize
and Fourier transform

73
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:23,581
both the Maxwell equations
and the two-fluid equations.

74
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:26,209
Let's start with the Maxwell equations.

75
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:35,755
The equation that are interesting for us
are ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

76
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:44,824
and 
∇ × B = μ₀ j + 1/c² ∂E/∂t .

77
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:49,444
From these two equations,
taking the curl of the first equation

78
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:59,661
we have that 
∇×(∇×E) = -∂/∂t(∇×B)

79
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:10,062
which is equal to 
-∂/∂t (μ₀j + 1/c² ∂E/∂t)

80
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:26,158
Bringing the time derivative in,
this is equal to -μ₀∂j/∂t - 1/c² ∂²E/∂t².

81
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,375
This is the equation
we want to linearize.

82
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:34,184
The first thing we notice is that
equilibrium terms in this equation

83
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:35,952
do not play any role.

84
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:41,327
In fact, here we are dealing
with spatial or temporal derivative,

85
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:46,365
and therefore the constant uniform value 
of the equilibrium do not matter.

86
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:51,816
Therefore, only the perturbed 
terms enter in this equation

87
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:56,661
and if we Fourier transform this equation
and we linearize it,

88
00:07:56,661 --> 00:08:22,844
we find 
-K×(K×Ẽ₁) = μ₀ iω j̃₁ + ω²/c² Ẽ₁

89
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:31,080
Here we have an ugly beast,
the K×(K×Ẽ₁).

90
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,077
Actually this expression can be simplified
by using vector properties

91
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:42,014
that I will remind in a few seconds.

92
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:52,783
K×(K×Ẽ₁) = K² 
- the modulus of <i>K²</i>,

93
00:08:53,375 --> 00:09:05,915
and then the tensor KK/K²
minus the unity dyad, times Ẽ₁.

94
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:09,927
What do I mean with the KK tensor?

95
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:18,077
Component by component,
it's the matrix that has the i j element,

96
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:21,801
the value K i K j ,

97
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:29,277
and which we can write
using the XYZ coordinates

98
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:42,002
as Kx, KxKy, KxKz, KxKy, Ky² and so on.

99
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:49,193
And the unit dyad is the matrix
that has the delta Kronecker

100
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:55,227
as the i j element
that is the identity matrix.

101
00:09:57,776 --> 00:10:05,293
And now, by using these vector properties
we can expand this K×(K×Ẽ₁),

102
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:17,855
and by multiplying (c²/ω²), we find
-c² K²/ω² and then this term here,

103
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:21,436
times E₁ Fourier transformed [i.e. Ẽ₁].

104
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:28,555
Then here, recalling that (ε₀µ₀)⁻¹ = c²,

105
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:41,908
this can be written as 
i/(ε₀ ω) j̃₁ + Ẽ₁

106
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:47,443
This quantity here
is an dimensionless number

107
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:52,825
and we will denote with N²,

108
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:56,184
and this is actually
the index of refraction.

109
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,636
What have we found?

110
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:04,537
We've found the relation between
the electric field and the current.

111
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:08,685
Somehow we have to work
from the fluid side

112
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:13,543
to try to get a relation between 
the current and the electric field,

113
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:15,033
-a second relation,

114
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:18,308
such that by using both equations,

115
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:21,695
we will be able to derive 
the dispersion relation,

116
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:26,305
the relation that will relate ω,
the [angular] frequency of the waves,

117
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:29,331
or the instability that we are analyzing,

118
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:31,359
and their wavenumber.

119
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:36,485
So now our goal is
to derive a relation between

120
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:42,123
the plasma current and the electric field
by using the fluid equations.

121
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:47,206
We will focus on a relatively simple case
of the two-fluid model:

122
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,305
the one of the cold plasma.

123
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:54,632
We will therefore neglect all the terms
related to the finite ion temperature.

124
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,815
In other words, we will put
the temperature

125
00:11:56,815 --> 00:12:00,145
of both electrons and ions
equal to zero.

126
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:04,316
This will considerably simplify
our study

127
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:11,612
without losing much of the physics
that is behind waves and the instability

128
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:14,088
described by the two-fluid model.

129
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:23,573
So we consider the two-fluid equations
in the limit of temperature equal to zero.

130
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:31,965
Our goal is to obtain a relation
between j̃₁,

131
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:35,185
the plasma current, 
and the electric field Ẽ₁.

132
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:38,528
We expect that this relation
will be a linear relation

133
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:40,616
that will pass through σ,

134
00:12:40,616 --> 00:12:45,935
that is the conductivity,
that in general can be a tensor.

135
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:55,715
That is, the mass of the species s
times the convective derivative of us,

136
00:12:55,715 --> 00:13:03,645
this has to be equal to the electric force
plus the Lorentz force.

137
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:07,796
We will neglect the pressure term
according to the hypothesis

138
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:11,433
of having the plasma temperature
equal to zero.

139
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:16,118
And this equation will be written
for the species

140
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:18,086
that are present in our plasma

141
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:22,055
that we will assume to be
the ions and electrons.

142
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,280
We will assume that we are considering
a static equilibrium,

143
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,182
therefore with us₀ = 0,

144
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:36,229
that there is no electric field
at equilibrium.

145
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:40,515
So basically, the plasma will be neutral,

146
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:46,295
in steady state, so the species
will have the same density,

147
00:13:46,295 --> 00:13:49,858
and therefore the equilibrium
electric field will be equal to zero.

148
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:54,231
But we will assume
there are at least the presence of

149
00:13:54,231 --> 00:14:01,296
an equilibrium magnetic field B
that we assume to be uniform

150
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,775
and we will choose our coordinate system

151
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:10,595
in such a way that B becomes aligned
to the ez direction.

152
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:14,994
Now, we can linearize our equation.

153
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:19,253
This term is higher order,
a second order in perturbation

154
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:23,005
only this one, the ∂/∂t remains.

155
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:33,531
Therefore, we have ms ∂ũs₁/∂t is equal
to the perturbed part of the forces,

156
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:41,760
which will be given by qs Ẽ₁ + qs ...
and then the Lorentz force.

157
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:46,925
And it's now time to Fourier transform
this equation.

158
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,836
As usual, ∂/∂t will become a -iω term

159
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:57,657
and therefore the Fourier component
of ũs₁ and Ẽ₁

160
00:14:57,657 --> 00:15:07,744
we will have 
-iω ms ũs₁ = qs Ẽ₁ + qs (ũs₁ x B₀)

161
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,677
From this moment on,

162
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:16,817
as we will be only dealing
with Fourier components ũs₁ and Ẽ₁,

163
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:20,631
<b> let's drop the tilde (~) notation for 
simplicity </b>.

164
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:28,069
Therefore, for the notation
we will, for example, denote Ẽ₁,

165
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:31,709
Fourier transformed simply as E₁,
[Ẽ₁(K,ω) → E₁(K,ω)]

166
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:37,769
but we will keep in mind that this is
the Fourier transform of E₁,

167
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:42,074
and more particularly, the (K,ω) mode.

168
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:50,644
Now since (us₁ x B₀) can be written 
component by component

169
00:15:50,644 --> 00:16:03,373
as B₀ (us₁y ex - us₁x ey),

170
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:10,728
this equation can be written as -iω, 
(i.e. the ∂/∂t term),

171
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:13,628
that will be a diagonal term,

172
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:20,869
then we can bring the contribution
of this term on the left-hand side

173
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:28,299
and what we will find is a -Ωs
[cyclotron frequency for species s]

174
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,297
and Ωs here,

175
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:35,658
0, 0 ..... • us₁ = qs/ms E₁

176
00:16:35,658 --> 00:16:41,139
where we leave on the right-hand side
the E₁ term.

177
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:46,065
Just as a reminder, the Ωs
that we have introduced here,

178
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:54,007
the cyclotron frequency,
is equal to qs B₀ / ms .

179
00:16:55,075 --> 00:17:02,644
Therefore, we can explicitly write
us₁ by inverting this matrix here.

180
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:11,283
us₁ will be equal qs ms ...
times the inverse of this matrix.

181
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:22,446
The inverse of the matrix times qs ms
can be defined as a tensor we call μs,

182
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:31,155
...μs E₁ ...., where this tensor, μs 
is equal to qs ms ... .

183
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:35,795
And if you evaluate the inverse
of this matrix

184
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,816
-- thing that is a bit boring,
but it's feasible,

185
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:48,767
you get - iω/ (Ωs²-ω²) ,

186
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:57,123
Ωs / (Ωs²-ω²) , 0, and so on.

187
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:02,449
We will call this tensor
the <i>mobility tensor</i>,

188
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,887
as it will tell us how a particle
will start to move a subject

189
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,896
to a certain electric field.

190
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:16,200
Actually now it's possible to evaluate
the perturbed current in the plasma

191
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:23,047
because the perturbed current
-as the equilibrium flow is equal to zero,

192
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:28,821
will be given by the sum
over all species of qs [times]

193
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:31,959
the equilibrium density
[ ns₀, times] us₁.

194
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:36,885
This is the only terms that remains
from the linearization of the current,

195
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:43,805
and now, we can write us₁
in terms of the mobility tensor

196
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:47,021
and the electric field, ... times E₁.

197
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:54,313
This quantity here
is actually a tensor σ E₁.

198
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:58,513
We have, in fact, obtained exactly
the relation we were looking for.

199
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:04,837
And σ , by the way,
is the <i>conductivity tensor</i>.

200
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:11,518
We have now all the elements
to derive the dispersion relation

201
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:16,811
that is the function that gives us the
relation between ω and K,

202
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:20,313
the frequency and the wave number
of the modes

203
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:23,052
that are intrinsically present
in the system.

204
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:29,545
What we have to do is in fact to inject
that the expression of the plasma current

205
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:34,098
that we have derived within 
the two-fluid model

206
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:35,965
into the Maxwell equations.

207
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:39,875
In fact, by the linearization
of the Maxwell equation,

208
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:45,264
we have obtained that
-N² (the index of refraction) ...

209
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:50,230
times this tensor here ... ⋅ E₁

210
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:57,639
is equal to the contribution of the
plasma current and the electric field.

211
00:19:58,372 --> 00:20:05,783
And from the fluid equation
we have a relation between j₁ and E₁.

212
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:11,867
We can plug this expression here,
and what we obtain is ...

213
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:17,377
where we have introduced
the ε tensor

214
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:22,013
which will take into account
the contribution from the conductivity,

215
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,551
and this term here.

216
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:29,405
And now we have all the elements
to derive-- to write down the equation

217
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:33,043
for the dispersion relation
of the two-fluid model.

218
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:39,637
In fact, the modes that have a frequency
and a wavenumber

219
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:44,880
such that the determinant
of this matrix here

220
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,665
which we can call D(ω,K) = 0,

221
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:55,020
so the modes whose frequency
and wavenumber

222
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:01,760
are such that the determinant
of this matrix is equal to zero,

223
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,136
then these are intrinsically
present modes,

224
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:10,090
i.e. modes which can be 
present in our system,

225
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,482
and they can have an E₁ 
different from zero.

226
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:16,274
Solving this equation
will actually tell us

227
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:22,486
what is the relation between the frequency
and the wavenumber of these modes.

228
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:28,763
Before concluding,
let me just write explicitly

229
00:21:28,763 --> 00:21:33,453
what is the value of ε
by introducing the conductivity

230
00:21:33,453 --> 00:21:35,161
that we have found.

231
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:40,103
This can be written by introducing
three parameters:

232
00:21:40,103 --> 00:21:44,926
ε₁, ε₂, and ε₃,

233
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:53,147
where ε₁ is defined as
one plus the sum over all species

234
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:56,028
of the plasma frequency of species s,
[squared],

235
00:21:56,028 --> 00:22:00,422
divided by the cyclotron 
frequency [squared] minus ω².

236
00:22:00,422 --> 00:22:05,972
I just remind you that
the plasma frequency squared

237
00:22:05,972 --> 00:22:12,763
of species <i>s</i> is equal to ns₀,
the equilibrium density,

238
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:18,829
[times] the charge squared,
divided by the mass [ms] and ε₀.

239
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:25,337
ε₂ is equal to minus the sum 
[over species] of the cyclotron frequency

240
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:27,853
over the frequency of the wave,
[times the]

241
00:22:27,853 --> 00:22:30,482
plasma frequency [squared] divided by 
the difference between

242
00:22:30,492 --> 00:22:35,655
the cyclotron frequency squared
and the frequency of the wave squared.

243
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:43,051
And ε₃, finally, will be given by 1
minus the [sim over species] of

244
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,142
plasma frequencies squared
divided by ω².

245
00:22:46,513 --> 00:22:48,782
To summarize, 
in the present module,

246
00:22:48,782 --> 00:22:54,025
what we have done is to linearize and
Fourier transform the Maxwell equations

247
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:56,015
and the two-fluid equations,

248
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:59,100
in order to come up
with a dispersion relation,

249
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,753
a relation between the frequency
of the wave number of the modes,

250
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,294
of the waves and instability

251
00:23:05,294 --> 00:23:08,872
that are intrinsically present 
in our system.

252
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:12,273
In the next module,

253
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:16,246
we will consider exactly 
what are the waves

254
00:23:16,246 --> 00:23:18,880
and instabilities present in our system

255
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,062
and we will look at 
their physical properties.
