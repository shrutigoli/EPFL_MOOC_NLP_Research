1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,937
Welcome.

2
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:10,261
Welcome to the Plasma Physics
course of the EPFL.

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,983
Today, we are going to derive
the fluid equations

4
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:15,999
starting from the kinetic equations.

5
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:17,848
Why do we do that?

6
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:22,766
The kinetic description of a plasma
is extremely detailed and precise.

7
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:27,075
However, to deal with it 
is extremely complicated

8
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:30,138
both analytically and numerically.
It is extremely expensive

9
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:32,100
to solve a kinetic equation,

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,329
and sometimes it's not even necessary.

11
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:39,227
There is a need to come up 
with a simpler model like a fluid model

12
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:41,283
to describe the plasma dynamics.,

13
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:44,857
This is exactly what we will do today 
more precisely.

14
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:49,073
Today, we will first
derive the fluid quantities

15
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:51,508
from the distribution function,

16
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:55,871
and we'll then take the moments
of the kinetic equation

17
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:58,895
to derive a set of fluid equations.

18
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:03,166
With you, I will go through the details
of deriving the continuity equation

19
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,899
and I will leave to you 
the derivation of the momentum

20
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,570
and energy fluid equations.

21
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:14,470
What I will do at the end of this lecture
is state a two-fluid model

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,531
that can well describe 
the dynamics of a plasma.

23
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:23,918
Now as we have seen particles,

24
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:28,553
are located in the 
six-dimensional phase space.

25
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:35,006
Here I am projecting this six-dimensional
space on this 2D plane.

26
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:40,013
Here is the projection of the 
configuration space coordinates,

27
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:42,836
here is the velocity coordinate

28
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:47,598
and particles are scattered all over
the phase space.

29
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:54,705
We want to study the 
dynamics of the plasma

30
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:58,904
by looking at quantities that only depend
on the spatial coordinates.

31
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:03,211
Quantities like density, temperature,
fluid velocity of the plasma.

32
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:07,152
How can we get this quantities
from the distribution function?

33
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:09,942
Well, we have seen already something,

34
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:16,475
for example we have observed that
the density of particles

35
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:22,478
can be expressed by integrating
over the velocity direction,

36
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:27,835
so over the velocity space,
the distribution function.

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,425
This is what we have called 
the number density.

38
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:41,588
This is a specific case of a more 
general way of evaluating fluid quantities

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,441
starting from a distribution function.

40
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,661
In general effect, the average value <g(r)>

41
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:58,091
of a generic function, g(v)

42
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:01,444
that depends on v,

43
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:03,653
is given by

44
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:11,153
the integral of this function,

45
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,153
weighted according to the distribution

46
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:20,867
of particles in the velocity space,
integrated over full velocity space

47
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:26,541
and this has to be normalized
to the number density of our plasma.

48
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:32,154
By considering different g functions,

49
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:36,456
we can actually evaluate 
all the fluid quantities

50
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:40,313
that may be of interest,
so let's give a few examples.

51
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:47,738
First we can be interested 
in the fluid average velocity,

52
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:57,641
and this can be deduced 
by taking g(v) = v

53
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:01,570
and evaluating the fluid velocity

54
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:08,300
which is a function of space and time

55
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,304
that is therefore defined 
as the weighted average of

56
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:21,944
v fs(r,v,t)

57
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:24,692
integrated over all dv.

58
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:32,665
We may be interested 
in the average kinetic energy density

59
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:40,445
that is obtained by taking 
g(v) = 1/2 ms v²

60
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:46,019
and which is a function 
of position and time

61
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:50,547
and is equal to one 
over the number density,

62
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:58,047
integral of 1/2 ms v² [times the]
distribution function,

63
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:04,649
integrated over the full velocity.

64
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,521
A quantity that may be of great interest,
the fluid quantity is the pressure.

65
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:13,457
In plasma physics, we define

66
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:17,585
- as the distribution function 
may not be isotropic-

67
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:22,214
A <i>pressure tensor</i> that is defined as...

68
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:30,978
Here we want to normalize 
with respect to the number density.

69
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:32,892
We will define the pressure tensor

70
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:37,282
as the integral of 
the mass of the particles,

71
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:44,843
the velocity of the particles minus
the fluid velocity, same thing again.

72
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,770
Please note that 
there is no dot product here

73
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,292
this is really a tensor quantity.

74
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:57,612
This has to be weighted according 
to the particle distribution function

75
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:03,575
and integrated as we were saying
over the full velocity space.

76
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:07,116
What is this [pressure] tensor?

77
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:12,391
The ij component of this tensor

78
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:18,381
will be given by the i component

79
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:20,669
of the first vector [ (v-us)i ]

80
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:26,089
multiplied with the j component 
of the second vector [ (v-us)j ]

81
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:31,408
So the conclusion 
of the point I want to make

82
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:38,167
is that basically one can derive 
the fluid quantities of interest

83
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:42,057
by starting from the distribution function

84
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:47,294
if a proper integral is taken
in the velocity space.

85
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:52,847
To make things more practical

86
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:56,901
let's evaluate a few fluid quantities

87
00:06:56,901 --> 00:07:00,701
from some distribution functions

88
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:03,709
that may be of interest.

89
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:08,224
The first distribution function 
that we can consider

90
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:11,200
is the one of a beam of particles.

91
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,242
That moves with the velocity v₀,

92
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:23,326
therefore the distribution function 
is equal to 0, except when v equal to v₀.

93
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:26,094
This is the reason of this delta 
[Dirac] function.

94
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,571
Now we can evaluate some fluid quantities
starting from this distribution function.

95
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:38,589
And we note for example that n, 
the number density

96
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:44,219
is equal to the integral of f dv

97
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:47,219
is equal to the integral of n₀.

98
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:54,367
In this specific case, δ(v-v₀) dv

99
00:07:55,767 --> 00:08:00,940
and this is basically n₀
that we can take out from the integral,

100
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:06,174
and then integral of the delta function,
which is equal to one.

101
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:10,028
So we find that the number density
is equal to n₀.

102
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:16,470
We can evaluate the fluid velocity
of this beam.

103
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:23,808
* is equal to 1/n integral of v

104
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:27,596
weighted according to the
distribution function [times] dv

105
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:30,004
and for the specific case,

106
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:42,124
is 1/n₀ ∫ n₀ v δ(v-v₀) dv

107
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:45,137
n₀ and n₀ simplify,

108
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:51,095
integral of v δ(v-v₀) 
is equal to v₀

109
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:56,165
This is exactly what we were expecting
also from a fluid point of view:

110
00:08:56,165 --> 00:09:02,610
all these particles of the distribution 
function are moving with velocity v₀.

111
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,004
The average fluid velocity 
should be equal to v₀. Energy?.

112
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,174
Energy will be the weighted average

113
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:19,404
1/n ∫ 1/2 m v² f dv

114
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:23,292
and for this specific case,

115
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:36,462
this will be 
1/n₀ ∫ n₀/2 m v² δ(v-v₀) dv

116
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:43,048
Then this will be equal to 1/2 mv₀²

117
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:50,056
Pressure; pressure tensor 
as we have defined it,

118
00:09:50,056 --> 00:10:08,032
will be given by the tensor
1/n₀ ∫ m (v-u) (v-u) f dv

119
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:12,134
and this will be equal to, 
for this specific case,

120
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:32,089
1/n₀ ∫ m (v-v₀) (v-v₀) n₀ δ(v-v₀) dv

121
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:40,910
If we integrate over dv,
we will obtain zero.

122
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:43,049
What does it mean?

123
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:49,374
The pressure tensor gives us an idea
of the the dispersion of the velocity,

124
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:54,480
as given by the distribution function
around the mean value,

125
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,241
and what we found is that
this is equal to zero.

126
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:02,280
Basically there is no spreading around
the mean velocity

127
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,078
and as a matter of fact this function
that is very peaked

128
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,599
around the average fluid velocity.

129
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:16,510
We may consider another 
distribution function

130
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,980
and the most interesting one is for sure
the Maxwellian distribution function.

131
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:27,536
This would be given by

132
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:37,726
n₀ (m/(2 π vth²))^(3/2)
[vth = thermal velocity]

133
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:50,876
exp{ -(v-v₀)² / (2 vth²) }
[note: no m in the exp...]

134
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:58,584
We can evaluate 
the number density.

135
00:11:59,147 --> 00:12:03,866
If you do the integral of this function
you will get 1.

136
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:08,493
And therefore n, the number density
is equal to n₀.

137
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,748
Similarly if you play a bit
and you do the integral

138
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:17,921
of v f(v), you get

139
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:24,574
that the particles -as we expect-,
move with a fluid velocity

140
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:27,307
that is given by v₀.

141
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:31,063
That's where the Maxwellian is centered.

142
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:40,900
If we evaluate this integral to get 
the mean average kinetic energy,

143
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,932
you obtain

144
00:12:43,853 --> 00:12:50,476
that this will be given by 1/2 mv₀².

145
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:55,940
That is the kinetic energy associated
with the collective fluid motion

146
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:02,727
of the plasma, plus-- 
there will be some spreading,

147
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:07,903
some kinetic energy related 
with the spreading

148
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:09,406
around the mean velocity.

149
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:14,219
And this will be given by 
3/2 m vth²

150
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:23,097
which is equal to 1/2 mv₀²

151
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:29,217
and if we introduce the temperature T,

152
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:37,654
we can write this kinetic energy
as 3/2 T [note: no Boltzmann cst]

153
00:13:37,654 --> 00:13:41,385
times the more precisely 
what we have found

154
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:47,644
in determining was the temperature
that is written as the--

155
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:54,918
is related to the thermal velocity
by the relation vth² = T/m [T in eV]

156
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,193
The pressure tensor is something 
that you can also evaluate

157
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:05,970
and what you will find is that as 
this distribution function is isotropic,

158
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,970
then only the diagonal terms 
of this pressure tensor

159
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,880
will be different from zero,
all the others will be equal to zero.

160
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:20,609
And more precisely, 
what you will find is that

161
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,859
they will be equal to n₀ T
[Note: No Boltzmann's cst]

162
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:26,861
for the diagonal terms,

163
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:33,543
and they will be equal to zero
for all the off-diagonal terms.

164
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,459
We have now introduced
the fluid quantities

165
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:44,315
starting from the distribution function.

166
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,777
It's now time to see how they evolve,

167
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:52,653
how we can actually derive an equation
that states how these fluid quantities

168
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:59,203
such as density, fluid, velocity, pressure
evolve as a function of time.

169
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:03,498
To do that we start it 
from Boltzmann equation.

170
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:11,102
Boltzmann equation states that

171
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:14,372
the derivative with respect of time

172
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:19,858
of the distribution function
is due to the streaming

173
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:23,807
in configuration space,

174
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:30,887
plus the streaming in velocity space

175
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,316
due to long range interactions,

176
00:15:36,316 --> 00:15:39,816
plus a term that takes 
into account of collisions.

177
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,962
In order to derive the fluid equation,

178
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:51,593
what we will do is take the moment
of the Boltzmann equation.

179
00:15:57,637 --> 00:16:02,120
More precisely, we will consider 
the Boltzmann equation,

180
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,692
we will multiply it 
by a function gᵢ(v)

181
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:14,819
and we will integrate this with respect
to the velocity space.

182
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:21,883
By properly choosing the function gᵢ(v)
we will get the continuity,

183
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:26,271
the momentum and the energy 
fluid equations.

184
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:34,225
More precisely we will consider
g₁(v) = 1

185
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,370
and in this case we will get 
the continuity equation.

186
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:45,300
We will then consider 
g₂(v) = ms v

187
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,470
and get the momentum equation,

188
00:16:50,880 --> 00:17:00,467
and finally if we consider 
g₃(v) = (ms/2) v²

189
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:03,597
we will get an energy equation.

190
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,722
I will derive carefully 
with you the continuity equation

191
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:17,177
and I will leave to you the derivation
of the momentum and energy equation.

192
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:23,749
So let's try to derive together 
the continuity equation.

193
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,948
We have to take 
the Boltzmann equation

194
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:32,207
multiply it by g₁(v), that is by 1,

195
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:34,822
and then integrate over 
the velocity space.

196
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,835
Let's see what we obtain.

197
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:45,625
So, we consider the Boltzman equation

198
00:17:57,602 --> 00:18:02,483
taking into account also the collision term.

199
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:11,221
We multiply this equation by 1,
that is by g₁(v).

200
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:17,019
We integrate it with respect to velocity.

201
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,439
This will have to be equal to zero.

202
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:26,410
So let's consider the four integrals

203
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,730
that we have to perform separately.

204
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,012
Let's start from the first one.

205
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,815
What we have to evaluate is the integral

206
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:47,455
of ∂fs/∂t dv that is ∂/∂t

207
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:52,140
of the integral of fs with respect to dv.

208
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:59,878
That is equal to the time partial 
derivative of the particle density

209
00:19:00,712 --> 00:19:02,713
∂ns/∂t.

210
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,398
Second term.

211
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,815
We have to evaluate 
the integral of

212
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:20,235
v⋅∂fs/∂r dv

213
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:27,289
Now, you can bring the v inside ∂/∂r 
as v and r are independent

214
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:29,265
phase space coordinates,

215
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:35,067
and then you can also take 
the ∂/∂r out of the integral

216
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,753
as the integral is with respect to v.

217
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:42,346
Therefore, what you will have is

218
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:48,116
∂/∂r ⋅ ∫ v fs dv

219
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:56,947
and if you look at this quantity,
this quantity is the fluid velocity [us]

220
00:19:57,048 --> 00:20:00,139
times the particle density [ns].

221
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:09,091
Let's focus on the third integral.

222
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:30,267
This is
qs/ms ∫ (E + v × B) ⋅ ∂fs/∂v dv

223
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:38,516
and as E does not depend on v
and v × B is perpendicular to v,

224
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:55,604
we can write this as
qs/ms ∫ ∂/∂v ⋅{(E + v × B) fs} dv

225
00:20:56,073 --> 00:21:01,224
This is equal to qs/ms ...

226
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,859
-and then here you can use
the divergence theorem

227
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:10,737
and this becomes the integral
over a surface

228
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:16,659
that contains the velocity space

229
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:19,744
and this surface tends to infinity-

230
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:27,144
of (E + v × B) fs

231
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:32,317
dotted with the surface vector [⋅ dSv]

232
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:38,605
Since there are no particles
that have an infinite speed,

233
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:44,049
fs will tend to zero [on the surface]
and the surface integral

234
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,489
has to be equal to zero.

235
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,479
Finally, the fourth integral:

236
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:57,911
we have to evaluate

237
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:01,801
the integral of the collision operator.

238
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:05,638
Now this will be equal to zero
as a matter of fact

239
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:08,491
because collisions

240
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:13,861
do not create nor destroy particles.

241
00:22:17,481 --> 00:22:21,006
If we put ①, ②, ③, ④ together,

242
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,516
what do we obtain?

243
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:37,568
We obtain 
∂ns/∂t + ∂/∂r⋅(ns us) = 0

244
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:45,469
What we have just derived 
is the <i>fluid continuity equation</i>.

245
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:52,461
We have derived together 
the continuity equation.

246
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:56,481
Following exactly the same steps
and I leave that to you.

247
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:59,986
One can derive the momentum
and energy equation.

248
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:02,150
It's enough to take 
the Boltzmann equation,

249
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,150
weighted with the correct g function

250
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,614
and carry out the integration.

251
00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:12,514
I will now summarize the results of

252
00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:17,187
this exercise, if you integrate
the Boltzmann equation

253
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,600
with these different weights.

254
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:24,146
What we come up with is a fluid model,

255
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:29,321
a fluid model that separates each species
present in our plasma.

256
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:34,151
As there are typically ions 
and electrons in the plasma,

257
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,254
therefore two species,

258
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:40,981
the model that we will describe
that I will write down now

259
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:44,230
is the so-called <i>two-fluid model</i>.

260
00:23:46,914 --> 00:23:50,269
In fact, for the electrons and ions,

261
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:56,089
you will have a continuity equation
that we have just derived.

262
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:04,536
Again, for ions and electrons
we will have a momentum equation...

263
00:24:16,484 --> 00:24:22,755
... that states that the 
derivative of the velocity

264
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:29,805
we have indicated with d/dt,
the convective derivative.

265
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:32,805
d/dt = ∂/∂t + us⋅∂/∂r

266
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:35,390
The acceleration of the fluid,

267
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,410
will be due to the electric 
and magnetic force

268
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,576
plus the contribution of the pressure

269
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:52,035
and a viscous force that is due to 
the collisions that plasma does.

270
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:05,272
And it's defined as you see.

271
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:10,803
One gets also an energy equation

272
00:25:10,963 --> 00:25:20,299
that states that the variation 
of the energy of the system

273
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:23,900
where we have defined with Ts

274
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,860
the integral of the kinetic energy

275
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,049
due to the spreading

276
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:38,589
around the fluid velocity, 
properly averaged,

277
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:42,245
is due to the viscous heat here.

278
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:45,558
We note that this is a double dot product

279
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:50,009
plus the heat that is transported by

280
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,069
the heat flux vector

281
00:25:55,979 --> 00:26:02,427
qs [not to be confused with charge!] 
is defined as

282
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:06,507
qs = ms/2 ∫ (v-us)² (v-us) fs dv

283
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:10,223
therefore the kinetic energy 
that is transported

284
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:18,238
with the velocity of the particles,

285
00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:25,863
And then the heat [Qs] generated 
because of the viscous forces.

286
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:36,703
Observations:

287
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,494
The first observation 
that I would like to make

288
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:46,612
is that this system of equation
is not closed.

289
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:51,067
As a matter of fact, in order 
to solve the energy equation,

290
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:56,399
what you need to have is 
an expression for the heat flux.

291
00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:01,885
And this requires to know 
the distribution function.

292
00:27:02,536 --> 00:27:05,712
What we have is a problem of closure.

293
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:14,020
How to derive a good expression 
of the heat flux

294
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,727
without having to evolve 
the full distribution function ?

295
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:22,626
This is a very active area of 
research in plasma physics.

296
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:26,479
And at the same problem is for 
the pressure tensor,

297
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,589
the collisional forces.

298
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:33,133
The second observation is that this
fluid model

299
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:40,551
has to be coupled to the Maxwell 
equations, and this can be done

300
00:27:40,883 --> 00:27:46,960
because the electric charge present
in our system can obtained

301
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:52,398
by summing the electric charge
of ions and electrons

302
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:57,328
and similarly for the current density,

303
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:06,487
and then the charge and current 
densities can then be injected

304
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:10,389
in the Maxwell equations 
that therefore read:

305
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:16,089
∇⋅E = ρ/ε₀

306
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:21,111
∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

307
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:24,821
∇⋅B =0

308
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:34,851
and 
∇ × B = μ₀ (j + ε₀ ∂E/∂t)

309
00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:43,082
Where does it actually makes sense to use
a fluid description like the one

310
00:28:43,082 --> 00:28:46,110
I have just given, 
the two-fluid description

311
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,543
to evolve and describe the 
dynamics of a plasma?

312
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,872
It definitely makes sense
where it is possible.

313
00:28:54,872 --> 00:28:59,890
It's easy, or relatively easy
to find the good closure

314
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,732
for the set of fluid equations.

315
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:09,181
And this is where the plasma 
is fairly collisional.

316
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,858
There in this region, 
you expect that the distribution function

317
00:29:13,858 --> 00:29:19,327
will be close to a Maxwellian, and 
therefore somehow one can make progress

318
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:25,923
in evaluating the closure
of the set of fluid equations.

319
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:31,854
In particular, two-fluid simulations
of plasma turbulence

320
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:36,600
are done in the periphery 
of magnetic fusion devices.

321
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,824
In this region, the plasma is 
relatively cold

322
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:44,904
and one can evolve the dynamics
of the plasma,

323
00:29:44,904 --> 00:29:49,248
by looking, by evolving
as set of fluid equations

324
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:56,129
that describe the evolution of density
for electrons and ions

325
00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:02,651
of temperature, of velocity,
of the plasma contained in this region.

326
00:30:04,827 --> 00:30:06,725
What did we do today?

327
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:10,847
What we did was to see 
how it is possible to derive

328
00:30:10,847 --> 00:30:14,441
from the distribution function, 
fluid quantities

329
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,526
that may be of interest 
to describe our plasma.

330
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:21,775
For example the density, 
the pressure, the fluid velocity.

331
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:27,360
We pointed out then 
how it's possible to derive

332
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,676
a set of fluid equations.

333
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:32,561
A set of equations 
that is able to describe

334
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:35,920
the evolution of these fluid quantities.

335
00:30:36,122 --> 00:30:41,174
We have done this by taking 
the moments of the kinetic equation

336
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,714
and by using these moments,

337
00:30:44,454 --> 00:30:47,384
I have derived a two-fluid model.

338
00:30:47,384 --> 00:30:50,495
I have in particular carefully done 
with you the calculation

339
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:51,840
of the continuity equation,

340
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,334
and I have left to you the calculation
of the momentum and energy equations.

341
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:02,146
The fluid equations that we came up with

342
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:05,883
describe separately the dynamics 
of ions and electrons.

343
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:11,827
This is why it's typically called 
the two-fluid system of equations

344
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:15,045
and it's actually used 
for a number of applications

345
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:17,943
to study the dynamics of a plasma.

346
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:23,987
What we have just briefly mentioned
is the study of the dynamics

347
00:31:23,987 --> 00:31:27,252
of the turbulent dynamics
of a plasma

348
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,954
in the periphery of fusion devices.
