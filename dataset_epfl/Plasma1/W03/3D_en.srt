00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:10,001
Welcome, welcome to the 
plasma physics course of EPFL.

2
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:14,625
In the past module, we have derived 
the intrinsic modes,

3
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:19,376
the waves that are present in a plasma
within the two-fluid model.

4
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:26,210
In the present one, we will actually show 
what are the properties of these waves.

5
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:30,005
We will start by looking at 
the properties of the waves

6
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:33,269
propagating in the direction parallel 
to the magnetic field

7
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:35,872
that is right-handed 
and left-handed waves.

8
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:41,533
We will see that in a certain range of 
frequencies, an interesting

9
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:45,485
kind of wave appears:
the <i>whistler wave</i>.

10
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:51,817
The study of these waves, 
that are propagating parallel

11
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:56,128
to magnetic field will give us the 
opportunity to introduce the concept of

12
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:57,958
<i>cut-off</i> and <i>resonance</i>.

13
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:03,776
Then we will turn our attention 
to the physical properties

14
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:07,957
of the waves propagating perpendicular 
to the magnetic field.

15
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:14,865
So let's start to give a look at 
the properties of the left-handed

16
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:16,793
and right-handed waves.

17
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:22,354
We will do that by first recalling 
the dispersion relation

18
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:26,075
and then by looking at what is 
the range of frequency

19
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:30,699
and wavenumber in which 
these waves can propagate.

20
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:36,151
The dispersion relation for 
the right-handed waves reads as

21
00:01:37,274 --> 00:02:00,377
the index of refraction equal to
K²c²/ω² = (ω-ωR)(ω+ωL)/((ω-|Ωe|)(ω+Ωi))

22
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,866
and these are the right-handed waves.

23
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,393
The left-handed waves, on the other hand 
are such that

24
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:39,254
K²c²/ω² = (ω+ωR)(ω-ωL)/((ω+|Ωe|)(ω-Ωi))

25
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:42,097
These are the left-handed waves.

26
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:45,402
Just let's recall for a second

27
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:49,802
why these waves are called this way.

28
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:55,457
So why are these waves called 
right- and left-handed waves?

29
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:59,763
Let's draw our coordinates system.

30
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:04,487
x,y,z,

31
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:13,393
With the equilibrium magnetic field
along the z direction

32
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:19,880
Now for these waves the electric field 
lies on the x,y plane

33
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:24,038
and we've seen in the last module

34
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:29,546
that this electric field rotates 
according to the right hand rule

35
00:03:29,546 --> 00:03:34,849
with respect to B₀ if we are dealing 
with the right-handed waves

36
00:03:35,556 --> 00:03:40,816
while it moves in opposite direction 
for the left-handed waves.

37
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:46,461
The frequencies that I have 
introduced here, ωR and ωL

38
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,703
are defined such that

39
00:03:49,703 --> 00:04:06,174
ωR = 1/2 { |Ωe| + sqrt( Ωe² + 4 ωpe² ) }

40
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,753
and let me point out that

41
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:14,916
this is a quantity that is larger 
than the electron cyclotron frequency,

42
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:22,607
while 
ωL = 1/2 {-|Ωe| + sqrt( Ωe² + 4 ωpe² ) }

43
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,757
that is a quantity that is 
larger than zero.

44
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,774
What are the properties of these waves?

45
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:34,426
First of all, in order to propagate,

46
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:42,893
these waves should have a frequency 
such that this quantity here

47
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:47,006
or this quantity here is positive.

48
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:50,571
As K² c² / ω² is positive

49
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:54,077
and if ω

50
00:04:54,411 --> 00:05:00,082
is found to be in between 
the electron cyclotron frequency |Ωe|

51
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:06,799
and ωR ... I remind you that 
this inequality is valid

52
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:13,897
then this quantity here, - as 
these other two terms are always positive,

53
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:17,418
will be negative.

54
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:22,189
Therefore we will not have 
right-handed waves

55
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:27,899
and similarly for the left-handed waves 
this term and this term here

56
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:32,049
are always positive, 
so the only negative contribution

57
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:36,712
can come from this factor 
and this factor here

58
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:41,657
and in particular we see that for...

59
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:49,843
- as typically the ion cyclotron
frequency is much smaller than ωL,

60
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:58,004
... that for frequencies between 
the ion cyclotron frequency Ωi and ωL,

61
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,082
we have no left-handed waves.

62
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:06,496
If we draw a diagram that represents 
the frequency

63
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:12,380
as a function of the wavenumber,
the frequencies of interest will be

64
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:18,683
along this scale located 
in the following order:

65
00:06:18,683 --> 00:06:20,397
Ωi,

66
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:29,142
then ωL, then the electron 
cyclotron frequency |Ωe|, and ωR

67
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:36,415
and in this region
we won't have left-handed waves

68
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:42,107
and similarly in this region we won't have
any right-handed waves.

69
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:50,768
A second thing that may be interesting 
to look at is how these waves behave

70
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:53,253
when ω tends to infinity.

71
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:56,408
In this case, we will have that 
K² c² / ω²

72
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:06,546
will tend to -- ω will tend to infinity 
both this fraction and this fraction here

73
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:08,278
will tend to 1.

74
00:07:08,702 --> 00:07:15,546
In other words, we will have 
that ω/K will be equal to c.

75
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,064
What will happen?

76
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:25,104
Basically we will have waves that 
are propagating at the speed of light.

77
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:30,246
There are electromagnetic waves, 
the plasma has no time

78
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:35,280
to respond at frequencies 
that are so high.

79
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:44,522
There will be therefore 
an asypmtote here that is ω/K = c

80
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:48,981
where these waves will tend to.

81
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:54,577
And then how about 
the limit of ω going to zero

82
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:57,700
and K going to zero?

83
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:03,369
We will have that 
K² c² / ω²

84
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,457
will be equal to... -- we will be able 
to neglect ω with respect to ωR,

85
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,319
ωL, |Ωe|, and Ωi.

86
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:22,252
... therefore, this will be equal to
ωR ωL / (|Ωe| Ωi)

87
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:26,728
and let me point out that we will have 
the same expression for both

88
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:28,958
the right- and left-handed waves.

89
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:33,978
Now if we explicit the product of 
ωR and ωL,

90
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:46,417
we find 
ωpe² / (|Ωe| Ωi)

91
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:51,776
Now we can explicitly write that 
the expression for the plasma frequency

92
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:58,724
that is 
ωpe² = e² n₀ / ( ε₀ me )

93
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:15,004
and then we can write explicitly the
1/ (|Ωe| Ωi ) term as mi me / (e² B₀²)

94
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,781
We can simplify e² .

95
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:19,356
We can simplify me and me

96
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:31,232
and we get
mi n₀ / ( ε₀ B₀² ),

97
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:42,926
which is equal --if we notice that 
ε₀ μ₀ = 1/c²,

98
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:53,409
...to 
c² μ₀ mi n₀ / B₀²

99
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,095
The quantity that

100
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:05,384
I have just drawn here is actually 
the inverse of a square speed, 1/cA².

101
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:10,717
The speed cA that is called 
<i>Alfvén speed</i>.

102
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:17,066
If we look at this we notice 
that c² and c² simplify

103
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:20,611
and therefore that

104
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,746
ω² = cA² K² .

105
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:31,357
This implies that there is 
another asymptote

106
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:37,617
that is given by ω/K = cA.

107
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:45,788
We have now all the elements to derive 
the relationship between ω and K

108
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:48,678
for the right-handed waves 
and the left-handed waves.

109
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,245
Let's start by considering 
the right-handed waves.

110
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,167
First of all, what we see is that

111
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:59,248
for ω going to zero, K tends to zero,

112
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,084
therefore the wave will 
start from this point,

113
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:07,259
then will follow these 
aymptotically this expression

114
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:14,619
and then the right-handed waves 
will exist up until |Ωe|.

115
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:26,864
When ω will tend to |Ωe|, 
this term will tend to 0,

116
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:31,463
and therefore this will blow up 
and we expect that K

117
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:34,666
will tend to infinity.

118
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:39,290
We expect, in other words, 
something like that.

119
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:44,622
With K going to infinity

120
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:51,722
and the dispersion relation 
that follows ω/K = cA

121
00:11:51,722 --> 00:11:53,878
at low K and low ω.

122
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:59,345
The wave then will appear again at ωR

123
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:05,414
and when ω is equal 
to ωR, we will have K = 0.

124
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,047
And then when ω will tend to infinity,

125
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:12,982
this asymptote will be followed.

126
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:16,742
We expect, in other words, 
something like that.

127
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:20,502
These are right-handed waves.

128
00:12:21,471 --> 00:12:23,585
What about the left-handed waves?

129
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:30,528
Well they do not exist for ω
that is in between Ωi and ωL

130
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:33,028
and they have the same 
asymptotic behavior

131
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:37,776
therefore at the low value of ω and K

132
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:45,100
they will follow again, same asymptote 
then K will tend to infinity

133
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:49,851
and then at the left-handed wave 
will appear again

134
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:59,550
at ωL and will tend to infinity 
following this asymptote, ω/K = c

135
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,761
These are the relationships between

136
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:09,380
frequency and the wavenumber for 
both left-handed and right-handed waves.

137
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:13,527
There is a range of frequencies 
where the right-handed waves

138
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:17,508
display very interesting properties
and in this range of frequency

139
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:19,348
they are called <i>whistler waves</i>.

140
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:21,395
Let's look at this property.

141
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,834
So we will consider 
the right-handed waves

142
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:29,594
in the limit of ω/K << c

143
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,826
and in a range of frequencies 
that are much larger than

144
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:38,358
the ion cyclotron frequency Ωi
and much smaller

145
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,350
than the plasma frequency ωpe,

146
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:44,487
that is typically smaller 
or comparable

147
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:50,984
to the electron cyclotron frequency |Ωe|
and the frequency ωR .

148
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:56,546
Where are we in 
the dispersion relation diagram

149
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,519
that we have just drawn?

150
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,181
We had pointed out the presence 
of the ion cyclotron frequency Ωi,

151
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:09,959
ωL, Ωe and ωR frequencies.

152
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:17,061
We've shown that there are 
no right-handed waves in this region

153
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:22,201
and that the relationship between ω and K

154
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,221
is given by something like that.

155
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:27,560
In this range of frequency 
that we are considering here,

156
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,279
we are looking at frequencies 
that are much larger than

157
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:36,127
the ion cyclotron frequency
but much smaller than the electron one.

158
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,892
We are looking at waves that are 
propagating in this region here.

159
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:48,052
What does the dispersion relation look 
like in this range of frequencies ?

160
00:14:48,052 --> 00:15:08,519
We have 
K²c²/ω² = (ω-ωR)(ω+ωL)/((ω-|Ωe|)(ω+Ωi))

161
00:15:08,712 --> 00:15:14,530
We can leave the denominator 
of this expression as it is,

162
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:18,543
and for the numerator 
we can develop this product

163
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:29,693
and we have 
ω² + ω(ωL-ωR) - ωL ωR

164
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:35,486
Now this, in the regime of interest 
can be actually simplified

165
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,527
-up to now we haven't done 
any simplification,

166
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:44,754
and in particular ω can be neglected 
with respect to |Ωe|

167
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:50,514
and Ωi can be neglected with respect to ω.

168
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:56,773
We've also that ωL is typically 
smaller than ωR

169
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:58,933
and therefore it can be neglected
in the term ( ωL- ωR),

170
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:13,484
and therefore this can be written as
{-ω(ω-ωR) + ωL ωR}/(|Ωe| ω)

171
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:17,414
Now ω and ω here can be simplified,

172
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:21,129
ω can be neglected with respect to ωR

173
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:26,137
and in the limit of ωpe 
smaller than |Ωe|,

174
00:16:26,137 --> 00:16:29,582
ωR becomes comparable to |Ωe|.

175
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:32,119
What we have therefore here is 1

176
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:36,679
and then the product of ωL and ωR

177
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,429
gives the plasma frequency squared ωpe²,

178
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:45,764
that is then divided by ω |Ωe|.

179
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,461
Now this, as we've already said 
is larger than |Ωe| and ω

180
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:57,530
and therefore this 1 can be 
neglected with respect to this term.

181
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:01,771
This is therefore equal to 
ωpe² / ( ω |Ωe|)

182
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:07,286
Here we've got a relatively simple result

183
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:21,526
because that we can write it as as 
ω/K = c/ωpe sqrt(|Ωe| ω)

184
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:26,255
Now these terms are constant: c, ωpe, |Ωe|

185
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:29,477
and therefore ω/K

186
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:34,240
is proportional essentially 
to square root of ω

187
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:38,380
which implies that the square root of ω

188
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:41,080
is proportional to K

189
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:44,555
which implies that
-if we want to evaluate

190
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:51,221
the group of velocity of the wave 
by deriving ω with respect to K,

191
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:56,210
we find that the group velocity 
is proportional to the square root of ω .

192
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,822
This is an interesting result 
because it tells us,

193
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:05,445
first of all, that the group velocity 
increases with the frequency

194
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:09,619
as the group velocity goes like 
the square root of ω,

195
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,692
and therefore that higher frequencies
will propagate faster.

196
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:21,991
That fact that the whistler waves 
propagate with a group velocity

197
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:26,415
that varies with the frequency 
is not only interesting academically

198
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:29,163
it has actually consequences 
that are important.

199
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:32,929
For example, for the propagation 
of waves in the ionosphere

200
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:38,121
something that is of practical interest 
for radio transmissions, for example.

201
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:41,811
In fact, let's consider our planet.

202
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,372
There is the North Pole and the South Pole

203
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:50,356
and as we know there is a magnetic field, 
a polar magnetic field

204
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:52,154
that goes around the earth.

205
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:59,322
Now let's suppose that a lightening 
strikes this region here,

206
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:03,418
a number of waves with 
all frequencies will be produced

207
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:06,682
and then will travel along 
the magnetic field

208
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,612
surrounding the earth.

209
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:13,719
The velocity at which these wave propagate
along the magnetic field

210
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,129
will depend on their frequency.

211
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:20,303
And if we look at 
the spectrogram of a wave

212
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:23,226
that has been traveling 
along the magnetic field,

213
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:27,786
that is if we look at the frequency 
as a function of the time

214
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:32,192
at which the wave has been recorded
we observe

215
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:35,787
that the higher frequency waves 
will arrive earlier

216
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:38,294
than the low frequency waves.

217
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:44,219
In radio transmissions, this causes 
a sound that is very similar

218
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,008
to the one of whistler.

219
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,552
This is also where the name 
<i>whistler waves</i> comes from,

220
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:53,638
and here is the typical sound 
that can be heard,

221
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:58,537
due to propagation 
of whistler waves.

222
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:03,739
(static and whistling)

223
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:22,794
Well you have noticed 
that high frequency

224
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:26,457
waves arrive earlier than 
the low frequency ones.

225
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:33,469
Now by looking at the dispersion relation 
of right and left-handed waves,

226
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:36,965
we can notice that there are some 
frequencies that are quite interesting.

227
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:41,100
The ones for which K goes to zero, 
or K goes to infinity.

228
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,377
It's interesting to look at 
the physics of this frequencies,

229
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:49,006
which are called <i>Cut-off 
and Resonant frequencies.</i>

230
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:52,811
Okay, so let's go back to 
the dispersion relation

231
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:54,447
that we were looking at.

232
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:58,231
Let's focus on the dispersion relation 
of the right-handed waves.

233
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:03,527
We notice that there was a region 
where the right-handed waves

234
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:10,266
were not propagating,
that is between |Ωe| and ωR frequencies,

235
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:15,263
and that the dispersion relation 
shows an interesting behavior.

236
00:21:15,468 --> 00:21:18,504
As a matter of fact, 
for the right-handed waves

237
00:21:18,874 --> 00:21:23,870
it's clear that the electron cyclotron
frequency |Ωe|, and the frequency ωR

238
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,739
are two interesting frequencies.

239
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,128
They are what we usually call 
cut-off and resonance frequencies.

240
00:21:31,342 --> 00:21:33,899
What do I mean by cut-off frequency?

241
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:37,620
It's a frequency at which

242
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:41,607
ω/K tends to infinity.

243
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:46,806
In particular, this tends 
to infinity because K

244
00:21:47,522 --> 00:21:52,596
tends to zero, while ω
is different from zero.

245
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:59,377
In the present case, ω = ωR
is a cut-off frequency.

246
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,243
What happens in this region

247
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:06,011
when we are close 
to the cut-off frequency?

248
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:11,154
Well it happens that K passes 
from being purely real

249
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:13,831
to being purely imaginary.

250
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:17,432
That's the region where there is 
no propagation of the wave,

251
00:22:17,563 --> 00:22:21,863
therefore, the wave when it goes 
close to this frequency

252
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:23,339
cannot propagate.

253
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,227
And what happens to the wave?

254
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:26,519
It's reflected.

255
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,343
In other words, the cut-off frequencies, 
the frequency at which

256
00:22:30,343 --> 00:22:32,818
there is a reflection of the wave.

257
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:36,740
Another interesting frequency here is

258
00:22:37,663 --> 00:22:40,238
the electron cyclotron frequency.

259
00:22:40,316 --> 00:22:43,412
This is what we call a 
resonance frequency.

260
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:46,116
It's the frequency at which

261
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:51,450
ω/K tends to zero, therefore,

262
00:22:51,478 --> 00:22:56,913
it's a frequency for which 
particularly this tends to zero

263
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:59,955
because K tends to plus infinity

264
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,847
and ω is different from zero.

265
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:07,974
As I was saying for the right-handed waves
ω = |Ωe| is a resonance.

266
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:11,818
So what happens around this frequency?

267
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:18,787
K becomes large. 
In this case

268
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:22,804
the mode starts to have a shorter 
and shorter wavelength.

269
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,202
Now, when a mode goes 
to very short wavelengths,

270
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:30,793
small [scale] dissipative processes 
start to play a role

271
00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:35,320
and therefore, the wave 
is somehow dissipated

272
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,551
because it's absorbed by the plasma

273
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:40,794
through these small dissipative processes.

274
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:47,238
Therefore, the resonance frequency, 
is a frequency at which

275
00:23:47,238 --> 00:23:50,314
there is absorption of the wave.

276
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:54,799
This was for the right-handed waves.

277
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,873
For the left-handed waves,

278
00:23:56,978 --> 00:24:01,145
we have a resonance for ω = Ωi

279
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:07,284
and a cut-off for ω = ωL.

280
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:11,014
And now let's turn our attention 
to the modes propagating

281
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:13,186
perpendicularly to the magnetic field,

282
00:24:13,343 --> 00:24:16,476
that is the ordinary 
and extraordinary modes.

283
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:20,783
The dispersion relation 
of the ordinary mode says that

284
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:28,199
ω² = ωpe² + K²c²,

285
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:31,525
while for the extraordinary modes 
we have that

286
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:36,265
K² c² / ω² =

287
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:56,617
(ω²-ωR²)(ω²-ωL²)/((ω²-ωLH²)(ω²-ωUH²))

288
00:24:57,047 --> 00:25:01,866
This is the ordinary mode (OM)
and this is the extraordinary mode (XM).

289
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:06,525
I just remind you what 
the lower hybrid

290
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:11,043
and upper hybrid frequencies are:

291
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:16,362
ωUH² = Ωe² + ωpe²

292
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:19,041
While the lower hybrid is given by:

293
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:34,673
ωLH² = Ωi |Ωe| x ...
{1 + me/mi (Ωe/ωpe)²} / (1 + Ωe²/ωpe² )

294
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:39,035
First of all what are 
the cut-off frequencies of these modes?

295
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:43,496
Those are the frequencies 
for which K tends to zero

296
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:47,748
with ω different from zero 
and clearly, for the ordinary mode,

297
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:51,953
it is given by ω = ωpe

298
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:55,261
while for the extraordinary mode 
they are given by

299
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:58,522
ω = ωR and ω = ωL .

300
00:25:58,522 --> 00:26:05,798
Resonances: there is no resonance 
for the ordinary mode,

301
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,267
but there are 2 for the extraordinary one,
given by the lower hybrid

302
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:12,853
and upper hybrid frequencies,
ω = ωLH and ω = ωUH .

303
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:16,786
What is the behavior 
for ω that tends to infinity?

304
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:23,904
For ω that tends to infinity then 
these 4 terms here tend to 1

305
00:26:24,097 --> 00:26:29,237
and therefore K²c²/ω²
tends to 1,

306
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:33,271
which means 
that ω/K tends to c,

307
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:36,304
and the same for the ordinary mode.

308
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,549
Now what happens in the limit of 
ω and K that tend to zero?

309
00:26:41,587 --> 00:26:46,782
First of all, this limit cannot be 
reached by the ordinary mode,

310
00:26:46,782 --> 00:26:50,383
so it has only relevance
for the extraordinary mode.

311
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:56,035
If you do the full calculation 
as we did for the left-handed

312
00:26:56,035 --> 00:27:00,330
and right-handed waves,
you'll find that ω²

313
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:06,254
becomes equal to cA² , 
the Alfvén speed squared

314
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,644
times K² .
[ ω² = cA² K² ]

315
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:13,970
So we have now all the elements 
to draw the dispersion relation of

316
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,910
the ordinary and extraordinary modes.

317
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:21,889
First, let's point the frequencies 
of interest:

318
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:27,938
these are: ωLH, ωL, ωpe,

319
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:32,549
ωUH, and ωR.

320
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:40,425
Then quite interesting there is 
an asymptote for ω/K = c

321
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,932
and a second one that is for 
ω/K = cA.

322
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:49,516
The ordinary mode cannot 
propagate for frequencies

323
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:53,144
that are below the 
electron plasma frequency (ωpe)

324
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:57,673
and will tend to ω/K = c
- to the dispersion relation

325
00:27:57,673 --> 00:28:00,284
of the electromagnetic waves, 
for ω that grows,

326
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:03,326
therefore, it will do something like that.

327
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,932
This is the ordinary mode.

328
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:08,998
And then if we look at 
the signs of this terms,

329
00:28:08,998 --> 00:28:13,255
we will see that the extraordinary mode
does not propagate

330
00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:18,327
for frequencies such that 
ωLH < ω < ωL

331
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:26,444
and same thing for frequencies 
ωUH < ω < ωR,

332
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:31,775
and the dispersion relation 
we tend to ω/K = cA

333
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:35,230
for small values of K and ω.

334
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:41,108
And ωLH will be 
a resonance frequency,

335
00:28:41,108 --> 00:28:45,634
therefore, the dispersion relation 
will do something like that.

336
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:51,638
It will go back here 
with ωL as a cut-off frequency,

337
00:28:51,888 --> 00:28:56,972
and it will tend to ωUH
which is the second resonance frequency,

338
00:28:56,972 --> 00:29:00,442
and then the mode will appear again

339
00:29:00,645 --> 00:29:06,094
at the cut-off frequency ωR
and the dispersion relation will tend

340
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:10,114
to that of the electromagnetic waves.

341
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:14,064
This is the dispersion relation 
of the extraordinary mode.

342
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:20,229
In the present module we have studied 
some of the properties of the waves

343
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:23,661
that propagate in a plasma
according to the two-fluid model.

344
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:29,443
First, we have pointed out
the ranges of frequencies

345
00:29:29,774 --> 00:29:33,334
at which left-handed,
right-handed waves and similiarly

346
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:36,267
ordinary, extraordinary modes propagate.

347
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:43,376
Then we have shown that in certain range
of frequencies the right-handed waves

348
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:47,159
have very interesting 
propagation properties,

349
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,570
and in this range of frequencies, 
the right-handed waves

350
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,621
are called whistler waves.

351
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:57,638
And finally we've pointed out that 
there exist some frequencies,

352
00:29:57,638 --> 00:30:00,526
the so called <i>cut-off</i>
and <i>resonance</i> frequencies

353
00:30:00,526 --> 00:30:04,480
that have a particular importance 
in the dynamics of the waves.

354
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,677
A cut-off frequency corresponds to 
a wave reflection

355
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:13,789
while the wave 
is absorbed at a resonance frequency.
