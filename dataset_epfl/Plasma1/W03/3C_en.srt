00:00:06,027 --> 00:00:07,225
Welcome!

2
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:10,488
Welcome to the Plasma Physics
course of EPFL.

3
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:16,169
In the past module, we have derived
the two-fluid dispersion relation.

4
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:19,720
If you want, the relation between

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,937
the frequency and the 
wavenumber of the modes

6
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:27,305
that are intrinsically 
present in a plasma,

7
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:30,065
according to the two-fluid description.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,388
Now it's time to look more into details
at what are these modes,

9
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:38,695
what are the waves that are actually
described by the two-fluid model.

10
00:00:38,982 --> 00:00:41,917
For this purpose
I will very briefly recall

11
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,159
the two-fluid dispersion relation,

12
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,845
and then I will show you
that there are waves

13
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:53,051
that are propagating both in the parallel
and the perpendicular direction

14
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,184
to the equilibrium magnetic field.

15
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:59,581
So to start, what is the equilibrium
we are considering?

16
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:02,964
We are considering a static equilibrium,

17
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:08,081
therefore, the equilibrium velocity
of the plasma species equal to zero.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,573
We are considering a plasma
that is neutral, of course,

19
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,387
in the equilibrium state, and therefore

20
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:20,832
where the equilibrium electric field 
is equal to zero

21
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:24,039
and we will also consider

22
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:30,361
an equilibrium magnetic field
that is uniform and static

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,049
and we will turn our coordinates system

24
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,345
in such a way that the
equilibrium magnetic field

25
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:40,187
becomes parallel to the ez vector.

26
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:48,472
As we are considering
the cold plasma dispersion relation,

27
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:51,626
I just remind you that we will assume
that

28
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:57,663
both the equilibrium and perturbation
of the temperature are equal to zero.

29
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:05,748
The linearization and Fourier mode
analysis of the two-fluid equations

30
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,276
and the Maxwell equations show us
that

31
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:27,317
(N² [KK/K² -𝟙] + ε )⋅E₁ = 0

32
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:37,635
where ε is given by
ε = iσ/(ε₀ ω) + 𝟙

33
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:41,119
and as we have seen in the past module,

34
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:53,029
this can be written as ...
introducing 3 functions ε₁, ε₂ and ε₃,

35
00:02:53,844 --> 00:03:06,439
where 
ε₁ = 1 + ∑ ωps²/(Ωs²-ω²)

36
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:15,506
Just to remind you 2 definitions,
Ωs = qs B₀/ms : cyclotron frequency

37
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:20,836
and the plasma frequency:
ωps² = ns₀ qs²/(ε₀ ms) ,

38
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:35,145
and ε₂ is given by
ε₂ = - ∑ Ωs/ω ωps²/(Ωs²-ω²)

39
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:39,696
and 
ε₃ = 1 - ∑ ωps²/ω²

40
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:43,525
The intrinsic modes present
in the system are the ones

41
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:48,568
for which the determinant
of this matrix is equal to zero.

42
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:52,153
A few observations.

43
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:57,050
First of all, by looking
at this dispersion relation

44
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:02,225
we can observe that the plasma
seems to be an anisotropic medium.

45
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:05,791
The direction, the third direction,

46
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,677
the z-direction along the magnetic field

47
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:11,385
is actually very different

48
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,159
than what happens
in the plane perpendicular to it.

49
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,343
Well let's give a look.

50
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:22,044
Is this due to the presence
of the equilibrium magnetic field?

51
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:28,530
Let's take the limit of equilibrium 
magnetic field equal to zero

52
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:32,892
which implies that 
the cyclotron frequency is equal to zero

53
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:41,830
and this implies that ε₁,
if Ωs² = 0,

54
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:45,032
ε₁ becomes equal to ε₃

55
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:55,153
i.e. equal to 
1 - ∑ ωps²/ω²

56
00:04:55,311 --> 00:05:01,128
while ε₂,
being proportional to Ωs,

57
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:02,736
becomes equal to zero.

58
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:09,189
Well, the off-diagonal terms of ε,
therefore, are equal to zero

59
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,546
and ε₁ becomes equal to ε₃

60
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:22,984
It means that ε = ε₃ 𝟙

61
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,897
In this case, the plasma 
is an isotropic medium.

62
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,963
Second observation
that I would like to do:

63
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:38,628
well let's look at our space, xyz.

64
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:43,302
We have that 
the equilibrium magnetic field

65
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:49,221
is in the direction of the z-axis.

66
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:56,503
We can turn the x and y axes

67
00:05:56,503 --> 00:06:00,313
in such a way that the K vector

68
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:07,105
lies on the yz plane,
and denoting θ as the angle

69
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:11,244
between the z-axis and K.

70
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:17,357
We can write K as the K component

71
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:22,150
along the y direction,
plus the component in the z direction.

72
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:28,470
With this expression for K,
we have that this term here,

73
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:36,033
(N² [KK/K² -𝟙] + ε )

74
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:40,682
becomes equal to -N² +ε₁ ,

75
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:47,492
i ε₂, 0, 0, N² sinθ cosθ,

76
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:53,364
N² sinθ cosθ,

77
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:55,580
and for the last term,

78
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,056
- N² sin² θ + ε₃

79
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:06,319
What are the intrinsic modes
present in our plasma?

80
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:08,716
We will show that there are modes

81
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:12,894
that are propagating parallel
to the magnetic field.

82
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:18,913
That means that the angle between
the magnetic field and the K vector,

83
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:21,218
the angle θ is equal to zero

84
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:25,548
and modes that propagate in the direction
perpendicular to the magnetic field

85
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,852
where θ = π/2.

86
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:33,273
We can start by analyzing the modes
propagating parallel

87
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:34,983
to the magnetic field.

88
00:07:36,193 --> 00:07:40,150
In the three-dimensional space,

89
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,683
a magnetic field
that is in the z direction

90
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:51,294
and the same thing for K,
which we plot

91
00:07:51,843 --> 00:08:00,364
equal to 
K sinθ ey + K cosθ ez

92
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:05,827
okay, we will write equal to K ez.

93
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:10,349
Basically, we will consider
the case θ=0.

94
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:14,000
In this case, the dispersion relation,

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,229
the determinant of 
this matrix equal to zero.

96
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:23,077
What we can immediately notice is that
there are two families of solutions.

97
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:27,179
In fact, the determinant of this matrix
can be equal to zero,

98
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:30,179
because ε₃ is equal to zero,

99
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:34,531
or because the determinant of this 
2-by-2 two matrix is equal to zero.

100
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:41,314
The first case is such that 
ε₃ = 0,

101
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:51,332
which means 
1 - ∑ ωps²/ω² = 0

102
00:08:52,779 --> 00:09:02,221
which implies that
ω² = ∑ ωps²

103
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:07,807
and now as the electron plasma frequency
is much higher than the ion one,

104
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:18,744
a good approximation can be written as
ω² = ∑ ωps² ≃ ωpe²

105
00:09:19,385 --> 00:09:21,404
What have we found?

106
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:24,826
ω² ≃ ωpe²

107
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:26,608
These are the <i>plasma waves</i>,

108
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:32,910
that were the subject of our first lecture
of the Plasma Physics course.

109
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:38,693
It's a wave that takes place only
in the direction parallel

110
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:45,828
to the magnetic field
for which B₀ is parallel to K

111
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:51,648
which is also parallel
to the perturbed electric field E₁.

112
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:57,026
These are the waves
that are present in a plasma

113
00:09:57,026 --> 00:10:01,522
because the plasma wants
to restore the quasi-neutrality.

114
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:07,821
They are not affected by the 
presence of the magnetic field.

115
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:10,537
It was nice to retrieve

116
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:13,485
the dispersion relation
of the plasma waves.

117
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:18,463
Now, let's look at something new
that we see here.

118
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,735
The determinant
of this 2-by-2 two matrix.

119
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:25,786
This determinant can be written

120
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:38,514
as 
(-N² + ε₁)² - ε₂² = 0

121
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:46,948
and this is 
-N² + ε₁ = ± ε₂

122
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:58,311
from which we derive that 
N² = ε₁ + ε₂ = εR

123
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:03,308
and this will give, as we will see
in a moment,

124
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:07,241
the dispersion relation
of the <i>right-handed waves</i>

125
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:16,438
and N² = ε₁ - ε₂ = εL

126
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:23,796
and this gives the dispersion relation
of the <i>left-handed waves</i>.

127
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,916
We have therefore found
that there are three families of waves

128
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:33,215
that propagate in the direction
parallel to the magnetic field:

129
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,938
plasma waves, right handed waves,
and left handed waves.

130
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:40,650
Let's focus on the last two.

131
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:44,682
First of all, let's look at why
they are called in this way,

132
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:48,179
and then on what is
their dispersion relation.

133
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:51,915
So let's look at the right-handed waves,

134
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:58,088
for which N² = ε₁ + ε₂

135
00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:01,657
and for which we have defined
this quantity as εR.

136
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:09,030
Now, the equation that we had found
for wave dynamics says

137
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:25,940
that 
(N² [KK/K² -𝟙] + ε )⋅E₁

138
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,351
has to be equal to zero.

139
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:34,098
Let's see what the first equation
of this linear system

140
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:38,458
tells us about the relationship

141
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:43,269
between the electric field
in the different directions.

142
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:45,820
If we look component by component,

143
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,928
this linear system tells us
for the first equation

144
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:56,732
(with θ = 0) that

145
00:12:57,312 --> 00:13:04,219
(-N²+ ε₁) Ex - i ε₂ Ey

146
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:08,516
has to be equal to 0,
as there is no contribution,

147
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:11,875
no terms are related to Ez.

148
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:26,171
This means that Ex
will be equal to i ε₂ Ey / (-N² + ε₁)

149
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:31,519
Now we can replace the expression
for N² that we have from here

150
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:42,985
and this will be equal to 
i ε₂ / ( - ε₁ - ε₂ + ε₁ ) Ey

151
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:44,874
which is
therefore equal to,

152
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:49,588
simplifying, -ε₁ with + ε₁

153
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:55,401
and dividing ε₂ by ε₂

154
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:57,578
-i Ey.

155
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:00,660
What does it mean?

156
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,084
If we call Ex E,

157
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:12,286
we will have that Ey will be,
for the right handed waves, equal to iE.

158
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,361
Okay, this is a relation in Fourier space.

159
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:22,050
How can it be translated in real space?

160
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:27,579
We will have that the electric field
will be given by the real part

161
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:32,613
of the electric vector

162
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:38,343
E ex + iE ey

163
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:44,576
multiplied by the exponential factor
that enters in the Fourier mode

164
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:50,593
exp {i (K⋅r - ωt) }

165
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,678
Now, let's suppose that
we place ourselves for simplicity

166
00:14:55,678 --> 00:15:00,041
at the r = 0 location.

167
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:06,329
We will have that the real part
of this expression, for r = 0

168
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,438
will be given by, -for the x direction,

169
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:19,438
by E cos(ωt)ex + E sin(ωt)ey .

170
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:25,748
Let's try to draw what we have 
just derived mathematically.

171
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:31,679
So we have our 3D coordinates, xyz

172
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,460
the equilibrium magnetic field
is in the z direction.

173
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:43,051
The electric field will be
on the xy plane

174
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,700
and the direction of the electric field

175
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,437
on the xy plane will evolve in time

176
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,365
according to the law
that we have just derived,

177
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:57,512
In particular, if when we draw an angle

178
00:15:57,512 --> 00:16:03,385
between the electric field and the x axis

179
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,775
and we call this θ,
[not the angle between K and ez]

180
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:11,077
we see that this θ
will be equal to ωt.

181
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:16,668
You see that the electric field
rotates in the xy plane

182
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:23,283
in a direction such that by using
the right hand rule,

183
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:32,091
the direction of rotation
coincides with the B₀ field.

184
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:36,234
This is why this is called
the right-handed wave.

185
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:41,340
Now, let's give a look in more detail
at what is the dispersion relation

186
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,655
of the right handed waves.

187
00:16:44,346 --> 00:16:52,638
What we have is that 
N² = K² c² /ω²

188
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:58,717
which is equal to εR,
that is ε₁ + ε₂.

189
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:04,366
And then, if you substitute the 
expression for ε₁ and ε₂

190
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:09,852
that we have seen previously,
you find that

191
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:12,378
this will be given by ω²

192
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:16,596
plus the electron and ion 
cyclotron frequencies [ (Ωe + Ωi) ]

193
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:22,256
divided by--
let me just point in evidence

194
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:24,912
that the sign of Ωe

195
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:31,348
-- Ωe is a negative quantity,
to put in evidence this negative sign

196
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:34,820
and we will take the absolute value
and put a minus here, [ (ω - |Ωe|) ]

197
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:41,051
and then multiply by 
(ω + Ωi).

198
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:47,397
This expression here
can actually be written as

199
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:52,935
-- we won't make any change
in the denominator,

200
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:57,979
-- and we will decompose the numerator
into the product of 2 terms

201
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:05,316
which involve two frequencies:
ωR and ωL

202
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:10,057
which are given approximately

203
00:18:10,234 --> 00:18:14,312
-- this is why I am using
an approximate equal here,

204
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:29,187
by 
ωR = 1/2 { |Ωe| + sqrt( Ωe² + 4 ωpe² ) }

205
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:34,605
which is a general quantity
that is greater than |Ωe|,

206
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:47,954
and ωL which is given by
ωL = 1/2 {-|Ωe| + sqrt( Ωe² + 4 ωpe² ) }

207
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:51,714
If you look at this, as this is a quantity

208
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:55,329
that is always larger than |Ωe|,

209
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:58,409
this will be always greater than zero.

210
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:04,274
So these ωR and ωL are, in practice,

211
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:08,629
the solutions of the quadratic equation

212
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:15,888
that we have here at the numerator
and which are evaluated

213
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:22,151
in the limit of the electron mass
being much smaller than the ion mass.

214
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:27,943
So this is the dispersion relation
for the right-handed waves.

215
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:32,764
Now we can derive a similar expression
for the left handed waves

216
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,630
by observing that 
N² = ε₁ - ε₂ ,

217
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:42,890
that is what we have called εL.

218
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:48,574
In this case we won't do the calculation
as we did for the right-handed waves

219
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:54,656
but let me say that the rotation
of the electric field

220
00:19:54,656 --> 00:20:00,174
will be in the direction opposite
to the magnetic field, B₀,

221
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:03,375
and this is why

222
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:10,106
this is called left-handed wave,
and the dispersion relation turns out

223
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:15,203
to be 
N² = K²c²/ω²

224
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:34,854
and this is equal to 
(ω+ωR) (ω-ωL) / ( (ω+|Ωe|) (ω-Ωi) )

225
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:39,323
We will study the physics
of the left-handed waves

226
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,952
and of the right-handed waves
in the next module.

227
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:46,903
Now, let's focus our attention
on the waves propagating

228
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:49,910
in a direction perpendicular
to the magnetic field

229
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:54,792
the waves for which the K vector
is in the y direction,

230
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:59,093
and therefore θ = π /2.

231
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:03,491
Let's derive the dispersion relation
for these waves.

232
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:09,162
For waves propagating
perpendicular to the magnetic field,

233
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:11,212
θ = π /2

234
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:16,215
and what we have to evaluate
is the determinant of a matrix

235
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:20,641
that is -N²+ ε₁,

236
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:25,003
i ε₂,

237
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:28,773
0, i ε₂,

238
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:34,273
ε₁, 0, 0,

239
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:39,070
-N²+ ε₃, 
is equal to zero

240
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:46,460
which can be written
as the product of these terms here,

241
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:53,867
times the determinant of the 
2-by-2 matrix up here equal to zero.

242
00:21:56,654 --> 00:22:00,380
Here too we have two possibilities.

243
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,198
The first one is that 
-N²+ ε₃ = 0.

244
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:12,333
This is the ordinary mode
we will denote with OM

245
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:20,923
which therefore, -N²+ ε₃ = 0.

246
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:28,267
In this case the electric field
is again in the direction parallel to B,

247
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:32,566
therefore E is parallel to B₀

248
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:37,005
and if you try to evaluate
the dispersion relation

249
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:40,221
you plug the correct expression
for ε₃,

250
00:22:40,221 --> 00:23:04,552
you find that 
K² c² / ω² = 1 - ∑ ωps² / ω²

251
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:07,525
which is approximately equal to,

252
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:12,422
-- as the ion plasma frequency
is much lower than the electron one,

253
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:14,310
this is approximately equal to

254
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:20,761
1 - ωpe² / ω².

255
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,965
This is the so-called ordinary mode

256
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:28,135
that satisfies this first term 
is equal to zero.

257
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:33,022
There is another kind of wave
that is present in our system

258
00:23:33,173 --> 00:23:40,491
that is one for which
the second term vanishes.

259
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:47,751
These are the waves that are called
the extraordinary mode, XM.

260
00:23:50,433 --> 00:24:00,472
So for these waves, 
ε₁(-N²+ ε₁)-ε₂² = 0

261
00:24:00,514 --> 00:24:02,624
has to be equal to zero.

262
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:08,211
For this wave we will have 
that Ex and Ey

263
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:10,618
are in general different from zero

264
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,993
but Ez will be constrained
to be equal to zero,

265
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:19,604
and then, if we try to solve
the dispersion relation,

266
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:27,797
we will find by expressing N²
in terms of ε₁ and ε₂

267
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:35,387
that 
N² = (ε₁² - ε₂²) / ε₁

268
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:40,823
which we can write as ...

269
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,011
-sorry, there is a minus here,

270
00:24:44,011 --> 00:24:49,225
it's the difference between
ε₁² and ε₂².

271
00:24:49,911 --> 00:25:02,611
.. this can be decomposed as 
(ε₁ + ε₂) (ε₁ - ε₂) / ε₁

272
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:08,656
These are two terms
that are now familiar to us.

273
00:25:10,326 --> 00:25:16,490
They are called εL
and εR, divided by ε₁

274
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:25,600
and now, this can be written
by decomposing the product,

275
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,228
εL εR
as ....

276
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,165
-it's a few lines of algebra
that I spare you...

277
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:50,670
(ω²-ωR²)(ω²-ωL²)/((ω²-ωLH²)(ω²-ωUH²))

278
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:53,134
and we will give the definition
in a few seconds

279
00:25:53,905 --> 00:25:59,945
[same formula as before]
(ω²-ωR²)(ω²-ωL²)/((ω²-ωLH²)(ω²-ωUH²))

280
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:04,493
What are the frequencies
that we have just introduced?

281
00:26:05,153 --> 00:26:15,160
ωUH² = Ωe² + ωpe²

282
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,557
plus the electron plasma frequency,
and we have denoted that as <i>UH</i>

283
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:25,204
as we call it <i>Upper Hybrid frequency.</i>

284
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:27,957
It's a hybrid frequency as it involves

285
00:26:27,957 --> 00:26:32,051
both the cyclotron
and the plasma frequency.

286
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:41,441
We've also introduced ωLH²
and this is equal to Ωi |Ωe|

287
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:53,128
and then times 
( 1 + me/mi (Ωe/ωpe)² )

288
00:26:53,603 --> 00:27:02,855
divided by 
(1 + Ωe²/ωpe² )

289
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,585
This is what we have called
<i>Lower Hybrid frequency</i>.

290
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:11,898
This is the reason of having used 
the subscript LH.

291
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:16,685
To summarize the contents
of the present module,

292
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:21,298
let me first of all say that we
have actually pointed out

293
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:25,375
that the plasma, even within
a relatively simple model

294
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,509
such as the two-fluid model
in the cold plasma limits,

295
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:31,228
the plasma is actually a complex medium.

296
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:36,295
It supports, in fact, a large 
number of intrinsic modes.

297
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:42,903
We have pointed out that, propagating
<b>parallel</b> to the equilibrium magnetic field

298
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:45,137
there are:
- plasma waves

299
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:48,597
- right-handed waves,
- left-handed waves.

300
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:51,808
And propagating <b>perpendicular</b>
to the magnetic field

301
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:55,154
that we have extraordinary (XM)
and ordinary (OM) modes.

302
00:27:56,097 --> 00:28:01,072
The physical properties
of these modes, of these waves,

303
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:04,805
will be the subject of the next module.
