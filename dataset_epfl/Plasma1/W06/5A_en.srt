00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,776
Welcome to the course on Plasma
Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:13,955
In this introductory module, we will
discuss some industrial applications,

3
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:18,166
we will see why plasma chemistry
is a difficult subject,

4
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:22,601
we will go through some different types
of reactions and collisions,

5
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:26,099
and then we come to the key
to plasma processing,

6
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,676
which is low temperature,
non-equilibrium plasma.

7
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:34,070
And then we will finish with a brief
application to plasma medicine.

8
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:38,133
Industrial plasma applications
can be found in all walks of life

9
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,873
as you can see from this list on the left.

10
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:44,902
In this course, I will speak,
the next two modules

11
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:49,696
about the space industry,
and finally, on microelectronics

12
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:54,838
which is important for all our computing
and other electrical devices.

13
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:58,642
Plasma physics is used more and more
in the medical domain,

14
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,260
for sterilization,

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,301
wound, dental and cancer treatment.

16
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:07,207
Why is plasma chemistry
a difficult subject?

17
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:11,645
Let's compare it with fusion physics
and see the differences.

18
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:16,066
In industrial plasmas, we tend to have
a high pressure of neutrals

19
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:18,021
with a low degree of ionization --

20
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:22,396
that is, about only one particle
in a million is ionized.

21
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:26,933
Therefore we have collisional damping,
that is 'no wave' physics,

22
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:32,491
and we often have no magnetic field,
that is, no magnetohydrodynamics.

23
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:35,235
So what is the difficulty
with plasma chemistry?

24
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:38,314
We can see that in this diagram here,

25
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:41,823
where we have a gas inlet of molecules,

26
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:43,582
we have an electrical power source

27
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:47,014
which creates a plasma with
a certain electron density

28
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:48,822
and electron temperature.

29
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:53,182
These molecules are dissociated
by the plasma --

30
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:55,054
by the electrons in the plasma --

31
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:57,191
to create neutral radicals,

32
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:58,998
positive ions,

33
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:01,872
and even negative ions by attachment.

34
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:06,974
All these species can undergo secondary
reactions between themselves

35
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:11,413
which create a very complicated soup
of plasma species.

36
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:17,329
In this bulk plasma, the transport
is determined by simple diffusion,

37
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:21,326
for radicals
and ambipolar diffusion for ions.

38
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:24,125
There's also transport to the sheath,

39
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:28,069
which will be the subject
of the fourth and fifth module,

40
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:31,761
where the positive ions
are transported to the surface,

41
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:34,763
and negative ions are trapped
inside the plasma.

42
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:39,672
On the substrate itself,
there are also surface reactions

43
00:02:39,672 --> 00:02:43,187
which change the composition
of the plasma.

44
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:48,109
The final saturated molecules
are pumped out through to the exhaust.

45
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:53,176
The complication of plasma chemistry
comes from all of these different types

46
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:54,443
of species.

47
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:58,083
We have many different types of reactions,

48
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,441
for example, gas phase
reactions in the volume,

49
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:04,386
which are called <i>homogeneous</i>
because these are reactions

50
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:06,378
between gas and gas.

51
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:12,016
Type of reactions possible are electrons
which ionize molecules,

52
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:14,343
therefore giving two electrons.

53
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:17,751
We'll see this in module 2 and 3.

54
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:24,365
There's also dissociation of the neutrals
into separate atoms or molecule groups.

55
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:28,947
And even attachment to molecules
which can give negative ions.

56
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:33,493
There are also gas surface reactions
which are called <i>heterogeneous</i>

57
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:37,342
because this is between a gas phase
and a solid phase.

58
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:41,566
We see that ions are always neutralized

59
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:44,003
with high efficiency on surfaces.

60
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:48,451
Therefore electrons and ions
are neutralized on surfaces.

61
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:52,825
Hydrogen atoms associate on surfaces.

62
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:56,524
These atoms cannot recombine
in the volume

63
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:01,109
because it's difficult to conserve
momentum and energy

64
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,612
in a volume process.

65
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:07,421
Therefore hydrogen atoms, for example,
recombine only on surfaces.

66
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:13,435
Another surface reaction is where
positive ions bombard the surface

67
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:16,211
and release a secondary electron.

68
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:21,918
Yet another is sputtering, where ions
release a component of the surface itself.

69
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:29,611
And finally, very useful applications
are concerning deposition,

70
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:34,734
where a gaseous atom 'A' reacts
with a surface species 'B'

71
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:38,402
and forms a solid surface deposition.

72
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,474
The opposite process is etching,

73
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:46,371
where a gaseous atom 'A'
reacts with a surface atom 'B',

74
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:50,070
and A and B both leave as a gas
and are pumped away.

75
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:57,584
The transport of species to surfaces
is guaranteed by diffusion,

76
00:04:57,584 --> 00:05:00,884
by neutral flux, which is Fick's law

77
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:06,461
or for ions, it's the Bohm criterion
which we will show in modules 4 and 5.

78
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,971
Now we will consider elastic collisions.

79
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:13,085
That means where only kinetic
energy is exchanged.

80
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:17,039
Consider this case
of billiard ball collisions,

81
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,671
where a ball of speed 'V'
strikes a ball which is at rest,

82
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,513
and afterwards they move off
with their separate velocities.

83
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:30,577
We consider conservation of momentum
and conservation of energy,

84
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:33,882
and simple Newtonian physics shows

85
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:36,793
that the maximum fraction
of energy transferred

86
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:40,962
to Mass 'M' (big 'M')
is this expression here.

87
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:45,174
We can simplify this
for the case of electrons.

88
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:47,625
For an electron striking an atom,

89
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,612
<i>m</i> is much smaller than <i>M</i>,

90
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:55,108
and therefore this fraction of energy
transferred is very much less than 1.

91
00:05:56,246 --> 00:06:02,775
In contrast to ions, where,
for an ion striking an atom,

92
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:05,334
the masses are almost exactly the same,

93
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:09,338
and therefore the fraction of energy
transferred is almost 1.

94
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,643
This has important implications
for plasma physics

95
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:18,068
because it means electrons do not
efficiently heat the gas,

96
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:23,930
that is, the electrons do <i>not</i> transfer
much of their energy to neutral atoms,

97
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,101
whereas in contrast, ions thermalize
efficiently with a gas

98
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:31,755
and with collisions with a wall.

99
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:34,741
Let's put this discussion
on a more formal footing.

100
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:39,662
In a plasma, the electrons gain energy
from the electric field,

101
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:42,249
and they transfer this energy to the gas,

102
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:48,028
The average power gain per electron
is the force on the electron

103
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:50,456
times the electron drift speed,

104
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,615
which is the electric field
times the electron charge

105
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,148
times the drift speed.

106
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:59,991
Both of these are negative and cancel out
to be a positive value.

107
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,680
The electron drift speed
is the electron mobility

108
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,313
times the electric field.

109
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:08,844
And the electron mobility
is the electronic charge

110
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,263
divided by electron mass

111
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:14,642
times the collision frequency
of electrons and neutrals.

112
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:19,991
For an electron temperature Te
and gas temperature Tgas,

113
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:23,317
the average energy loss
per electron collision

114
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,777
is the energy difference,

115
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:29,341
which is the electron charge times
the temperatures in electron volts,

116
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:33,929
times this delta which is the fraction
of energy transfer

117
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,249
we saw in the previous slides.

118
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:40,407
Therefore the average
power loss per electron

119
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:45,088
is the average energy loss
times the number of collisions per second.

120
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:49,425
Therefore in steady state,
we have a simple expression

121
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:51,987
for the difference in gas
electron temperature

122
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:53,484
and gas temperature

123
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:57,101
which defines as 1/pressure squared.

124
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:02,165
So this is a reminder
of the previous expression.

125
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,630
Now we find that in low pressures,

126
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,922
the difference in temperatures
can become very high.

127
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:10,574
And therefore we have
a non-equilibrium plasma,

128
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:14,842
where the electron temperature can be
much higher than the ion temperature

129
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:18,454
at low pressures
of the order of 1 millibar.

130
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:22,413
At higher pressures and between
conducting electrodes,

131
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:24,474
this will lead to a thermal plasma

132
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:27,459
where the temperatures
are almost all equal.

133
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,958
But at low pressures,
the ion temperature

134
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,512
is somewhere similar
to the room temperature

135
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,373
and the electrons have
a few electron volts.

136
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:40,835
Now you might ask the question,
What are the use of electrons

137
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:45,329
if they only transfer a small amount
of their energy to the gas?

138
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,999
Well let's consider a different situation

139
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:54,825
where the electron billiard ball hits
an atomic mass at rest,

140
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,375
but afterwards this time,
the atomic particle,

141
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:02,293
or the molecule can be considered
to be excited.

142
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:06,521
That is, there is some internal
energy gain by a target.

143
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:12,246
We repeat conservation of momentum
and conservation of energy,

144
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:16,678
but this time, including
the internal energy of the atom 'M',

145
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:22,566
and now we find that the maximum fraction
of internal energy transferred

146
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,965
is almost 100% for electrons.

147
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:29,846
That is, the electrons are capable
of giving up almost all of their energy

148
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:31,570
to the target molecule.

149
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:36,693
At the same time, the electrons
simultaneously give

150
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:41,556
only a very small fraction
of their kinetic energy to the gas.

151
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:49,814
This means, in conclusion, that high
energy electrons can modify chemical bonds

152
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:53,429
in molecules without heating the gas.

153
00:09:54,713 --> 00:09:57,774
This is then the key to industrial
plasma processing.

154
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:02,341
In low temperature,
non-equilibrium plasmas --

155
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:08,169
and by the way, by 'low temperature,'
I mean only a few electron volts,

156
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:11,094
which is much colder
than fusion plasmas --

157
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:14,262
but nevertheless, don't forget,
that two electron volts

158
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:16,784
is still 23,000 Kelvin.

159
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,606
Non-equilibrium plasmas means
the electron temperature

160
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:22,591
is much higher than the gas temperature.

161
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,821
And the key to industrial
plasma processing

162
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:29,972
is that we can do high temperature
plasma chemistry

163
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:32,402
on low temperature substrates.

164
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:37,877
When I say 'low temperature substrates,'
this can mean, for example,

165
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:41,340
glass, plastics, or even people.

166
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:45,931
Let's look at one example
of an application in medicine.

167
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:51,401
We will consider a low temperature
dielectric barrier discharge

168
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:56,539
jet in air, where we have a rare gas
flowing into a dielectric tube,

169
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,476
which could be glass.

170
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:03,074
This glass separates the gas
from the conducting electrodes

171
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:07,224
which have an alternating
voltage across them.

172
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:10,382
This creates a plasma in the tube
and a plasma jet

173
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:12,391
emanating from the tube.

174
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:15,731
This plasma jet could be used
for sterilization, for example,

175
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:18,142
for killing bacteria.

176
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:23,756
It could also be used to treat skin,
wounds, cancer, teeth, etc.

177
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:29,646
Now the plasma medical mechanisms
are not fully understood,

178
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:34,801
but the plasma creates chemical species
such as reactive oxygen

179
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:37,131
and nitrogen radicals.

180
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:42,076
The plasma also produces photons,
for example ultraviolet photons.

181
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,599
The plasma has electric fields,

182
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:49,861
and it also has electrical charges
in the form of electrons and ions.

183
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:54,191
All of these four types of effects
could play a role,

184
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:56,964
and maybe even synergy between them.

185
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:01,895
Now plasma physics and biochemistry
is certainly a complex subject

186
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,995
but there's been very rapid progress
in the last decade.

187
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:09,090
To summarize this introductory module,

188
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,452
we had a brief introduction
to plasma chemistry,

189
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:17,251
we saw that electrons are hotter
than the ions and the gas.

190
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:23,258
We saw that this gave a low temperature,
non-equilibrium plasma,

191
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:27,284
and the key to industrial
plasma processing,

192
00:12:27,284 --> 00:12:31,124
which is that we have high temperature
plasma chemistry

193
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:33,741
on low temperature substrates.

194
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,812
We finished with a brief application
to plasma medicine.
