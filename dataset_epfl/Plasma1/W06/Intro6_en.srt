00:00:00,498 --> 00:00:04,320
Plasmas are widely used in industry
for many applications and products

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,375
that we have in our daily lives,

3
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:08,236
As shown in the five modules 
of this lecture

4
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:09,813
on basic industrial plasmas.

5
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:13,441
The plasma parameters in plasma physics 
are very different

6
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:15,666
from fusion and astrophysical plasmas.

7
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:18,887
These differences are explained 
in the first module,

8
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:22,154
in which we provide the general 
introduction to basic industrial plasmas

9
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:23,617
and plasma chemistry.

10
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:27,853
We will show the one key 
to industrial plasma processing

11
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:31,947
is that high temperature plasma chemistry,
at thousands of degrees Centigrade,

12
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:34,502
can be applied to 
low temperature substrates,

13
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,724
such as glass, plastics, and even people.

14
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:41,619
In the next two modules, we describe 
how a plasma actually starts,

15
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:45,175
that is how a plasma forms, 
from the moment when the voltage

16
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,942
is first applied across 
electrodes in a gas.

17
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:52,027
As an example of application, we consider 
how to apply our knowledge

18
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:54,685
to a practical case
in the design of satellites.

19
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:00,290
In the last two modules, we discuss 
the basic physics of the plasma sheath

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,237
and the applications to plasma etching 
and macro-electronic manufacturing.

21
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:08,350
We show what happens when a plasma 
that has formed comes into contact

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,603
with a material surface.

23
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,648
Clearly this is important 
for any plasma application

24
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,414
where devices are manufactured.

25
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:18,338
One extremely important 
and lucrative example is

26
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:21,781
the field of micro-electronics, 
which has revolutionized our lives

27
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,439
over the last 50 years.

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,316
This part of the course is taught 
by Dr. Alan Howling,

29
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:29,274
a senior scientist 
with long-standing experience

30
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:31,448
in industrial and associated
application of plasmas.
