00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:09,177
Welcome to the course in Plasma Physics
and Applications.

2
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:12,942
In the next two modules, we will consider
electrical breakdown

3
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:14,543
in low pressure gases.

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,447
As an example, we will consider
a communication satellite

5
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:23,518
orbiting the earth, which is powered
by photovoltaic solar panels.

6
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:28,268
Now the communication satellite
is aimed at the ground

7
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:32,247
and the photovoltaic solar panels
are aimed at the sun.

8
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:36,322
And therefore, there has
to be some relative rotation,

9
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:39,641
which is guaranteed by
a slip-ring assembly.

10
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:45,011
Now in this example of breakdown,
this is an application where we want

11
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,919
to design the slip-ring assembly
to avoid electrical breakdown.

12
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,224
Therefore, we have to consider
the physics of electrical breakdown

13
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:54,924
in low pressure gases.

14
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:59,484
In this course, we will first consider
background ionization

15
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:03,501
and then the first and second
Townsend coefficients

16
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:08,163
and then we will come
to breakdown criterion in gases.

17
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:13,267
As an example, we will take
a vacuum vessel here with electrodes

18
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:18,163
of a few centimeters dimensions
and the vessel is filled with argon

19
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:20,661
to a pressure of a few millibars.

20
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:26,606
We will apply a <i>dc voltage</i> between
a cathode and the anode

21
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:31,780
and the question is: does a plasma
form immediately?

22
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:38,925
That is, how does the plasma start
or where does the first electron come from

23
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:40,536
to start the plasma?

24
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:45,288
The answer to this is that there is
always background radiation on earth

25
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:49,987
coming from cosmic rays or radioactivity
in the environment.

26
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:55,022
These rays or radioactivity can cause
photoemission from the cathode

27
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:59,941
or photoionization in the gas
and these release electrons,

28
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:03,896
which travel in the electric field from
the cathode to the anode.

29
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:11,641
Let's say that the photoemission
creates <i>N₀.</i> charges per second

30
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:16,921
and when all of these charges
are collected at the anode

31
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:21,588
then we have a saturation current,
that is the saturation current is equal to

32
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:26,365
the rate of production of all electrons
times the electronic charge.

33
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:31,384
This current is generally very small,
of the order or picoamps,

34
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:36,674
and this situation occurs for voltages
up to, say, ten volts.

35
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:40,682
Now this discharge is too weak
to be visible.

36
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:43,373
It depends only on an external source.

37
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,694
This is not a self-sustaining plasma.

38
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:49,992
Now if we now increase
the voltage still further,

39
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:55,195
then the electron impact on atoms
will eventually lead to ionization --

40
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:57,924
something considered
in the previous module --

41
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:02,708
where each electron will therefore
give rise to two electrons

42
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,237
and the ion of the original atom.

43
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:10,955
The discharge current will now increase
strongly above the saturation current

44
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:16,124
because each electron can create
an avalanche of electron-ion pairs,

45
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:20,100
as we see schematically in this diagram,
where each electron

46
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,469
arriving strikes an atom creating
therefore two electrons,

47
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:28,200
which are accelerated
in the electric field.

48
00:03:28,464 --> 00:03:31,951
This repeats, causing an avalanche
to the anode.

49
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:37,634
This was considered by Townsend
in the year 1900.

50
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:43,979
Townsend introduced something called
the "first ionization coefficient,"

51
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:50,456
which he defined as <i>α = the number
of ionizing collisions per electron,</i>

52
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:53,436
<i>per unit length along the electric field.</i>

53
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:58,650
Now let's look at the number of electrons
arriving at the anode

54
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,490
due to the avalanche phenomenon
of electrons coming from the cathode.

55
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:09,428
If <i>N.</i> is the rate of electrons arriving
at position <i>x</i>,

56
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:16,319
then by definition of <i>α</i>, the increase
in the rate of electrons crossing <i>x + dx</i>

57
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,569
is <i>N.</i> times <i>αdx</i>, which is the increase
of the number of electrons

58
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:24,941
due to ionization in the slice <i>dx</i>.

59
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,380
We integrate this from the cathode
to the plane at <i>x</i>

60
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,171
and if <i>α</i> is independent of <i>x</i>,

61
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:38,844
then we find that the rate of electrons
crossing <i>x</i> increases

62
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:45,637
with the exponential of <i>x</i> and therefore,
the current leaving the anode --

63
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:48,449
since electrons have negative charge --

64
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,095
this current leaving the anode
is the number of electrons

65
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:59,751
leaving the cathode times the charge of
the electrons times the exponential of <i>αd</i>

66
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:06,392
and therefore the current is <i>i₀eᵃᵈ</i>,
where <i>i₀</i> is the saturation current

67
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:08,002
from the previous slide.

68
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,758
This strong increase in current
is called the "avalanche effect."

69
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:19,727
Don't forget that every electron
ionizing event creates positive ions,

70
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:22,171
which travel back in
the opposite direction.

71
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:26,487
Therefore, you can convince yourself
that the current crossing any plane

72
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:30,223
is everywhere the same
by continuity of current.

73
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:37,103
So the number of electrons arriving
at the anode it <i>N₀.eᵃᵈ</i>.

74
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,224
There are no positive ions
leaving the anode,

75
00:05:39,224 --> 00:05:43,550
so this, the minus <i>e</i> times
this is the current arriving here.

76
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,992
The positive ions travel back
and the sum total of current arriving

77
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:53,703
at the [at] cathode is also <i>i₀eᵃᵈ</i>
and this current circulates

78
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:56,071
also in the external circuit.

79
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,588
So if we go back to our
current voltage graph,

80
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:05,994
we find that beyond several volts,
beyond the saturation current,

81
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:11,072
we enter the Townsend discharge
regime defined by α

82
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:14,989
where the current is increasing
exponentially with distance.

83
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,105
Now if we look again at
the cathode and the anode,

84
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:23,026
we consider what happens
when the ions themselves

85
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:25,424
arrive back at the cathode.

86
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:27,709
So we have the start electron.

87
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,652
This causes an ionizing event,
the ion goes back to the cathode,

88
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:34,417
and the avalanche continues
towards the anode.

89
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:38,104
All the subsequent ions arrive
back at the cathode.

90
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:41,281
All the ions are neutralized there

91
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:44,598
but some of them, when they strike
the cathode, can cause

92
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:46,722
secondary electron emission,

93
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:51,864
for example, by the Auger effect,
and these secondary electrons

94
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:53,964
can create further avalanches.

95
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:57,622
The secondary emission
events are quite rare.

96
00:06:58,257 --> 00:07:01,838
So now we want to consider
what the current is

97
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,305
in the presence of secondary emission.

98
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:08,711
Between the electrodes, the current
can increase even more strongly

99
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:11,343
due to the secondary emission effect.

100
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:16,678
The number of electrons emitted
per incident ion is small,

101
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:22,658
of the order of 10⁻²
and the probability, 10⁻²,

102
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,258
this probability depends on
the type of gas --

103
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:29,535
that is the type of ion arriving
on the cathode -- and the type of material

104
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,387
that the cathode is made of.

105
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:37,105
So the question is, what is the current
when secondary emission is included?

106
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:42,978
The initial photoemission current
from the cathode undergoes avalanche

107
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:45,394
as it arrives at the anode.

108
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:51,643
All the ions created during the avalanche
drift back to the cathode

109
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:57,840
and a fraction <i>γ</i> of these ions
creates secondary electrons,

110
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,819
which themselves avalanche towards
the anode giving you

111
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,033
this number of electrons
arriving at the anode,

112
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:10,392
giving rise also to this number of ions,
arriving back at the cathode,

113
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,554
whose fraction <i>γ</i> gives another
secondary emission source,

114
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:22,564
which travels with avalanche
to the anode, etcetera.

115
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:26,449
So we can see that we have here
a geometric series

116
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,314
with a constant value of <i>i₀eᵃᵈ</i>

117
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:34,580
multiplied by a factor <i>γ(eᵃᵈ - 1)</i>.

118
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,946
This is the ratio between
successive avalanches.

119
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:45,854
The sum of a geometric series
is the constant divided by one

120
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:50,924
minus the ratio and therefore
when secondary emission is included,

121
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:55,241
we find that the sum of
the infinite series of all the avalanches

122
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:57,824
gives this current at the anode.

123
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,127
So now we see the Townsend
discharge current

124
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:07,003
due to the first Townsend coefficient
and the second Townsend coefficient

125
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:09,619
increases the current even more strongly.

126
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:14,562
This current still depends on
the external source <i>i₀</i>.

127
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:19,173
But note that the Townsend current
will become theoretically infinite

128
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:21,492
as the denominator here

129
00:09:22,024 --> 00:09:23,561
tends to zero.

130
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:29,024
This, then, is the Townsend criterion
for breakdown in gases

131
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:35,428
between parallel electrodes -- that is
that one minus the ratio equals zero.

132
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:41,529
In this case, the gas breaks down
and becomes a self-sustaining discharge.

133
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:47,193
That is, that the discharge is independent
of the external source

134
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:53,758
for this condition <i>γeᵃᵈ = γ +1</i>,
which is approximately equal to one.

135
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:59,425
Physically, this simply means that
the number of secondary electrons

136
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:03,062
created per primary electron
is at least equal to one.

137
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:08,264
That is, every electron from the cathode
creates another to replace it.

138
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:13,665
And now we have our full
current voltage diagram,

139
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:17,623
where the saturation current
undergoes avalanche

140
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:23,073
and secondary emission to become
a self-sustaining plasma

141
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:25,786
instead of a non self-sustaining
discharge.

142
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:32,785
When breakdown occurs between
parallel conducting electrodes,

143
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:37,187
this can cause an arc whose current is
limited only by the impedance

144
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:39,012
of the external circuit,

145
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:42,794
as we can see in these photographs here,
where the current limit

146
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:47,628
in the external circuit was increased
between each different experiment.

147
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,310
So as the current limit becomes
very high, we can get catastrophic melting

148
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:59,291
of components and complete destruction
of the electrodes.

149
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:04,305
So if the supply is maintained,
for example, by a solar panel,

150
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:08,834
then catastrophic arcing could destroy
a slip-ring in a satellite.

151
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:14,493
This is not good, especially in orbit
where the possibility of repair

152
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:15,970
is very small.

00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:19,975
So to summarize this module,
we've considered

154
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:22,009
the background ionization current.

155
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,818
We've seen how ionization leads
to an avalanche,

156
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,589
which increases the current.

157
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:33,022
We've seen that secondary emission
increases the current still further

158
00:11:33,822 --> 00:11:36,908
and then we arrive at a point
where we have breakdown;

159
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:42,920
and the breakdown criterion
is given by <i>γeᵃᵈ = γ + 1</i>
