00:00:05,316 --> 00:00:08,585
Welcome to the course on plasma physics 
and applications.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,382
In the second module on electrical 
breakdown in low pressure gases,

3
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:17,418
we will complete the theory and compare it
with experimental measurements

4
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,385
made in the laboratory.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,200
We will quickly revise 
Townsend's criterion

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,419
and Townsend's first coefficient.

7
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:28,567
We will use these to derive Paschen's law.

8
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,063
We will then consider breakdown 
measurements

9
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:39,530
and to compare measurements
with theory we will need vacuum breakdown

10
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:45,369
and finally, a numerical model 
to compare experiments and theory

11
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,165
in the real world.

12
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,279
For revision, we saw that 
the Townsend's criterion

13
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:57,030
for breakdown is <i>yeᵃᵈ = y + 1</i>
where the non self-sustaining discharge

14
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:01,395
eventually leads to a plasma
at the breakdown voltage.

15
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:06,573
Let's reconsider Townsend's first 
ionization coefficient.

16
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,899
Where α is the number of 
ionizing collisions per electron

17
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:14,564
per unit length along electric field <i>E</i>.

18
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:18,900
In this phenomenological expression 
for alpha,

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,870
which is found from experiment.

20
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,938
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are constants which 
depends on the gas type.

21
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,092
<i>p</i> is the pressure of the gas

22
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,439
and <i>E</i> is the electric field.

23
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:36,414
Now let's see if we can get a physical 
understanding for this alpha.

24
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,669
I repeat, the number of 
ionization collisions

25
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:44,067
per electron in distance <i>dx</i> is <i>α dx</i>.

26
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:48,455
By definition of mean free path <i>λ</i>.

27
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:52,825
The number of collisions 
in distance <i>dx</i> is <i>dx / λ</i>

28
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:59,179
The probability that each of 
these collisions causes ionization

29
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:04,164
is a type of Boltzmann factor
where <i>ϵi</i> is the ionization energy

30
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:10,648
of that atom and <i>eEλ</i> is the energy 
gained by an electron

31
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:12,452
in crossing a mean free path.

32
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:17,080
So this is a probability that 
each collision causes ionization.

33
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:21,295
Therefore, the number of ionizations 
in a distance <i>dx</i>

34
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:26,846
is given by number of collisions times 
the probability of ionization.

35
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,672
Now we simply equate this expression

36
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:34,424
with the definition of alpha and we find

37
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:40,535
this expression and since pressure 
is simply related to the inverse

38
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,127
of the mean free path, 
the we rederive this

39
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:46,860
phenomenological expression for alpha.

40
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:51,578
Since this whole discussion has 
been limited to parallel plates,

41
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:55,916
the electric field is simply the voltage 
over distance between the plates

42
00:02:56,529 --> 00:03:00,482
and therefore we substitute for <i>E</i>
to find this expression

43
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:03,436
for first Townsend's coefficient.

44
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,124
Now let's reconsider 
our breakdown criterion.

45
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,982
<i>γeᵃᵈ = γ + 1</i>

46
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:16,412
We rearrange and substitute our expression
for the first Townsend coefficient.

47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,939
Now if this is the breakdown criterion, 
then this voltage is the breakdown voltage

48
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:25,828
substituting <i>VB</i> for the breakdown voltage.

49
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:30,684
We can solve this equation and find 
the breakdown voltage,

50
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:36,114
gives this expression where <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>
are the constants which depend on the gas.

51
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:40,677
Gamma is Townsend's second coefficient

52
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:45,489
and it's dependence on pressure 
and distance is the product of

53
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,739
pressure and distance 
everywhere in this equation.

54
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:51,312
This is Paschen's Law.

55
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:54,586
It means that the breakdown voltage 
between parallel plates

56
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:58,409
depends only on the produce
<i>pd</i> for a given gas.

57
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:04,335
This can be rearranged as 
the breakdown voltage is <i>B</i> times <i>pd</i>

58
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:08,052
over the natural log of <i>Cpd</i>,

59
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:13,520
where <i>C</i> is simply another constant 
given in terms of <i>A</i> and <i>γ</i>.

60
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:19,312
So let's reconsider our Paschen's Law, 
expressed in this form.

61
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:22,488
It gives this red curve here in air,

62
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:25,806
where the axes are the 
pressure times the distance

63
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:29,268
and the horizontal axis in units of 
Torr centimeter here

64
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:32,673
and the breakdown voltage on the Y axis.

65
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:39,655
In air, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> have these values 
for iron electrodes <i>γ</i> is 0.01

66
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,034
for an air plasma.

67
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,464
Now we can see immediately, two strong

68
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,132
results from this Paschen curve.

69
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:55,234
The first one, is that as <i>C</i>
times <i>pd</i> goes to one.

70
00:04:55,682 --> 00:04:59,738
That is as the log goes to zero, 
then the breakdown voltage

71
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:02,013
becomes infinite.

72
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:07,060
Therefore, a result of Paschen's curve 
is that no breakdown is possible.

73
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:10,143
That is there's an infinite 
breakdown voltage

74
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:15,130
for all pressure times distance 
below a critical value given by

75
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,797
this expression here.

76
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:23,457
That means at very low pressure 
times distance, at very low values

77
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,102
breakdown should not occur.

78
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,935
We also see that there's the minimum 
in the Paschen's curve,

79
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,504
which occurs for log <i>Cpd = 1</i>.

80
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:39,999
This means there is a minimum 
breakdown voltage given by this expression

81
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:44,145
<i>B</i> times <i>pd</i> the minimum breakdown voltage

82
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:48,709
where <i>pd</i> at the minimum 
breakdown voltage is the natural base

83
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:51,883
of natural logs, <i>pd</i> infinite.

84
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,541
This graph gives an example of 
Paschen's curve for different gases.

85
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:02,520
We know that the form of the curve 
depends on alpha,

86
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,249
which is the Townsend's coefficient, 
depends on the gas type,

87
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,395
and it also depends on gamma, 
which depends on the gas type

88
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:11,127
and the type of material.

89
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:16,662
Now we could ask ourselves 
why is the breakdown voltage

90
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:19,592
the same for constant pressure 
times distance?

91
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:24,087
Well we can look at this in 
a phenomenological way

92
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:28,260
by noticing that the number of collisions 
for an electron,

93
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,953
crossing the electrodes is the electrode
gap divided by the mean free path,

94
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:35,878
which is proportional to pressure 
times distance.

95
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:43,294
We also note that the collision energy 
for each electron is the force

96
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:47,184
times the distance for every 
mean free path travelled

97
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:53,836
and therefore this collision energy 
is a function also only of

98
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:55,642
pressure times distance.

99
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:59,850
And therefore a reason as 
to why pressure times distance

100
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:05,121
is a constant in Paschen's Law is that 
we have identical ionization physics

101
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,168
for a given gas when pressure 
times distance is a constant.

102
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:16,569
Let's consider a physical reason why 
there's a minimum in the Paschen's curve.

103
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:21,636
It's because at low pressures 
there are very few collisions

104
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:25,715
and therefore there has to be 
a high probability of ionization,

105
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:28,417
which means you have to have 
a high electric field.

106
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:32,992
That means high voltages are necessary 
to breakdown at low pressures.

107
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:38,479
Whereas at high pressure, there's only 
a short mean free path

108
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,240
and therefore electrons have 
to gain all their energy

109
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,101
in crossing a very short distance.

110
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,447
Therefore, again, you need 
a high electric field

111
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:48,075
and therefore high voltages.

112
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:51,161
This is why there is a minimum 
in the Paschen's curve.

113
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:56,077
Now let's consider some breakdown 
measurements made in the lab

114
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:59,031
for real applications 
on a slip ring assembly.

115
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:02,505
When we look at the experimental 
measurements,

116
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:04,015
we find that the Paschen's curve

117
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:10,246
is more or less reproduced except that 
we notice we have some breakdown in

118
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:13,685
the so-called vacuum region 
where Paschen's Law

119
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:15,545
would say there is no breakdown.

120
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:20,495
So the low pressure breakdown in 
fact is not an infinite voltage.

121
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:27,024
This is because in vacuum the electron 
material itself can breakdown

122
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:31,073
and plasma can occur in the vapor 
of the metal electrodes.

123
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:34,986
Now this is an experimental proof of that.

124
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:40,700
Where along this axis we have 
the pressure between the electrodes

125
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:45,847
and here we have the optical spectrum 
measured of the plasma

126
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:48,095
created for every discharge.

127
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,781
We see that in the gas breakdown region, 
which is from moderate values of pressure

128
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:58,695
all these light emitted from the plasma 
is the light emitted

129
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:01,424
from the Argon gas in the plasma.

130
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,207
Whereas in the vacuum breakdown region, 
which is below the

131
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:11,085
theoretical Paschen minimum,
the lines correspond

132
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,756
to vapor from metal elements.

133
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,544
Therefore, this is experimental proof 
by spectroscopy

134
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:22,563
that the vacuum breakdown 
and gas breakdown are separate phenomena.

135
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:26,195
In fact, vacuum breakdown depends on 
something called

136
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:31,265
Thermionic field emission, which we will 
not consider further in this module.

137
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:36,026
Having explained the 
vacuum discharge region,

138
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:39,723
we can now reconsider the gas breakdown

139
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:45,568
where this looks like the Paschen's curve 
but it's rather too wide and flat

140
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:48,972
compared to a typical Paschen's curve.

141
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:54,499
Remember that the Paschen's curve 
was derived only for the case

142
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:56,389
of parallel electrodes

143
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,866
but in the real world, 
such as a slip ring,

144
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:03,009
we'll have to calculate the breakdown 
in arbitrary geometry.

145
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:07,375
Here is a simple two-fluid 
numerical model to do that.

146
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:11,754
We start with a continuity equation 
for electrons and ions.

147
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:17,250
The flux term here is the sum of 
the diffusive term, which is Fick's law

148
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,679
and the convective flux, which is density 
times the drift velocity.

149
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:26,657
If we know the mobility of each species, 
electrons and ions,

150
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:28,269
we can calculate the drift velocity.

151
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:32,595
The electric field we can calculate 
from the vacuum electric field,

152
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:37,871
Laplace's equation, because we know 
that the charge density is negligible,

153
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:42,235
for which case the Poisson's equation
becomes the Laplace equation.

154
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,458
So once we know the electric field,

155
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:50,532
we can calculate 
Townsend's first coefficient

156
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:57,088
and then we have a total ionization rate
per unit volume due to electron collisions.

157
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:02,418
This is a simple closed set of equations 
for a practical application.

158
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:07,717
Of course we have to consider 
boundary conditions

159
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:09,227
for our numerical model.

160
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:15,144
For the ions, this is simply that the 
flux of ions leaving the anode is zero.

161
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:21,924
The flux of electrons leaving the cathode 
is Townsend's second coefficient

162
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,141
times the flux of ions 
arriving at the cathode.

163
00:11:25,512 --> 00:11:28,155
That is for all the ions 
arriving at the cathode,

164
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:32,297
there are gamma times that number of electrons 
leaving the cathode.

165
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:36,900
We assume convective flow 
to all of the surfaces

166
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:40,620
and we apply voltage <i>V</i>
across the electrodes.

167
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:45,442
Here are some results from 
a numerical simulation.

168
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:51,707
If we consider a single gap of 
parallel electrodes one millimeter apart,

169
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:57,200
then we find the Paschen's curve which 
is this blue line here as expected.

170
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:03,075
If we consider a single gap 
between parallel electrodes

171
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:07,891
a hundred millimeters apart, then we find 
also Paschen's curve

172
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:12,716
but which is displaced to lower pressures 
because on this graph

173
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:16,047
the axis is pressure, not pressure 
times distance

174
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:20,128
and therefore these two curves 
will superimpose on

175
00:12:20,128 --> 00:12:22,514
a Paschen plot of pressure times distance.

176
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:29,615
Now let's consider a special case 
of electrodes where we have a large gap

177
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,573
and simultaneously a small gap.

178
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,257
So we have electrodes assembly 
with two gaps present

179
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:42,785
and now the numerical simulation 
gives the physically reasonable answer,

180
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:47,249
the breakdown at high pressure 
occurs in the small gap

181
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:51,917
but as we get to lower pressures, 
the breakdown switches

182
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:57,346
to breakdown in the large gap 
and therefore we get the black curve

183
00:12:57,346 --> 00:13:00,776
for numerical simulation, 
which is the breakdown

184
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:03,611
in this double gap electrode geometry.

185
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:10,460
Now if we consider electrodes which 
are conducting on every surface here,

186
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13,921
we find that the electric field

187
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:19,938
is curved and gives a possibility of 
breakdown in a range of gaps,

188
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,565
not only breakdown in the small gap 
but also breakdown in the large gap.

189
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:29,415
And now the numerical simulation 
shows that the breakdown occurs

190
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:33,105
in the small gap only at high pressure

191
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:37,534
but then in intermediate pressures, 
the breakdown now

192
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:41,320
will occur in the gap length,
which gives the optimum

193
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,779
lowest breakdown voltage instead of 
the double gap curve, which is black.

194
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:52,764
Therefore, now the numerical simulation 
result goes from high pressure,

195
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:58,101
remains at low values all the way down 
to the lowest pressure

196
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:00,216
for Paschen breakdown.

197
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:06,029
The resultant curve for multiple gaps 
shows that we have therefore

198
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:11,171
breakdown at minimum breakdown voltage 
over a whole range of pressures.

199
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,776
This gives a very wide and flat curve 
as we observe experimentally.

200
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:19,849
To summarize this module, 
we've derived an expression

201
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:22,284
for Townsend's first coefficient.

202
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:26,273
After this we find Paschen's Law 
for parallel plates

203
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:30,091
where the breakdown is a function only 
of pressure times distance.

204
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:35,457
By comparison with breakdown measurements 
we see that we also need

205
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:39,156
to compare vacuum and breakdown 
in multiple gaps.

206
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:45,423
We did this using a numerical model 
for the applications of a slip ring.
