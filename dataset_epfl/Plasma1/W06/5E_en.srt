1
00:00:05,602 --> 00:00:08,880
Welcome to the course on plasma physics 
and applications.

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,859
This is the fifth and last module 
on basic industrial plasmas.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,218
In the previous module we made 
a qualitative description of plasmas

4
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:24,485
in contact with a wall and now we will 
introduce a mathematical description

5
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:26,346
of sheath physics.

6
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:32,090
We will show how to calculate the profiles
of potential and density across a sheath.

7
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:36,870
We will find the ion flux across 
a collisionless sheath.

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,949
We will calculate the Bohm criterion.

9
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:46,724
And also the ion energy across 
a sheath to a floating wall.

10
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:50,743
This is a revision of the sheath 
from the previous module.

11
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:55,915
We saw that the plasma potential rises 
until the fluxes become equal.

12
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,824
So we have equal ion 
and electron flux to the wall.

13
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,865
The positive ions are accelerated 
in the drop of sheath potential

14
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,306
from the plasma potential down 
to the wall potential.

15
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:14,449
This same sheath potential drop 
has the effect of braking electrons

16
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:18,522
to equalize the charge particle fluxes.

17
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:23,824
Now let's introduce some parameters 
onto our qualitative profile

18
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:25,751
for plasma potential.

19
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:30,350
We say that the potential 
on the wall is <i>V wall</i>,

20
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:36,416
the potential profile is <i>V(x)</i>, 
where x is the distance from the wall

21
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:40,307
and <i>V plasma</i> is the 
potential of the plasma,

22
00:01:40,307 --> 00:01:44,515
which is equipotential at a large distance
from the wall.

23
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:50,680
We will introduce an <i>arbitrary 0</i>
of potential at the edge of the sheath,

24
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:52,933
which will be defined later on

25
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,146
and there is a drop from 
the plasma potential

26
00:01:56,146 --> 00:02:01,384
down to the sheath edge,
which we will call <i>ΔV presheath</i>.

27
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:07,688
Let's consider the ion velocity 
in this plasma potential profile.

28
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:14,940
At a far distance from the wall, 
these cold ions have zero drift velocity

29
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,448
in the equipotential profile.

30
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:23,388
As ions approach the sheath edge, 
they are accelerated across the presheath

31
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:26,577
potential drop <i>ΔV presheath</i>

32
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:31,169
and they reach a velocity <i>Us</i>
at the sheath edge.

33
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:34,355
They are further accelerated,

34
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:39,470
their ion speed increases 
with a value <i>u(x)</i>

35
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,157
between the sheath and the wall.

36
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:48,005
Let's consider the conservation 
of ion energy as they cross the sheath.

37
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:54,422
The energy of the ions as they approach 
the sheath is a <i>½ Mus²</i>

38
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,912
and as they cross the sheath 
their energy is <i>½ Mu ² + eV</i>

39
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:03,996
as they cross the sheath.

40
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:06,761
This voltage here is in fact negative.

41
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:12,339
If we consider that the sheath 
is collisionless

42
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:15,946
and therefore there are no collisions, 
no ionizations in the sheath,

43
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:21,634
then conservation of ion flux simply 
gives the ion density times

44
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:27,093
the velocity in the sheath is equal 
to the ion density at the sheath edge

45
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:30,886
times the ion velocity at the sheath edge.

46
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:36,617
Now let's simply eliminate the unknown 
ion speed in the sheath, <i>u</i>

47
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:40,808
and we find an expression for 
the ion density in the sheath.

48
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:45,055
Ion density in the sheath equals 
the ion density at the sheath edge

49
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:46,498
times this expression.

50
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:53,069
Let's also introduce a profile for 
the charge particle densities

51
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:55,798
in this situation.

52
00:03:57,207 --> 00:04:00,929
In the equipotential plasma, 
that is in the bulk plasma

53
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,977
the densities of the electrons equal 
to the density of ions

54
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:09,028
for a quasi-neutral plasma.

55
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:14,415
<i>n₀ = nₑ= nᵢ</i> is the density in the plasma.

56
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:20,189
In the presheath we consider 
that the plasma is still relatively

57
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:25,070
equipotential and therefore we have 
electron density still equal,

58
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,639
closely, to the ion density.

59
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,911
At the sheath edge, therefore, 
the density of electrons and ions

60
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:34,969
are both equal to <i>ns</i>.

61
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,754
This is the quasi-neutral plasma.

62
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:43,833
However, in the sheath 
the electron density

63
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:48,042
is strongly reduced as we saw 
due to the sheath potential drop.

64
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:52,579
Therefore, we have the <i>nₑ(x)</i>
electron density profile

65
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:57,840
is lower then the <i>nᵢ (x)</i> the ion density 
profile in the sheath,

66
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:00,478
whose width is <i>s</i>.

67
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:07,479
To summarize, we have the ion density 
in the sheath from our previous slides

68
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:12,133
and using the Boltzmann relation, 
the electron density in the sheath

69
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,684
is the electron density at the sheath edge

70
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:21,382
<i>ns</i> times the Boltzmann factor <i>exp(V/Tₑ)</i>,
V over electron temperature, in the sheath.

71
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:27,068
Now these two expressions are different 
because the ion flux is determined

72
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:29,610
by the drift speed of the ions

73
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,814
whereas the electron thermal velocity 
is much greater than the drift speed

74
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:38,192
and therefore still determined 
by the Boltzmann relation.

75
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:42,624
Now we introduce Poisson's equation 
in the sheath.

76
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:47,695
That is the second differential of voltage
with respect to the distance

77
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:53,035
is minus the charge density 
divided by the vacuum [permitivity].

78
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:58,273
The charge density is the ion density 
minus the electron density,

79
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:01,933
multiplied by the magnitude 
of the electronic charge.

80
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:07,235
We substitute for the charge densities 
from the previous slide.

81
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:09,160
This is the electron contribution.

82
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:11,633
This is the ion contribution.

83
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,711
At the plasma-sheath interface, 
where x is small,

84
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:20,739
we will do a Taylor expansion of
these expressions.

85
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:26,191
The exponential appears as <i>1+ V/Tₑ</i>
and the binomial expansion

86
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:32,072
introduces this expression here
and we find finally this expression

87
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:34,348
for Poisson's equation.

88
00:06:35,058 --> 00:06:39,945
Now for a physical solution 
because we expect the voltage profile

89
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:45,311
to be non-oscillatory with distance,
we require the expression in the brackets

90
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,553
must be greater than zero.

91
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:53,656
From this inequality, 
we find an important conclusion

92
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:58,416
that is that the ion speed 
entering the sheath, <i>Us</i>

93
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:03,620
has to be bigger than 
the square root of <i>eTₑ/M</i>

94
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:08,150
where <i>Tₑ</i> is the electron temperature 
in electron volts,

95
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:14,179
therefore, <i>eTₑ</i> is the 
electron thermal energy in Joules

96
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:17,974
and <i>M</i> is the mass of the ions.

97
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:21,835
Therefore, we see the ion speed 
entering the sheath

98
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,360
is determined by the ion mass 
and the electron temperature,

99
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,125
not the ion temperature.

100
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:35,322
This inequality, the lower limit is called
the "Bohm velocity" for ions.

101
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:40,601
This is the Bohm criterion 
for the ion velocity leaving the plasma

102
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:42,134
and entering the sheath.

103
00:07:44,455 --> 00:07:47,979
The Bohm criterion is an important factor 
in sheath physics.

104
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:52,162
Therefore, we will repeat it here 
and discuss the conclusions.

105
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:57,105
That is that the ion velocity depends 
on the electron temperature.

106
00:07:57,105 --> 00:08:03,695
The ions are accelerated to an energy of 
<i>½Muᴮ²</i> as they enter the sheath.

107
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:09,613
If you work it out, this corresponds 
to an energy <i>eTₑ/2</i>

108
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:12,833
which the ions gain in 
crossing the presheath.

109
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:20,463
Now this corresponds to a presheath 
potential drop, <i>Δpresheath = Tₑ/2</i>.

110
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,457
Now this is consistent 
with Debye screening,

111
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:30,915
which allows potentials of up to <i>Tₑ/2</i>
to penetrate an quasi-neutral plasma.

112
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,795
Now the plasma density at the sheath edge,

113
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:42,354
is <i>ns</i> times the electron density 
in the equipotential plasma bulk

114
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:45,982
times the Boltzmann factor 
crossing the presheath,

115
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:50,729
electrons are negative, 
the presheath value is <i>Tₑ/2</i>

116
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:53,684
divided by the electron temperature.

117
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,796
This gives <i>n₀</i> the base of natural logarithms, 
one over the square root

118
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:03,674
and this works out to be 0.61n₀

119
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:09,424
that is the plasma density 
at the sheath edge is 61 percent

120
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,599
of the plasma density and the plasma bulk 
far from the wall.

121
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:19,951
Using this knowledge, we can now go 
back to our plasma profile

122
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:24,092
and our density profile and start to put 
some expressions in

123
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:25,731
for the unknown values.

124
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:32,837
The presheath potential drop we found is 
<i>Tₑ/2</i> from the plasma to the sheath edge.

125
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:36,175
The ion velocity approaching 
the sheath edge

126
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,262
is the Bohm criterion velocity.

127
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:46,560
The electron ion and plasma density 
approaching the sheath edge is 61 percent

128
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:50,405
of the charge particle density 
in the bulk plasma.

129
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:56,028
Now Debye screening means that 
the sheath width can only be

130
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,112
a few Debye lengths long.

131
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:05,059
Now that we have derived Bohm's criterion,
we can use it as a tool to calculate

132
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:07,079
other effects in the plasma.

133
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:11,032
For our first example, we will use it 
to calculate the ion flux,

134
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:14,570
which influences the etch rate 
in plasma etching.

135
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:18,468
Now first we need to know that 
Bohm's criterion has some

136
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:21,251
rather general applicability.

137
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,978
It seems to apply in many cases, 
for example, radio frequency plasmas,

138
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:30,217
probably because the maximum 
potential drop which can penetrate

139
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:35,552
a presheath is generally <i>Tₑ/2</i>
and therefore Bohm's criterion

140
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,116
tends to have some general validity 
in many cases.

141
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:43,568
This is part of the great interest 
in Bohm's criterion.

142
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:49,137
Now the ion flux into a sheath equals 
the ion flux through the sheath

143
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:54,109
equals the ion flux to the wall 
because of conservation of ion flux

144
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:55,522
crossing the sheath.

145
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:58,316
That is, no ionization in the sheath.

146
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:04,906
Therefore, the ion flux to the wall is 
the same as the ion flux into the sheath,

147
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:08,190
which is <i>ns</i> times the Bohm velocity,

148
00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:11,550
<i>ns</i> times the Bohm velocity again

149
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:18,620
<i>ns</i> is the plasma density in the bulk 
divided by the square root

150
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:24,655
of natural logs, which is 61 percent 
of the plasma density in the plasma.

151
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:31,570
Now we know that the ion flux to the wall 
is equal to the electron flux to the wall

152
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,353
because the sheath potential appeared 
in order to guarantee equality of flux.

153
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:43,010
And therefore, the electrons and ions, 
that is the plasma particle loss flux,

154
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,274
is given by this expression.

155
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,289
In making the statement 
that the electron flux and ion flux

156
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:54,275
to the wall are both the same,
this is the same as stating that

157
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:58,928
there is no current to the wall,
we have assumed no current to the wall.

158
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:03,591
That is we have assumed the wall 
is electrically floating in this example.

159
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:09,695
Now the ion flux controls the etch rate 
as we said at the beginning

160
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:14,728
and we are now able to calculate also 
the ion current to a probe.

161
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:20,777
A <i>probe of area A</i> will find a current <i>e</i>

162
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:25,169
<i>nsu ᴮ</i> times the probe area 
times this expression.

163
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,987
This is a factor very often seen in 
plasma physics is called

164
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:34,038
the ion saturation current 
to a wall or probe.

165
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:39,065
If the wall is negatively biased, 
then the Bohm velocity still

166
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:44,533
determines the ion flux into the wall
because the ions cannot arrive any faster.

167
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:47,577
In this case, electron flux is zero.

168
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,609
A second consequence of Bohm's criterion 
is that we can calculate

169
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:55,722
the ion bombardment energy.

170
00:12:55,722 --> 00:12:57,325
For equal fluxes to the wall,

171
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:02,215
the ion flux can be equated 
to the electron flux

172
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:07,640
and the electron flux is given 
by the kinetic expression,

173
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,103
which is <i>¼</i> times the electron density 
times the electron thermal speed.

174
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:18,453
The electron density is given by <i>ns</i>
times the Boltzmann factor

175
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:22,497
in crossing the sheath 
and the electron thermal velocity

176
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:28,219
is <i>8eTₑ/π mₑ</i> where <i>Tₑ</i>
is the electron volts.

177
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:33,819
We use the kinetic expression 
for electrons and not for ions

178
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:37,713
because the thermal velocity of electrons 
is much much greater than

179
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:40,406
the drift velocity in these cases.

180
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,749
We can now solve this equation
for the sheath voltage drop.

181
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:52,689
We find the sheath voltage drop 
depends on the electron temperature

182
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:58,351
and the natural logarithm of the ratio 
of ion mass to electron mass,

183
00:13:58,351 --> 00:13:59,893
with a factor <i>2 π</i>,

184
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,615
substituting the values 
for an argon plasma

185
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,262
we find that this is about 4.7 times 
the electron temperature.

186
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:13,243
Therefore, the sheath 
voltage drop is 4.7 Tₑ

187
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:18,063
and this is equal to the ion energy drop 
across the sheath.

188
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:24,320
To get the total ion energy, 
we add the presheath voltage drop

189
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,722
to the sheath voltage drop 
because the ions are accelerated

190
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:34,248
across the presheath plus acceleration 
across the sheath voltage <i>Vs</i>.

191
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:38,576
Therefore, the total ion energy 
approaching the wall

192
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:41,732
is equal to the energy they gained 
in the presheath

193
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:45,068
plus the energy they gained 
crossing the sheath,

194
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:49,405
which is <i>eTₑ/2</i> times one 
plus this expression here.

195
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:54,452
We can put the one inside the natural log

196
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:55,897
and combine it this way

197
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,946
and we find an expression 
which is often given in the books

198
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:03,742
<i>Tₑ/2</i> log mass over 2.3 electron mass.

199
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:08,969
If you put the numbers in, this is 5.2Tₑ

200
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:13,306
which of course is 0.5 plus 4.7.

201
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:18,961
Tₑ/2 plus 4.7 Tₑ is 5.2 Tₑ.

202
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:25,467
In books and papers, if you see 
this expression of the ion energy

203
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,773
then that's because we're talking 
about the ion energy

204
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:30,855
crossing the sheath.

205
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:33,739
If you see this expression 
for the ion energy,

206
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:37,501
it's because we're talking about 
the ions from the plasma

207
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:40,807
through the presheath, 
crossing the sheath, to the wall.

208
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,738
That is the total ion energy.

209
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:46,501
To summarize this module,

210
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:50,006
we have calculated the Bohm velocity 
for ions into a sheath.

211
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:57,427
We've seen that the ion flux to a wall 
is 61 percent of the ion density

212
00:15:57,427 --> 00:15:59,996
in the plasma times the Bohm velocity.

213
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:06,479
And we have calculated the ion energy 
of an ion from the plasma to the wall,

214
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:10,697
which is about 5.2 times 
the electron temperature in volts.
