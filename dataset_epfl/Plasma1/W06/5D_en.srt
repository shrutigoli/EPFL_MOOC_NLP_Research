1
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:08,830
Welcome to the course on plasma physics
and applications.

2
00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:13,357
In these next two modules, 
we will consider sheath physics

3
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:14,864
and plasma etching.

4
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:18,172
We will show the plasma etching 
is the only way to make

5
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:21,986
the complicated structures
that you find in integrated circuits.

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,557
In this module we will see 
how a plasma forms.

7
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:31,976
We will see how a sheath forms 
when a plasma is in contact with a wall.

8
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:38,023
We will see some properties of the sheath 
and how we can apply these

9
00:00:38,023 --> 00:00:40,400
for plasma etching applications.

10
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:45,991
In modules 5.2 and 5.3, we saw how 
breakdown could lead

11
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:51,287
to very high densities in the plasma
and as the density increases

12
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:56,421
the voltage drops down to a glow discharge
and can eventually form an arc.

13
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:59,564
This is the development from 
a Townsend discharge

14
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:01,683
to a plasma glow and arc.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,567
In the Townsend region, this is a 
non self-sustaining discharge

16
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,427
where only an external source 
can maintain the plasma.

17
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:11,864
The plasma density is weak.

18
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:15,550
The space charge therefore is weak 
and we can use the Laplace equation

19
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,607
to calculate the electric field.

20
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:23,001
But after breakdown the density increases 
by a factor of 10 to the 12 or more

21
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,700
and then we arrive at 
self-sustaining plasmas.

22
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:30,707
Where we have strong space charge 
and we have to include Poisson's equation

23
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:33,375
for calculations of electric fields.

24
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:38,995
This is the same voltage current graph 
presented in a different orientation.

25
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:41,767
This time with current along the X axis,

26
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,720
the voltage on the vertical axis.

27
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:46,933
This again, is the Townsend region.

28
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,824
This is the glow discharge and arc region.

29
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:55,768
Again, the vacuum field applies here 
and Poisson's equation applies here.

30
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,487
Just note that this curve applies 
to parallel plates.

31
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:04,150
It's not a universal curve because 
in other types of configuration,

32
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,221
other types of electrodes, other shapes,
other types of plasmas can form,

33
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:13,719
such as sparks, coronas, and streamers 
depending on electrode geometry.

34
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:19,363
Now let's consider in a simple way 
how a sheath can form in a plasma.

35
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:24,833
First, let's consider a virtual 
or an imaginary surface in the plasma.

36
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:28,286
There is an ion flux 
crossing this surface,

37
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:31,373
whose value is given by 
the ion thermal flux

38
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:33,645
given by the kinetic theory.

39
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:39,565
This is simply the ion density times 
the ion thermal speed divided by four.

40
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:45,275
The ion thermal speed is given by 
the root of eight, <i>eTi</i>.

41
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:49,001
Remember the ion temperature 
is given in electron volts

42
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,191
over Ï€ times the ion mass.

43
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:56,658
This ion flux can cross this surface 
in a uniform plasma

44
00:02:56,658 --> 00:03:00,674
because simply there's the same ion flux
coming back the other way.

45
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,246
There is also an electron flux crossing 
this virtual surface.

46
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:08,644
The electron thermal flux given by 
a similar expression

47
00:03:08,644 --> 00:03:14,067
to the ion thermal flux is 
in fact much larger than the ion flux,

48
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:19,501
simply because the electron mass 
is much smaller than the ion mass.

49
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,610
We also know that the electron temperature
is generally higher

50
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,567
than the ion temperature
but the principle reason

51
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,231
for the strong electron flux is that 
it has a higher mobility

52
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:34,670
due to its low electron mass.

53
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:41,184
To resume, the electron thermal flux 
is much bigger than the ion thermal flux.

54
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:46,617
Of course, there's an equal and opposite 
electron flux crossing this same surface.

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,065
Now in all the courses up until now, 
the plasma has always been considered

56
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,534
in isolation from its environment.

57
00:03:55,056 --> 00:04:00,701
That is, the plasma has never been 
in contact with any walls or electrodes

58
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,729
in this course so far.

59
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:08,024
However, if you want to make any devices, 
that is, any plasma applications.

60
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:11,615
Then plasma wall interaction will 
of course be necessary

61
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:15,317
because it's the only way you can 
make deposition, etching,

62
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:17,301
or surface modification.

63
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:21,213
So now we have to consider what happens 
if the virtual surface

64
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:23,521
is replaced by a metal wall.

65
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,044
In a very short time the electron flux 
will flow quickly to the wall

66
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:33,319
and form a negative charge on the surface.

67
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:37,783
This will leave behind 
a layer of positive ions.

68
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,334
This is called the sheath.

69
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:44,213
The sheath forms in contact of a plasma 
with the metal wall.

70
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:49,090
Now what happens when the electrons 
rush to the wall and the ions

71
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,270
are left behind is that 
the plasma potential

72
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,870
rises until the fluxes become equal.

73
00:04:57,316 --> 00:05:00,490
Now as you can see on 
this voltage distance graph,

74
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,875
the plasma potential now rises

75
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:09,687
this potential drop across the sheath 
brakes the electrons

76
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:13,996
to reduce the electron flux 
and electric fields now

77
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:18,543
accelerate the positive ions 
across the sheath potential drop

78
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:20,667
to the voltage of the wall.

79
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,105
So to resume, the ion flux is increased 
by the voltage drop,

80
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:29,859
the electron flux is decreased 
due to the voltage drop,

81
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:32,915
and the fluxes are equalized 
in equilibrium

82
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,742
if there's no net current to the wall.

83
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:41,686
Of course, this positive space charge 
in the sheath causes electric field

84
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:48,039
towards the wall and there's a directional 
ion flux to the wall

85
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,129
due to the sheath electric field.

86
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:55,978
We can learn a bit more about the sheath 
by drawing a Gaussian surface,

87
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:57,456
which straddles the sheath.

88
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:02,305
On the righthand side, 
the electric field metals zero.

89
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:07,702
The electric field in plasmas is 
very small because it's quasi-neutral.

90
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:12,590
Therefore, we see that the total 
free charge in the sheath is zero.

91
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:17,922
That is, that the positive charge 
in the sheath layer is equal and opposite

92
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:22,294
to this surface charge of the electrons 
of the metal surface.

93
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,915
Therefore, with these very simple 
qualitative arguments

94
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:31,346
we can already make a list 
of sheath properties.

95
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:36,552
The sheath provides the transition 
between the plasma and the wall.

96
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:40,784
Positive space charge 
is equal and opposite

97
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,974
to the negative surface charge.

98
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,201
The sheath guarantees 
a dynamic equilibrium of ion

99
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,030
and electron fluxes to the wall.

100
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:59,521
Plasma potential is always positive 
with respect to the most positive surface.

101
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:07,776
The sheath layer is thin, 
it's only several Debye lengths thick

102
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:10,600
due to Debye screening of 
the sheath potential.

103
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,803
The sheath is a dark layer because 
there is a strongly reduced

104
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,731
electron density in the sheath.

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,519
Not because the electrons are colder 
but because there are very few

106
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,825
electrons in the sheath 
and as we've already seen

107
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:28,976
there is a strong electric field 
and therefore positive ion flux,

108
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:32,307
which is perpendicular and directed 
towards the wall.

109
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:38,630
Let's see how our understanding of 
the sheath properties can help

110
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,096
explain the applications of 
plasma etching.

111
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:45,275
This is a plasma etch reactor.

112
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,526
The vacuum chamber is blue.

113
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,614
There are two electrodes

114
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:55,169
and a plasma forms between the electrodes.

115
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:59,539
Therefore there's a sheath in contact 
with each electrode.

116
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:03,778
Let's look in more detail 
at the sheath region.

117
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:09,814
We zoom in on the sheath and we see 
that we have a plasma in contact

118
00:08:09,814 --> 00:08:14,351
with a Photoresist on a silicon substrate.

119
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,588
The electric field in 
the plasma accelerates ions

120
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:22,521
normally to the surface.

121
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:26,123
The ions arrive perpendicular 
and go straight through the gaps

122
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:30,037
in the Photoresist down 
to the silicon substrate.

123
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:34,650
To resume, we have a uniform 
electric field above a substrate,

124
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,821
vertical flux of ions.

125
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:41,490
The Photoresist feature here is 
at the order of fractions of a micron,

126
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,664
which is much less than a sheath width, 
therefore, the ions always

127
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:47,750
arrive perpendicularly.

128
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:52,202
If we want to make these type of 
structures using plasma etching

129
00:08:52,202 --> 00:08:56,997
with a high aspect ratio then we have 
to transfer the mask features

130
00:08:56,997 --> 00:09:01,076
in a faithful way, high fidelity 
onto the substrate.

131
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:06,952
If we use a wet process, 
like in the early days of micro circuits,

132
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:11,769
then the liquid will cause isotropic etch 
of the silicon wafer

133
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:17,125
and not give a high fidelity reproduction 
of the photolithographic mask.

134
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:24,199
And therefore these type of structures 
cannot be made using a wet process.

135
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:28,789
However, with the plasma, 
since the ions come down directly

136
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:32,166
through the Photoresist then 
we get a vertical etch.

137
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:36,474
This is called "dry process" 
or "plasma etching".

138
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:43,729
So we see that in a plasma 
the anisotropic etching is given by

139
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,198
the directionality of ions 
crossing the sheath.

140
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:51,563
A very important result is that plasma 
processing is the only

141
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:54,428
commercial technology capable 
of such control.

142
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,152
Plasma is indispensable for modern 
integrated circuit manufacturing.

143
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:04,836
On this graph we see how micro electronics
has improved during the years.

144
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:06,729
This is the date.

145
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:12,218
This is the number of transistors on 
a square millimeter of silicon.

146
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,093
This is the minimum feature size on 
the integrated circuit in nanometers.

147
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:23,234
So we see that during the years, 
the number of transistors

148
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:28,888
on a square millimeter has increased 
strongly now coming up to 10 million

149
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,588
transistors per square millimeter

150
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:37,880
and the Photoresist size has come down 
to a few tens of nanometers

151
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,940
as the control of plasma etching 
has improved.

152
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:48,414
Historically the first p-n junction 
transistor was made in the 50's.

153
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:54,288
The basis for integrated circuits 
was invented by Kilby, Noyce, and others.

154
00:10:56,357 --> 00:11:01,397
The very first integrated circuits, 
for example, in 1961 Fairchild camera.

155
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:06,445
The feature sizes were of order of 
tens of microns.

156
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:11,132
This graph shows how the number of 
transistors per circuit

157
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:15,673
has almost doubled every few years
and this is the famous Moore's law,

158
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:18,763
which he formulated back in 1965.

159
00:11:19,977 --> 00:11:25,238
To summarize this module, we have seen 
that sheath formation is due to the fact

160
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:28,743
that the electron mobility is much greater
than the ion mobility.

161
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:33,791
From this we were able to deduce 
the basic properties of a sheath.

162
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:40,531
And we've seen that the directional ions 
crossing a sheath is indispensable

163
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,718
for integrated circuit manufacturing.
