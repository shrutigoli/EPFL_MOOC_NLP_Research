00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:08,481
Welcome to the course
Plasma Physics and Applications

2
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:11,169
to Fusion Energy,
Astrophysics and Industry.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,032
My name is Duccio Testa, 
and in this lecture

4
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:18,612
we will discuss the stellarator
and other confinement concepts.

5
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:22,988
We will discuss magnetic 
plasma confinement schemes

6
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:25,423
which are alternative
to tokamak devices.

7
00:00:25,423 --> 00:00:29,684
We will start with 3D configurations:
this is the stellarator,

8
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:33,570
and then we will look at other concepts:
the reversed field pinch,

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,250
the field reversed configuration,
and the levitated dipole.

10
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:43,584
Let's look at the confinement in 2D 
and 3D magnetic toroidal configuration.

11
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:50,837
We've seen already that in the presence
of a toroidal magnetic field, Bt,

12
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:55,699
we have a ∇B drift of particles
that goes in the opposite direction

13
00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:01,043
for particles with a different charge
and this creates an electric field.

14
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:05,059
So the question is how
can charge accumulation be short-circuited

15
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,063
in a toroidal device, 
because this electric field

16
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:11,546
cross the magnetic field
produces an E×B drift

17
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:14,031
that pushes the whole plasma out.

18
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:19,936
In fact, we have two methods
to short-circuit this charge accumulation.

19
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:25,449
The first is using a toroidal current
in a 2D axisymmetric configuration.

20
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:28,058
This leads to the tokamak concept.

21
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:32,725
The second method is by breaking
the axial symmetry —

22
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:36,742
so we keep the 3D configuration
so we can short-circuit

23
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:40,717
this charge accumulation
by torsion of the magnetic axis

24
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:43,645
or by 3D modulation of the flux surfaces.

25
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:48,631
3D magnetic toroidal configuration:
we have a magnetic field

26
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:52,168
that is the superposition
of a relatively large

27
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:56,840
axisymmetric toroidal field,
a moderately sized helical field

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,289
and a small axisymmetric vertical field.

29
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:03,852
Depending on the topology
of the magnetic field

30
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:08,494
we have a wide range of configurations
and here we can see — two of them.

31
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:14,636
If you have coils that are modular coils,
then we see a configuration

32
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,425
that has this particular shape.

33
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,756
If we have coils that are called
torsatron coils,

34
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:25,527
that torsion around the plasma,
then we have a torsatron configuration.

35
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,897
In the stellatator, 
one particular example

36
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:32,398
of 3D magnetic configuration,
the field is 3D.

37
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:37,532
What we must do in the stellarator
is avoid large magnetic islands

38
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,269
and extended regions in which
the magnetic field is stochastic,

39
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:44,549
because these are regions
where the plasma confinement

40
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:46,144
is very poor.

41
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,433
We see our sketch 
of a stellarator, the toroidal angle

42
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:53,573
in the magnetic surface,
and we see that these surfaces

43
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,741
are torsioned in 3D.

44
00:02:56,283 --> 00:03:01,903
Here we have a sketch of flux surfaces
in this region of the plasma,

45
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:06,340
and we see that the flux surfaces are
closed upon this end,

46
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,841
so this is a situation
of good confinement.

47
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:13,169
In this other region of the plasma,
this is a sketch with flux surfaces,

48
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:16,109
and what we see is
that in the center we have

49
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:19,416
well-behaved flux surfaces,
but towards the edge,

50
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:24,400
here, here, and here, 
we have magnetic islands.

51
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,264
So we move from a region
of closed magnetic flux surfaces

52
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:29,557
to magnetic islands.

53
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:32,823
These are regions of poor confinement.

54
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:36,352
So the main purpose
of the stellarator configuration

55
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:42,499
is to build up coils so that we remove,
as much as possible,

56
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:47,976
regions where we have magnetic islands
or a stochastic magnetic field.

57
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:53,735
This is an example 
of 3D non-axisymmetric equilibrium

58
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,149
for a stellator.

59
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:58,937
What we plot here 
is a graph of the module

60
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:04,143
of the magnetic field in 2D,
in this case toroidal angle

61
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:09,913
and poloidal angle, and here
we see cuts of the |B| graph

62
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:14,956
at different toroidal positions —
φ = 0, π/9, π/6, π/3.

63
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:18,671
We see that the flux surfaces
are very different.

64
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:23,289
We start with a banana
that is aligned, effectively, vertically

65
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:28,151
and then by moving off a ninth of π
in the toroidal direction,

66
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:31,101
the banana shifts obliquely.

67
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:34,705
Then it becomes an ellipse,
and then it actually becomes

68
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:38,965
a very complicated shape,
a square with a triangle at the end.

69
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:44,012
So here we see how the geometry
of a stellarator is very complex.

70
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,896
The stellarator concept has pros and cons.

71
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:53,690
The first pro is that the magnetic field
is entirely driven by coils

72
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,499
that are located outside the plasma,
so there is no ohmically driven current,

73
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,008
contrary to the tokamak.

74
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:05,706
Therefore, the stellarator
is an inherently steady-state device.

75
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:10,437
Also, we have less free energy
that can be tapped into

76
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:11,817
to drive instabilities.

77
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:14,490
This is a clear advantage
with respect to tokamaks.

78
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:19,000
However, we need to design
very precisely the structure

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,264
of the magnetic field —
here we see an example

80
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:24,786
for the TJ-II stellarator
in CIEMAT in Spain,

81
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:28,378
and this is a challenging construction
and a challenging optimization.

82
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:32,430
Furthermore, the 
reactor-relevant confinement

83
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,726
of thermal and fast particles
is still to be demonstrated experimentally.

84
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:40,121
Let's look at a brief history
of stellarators.

85
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:44,144
The original idea was developed
by Lyman Spitzer in 1951.

86
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:48,448
After the Geneva conference in 1958,
stellarator programs

87
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,429
started in Germany, in the UK,
in the Soviet Union, and in Japan.

88
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,275
At the time, tokamaks showed

89
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:57,571
better performances than stellarators,
becoming mainstream.

90
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,505
The stellarator research
was not discontinued.

91
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:04,850
In fact, a number of small stellarators
exist worldwide — TJ-II in Spain,

92
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,350
HSX in Wisconsin — the United States —
and now we are moving

93
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,905
towards very large stellarators —
the LHD in Japan

94
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:16,125
and the W7-X stellarator
that will soon be operational in Germany.

95
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,767
Let's look a little bit
at the LHD stellarator.

96
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,315
LHD stands for Large Helical Device.

97
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,638
We see a few images of the LHD.

98
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:31,527
The LHD is located in Toki, Japan,
and is the largest stellarator

99
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,174
now operating in the world.

100
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:38,006
The magnetic field is produced
by two superconducting helical coils

101
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:40,145
and six vertical field coils.

102
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:44,568
It was initially optimized
for MHD eqilibrium and stability

103
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:47,949
and then improved
for single particle confinement.

104
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:52,271
LHD can reach a value 
of the plasma β that is up to 5%

105
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:57,644
and an energy confinement time τE
that is up to 0.4 seconds,

106
00:06:57,644 --> 00:07:02,641
and then leads to a triple product n τE Ti

107
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:07,790
that is of the order 
of 2.2 × 10¹⁹ [KeV / (m³ s)].

108
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:11,568
So if we compare with the value
of the triple product in JET

109
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:14,960
that is on the order of 2.6 × 10²⁰,

110
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,435
we see that there is 
still a factor ten of difference

111
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:20,269
between the stellarator
and the tokamak concept

112
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:22,196
in terms of the triple product.

113
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:26,350
The Wendelstein 7X
is a new superconducting stellarator

114
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,541
that has been built in Germany.

115
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,775
It is the largest stellarator.

116
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:36,120
The main assembly was completed in 2014,

117
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:40,281
and the first plasma
scheduled for late 2015.

118
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:44,078
It's a very big technical challenge.

119
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:49,300
In fact, the construction relies
on the optimization of a system

120
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,553
of 50 non-planar modular 
superconducting coils.

121
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:57,054
We see here a photo
of the W7-X stellarator

122
00:07:57,054 --> 00:08:00,935
under construction, we see
the wall of the stellarator

123
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:07,037
that is a very particular shape,
with a bend inside,

124
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:10,922
and the parameters 
of the 7-X stellarator are

125
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:13,702
a major radius of 5.5 m,

126
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,725
a minus radius of 1 m,
a volume of 30 m³,

127
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:20,367
and a toroidal magnetic field
that is up to 3 T.

128
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:24,222
The total plasma heating can be
up to 14 megawatts

129
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:30,080
and the expected on-axis 
density is 3 × 10²⁰ m⁻³

130
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,423
which is a similar value
to the JET tokamak,

131
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:36,822
and an on-axis electron temperature
of 15keV, that again is a similar value

132
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:38,969
to that of the JET tokamak.

133
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:44,554
The W7-X stellarator
has been built and optimized

134
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:47,791
taking into consideration 
the orbit of all particles.

135
00:08:48,338 --> 00:08:51,729
The energy and particle confinement time
are expected to be comparable

136
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:55,139
to those of a similar-sized tokamak.

137
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:59,489
The main advantage of the W7-X stellarator
is that it is a superconducting device

138
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,956
and therefore plasma discharges
can last up to 30 minutes

139
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:06,316
to demonstrate the steady-state operation
of the stellarator concept.

140
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:11,370
Let's have a brief overview
of the confinement concepts

141
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,037
that we have described so far.

142
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,163
Most current investments in fusion
are in the tokamak concept,

143
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:20,535
that is considered the most mature,
and on stellarators.

144
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,483
However, there are
many other alternative concepts

145
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:28,647
that are studied, and we will describe 
some of them qualitatively.

146
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:31,104
We will describe
the toroidal reversed field pinch,

147
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,217
the field reversed configuration,
and the levitated dipole.

148
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,233
Let's look at the <i>reversed field pinch</i>
that is commonly abbreviated as RFP.

149
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:43,805
It is an axisymmetric 
toroidal configuration.

150
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:46,320
Let's look at the principle of operation.

151
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,409
Initially, we start
with a small toroidal magnetic field.

152
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:53,362
Then we have a large toroidal current
that is ramped up,

153
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:57,706
the plasma is compressed,
and we end up in a situation

154
00:09:57,706 --> 00:10:01,214
where the toroidal and poloidal fields
have very similar amplitude.

155
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,457
As the toroidal flux
has also been compressed,

156
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:09,431
what remains is only 
a small residual toroidal field

157
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:13,334
at the edge that also reverses direction.

158
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:17,851
We can now draw the profiles
that we can have for an RFP

159
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,699
for the magnetic field
and plasma pressure.

160
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:26,084
We can look at the profiles
in terms of the minor radius coordinate r.

161
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:29,956
We can start with 
the toroidal magnetic field

162
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,415
that is large in the plasma center,
and then it crosses zero

163
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,558
towards the plasma edge.

164
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:42,007
The poloidal magnetic field
is small in the plasma center,

165
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:47,034
it increases towards the plasma edge,
and then drops down a little bit.

166
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:51,505
We can now draw the safety
factor in an RFP, the q [profile]

167
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:54,556
which is basically the ratio
of the toroidal field

168
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:55,676
to the poloidal field.

169
00:10:55,676 --> 00:11:01,577
So the safety factor goes to zero
where the toroidal magnetic field

170
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,639
goes to zero.

171
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:07,350
For the plasma pressure we can have
a different profile, obviously.

172
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,070
Typically, the plasma pressure
peaks on the magnetic axis,

173
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,363
but we can also have a configuration
where the plasma pressure peaks

174
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:17,102
off the magnetic axis.

175
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:22,506
With respect to the tokamak,
the RFP has one main advantage —

176
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:25,607
that only a small set
of toroidal field coils is needed.

177
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:30,729
Theoretically, we achieve
higher β and efficient ohmic heating.

178
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,846
However, the losses 
due to turbulent transport

179
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:37,645
are larger than those
observed in a tokamak.

180
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:42,562
Let's now look at the
<i>field reversed configuration</i> [FRC].

181
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:46,352
We see here a schematic drawing
of this system.

182
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,048
FRC's are pulsed devices,

183
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:53,880
they have an ultra-compact
axisymmetric toroidal configuration,

184
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,464
there is no applied toroidal field,
there is no ohmic transformer.

185
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:03,365
FRC's are built by using two θ-pinches

186
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:07,854
that are created successively
with fields in opposite directions.

187
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:12,349
The magnetic field lines
first tear and then reconnect,

188
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:16,627
and the final configuration
is that of a flattened Z-pinch.

189
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:22,481
We can now look at the profiles
of the magnetic field

190
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:23,957
and the plasma pressure in an FRC.

191
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:30,127
The best way to draw them is as a 
function of the major radius coordinate R.

192
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:34,301
We can look at the plasma pressure
that is typically high

193
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,959
at the center of the device.

194
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,507
Then we can look
at the axial magnetic field, Bz,

195
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:46,329
that is negative on one side,
goes to zero in the center

196
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,248
of the device where the pressure peaks
and becomes positive

197
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:52,008
on the other side of the device.

198
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:56,311
Then we have a poloidal field,
that is typically small,

199
00:12:57,237 --> 00:13:00,310
that is relatively flat
across the radial direction.

200
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:05,396
The main advantage of the FRC 
configurations is that they are found to

201
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:09,166
be more stable than what is predicted
by MHD calculations.

202
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:15,179
In fact, some private companies
are conducting R&D studies

203
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:20,079
for a fusion reactor scheme
based on the FRC concept.

204
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,952
Let's look at the 
<i>levitated dipole</i> experiment.

205
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:27,322
We see a sketch of this experiment at MIT.

206
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:31,986
This experiment is motivated
by astrophysical observations

207
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:35,324
of stable plasma rings
in Jupiter's dipolar field

208
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:36,625
at very high β.

209
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,460
The levitated dipole experiment, LDX,
uses a dipolar field

210
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,805
to confine particles that are produced
by a levitated superconducting magnet.

211
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:53,898
The magnetic field has
an unfavorable curvature everywhere,

212
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:56,470
and that limits β in the plasma center.

213
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,656
However, the magnetic field
is that of a dipole,

214
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:06,212
so it has a 1/r³ dependence,
β, that is proportional

215
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:10,039
to the B⁻², increases rapidly

216
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,098
towards the plasma edge.

217
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:17,725
Therefore, the levitated dipole
is very stable at very high β

218
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:19,780
in the outer region of the plasma.

219
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,670
As in Jupiter — the β
in Jupiter's dipolar field

220
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,140
is of the order of 2,
which is much larger

221
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,431
than the typical β in a tokamak,
that is a fraction of 1.

222
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:33,368
The main drawback
of our levitated dipole experiment

223
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:38,567
is that D-T operation is not possible,
therefore a more challenging D-D reaction

224
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:39,579
has to be used.

225
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:43,296
We can now summarize
what we have discussed in this lecture.

226
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:44,763
We started with the stellarator.

227
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:49,507
It's a 3D toroidal equilibrium.
It's a system that allows

228
00:14:49,507 --> 00:14:52,981
inherently steady-state operation
because there is no need

229
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:55,819
for any ohmically driven
toroidal plasma current,

230
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:59,278
and the magnetic field 
is solely provided by external coils.

231
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:03,482
There are many alternative 
confinement schemes

232
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:07,066
that are studied in fusion research,
and we have seen a few of them.

233
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:09,043
We have looked 
at the reversed field pinch,

234
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:13,523
at the field reversed configuration,
and at the levitated dipole experiment.
