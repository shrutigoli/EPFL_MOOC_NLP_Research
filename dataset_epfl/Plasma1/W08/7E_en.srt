00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:08,392
Welcome to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:11,283
Today we will discuss 
transport in tokamak plasmas,

3
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:14,621
going beyond the classical paradigm
we illustrated last time.

4
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:19,406
We will dwell on the limits
of the classical model,

5
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:22,662
highlighting the presence 
of the so-called neo-classical effects

6
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:26,920
that are related to the orbits that are
complex in a tokamak environment.

7
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:32,896
We will also underline the fact that
the processes are not always diffusive

8
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:35,774
that provide transport.

9
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:40,610
But that we will focus primarily
on the so-called <i>anomalous</i> transport.

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,998
This is the transport caused by 
the presence of turbulence in a plasma.

11
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:48,760
Turbulence is developed
from the waves and instability

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,314
that are naturally occurring
in fusion plasmas.

13
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:56,120
We will highlight how to measure
turbulence in plasmas,

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,715
providing a couple of examples,

15
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,663
and the difficulties
of modeling turbulence

16
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,246
and its consequences in a plasma.

17
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:09,569
We will then focus on the empirical
approach to transport

18
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,354
and how we can make predictions
based on the present experiments

19
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:16,190
for the future devices.

20
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:20,459
I would like to start by reminding
ourselves where we concluded

21
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,029
from our analysis of classical theory.

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,365
We have used the very
simple model of <i>random walk</i>,

23
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:32,508
considering that the collisions
between charged particles

24
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:39,382
lead to jumps in their orbits
of the order of the Larmor radius

25
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:43,390
of course, across the magnetic field,

26
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,553
which leads to a diffusion equation

27
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,071
here for the density,

28
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:55,829
which has a main parameter,
the perpendicular diffusion

29
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:59,572
coefficient which can therefore
be simply estimated on the basis

30
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:03,631
of the square of the step
of this diffusive process

31
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:05,702
which is the Larmor radius

32
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:09,016
divided by the collision time

33
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:12,780
-or times the effective
collision frequency-

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,938
for the exchange 
of momentum in this case.

35
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:22,349
We can now see how this can be verified
in the practical situations

36
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,784
in the experiment.

37
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:27,122
In particular how the cross-field
diffusion coefficient can determine

38
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:31,971
a crucial parameter for fusion
that is the confinement time.

39
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,966
Let's take a very simple geometry:
a cylindrical plasma,

40
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,644
the cross-section of the cylinder
has a radius a,

41
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:41,965
the cylinder has a length L.

42
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:47,081
So we can evaluate the confinement time
for this situation in the following way:

43
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:52,163
So œÑ is my confinement time,
it is the ratio of the total number

44
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:57,450
of particles in my plasma
which will be contained in this cylinder.

45
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,240
So these are the plasma particles
in the cylinder.

46
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,760
There are N of them.

47
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:12,733
So œÑ will be given by N
divided by the loss rate.

48
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:16,661
So the number of particles
lost per unit time.

49
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,067
The number of particles N that we have

50
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,456
will be the density times the volume.

51
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:28,126
And the number of particles that
are lost because of transport

52
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:32,331
would be the flux say,
going through the walls

53
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:35,486
times the surface of the walls.

54
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:38,964
So the volume is œÄ a¬≤ L,

55
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:46,373
and the surface of this cylinder around
neglecting the end surfaces

56
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,503
will be 2œÄ a L.

57
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:52,196
Of course, I put Œì here
with the absolute value,

58
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:55,650
not to be confused by 
the sign in Fick's law.

59
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,643
Now I simplify here the different terms

60
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:05,721
end up with n a / (2 D‚ä•)

61
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:10,573
times a gradient of the density
in the radial direction, [dn/dr]

62
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:14,685
the radial direction is
the direction from center

63
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:16,879
to the edge of the cylinder.

64
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,421
And I evaluate in a simple way

65
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:25,782
this gradient in terms of
order of magnitude, as

66
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:30,959
just the density 
divided by the radius a.

67
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,578
So that is n a / (2 D‚ä•) n / a.

68
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:40,201
Interestingly, the density goes away,

69
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:44,297
ending up just with 
a¬≤ / (2 D‚ä•).

70
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:47,719
So this is one way to relate
in a simple way

71
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:51,263
the confinement time that one
can measure experimentally

72
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:56,021
to the value at least
in order of magnitude

73
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:59,087
of the diffusion coefficient
in the perpendicular direction.

74
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:02,301
a is the size of the plasma.

75
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,180
Let's take for example the case
of the JET tokamak

76
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,756
which we know quite well.

77
00:05:07,756 --> 00:05:11,405
If I apply this classical theory
that I developed so far,

78
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:15,097
the perpendicular diffusion coefficient
for electrons for example,

79
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:16,909
is of the order as we say

80
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:21,250
the Larmor radius squared [œÅLe¬≤] times
the collision frequency [<ùõé‚Çë·µ¢>].

81
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:27,012
Put the numbers and that 
is about 5 x 10‚Åª‚Åµ m¬≤/s

82
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:31,258
What about the experimental value
or the order of magnitude

83
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:32,639
of the experimental value?

84
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:35,317
a is of the order 1 m.

85
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:41,415
The experimental confinement times
of the order 1 second,

86
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:46,183
so if I evaluate D‚ä•
from this expression

87
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:50,716
we have seen together,
that would be of the order

88
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:53,271
of a¬≤/œÑ.

89
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:58,734
Here I don't even put the factor of 2
just to underline

90
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:02,113
the fact that we're really only evaluating
the orders of magnitude.

91
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,694
That gives me something like
1 m¬≤ /s.

92
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,177
1 m¬≤ /s to compare
with the classical prediction

93
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:13,189
of 5 x 10‚Åª‚Åµ m¬≤/s

94
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:16,855
so of course this is much larger
than the classical

95
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:18,571
theoretical prediction.

96
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,122
This is quite a general observation
that we have in many, many fusion devices

97
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:29,043
in fact, in many magnetically confined
plasmas, even at lower temperatures

98
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:30,621
and lower densities.

99
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:33,595
In general, the experimental
diffusion coefficient

100
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,823
is much larger than the classical value.

101
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:40,896
Not only that, but also the scaling
of the experimentally measured

102
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:43,961
or estimated diffusion coefficient
with parameters such as

103
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:46,752
the magnetic field
or even the temperature, etc.,

104
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:49,240
does not follow 
the classical prediction.

105
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:53,736
So the first question is,
why is the classical model

106
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:59,018
so far off, but also to evaluate 
D‚ä• quantitatively in particular,

107
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:03,637
and also in terms of the scaling
of D‚ä• upon the plasma parameters?

108
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:05,909
What have we done wrong?

109
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:10,061
First issue that comes to mind
is that perhaps the step size,

110
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:12,587
at least in a tokamak plasma,

111
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:18,232
is not quite the Larmor radius,
or it would be more complicated than that,

112
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:20,576
because the orbits are
more complicated than that.

113
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:23,639
So let's look at that possible effect.

114
00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:28,278
As we have learned in previous lectures, 
in the tokamak, particles move along

115
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:32,831
helical field lines
in addition to their gyromotion,

116
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:36,585
they have an orbit
that goes around

117
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,152
the helical field lines
in fact, we have constructed

118
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:43,625
a tokamak machine,
a tokamak concept

119
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:47,304
exactly to do that, so that on average
its drifts are compensated

120
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,900
and particles can be confined.

121
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:54,507
But as the particles go around 
this helical structure,

122
00:07:54,507 --> 00:08:01,261
they will go in, out,
in, out, in out.

123
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:07,718
In general, the magnetic field 
is proportional to 1/R,

124
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:11,880
where R is the distance 
from the axis of the torus.

125
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,104
So that means that if particles go around

126
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:19,899
in the way we've just seen in the picture,

127
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,909
they will see a field

128
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,578
that will be going up and down,
up and down, up and down.

129
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:32,564
Let's say this is
along the particle orbit.

130
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:39,378
If a particle sees a field that goes
up and down, up and down,

131
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:42,401
so it means it experiences 
minima and maxima

132
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:46,948
over B because it sort of moves
along this direction, back and forth.

133
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:51,960
It may be trapped in the minima
of B: it may be trapped

134
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,612
by the mirror trapping effect
that you have discussed

135
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:58,257
in the first part of the course.

136
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:01,586
Of course, not all particles are trapped.

137
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:03,817
The trapping will depend
on the pitch angle

138
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:10,319
of their velocity and on the depth
if you like, of this variation

139
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:14,296
of the magnitude of B
that they see along their orbit,

140
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:17,367
which itself depends
on inverse aspect ratio

141
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:20,029
which is the minor radius a
divided by the major radius

142
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,257
[R] of the torus.

143
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:24,035
But some particles will be trapped
in this effective mirror.

144
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:27,806
And the particles that get trapped
will follow a trajectory

145
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:29,847
that is not really going
all the way around

146
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:35,307
but it will be actually confined
to some portions of the torus

147
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:39,094
and if we project that trajectory
on the poloidal plane--

148
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:43,495
I'm following one here for example,
or a second one here,

149
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:46,237
that will look like a banana.

150
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:50,447
So this is why we call these
<i>banana orbits</i>.

151
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:55,481
These banana orbits represent
the orbits of the trapped particles.

152
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:58,624
Trapped particles mean particles
that are actually trapped

153
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:02,760
in a minima of the magnetic field
as they see a variation

154
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,781
of the field along the orbits
going in and out,

155
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,130
in and out the torus.

156
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:09,694
So why is this relevant
to our discussion of transport?

157
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:13,852
Because if particles move quickly
around banana orbits

158
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:19,100
and they collide, say I represent here
another banana orbit like that,

159
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:25,018
as a banana orbit
sort of next to it in red.

160
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:28,989
Suppose a particle is 
moving along this blue orbit

161
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:33,539
and collides with 
another particle at this point,

162
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:38,918
they may jump 
to a different banana orbit

163
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,695
and follow that agaiin.

164
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:47,535
So this jump is such that 
the displacement

165
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:53,869
of the particle on average,
would not be of the size

166
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:58,772
of the Larmor radius anymore,
but will be of the size of the width

167
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:03,184
of the banana orbit
which we call ‚àÜb.

168
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:09,235
So my step size in the collision
process will be of the order

169
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,634
of the banana orbit with ‚àÜb.

170
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:14,689
And if I calculate that, 
that will be equal

171
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:18,107
to the safety factor q
at the location of the orbit

172
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:21,853
times the Larmor radius
for the particle,

173
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:23,902
in this case I have taken electrons

174
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:27,480
divided by the square root
of the inverse aspect ratio Œµ,

175
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,898
again, the ratio 
of the minor to the major radius.

176
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,651
So we know now the step size,
what is the effective collision frequency?

177
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,565
Well, it will be similar
to the collision frequency

178
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:43,580
for the exchange of momentum
that we have seen before.

179
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:45,703
For example, between electrons and ions

180
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:51,462
but corrected by again,
a factor that is the inverse aspect ratio,

181
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,920
a/R [=Œµ].

182
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,218
Now, not all particles are trapped
so we need to account for that.

183
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:00,454
So we say that the fraction
of trapped particles

184
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:05,300
is of the order of the square root
of this inverse aspect ratio,

185
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,640
Œµ again,

186
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,639
so the contribution
from trapped particles

187
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,154
will be what we call
the <i>neoclassical diffusion</i>

188
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:17,137
corresponding to a neoclassical
diffusion coefficient,

189
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,521
perpendicular to B

190
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:23,285
would be of the order
of the fractional trapped particles

191
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,311
that are actually 
undergoing this process,

192
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,503
times the step size squared,

193
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:33,537
times the effective collision
of frequency for the process.

194
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:38,766
Now I take the numbers
for JET and noticing of course,

195
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:44,225
I can in fact express the terms
as we have developed them

196
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:48,402
before in the way of q¬≤/Œµ^(3/2), times

197
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:51,667
the classical diffusion coefficient,
so I take the numbers for JET,

198
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:56,388
let's say q of order 3.5,
Œµ is about .3,

199
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:59,950
so the neo-classical term,

200
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,212
which is the neo-classical diffusion
coefficient related to the fact

201
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:04,987
that the orbits are not simple

202
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:07,766
Larmor orbits, but they are more 
complicated and they are

203
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:12,725
on the poloidal plane in the form of 
bananas, is about 75 times

204
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,212
the classical diffusion coefficient
that we have seen before.

205
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:19,735
This is of course an improvement
in the sense that we are getting

206
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,731
a little bit closer to the values
that we observe experimentally

207
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:26,651
but remember that we were
orders of magnitude off

208
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:31,353
and we are still much, much lower
than the experimentally measured

209
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,030
or estimated data.

210
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,480
So even this correction
which is in fact necessary,

211
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,838
leading to this neo-classical term,
neo-classical diffusion coefficient

212
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:44,935
for neo-classical transport
does not account really for

213
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,159
experimental measures

214
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,189
and in fact, does not even account
for scalings in many cases.

215
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,902
So we have to ask ourselves
another question.

216
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:57,397
We have sort of corrected the step size
with the proper orbit.

217
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:02,207
we have considered
a rather standard

218
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:05,868
collision frequency
or even correcting that

219
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:08,978
with the appropriate term

220
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:12,059
for this neo-classical effect.

221
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,725
But that's not sufficient,
so what else can we do?

222
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:17,790
Perhaps we can even question
the hypothesis of classical

223
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,126
or even neo-classical diffusion.

224
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,757
Are they really satisfied?

225
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:24,809
This is a little diversion,

226
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:28,279
but it's important, at least conceptually.

227
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:34,020
What we have assumed is that
the classical diffusion was characterized

228
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,813
by a Gaussian distribution
of step sizes.

229
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:40,878
In fact, we have taken
even the same step size

230
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:44,578
for all particles of the same species.

231
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:46,600
This may not always be the case.

232
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,753
We can have a 
non-Gaussian distribution.

233
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:52,720
For example, the probability
distribution functions

234
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,758
that have heavy tails or in other words
that have a non-negligible probability

235
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,568
of having very, very large steps.

236
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:04,092
This is a typical situation
of what's called <i>Levy-flight</i>.

237
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:09,033
Effects that are non-local
between different parts of the plasma,

238
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,976
effects that are not really

239
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:16,231
described well by a single scale,

240
00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:18,531
so effects that are so called <i>scale free</i>.

241
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,925
So that's for the step size,

242
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:26,883
that may not be distributed
according to Gaussian distributions.

243
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:31,121
But also, we may have situations
that are non-Markovian.

244
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:35,395
In other words each step is not
necessarily independent

245
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:37,485
of the previous step.

246
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:39,048
So there may be 
memory in the system.

247
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:42,588
So there may be long-range
correlation also in terms of time.

248
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:47,708
These are situations that are
not described by the very simple

249
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,089
classical model we have seen so far.

250
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:54,464
These two movies illustrate
the difference between two situations.

251
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:57,965
On the left is a situation
we have seen so far,

252
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:00,186
it's the <i>Brownian motion</i>.

253
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:04,784
So it's a particle undergoing
uncorrelated steps of the same size,

254
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:08,747
or a size distributor according to
a very simple Gaussian distribution.

255
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,327
On the right we have a simulation
of a so-called <i>Levy-flight.</i>

256
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:18,968
So it's a non-diffusive transport
in which there's a finite probability

257
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:22,575
for having very large jumps
as opposed to

258
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:27,051
an exponentially small probability
of having very large jumps

259
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:30,915
which would be the case
of the classical Brownian motion,

260
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,852
which will lead to diffusion.

261
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:35,571
The consequence of this kind of--

262
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:41,346
non-classical behavior
is that the diffusive transport model

263
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:42,546
does not work.

264
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:45,069
So we have a situation 
which is non-diffusive

265
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:49,424
in which the mean square displacement
is no longer necessarily proportional

266
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:54,212
to the time simply,
but is proportional to the time

267
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:57,666
to an exponent Œ≥
which may be smaller than 1,

268
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,638
and that's the case of <i>sub-diffusion</i>,

269
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:04,184
or larger than one and that's the case
of <i>super-diffusion</i>.

270
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:10,045
I notice that non-diffusive transport
in fact is very, very common

271
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:13,416
in physical systems so we have
examples here.

272
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,516
The dispersal of banknotes for example.

273
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,574
You live in your village or in your town,

274
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:23,329
using banknotes and the transport 
of these banknotes

275
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:26,851
may be described
by a Gaussian distribution,

276
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:29,813
relatively a simple sort
of classical and random walk.

277
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:33,643
But suddenly you take the plane
and you go to a different country

278
00:17:33,643 --> 00:17:37,378
and a different location
and you use banknotes there

279
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:41,606
and so you have a sudden big jump
that's not accounted at all

280
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:44,391
by a Gaussian distribution,
therefore by a classical motion.

281
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:46,407
Other examples in nature include

282
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:52,240
the motion of sharks that are looking
for fish to eat, to feed on.

283
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,957
They explore and utilize

284
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:59,998
the local reservoir of fish
and then suddenly,

285
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:02,458
there are no fish anymore
for them to eat

286
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:06,079
and they have a very long
jump in their motion

287
00:18:06,163 --> 00:18:08,803
which is a Levy-flight
to go to a different location,

288
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,907
maybe thousands of kilometers away,

289
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:16,156
and start feeding on 
new reservoirs of fish.

290
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:21,249
So this non-diffusive transport 
is pretty common in many physical systems.

291
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:26,163
However, even considering that the process
may be non-diffusive,

292
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:29,771
we still need to understand
what is the underlying reason for that

293
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:32,470
and also we need to understand
why the predictions

294
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,400
of diffusion coefficients

295
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,598
and the corresponding
confinement times

296
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:41,444
are so far off compared to the
experiment, orders of magnitude off.

297
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:46,166
So Coulomb Collisions 
do not necessarily explain

298
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,185
what we observe in the plasmas 
in terms of transport

299
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:51,795
and even sort of correcting

300
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:57,430
or generalizing the classical approach
may not help at all

301
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:02,299
in explaining what we measure
in the experimental situation.

302
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,046
The answer to the question
of what is the underlying mechanism

303
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:10,358
that makes diffusion transport
so much more effective

304
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:15,002
than that Coulomb collisions 
would make is turbulence.

305
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:20,051
The transport that results from turbulence
is referred to as <i>anomalous</i> transport

306
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:23,330
to indicate that it's not
a collisional effect.

307
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:28,255
It is in fact generated
by the interaction of plasma particles

308
00:19:28,255 --> 00:19:33,047
with small-scale collective instabilities
which is what turbulence is,

309
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:37,915
and in fact is by far the dominant factor
in the confinement of a plasma

310
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,475
for magnetic fusion.

311
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:43,971
Turbulence is generated by
the instabilities that tap

312
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:48,526
the free energy present
in the plasma gradients.

313
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:54,963
This free energy is the source
for small-scale instabilities

314
00:19:55,072 --> 00:19:58,874
that combine nonlinearly
to give rise to turbulence.

315
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:05,857
This is a picture of a simulation
showing the structure that forms

316
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:10,502
in a fairly complex manner
inside a tokamak

317
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:13,733
and the turbulence 
that characterizes the tokamak.

318
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:21,123
And in this simple sketch
we see that particles and even heat

319
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:24,044
are kicked out by this turbulence

320
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:27,887
from the confinement region
to the outside.

321
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:31,824
In fact, turbulence in general
is a fundamental science question

322
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:34,909
that remains at least partly open.

323
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:40,442
Again, turbulence is a spontaneous
way of releasing free energy

324
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,068
associated with flows or gradients

325
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:46,480
in the presence of nonlinearities 
and of dissipation.

326
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,390
Turbulence doesn't just happen
in plasmas of course,

327
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,447
it's present in many
physical systems

328
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:59,733
and it acts over 
a large variety of scales,

329
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:02,233
both spatial and temporal.

330
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:06,073
The pictures here illustrate
such a variety.

331
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:09,401
Here we see a picture 
of the turbulence present

332
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:13,310
in the global atmosphere of our planet.

333
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,032
Turbulence is present for example, 
in the flow of the wind,

334
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:23,562
in this case behind wind turbines.

335
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,499
Turbulence is present
in the mixing of fluids,

336
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,288
like water in this glass.

337
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:34,976
And turbulence is even present 
in the systems that are man-made

338
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,996
like the stock exchange.

339
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:40,154
Let's focus on the origins of turbulence
in tokamak plasmas

340
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:43,327
and on its consequence on transport.

341
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,084
Turbulence that's important
for transport in plasmas

342
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:55,014
originates from the nonlinear development
of electrostatic waves typically.

343
00:21:55,502 --> 00:22:05,076
Electrostatic waves mean that
in the wave itself, there is practically

344
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,379
no perturbation to the magnetic field.

345
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:13,227
So we can neglect 
the magnetic part of the wave.

346
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:15,855
There are several kinds
of electrostatic waves

347
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,718
of importance for turbulence.

348
00:22:17,932 --> 00:22:20,817
Typically they are relatively low
frequency compared

349
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:23,810
to the gyrofrequencies of both
the electrons and the ions.

350
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:28,737
These are waves that are referred to
as drift waves or sound waves

351
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:32,590
or interchange waves that are driven 
unstable by pressure gradients

352
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,057
and what we call <i>bad curvature</i>,

353
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:39,535
that is, opposing magnetic curvature 
and pressure gradients.

354
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:43,377
What are the consequences
of the turbulence on transport

355
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,371
and what is the cause of transport?

356
00:22:45,826 --> 00:22:51,293
Well, the turbulence results
in the fluctuation of electric fields

357
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:57,714
primarily, as we said we mostly
deal with electrostatic waves,

358
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:02,042
and when we have 
a fluctuating electric field,

359
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:07,169
we have a fluctuating flow
that's associated with ExB,

360
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:08,704
related to that field.

361
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:12,131
This flow can cause transport.

362
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:17,413
So if we represent the 
flux here, Œìf,

363
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:22,799
that is associated
with these perturbations.

364
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,675
This is the time average of the product
of the perturbation in the density

365
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,794
and the perturbation in the velocity.

366
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:37,040
The perturbation in the velocity
comes from the ExB term

367
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,711
in which B can be considered
as the background magnetic field

368
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:45,974
because as we said, the wave
this primarily electrostatic

369
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:51,826
while E of course is the perturbed
field associated with the wave

370
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:54,203
and needs nonlinear development.

371
00:23:54,203 --> 00:23:59,729
So at the end we have the product
between density and field

372
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,007
between density and potential, 
if you like.

373
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,401
That has to be time averaged, ...√óB‚ÇÄ,
where B‚ÇÄ is the ambient

374
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:12,516
magnetic field, and divided by B‚ÇÄ¬≤.
< Œ¥n Œ¥E > √ó B‚ÇÄ / B‚ÇÄ¬≤

375
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:15,925
So of course, transport depends
on the fluctuation amplitude

376
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:17,571
that we have.

377
00:24:18,254 --> 00:24:20,621
But it also depends on the phase
between the potential

378
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:22,666
and the density fluctuation,
and let's look at that

379
00:24:23,368 --> 00:24:27,756
in a slightly more in-depth way.

380
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:31,734
To do that, we have 
a picture here that illustrates

381
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:37,240
the case for a single mode in which 
we have the potential fluctuations

382
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:40,170
or the potential oscillations if you like.

383
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:43,544
Say it's a function of time going down.

384
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:47,158
We assumed as a magnetic field,

385
00:24:49,877 --> 00:24:53,727
B‚ÇÄ coming out from the board.

386
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:58,689
We see that the potential
or the electric field

387
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:03,800
of course will cause a perturbation
in the velocity which we call

388
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,338
<i>flow velocity</i> here, which would be going
around in eddies if you like,

389
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:15,310
which are associated
with these potential wave structures.

390
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,477
Now the point is that you also have
density fluctuations

391
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:23,084
and these are represented 
by the black lines in this third column

392
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:27,131
but a key point is where are
these density fluctuations

393
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:31,300
with respect to the flow 
velocity fluctuations

394
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:35,391
and if they are perfectly aligned,

395
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:39,293
so if they are in phase with each other
which is not the case of the picture,

396
00:25:39,383 --> 00:25:42,203
of course there would be no transport,
everything will oscillate

397
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:45,943
up and down together,
but there would be no net transport.

398
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,296
When density and potential
are in phase,

399
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:56,204
we call the situation
adiabatic situations,

400
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:59,619
so this is a typical condition
we have assumed in the first part

401
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:04,729
of the course to make simple estimates
like the evaluation of the screening

402
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,888
of the charges and the Debye length.

403
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,071
Now when adiabaticity is present, 
no transport is induced

404
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,866
by the fluctuations.

405
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:16,416
But when it is not present,

406
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:20,263
in other words, when the density
and the flow velocity

407
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:23,492
issued by the potential fluctuation
are not in phase,

408
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,604
then you can have transport.

409
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:30,879
The reason for that is that you can have
of course, parts of the oscillations

410
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:34,983
that lead to a net flow in one direction,

411
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:38,170
and parts of the oscillations that lead
to a net flow in the opposite direction

412
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,866
but if the flow in the opposite 
direction characterizes

413
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:46,162
a large number of particles,

414
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:53,472
then you have a bigger effect
for the outflow

415
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:55,002
than you have for the inflow,

416
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:57,921
where you have a small number
of particles.

417
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:02,186
In other words, when you have
a flow that goes one direction

418
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:05,932
and the other, but associated
with a different number of particles,

419
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:09,684
you can have a net, overall transport

420
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:11,776
of the plasma in one particular direction.

421
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:15,653
In this case, to the right-hand side.

422
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:19,403
So in this case,
we would have a net

423
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:27,556
flux to the outside, 
to the right-hand side of this board.

424
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:31,897
So once again, the transport that 
is caused by the fluctuations

425
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:35,789
depends on their amplitude,
--which is very intuitive of course,

426
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:39,334
but also on the phase between
the potential and density fluctuations.

427
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:41,910
Let's just comment on a few
general features

428
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,692
of turbulence in tokamaks.

429
00:27:43,948 --> 00:27:48,158
Typically we have scales
that are very long.

430
00:27:48,828 --> 00:27:53,755
Parallel to B, this is typically, mostly
the toroidal direction of the tokamak,

431
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:58,155
and scales that are small,
perpendicular to B.

432
00:27:59,152 --> 00:28:05,264
So the eddies that cause transport
are therefore illustrated here

433
00:28:05,264 --> 00:28:06,972
in the cross-section,

434
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:11,292
and they mix if you like,
the hot core with a cold edge

435
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,101
and that's exactly
what we do not want

436
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:16,189
if you want to confine the plasma
to make it fuse in the core.

437
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:19,698
How do we characterize
turbulence experimentally?

438
00:28:20,743 --> 00:28:24,965
In general, we have plasma waves
and even if they develop nonlinearly

439
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:27,593
into turbulence, you have several
plasma parameters

440
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:31,916
and electromagnetic fields
that fluctuate together.

441
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,750
For example, you have 
the density that fluctuates,

442
00:28:36,874 --> 00:28:38,572
the temperature that fluctuates,

443
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:42,231
the magnetic field in case
of electromagnetic perturbations

444
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:45,949
(this can be neglected if we have 
electrostatic perturbations as we said)

445
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:48,191
and the electric field and so on.

446
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:52,589
So you have to measure in principle,
several parameters.

447
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:56,522
You also have to measure over
many spatial and temporal scales

448
00:28:56,522 --> 00:29:01,216
because fluctuations cover
several scales.

449
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,921
Depending on where you are
in the plasma profile,

450
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:09,343
you also have a relative fluctuation
amplitude that's very different.

451
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:14,185
Typically, they are relatively small
in the core say, less than 1%,

452
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,629
and relatively large towards the edge

453
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:22,848
and the very edge can reach
much more than 10%

454
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:24,787
typically.

455
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:30,764
We do have a number of experimental
techniques that are dedicated

456
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:33,363
to measuring the different
quantities and scales

457
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:35,954
that characterize turbulence
in fusion plasmas,

458
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:38,224
particularly in tokamaks.

459
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:42,727
For example, <i>ECE</i> that is,
Electron Cyclotron Emission,

460
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:46,860
reflectometry, interferometry,
scattering of laser light and so on.

461
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,581
Just take one example to illustrate

462
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:53,773
typical measurement 
of turbulence in a tokamak,

463
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:58,083
and this is the measurement
of the frequency spectrum

464
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:04,429
and of the RMS amplitude
[Root Mean Square amplitude],

465
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,519
as a function of essentially,
the radial position in the plasma

466
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,520
of what we call a 
<i>Geodesic Acoustic Mode</i> [GAM]

467
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,267
and the fluctuations
that are associated with it.

468
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:17,982
We don't need to go into details
of the physics of this mode.

469
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:22,048
This is done on the TCV tokamak
plasma in Lausanne.

470
00:30:22,952 --> 00:30:26,273
This is just to illustrate that you have
in this case, a mode that has

471
00:30:26,273 --> 00:30:30,799
a main frequency component
going across the profile

472
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,619
but an amplitude that does vary
cross a profile.

473
00:30:34,189 --> 00:30:35,821
It also illustrates
a particular technique.

474
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,154
In this case, we use the so-called
<i>Phase Contrast System</i> [PCS]

475
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:45,611
which is built to detect oscillations
of the phase of a beam of light

476
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,836
that this injected into the plasma

477
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:50,717
and is diffracted by 
the plasma density fluctuations.

478
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:54,677
The fluctuations are then transformed
to phase fluctuations

479
00:30:54,677 --> 00:30:57,795
and then detected over a range 
of frequencies

480
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:02,215
that can go as high as hundreds of KHz.

481
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:04,752
Let us go back to a few
general considerations

482
00:31:04,752 --> 00:31:07,840
on the effect of turbulence
on transport,

483
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:12,448
in particular via the development
of macroscopic structures.

484
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:17,090
What we can say
in simple terms is that

485
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,627
the effective diffusive coefficient

486
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:22,888
in our case, perpendicular
to the magnetic field,

487
00:31:23,986 --> 00:31:28,892
can be simply estimated by taking
the size of the wave structure

488
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:31,758
or the turbulence structure
squared of course,

489
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:35,562
as this would be the typical
step-size divided by

490
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,972
the correlation time.

491
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,994
Now of course,

492
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:44,899
small radial wavelength modes
would give small steps

493
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:47,409
that is, small transport.

494
00:31:47,936 --> 00:31:51,022
But turbulence can develop
nonlinear macroscopic structures

495
00:31:51,732 --> 00:31:55,047
and in fact, it does in many,
many, many systems

496
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,711
in which large-scale organized
structures are present.

497
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:05,815
The example here is that of a hurricane
in the southern United States.

498
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:12,427
So, in plasmas you can have
radially elongated structures

499
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:14,896
and that would be bad.

500
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,660
Let me just draw them, for example here.

501
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,093
it would be bad--

502
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:25,869
this is a cross-section
of our tokamak for example.

503
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,835
It would be bad because 
the step-size would be large,

504
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:34,353
say of the order of the size
of the structure itself

505
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,517
and therefore the effective 
diffusion would be fast.

506
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:46,132
However, you could have flows
that are also generated

507
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:50,157
by the turbulence itself
that could be sheared,

508
00:32:50,232 --> 00:32:53,909
that is non-uniform
in the radial direction

509
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:58,557
for example they could be larger
on the outside than the inside.

510
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:04,044
The result of these flows would be
that the structures would be

511
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:07,149
distorted or even broken.

512
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:10,289
Let me just try to illustrate
what would happen say,

513
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,249
in the presence of these flows,

514
00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:16,756
the structures would be distorted
or even broken apart.

515
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:19,427
This would actually be 
very good for a transport

516
00:33:19,427 --> 00:33:26,789
because the radial size of the step
would be significant and shortened,

517
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:29,009
both when they are distorted

518
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:32,374
and in fact, when they are 
completely broken apart.

519
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:36,638
So, turbulence could do both things,

520
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:42,374
it could generate
large-scale structures

521
00:33:42,374 --> 00:33:45,148
in the radial direction,
that is bad

522
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,370
because it would facilitate
radial transport,

523
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:54,173
and at the same time it could also provide
shear flows that would break

524
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:57,397
or distort these structures
and then restore

525
00:33:57,397 --> 00:34:00,567
something that would be
relatively beneficial

526
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:03,341
that is a level of transport
that could be relatively small

527
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,654
because again, the step-sizes
corresponding to the sizes

528
00:34:06,654 --> 00:34:08,108
or the structures associated 
with the waves

529
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:10,333
and the turbulence would be small again.

530
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,657
Let's just say a word 
about the possibility

531
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:16,719
of simulating turbulence
and transport in the tokamak plasma

532
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,611
particularly, in this case, in ITER.

533
00:34:20,881 --> 00:34:26,527
As you will see, in the evolution
of the movie that's being shown

534
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:31,924
on the right, you see
that the instabilities

535
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:36,080
are being generated by 
the gradients in the tokamak,

536
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:39,593
but are also is evolving 
nonlinearly into turbulence

537
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:44,410
and then evolving into structures
that first seem to be elongated

538
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:47,739
radially and then seem to be,
at least in some regions,

539
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:52,728
sheared apart
by flows that are non-uniform

540
00:34:52,728 --> 00:34:54,852
in the radial direction,

541
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:56,736
these are the famous shear flows,

542
00:34:58,575 --> 00:35:00,120
or <i>zonal flows</i>.

543
00:35:01,463 --> 00:35:06,369
This is a simulation of the ITER plasma
on one of the highest performance

544
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:11,685
computers used for fusion,
it's a 1.3 petaflop computer

545
00:35:11,685 --> 00:35:16,056
in this case, there were a billion 
particles and a billion points

546
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:21,092
in the grid to simulate
the ITER core plasma.

547
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:27,107
On the left you also see an image
of the zonal flows of Jupiter

548
00:35:27,915 --> 00:35:31,693
indicating that this question
and this development

549
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:37,788
of turbulence into regions
of reduced transport

550
00:35:37,788 --> 00:35:41,522
because of the presence
of macroscopic self-organized structures

551
00:35:41,522 --> 00:35:44,593
is not unique to tokamak plasmas.

552
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:50,775
These shear and zonal flows
we have seen in tokamak plasmas

553
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:56,436
but also in other situations can in fact,
create <i>local transport barriers</i>

554
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:58,360
that is, local regions
where the transport

555
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,302
is very, very small.

556
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:03,947
This is very beneficial for fusion.

557
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,283
These regions can be at
the edge or in the core

558
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,431
and they have been observed 
experimentally.

559
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:14,349
So the profiles that result
from the presence of these region

560
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:17,994
in fact, correspond
to different operating conditions

561
00:36:17,994 --> 00:36:21,653
of a tokamak plasma typically
and to what we refer to

562
00:36:21,653 --> 00:36:23,413
as <i>plasma scenarios</i>.

563
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:25,545
So let me just illustrate them.

564
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:32,483
This is the radial profile say,
the radial coordinate normalized

565
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:35,958
to the minor radius of our tokamak,

566
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:39,130
say between zero and one,
so this would be

567
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,961
a region corresponding to--

568
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:49,853
the section of our tokamak device

569
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:55,295
and you can have transport barriers
at the edge we said

570
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:56,602
or in the core, or in some cases

571
00:36:58,093 --> 00:36:59,937
you don't have
them at all of course.

572
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:04,128
When you don't have them at all, 
we have a situation referred to

573
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,965
as the <i>low confinement mode</i>,

574
00:37:06,796 --> 00:37:11,233
We're not helped, if you like, 
by the beneficial turbulent structures

575
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:13,860
that set these 
transport barriers in this case.

576
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,991
The low confinement mode or <i>L-mode</i>

577
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:21,744
has a profile that's relatively simple
but also relatively low

578
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,109
and the profile here is represented 
in terms of the plasma pressure,

579
00:37:25,185 --> 00:37:28,844
and the low plasma pressure
of course implies a relatively

580
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:30,896
low fusion performance.

581
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,273
You can also have a situation
in which you develop

582
00:37:34,414 --> 00:37:36,379
a transport barrier at the edge.

583
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:42,909
So a very steep gradient
in a relatively narrow region

584
00:37:42,957 --> 00:37:47,605
but even just the relatively
narrow region will help a lot

585
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:51,537
for the performance
of the whole plasma,

586
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:53,625
in particular of the plasma core,

587
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:59,722
because it is as if we had the pedestal
on which the whole profile was sitting

588
00:37:59,722 --> 00:38:01,953
and so the rest of the profile would be

589
00:38:01,953 --> 00:38:04,283
similar to what we have in L-mode

590
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:07,792
but it would be sitting on a pedestal
created by this transport barrier

591
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:10,031
at the edge and so it would be
much higher in terms of pressure

592
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:14,448
and therefore much higher in terms
of potential fusion performance,

593
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:19,836
This is is what we would refer to as
the <i>high confinement</i> or <i>H-mode</i>.

594
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:24,353
It's one of the modes we actually foresee
for the possible operation

595
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:26,010
of a fusion reactor.

596
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:29,329
You could also have a transport barrier

597
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:31,246
more to the inside,

598
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:33,416
what we call the 
<i>internal transport barrier</i>.

599
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:36,757
This would be a shear flow 
generated transport barrier

600
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:42,107
in some region not too close
to the edge of the plasma.

601
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:46,842
This would also generate
a boost in a pressure again

602
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:51,299
which will increase further
the performance of the core

603
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:52,299
in terms of fusion.

604
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:56,039
This is what we refer to as
<i>internal transport barrier scenario</i>

605
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:59,132
or <i>advanced modes
of operation of tokamaks</i>;

606
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:02,825
they have been discovered 
relatively recently.

607
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:07,535
Now we have seen that
in the sketches of the profiles

608
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:11,348
we can gain a lot even having
a transport barrier

609
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,438
only at the very edge
of the plasma

610
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:18,275
because the turbulence actually
couples the edge and the core

611
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:23,581
so the profile of the core of the plasma
is relatively similar

612
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:27,517
to this situation in which you
don't have a transport barrier.

613
00:39:27,517 --> 00:39:28,816
And In fact to--

614
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:34,709
highlight this coupling between 
the edge and the core performance,

615
00:39:35,434 --> 00:39:40,574
I illustrate here the findings
of different turbulent models

616
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:42,984
-- into which we'll not go,

617
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:48,585
in terms of the fusion gain
versus the temperature of the pedestal,

618
00:39:48,657 --> 00:39:55,948
that is the region that's made
at higher pressure

619
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:58,819
by the presence of 
the edge transport barrier.

620
00:39:59,935 --> 00:40:02,336
Although the details
or the different models are different

621
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:08,069
and even the details 
of the exact values are different,

622
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:13,679
in all cases, we see that by increasing
the pedestal temperature,

623
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:20,776
the fusion gain, Q,
which we can call a fusion performance

624
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:23,110
actually goes up in all cases.

625
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:28,511
So it is very important to have
a pedestal good performance

626
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:32,878
in order to have good fusion gain 
in the plasma core.

627
00:40:32,878 --> 00:40:37,959
Now we have of course
played experimentally

628
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:41,704
with several devices,
in particular several tokamaks,

629
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:46,763
we have measured transport,
we have measured confinement time

630
00:40:46,763 --> 00:40:53,066
and we have varied all the possible
parameters to explore the dependance

631
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:56,472
of the confinement time
upon these parameters.

632
00:40:57,516 --> 00:41:02,569
In the absence of a complete
ab initio theory,

633
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:05,076
because of this complexity
in the turbulence,

634
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:10,681
what we can do is to plot
the different results

635
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:13,070
from the different experiments worldwide

636
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,357
in an empirical transport
scaling kind of plot.

637
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,565
In particular this is something
we can use to design future devices

638
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:24,629
and this is something that has been used
to design the ITER machine

639
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:26,016
that's being built in a moment.

640
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:31,168
This is the plot that 
summarizes these findings,

641
00:41:31,168 --> 00:41:36,395
representing the confinement time,
measured experimentally in seconds

642
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:40,497
as opposed to the predicted
confinement time

643
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:43,990
predicted here on a basis
of a scaling law,

644
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:48,329
which includes the main
parameters of the machines

645
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:50,225
and of the plasmas.

646
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:55,606
Here I put the three main parameters
that play a major role

647
00:41:55,606 --> 00:42:00,044
that is the size of the plasma,
the major radius which appears as

648
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:02,876
power 1.97, say about 2,

649
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:06,585
so of course we gain in the confinement
as we increase the size.

650
00:42:07,678 --> 00:42:11,838
We gain also some if we increase
the toroidal magnetic field,

651
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,736
we don't gain much because the dependency
is only to the power .15,

652
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:20,254
and we gain by increasing
the plasma current which of course

653
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:23,859
reduces the size of the orbits
of the particles inside the tokamak.

654
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:28,523
The different machines are represented
by different colors here,

655
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:36,969
and you can see that we cover quite a 
range as the two axes are logarithmic.

656
00:42:38,397 --> 00:42:41,002
I highlight our own machine
the TCV tokamak here

657
00:42:41,002 --> 00:42:42,826
but of course there are 
many machines

658
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:46,389
and in particular as we go 
towards larger confinement times,

659
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:50,884
that means we're also going towards
larger and larger machines,

660
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:56,097
the JET device here is the one
providing all of the red points

661
00:42:56,097 --> 00:43:00,067
and therefore is the one that is closest
to the extrapolation we need to make

662
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:04,958
for ITER which needs a few seconds
of confinement time.

663
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:08,817
Therefore based on this scaling
we can devise it's size.

664
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:14,051
This is sort of a wind tunnel approach
that we use to dimension

665
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:15,918
the fusion devices like ITER,

666
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:20,562
but of course we also like to further
our understanding of turbulence

667
00:43:20,562 --> 00:43:24,170
because that would improve
the reliability of the prediction

668
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:30,714
and it would also make suggestions
for the ways to go to optimize

669
00:43:30,714 --> 00:43:32,807
a tokamak concept in general.

670
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:35,535
So in summary we have seen
that in fusion devices,

671
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:38,758
transport is generated 
mostly by turbulence.

672
00:43:40,613 --> 00:43:44,833
Simulations and indeed experiments
indicate that shear flows,

673
00:43:45,064 --> 00:43:50,458
that is, flows that are not uniform
in the radial direction of the device

674
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:53,959
can very significantly reduce transport.

675
00:43:55,017 --> 00:43:58,859
The transport barriers that are associated
with these shear flows,

676
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,623
in fact determine
different plasma scenarios

677
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:05,077
or different operating conditions
for our future reactor.

678
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:10,327
At the moment we don't have 
a complete understanding of turbulence

679
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:12,568
and therefore we use 
empirical scalings

680
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:14,649
to extrapolate confinement
in fusion devices

681
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:18,307
and to design the size in particular
and the main parameters

682
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:20,347
for the future experiments.
