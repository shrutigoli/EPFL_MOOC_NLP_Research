00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:08,456
Welcome to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:11,392
Today we will discuss collisional
transport in plasmas.

3
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:14,318
Even if collisions play 
a relative minor role

4
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:15,627
in plasmas that are hot,

5
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:19,211
which is the case of course
of plasmas for magnetic fusion,

6
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,813
they're crucial for determining 
the plasma resistivity

7
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,845
and the transport of particles and heat.

8
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,670
The former characterize 
uniform plasmas,

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,458
as you have seen in detail
in the first parts of this course.

10
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,269
But today we'll address the latter,

11
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:36,162
which characterize non-uniform plasmas.

12
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,294
In particular, we will look at 
how collisions determine transport

13
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:42,992
in real space of particles and heat.

14
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:46,846
We will start with a general discussion
on the <i>random walk</i>

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,178
and its relation to classical diffusion,

16
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:50,994
both as a general reminder,

17
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,375
and because this approach

18
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,515
will enable us to treat
the complex situation

19
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:00,101
of the magnetically confined
fusion plasmas, in a very simple way.

20
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:03,843
We'll prove that the heuristic 
random-walk model

21
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:06,114
does indeed correspond
to a diffusion process

22
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:09,388
in the case of an unmagnetized plasma.

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,365
And we will see how the plasma sets up
an intrinsic electric field

24
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:15,029
to maintain quasi-neutrality
called the <i>ambipolar field</i>

25
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:18,924
and how this later diffusion
that is equal for ions and electrons.

26
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:21,634
This is the so-called <i>ambipolar diffusion</i>.

27
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:25,060
We will treat the case 
of the magnetized plasmas

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,164
on the basis of the random-walk concepts,

29
00:01:27,164 --> 00:01:30,185
so a very simple mathematical treatment,

30
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:33,102
and we will distinguish
particle and heat transport,

31
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:36,251
and parallel and perpendicular directions

32
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:38,824
with respect to the ambient 
magnetic field.

33
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:42,219
Naturally, for a magnetized plasma

34
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:45,983
cross-field transport 
is the crucial element for confinement.

35
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:50,399
Just to start reminding ourselves
what a random walk is,

36
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:55,902
you can see here two simulations
of a 2D situation

37
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,826
in which we simulate on the left
the evolution of a single particle

38
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,168
which undertakes statistically 
independent steps.

39
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:07,812
Each step has the same size,

40
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:11,015
but of course in a different,
randomly chosen direction.

41
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,939
As opposed to the right-hand side

42
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:18,125
where you see a movie that simulates
the evolution of many particles

43
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:21,746
each of which undergoes a random walk.

44
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:25,583
So you can see the different steps
on the left,

45
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:29,682
and on the right, 
the spreading of a cloud

46
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:31,949
in a sense that represents

47
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:36,224
the spreading
of the initially close particles

48
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,845
under the influence of that random walk.

49
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,283
Although the average displacement is zero,

50
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:46,994
the mean square displacement
as we will see immediately

51
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,720
is actually non-zero,

52
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,119
and that's the crucial element
for assessing transport.

53
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:57,024
Having briefly seen 
the two-dimensional simulations

54
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:59,271
now we are ready for a very simple

55
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:02,923
one-dimensional calculation 
of the random walk.

56
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,504
Again, we consider 
statistically independent steps

57
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:10,838
ξi each of size ξ.

58
00:03:10,884 --> 00:03:13,118
So we can see what happens 
after N steps.

59
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:17,643
After N steps, the displacement

60
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:21,324
will be simply the sum 
of the steps undertaken.

61
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:27,015
The average displacement will be zero,

62
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:31,741
and average here means 
'taken over many possible random walks'.

63
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:34,569
It doesn't mean 'in time '
for the same particle.

64
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,949
But, as we said before,

65
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:43,545
the average of the square 
of the displacement is not zero.

66
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
And we'll evaluate it in a simple way.

67
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,697
It will be equal to the sum

68
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:56,328
of the average of the square
of each step

69
00:03:56,328 --> 00:04:00,410
plus the crossed terms.

70
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:06,844
But the crossed terms actually
do not contribute

71
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:10,323
because as we said, all the steps
are statistically independent.

72
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:13,829
Therefore the average of that product

73
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:16,080
is equal to the product 
of the two averages

74
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,580
which of course is zero.

75
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:25,164
So we only end up with N times

76
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:29,613
where N
is the number of steps undertaken

77
00:04:29,642 --> 00:04:33,408
times ξ² where ξ

78
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,683
is the size of each step.

79
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:40,003
If we define the inter-collision
time as τ

80
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:46,669
that means that the number of steps N

81
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,234
is equal to the total time 
divided by τ

82
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:54,650
we can evaluate 
the mean square displacement as follows:

83
00:04:56,245 --> 00:05:06,205
< x² > is equal to N ξ² = t/τ ξ²
<i>[ Note: x̅ = < x > ]</i>

84
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:09,322
which is equal to the typical 
squared velocity

85
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:16,466
averaged <v²> τ t.

86
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:20,716
And this product, <v²> τ

87
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:24,772
can be called 
D : <i>diffusion coefficient.</i>

88
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:33,494
So D = <v²> τ
as we have just defined,

89
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:39,355
or ξ² / τ

90
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:44,455
and that is even simpler conceptually

91
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:47,606
and also to apply 
to the different situations

92
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:52,496
because that means we have simply 
the product of the typical step size

93
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:57,324
in our random walk, squared,

94
00:05:58,294 --> 00:06:03,367
times a typical collision frequency

95
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:08,571
which is of course the inverse
of the intercollision time.

96
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,428
Here's the idea that we will apply
to much more complicated situations,

97
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,697
those that actually are needed
for fusion.

98
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:23,545
If we identify a characteristic time
or equivalently a collision frequency

99
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:27,634
and a typical step size 
in various situations we need to assess,

100
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:30,290
we can evaluate the diffusion coefficient.

101
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,371
For example, if we take electrons
that are colliding with ions

102
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:37,405
in a fully ionized plasma,

103
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:41,298
we can say the characteristic frequency
is that of the momentum exchange,

104
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:45,404
<νe/i> as you have seen 
in previous parts of the course.

105
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:49,649
I remind you that in this case
the average symbol indicates

106
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:53,883
an average over 
the Maxwellian distribution in the plasma.

107
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:56,658
And we have a step size

108
00:06:56,658 --> 00:07:00,487
that corresponds to the mean free path
for such collisions.

109
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,854
Mean free path is always one 
over the density of the targets

110
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:07,516
times the cross section for that process.

111
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:11,233
And that's corresponding
to the thermal speed

112
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:16,796
for the electrons, divided again 
by the characteristic frequency

113
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:19,195
for the momentum exchange,
average of the distribution.

114
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,723
So we get a simple evaluation
of the diffusion coefficient

115
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:28,130
which is the square of the thermal speed
for the electrons in this case,

116
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,676
divided by the effective 
collision frequency

117
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:32,359
for the exchange of momentum.

118
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:36,555
So this will help us 
in a number of situations.

119
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:39,761
The question is: can we verify,
at least in a simple case

120
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:41,013
that this approach works,

121
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:44,770
and that D has indeed
the meaning of a diffusion coefficient.

122
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,397
And I propose to do that in the case

123
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:52,438
of an unmagnetized steady-state plasma

124
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,488
with uniform temperature.

125
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,284
So as simple as we can get,

126
00:07:55,284 --> 00:08:01,264
but yet a typical case in which
we'll try to interpret D

127
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,923
as a real diffusion coefficient.

128
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,797
We start by the equation of motion
for electrons or ions.

129
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:16,231
So the mass times the acceleration
is of course equal to the electrical force

130
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:17,935
qj E,

131
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:23,922
plus the pressure force
which is -∇p

132
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:25,652
divided by the density [nj]

133
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:34,400
plus the friction term which is
minus the mass times the velocity

134
00:08:34,423 --> 00:08:37,987
times an effective collision frequency.

135
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,102
So this is my friction term.

136
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,609
I impose steady-state,
so no time derivatives,

137
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:49,519
I consider uniform temperature

138
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:51,588
for any species.

139
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:56,700
That means that ∇pj
is simply the temperature

140
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,089
times the gradient of the density [∇nj]

141
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:03,997
So with these assumptions,

142
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,175
I can evaluate my equation of motion,

143
00:09:08,023 --> 00:09:11,569
so no time derivative,
so that's zero on the left

144
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:17,475
equals to qj Ej, 
minus the pressure term

145
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:20,637
simplified for uniform temperatures,

146
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:23,839
and the friction term.

147
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:26,731
That means I can have

148
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:32,774
a steady-state velocity field,
which is vj,

149
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:37,795
that I can express with two terms:

150
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:41,304
the first term proportional 
to the electric field,

151
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:46,432
and the second term proportional
to the gradient of the density.

152
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,436
The first term has a coefficient
which is related to the mobility.

153
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:58,747
I say <i>related</i> because 
it's a pretty much the mobility

154
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:03,214
except the mobility [μj] is defined 
with an absolute value of the charge,

155
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:07,464
there is no sign,
as the charge in absolute value

156
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:09,348
divided by the mass

157
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:14,628
times the collision frequency, mj νj

158
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:19,184
The other term has a coefficient in front,

159
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:24,953
which is called the diffusion coefficient.

160
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:31,301
For the moment 
it's a relatively arbitrary definition

161
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,307
but we will converge towards
an inerpretation for both cases.

162
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:37,770
So that's Dj

163
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:45,084
which is the thermal speed
for species vj² divided by

164
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:47,037
the collision frequency once more.

165
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:52,382
Of course the thermal speed squared
is the ratio of the temperature

166
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:54,021
divided by the mass.

167
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:00,026
We note, as actually Einstein did,

168
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:08,636
that the ratio of the mobility coefficient
divided by the diffusion coefficent

169
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:14,031
is simply equal to the ratio
of the charge by the temperature.

170
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:18,341
the so-called <i>Einstein relation.</i>

171
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:24,962
Now we're interested in flux
which we call Γj

172
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,226
with species j.

173
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:31,479
That's the density times the velocity.

174
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:37,062
So we can use the expression 
with the velocity we have just found.

175
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:42,955
And we get nj
times the sign of the charge,

176
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:48,410
times µj, times electric field,

177
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:55,407
minus the diffusion coefficient,
times the gradient of the density.

178
00:11:56,246 --> 00:12:00,164
Now consider for a moment
zero electric field,

179
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:04,814
in this case we have Γj

180
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:08,638
the flux is equal to

181
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:13,482
the diffusion coefficient,
with a minus sign in front,

182
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,957
times the gradient of the density

183
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:17,983
This is the so-called <i>Fick's Law.</i>

184
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:22,871
It tells us that particles tend
to move down a density gradient,

185
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,445
which is a very general property 
of course.

186
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:28,359
Now we use the continuity equation

187
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:33,183
without sources or sinks.

188
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:40,525
So that's ∂nj/∂t
plus the divergence of the flux

189
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,991
for species j equal to zero,

190
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:49,888
and we use that to combine,

191
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:56,269
to be combined with the definition
of Γj or in fact with the result of Γj

192
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:00,930
as a function of the gradient
of the density.

193
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:06,814
So that we come to a final equation,
which will be the diffusion equation.

194
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:08,741
Let's do that.

195
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:17,230
Now I assume here that Dj is a constant

196
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,924
so that I can take it out 
of the differential operator.

197
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:30,113
This is just for the purpose of showing
the final result,

198
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:33,257
of course in real situations
this may not be the case.

199
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:37,081
And I get to the expression of

200
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:43,326
∂nj /∂t -Dj,
diffusion coefficient

201
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:49,424
times the second spatial derivative 
of the density, equals zero.

202
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:50,997
What do I have here?

203
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:54,375
I have a diffusion equation.

204
00:13:55,896 --> 00:14:01,013
So we have confirmed that at least
in this simple case as an illustration,

205
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:03,719
this coefficient D indeed

206
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,496
<i>is</i> a diffusion coefficient

207
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:09,547
because it's the coefficient that appears
in a diffusion equation

208
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:13,561
for the density of the plasma species j.

209
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,436
Now a further consideration is that,

210
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:19,936
plasmas tend to be quasi-neutral.

211
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:22,773
In other words, the density 
of electrons and ions

212
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:25,726
- presumed singularly 
charged -

213
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:29,410
for simplicity, have to be equal.

214
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,478
So that means that the fluxes
need to be equal for electrons and ions,

215
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,681
or quasi-neutrality
will not be maintained.

216
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:43,574
And in general, diffusion coefficients
-as the mobilities- are different

217
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:45,484
for ions and electrons,
so what happens?

218
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,893
What can the plasma do?

219
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:49,821
The plasma in fact, 
will set up an electric field

220
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,243
that will tend to slow down 
the faster of the two species

221
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:58,856
and accelerate the slower
of the two species

222
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:02,461
so that actually, the two fluxes
will be balanced.

223
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:08,123
This is a general property in the plasma,
we'll derive it here,

224
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:13,031
specifically for the case 
of unmagnetized plasmas or B₀ = 0

225
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:15,020
because it is simpler.

226
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:20,002
So we assume equal densities again
for ions and electrons,

227
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,469
we call it n.

228
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:24,229
Let's write the fluxes.

229
00:15:26,773 --> 00:15:32,865
For the ions, Γi is mobility of the ions
[μi] n times the electric field.

230
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:36,425
Of course electric field is common
between two species,

231
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:38,386
is a property of the plasma as a whole,

232
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:41,055
minus the diffusion term [Di ∇n].

233
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:46,437
That has to be equal to Γe for electrons,

234
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:49,123
which is minus µe.

235
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:52,685
Remember that the mobility 
was defined with no sign,

236
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,767
so I have to put a minus sign here,
times electric field

237
00:15:55,767 --> 00:16:00,356
minus the <i>Fick's Law</i>,
if you like, term,

238
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:01,855
that is the diffusion term.

239
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:04,811
So the two have to be equal,

240
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:10,143
that means I can extract the value 
of the electric field for that to happen,

241
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,371
which is simply the difference between
the diffusion coefficients [Di-De]

242
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:19,096
divided by the sum of the mobilities,
[μi + μe]

243
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:24,711
times ∇n / n.

244
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,322
So we have a flux that will be common
for both species,

245
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:32,966
that I can evaluate

246
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:38,199
by replacing the electric field
that we have just found

247
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:39,843
in the expression

248
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:42,672
for one of the two fluxes that I have
for ions and electrons.

249
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:45,011
It's equivalent because of course
they have to be the same.

250
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:48,354
Let's take Γe for example,

251
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:52,526
so I have -µe n E

252
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:56,194
- De ∇n

253
00:16:56,827 --> 00:17:00,006
and I replace the value of E
that we have just found.

254
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:07,172
This is my electric field, 
a diffusion term

255
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:10,903
and I simply do
a simple calculation here.

256
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:14,076
Everything will be multiplied
times the ∇n

257
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,816
so I put that on the right,

258
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:17,413
and I have the different terms,

259
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:24,585
-µi Di + µe De

260
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:32,617
- µi De - µe De .

261
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:36,716
There are two terms that drop

262
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:44,444
and I'm left with something like
minus sign in front,

263
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,847
a combination of mobilities
and diffusion coefficients,

264
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:54,501
µi De + µe Di divided by the sum
of the mobilities,

265
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:56,594
times the gradient of n.

266
00:17:56,594 --> 00:17:58,816
Now I notice that this is a flux

267
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,073
which is proportional with the minus sign

268
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:03,268
to the gradient of n,
so that means

269
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:06,197
that the term that's in front
of the gradient of n

270
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:10,087
is also a diffusion coefficient,

271
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:14,967
is a new diffusion coefficient
we call <i>ambipolar Da</i>

272
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,965
and this diffusion coefficient 
is a combination

273
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:20,920
of the different terms 
from ions and electrons,

274
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:25,339
it is a consequence of the electric field
which we also call <i>ambipolar</i>

275
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,966
that was set up by the plasma

276
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:29,675
in order to maintain equal fluxes
for the different species

277
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,591
and therefore, quasi-neutrality.

278
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:34,741
Generally, we can notice that

279
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:39,966
the mobility of the electrons is
much larger than that of the ions

280
00:18:40,513 --> 00:18:44,611
so we can simplify the expression
for the ambipolar diffusion coefficient,

281
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:50,662
and get a feeling for its dependences.

282
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:56,702
So it's µi Di + µi De
and then denominator.

283
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,827
I neglect the ion mobility

284
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:04,393
and that's equal to simply 
the ion diffusion coefficient

285
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,908
plus the ratio of the two mobilities:

286
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:11,260
µi / µe times the electron 
diffusion coefficient

287
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,111
And if I remember the Einstein relations

288
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:18,615
that relate mobility
and diffusion coefficients,

289
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,428
I can express this as Di

290
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:29,125
plus the temperature ratio, Te/Ti Di

291
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:34,344
And if the temperatures are similar,

292
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:39,637
that is simply two times 
the ion diffusion coefficients.

293
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:42,234
That is to say that, in general,

294
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:49,428
we can say that Di is the smallest 
of all diffusion coefficients.

295
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:52,553
The ambipolar diffusion coefficient
will be larger than that

296
00:19:52,553 --> 00:19:57,496
but it will still be significantly lower
than the electron diffusion coefficient.

297
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:02,176
So that means that 
-as we anticipated intuitively-,

298
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:06,260
the plasma is setting up electric fields
so that the diffusion of both species

299
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,560
will occur at a rate
which will be larger than the ions,

300
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,566
larger than that that the ions 
would have naturally, should I say,

301
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:17,801
and lower than that of the electrons,

302
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,344
or again that the electrons 
would have naturally

303
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,832
in the absence of any plasma effect.

304
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:27,508
Let's go now to the case 
that interests us the most,

305
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:30,035
that is the case of a magnetized plasma,

306
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:33,357
which is the case of fusion plasmas.

307
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:36,746
What we have verified together
is that the simple approach

308
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,856
of taking a diffusion coefficient

309
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:42,335
which is simply the product 
of a typical step size square

310
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:45,426
times a typical frequency
makes sense.

311
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:48,061
With only the caveat
we have just found

312
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:50,002
that there may be 
an ambipolar electric field

313
00:20:50,002 --> 00:20:52,409
to set equal fluxes 
for the different species.

314
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,601
But in general we can actually attempt

315
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:59,510
evaluating the transport 
by the diffusion coefficient,

316
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,439
evaluated in this very simple way.

317
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,704
We notice that in the presence
of a magnetic field

318
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:07,756
we of course have different directions.

319
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:10,226
We don't have 
an isotropic situation anymore.

320
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:13,032
We have the direction along the field,

321
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:16,324
for which the dynamics 
will be very similar to the case

322
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:18,188
of unmagnetized plasmas,

323
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:21,684
except perhaps that the ambipolar field,

324
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:26,924
and therefore the diffusion,
may be generated in a more complicated way

325
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:29,846
which will depend 
on the specific 3D configuration.

326
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:32,031
We will not go into that kind of detail

327
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:34,915
but we just noticed 
that there will be ambipolarity,

328
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:37,015
so this setting up
of an electric field,

329
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:40,630
but it will be more complicated
than the simple, say,

330
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,342
1D case that we have
illustrated together.

331
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:46,499
Across the magnetic field

332
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,776
is the more interesting direction 
for confinement.

333
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:53,631
We are setting up a magnetic cage
to trap the plasma

334
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:54,740
to make fusion happen

335
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,008
and of course a plasma 
via transport phenomena

336
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:03,546
will tend to go, given the rate
across the magnetic field

337
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:06,622
and that's something 
we really need to keep under control.

338
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:10,579
To go across the field,
collisions are necessary.

339
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,019
At least to go over distances
that are larger than particle orbits.

340
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:15,771
So let's play the game in which we try

341
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:18,069
to identify the step size
and the frequency,

342
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:22,627
and therefore evaluating 
the diffusion coefficient in a simple way.

343
00:22:23,184 --> 00:22:24,860
What is the typical step size?

344
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:30,444
So we have particles that undergo
their gyro motion,

345
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,177
and this particle will probably encounter
another particle,

346
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:40,613
with a different trajectory

347
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:44,089
that will come maybe 
from another direction.

348
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:48,636
And what happens when we have a collision
between the two particles?

349
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,610
There will be for the orange particle
sort of a jump in its orbit,

350
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:00,292
in this direction,

351
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:03,520
and for the blue particle,
it will be jumping the orbit

352
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,620
in the other direction.

353
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,620
So the displacement,

354
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:12,859
that will be taken typically
upon such a collision,

355
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:18,964
will be of the order 
of the Larmor orbit size, ρL.

356
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:23,359
We are evaluating 
orders of magnitude of course,

357
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,763
we don't pretend to be very precise
in this evaluation

358
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:29,290
but it's very important to give 
a typical step size

359
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,337
for this concept of diffusion coefficient.

360
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:34,223
So a typical step size is therefore

361
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:38,754
the <i>Larmor orbit</i> for different particles.

362
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:42,728
So we identify that,
and the next question of course is

363
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:44,724
<i>what is the characteristic frequency?</i>

364
00:23:47,437 --> 00:23:50,934
Now we are considering
the transport of particles.

365
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:56,272
So the characteristic frequency here
is that for the transfer or momentum.

366
00:23:56,272 --> 00:23:57,438
But we notice one thing,

367
00:23:57,438 --> 00:24:01,555
we need to consider 
only unlike particle collisions.

368
00:24:01,714 --> 00:24:05,223
Because the collisions 
among like particles

369
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:09,888
will only lead to a swap in the position
of their respective guiding centers,

370
00:24:09,888 --> 00:24:11,312
therefore no net transport.

371
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:14,708
So those actually don't contribute 
to any transport at all.

372
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:20,264
The end result 
of this very simple reasoning

373
00:24:20,264 --> 00:24:23,306
is that we have a diffusion coefficient
that can be evaluated.

374
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:26,114
For example for the electrons,
and this perpendicular sign indicates,

375
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:30,862
of course, that we're talking about
the direction across the magnetic field.

376
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:32,995
So that's the typical step size,

377
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:36,410
the Larmor radius for electrons squared,

378
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:41,758
times the frequency 
for the exchange of momentum

379
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:45,953
between different species
or between unlike particles.

380
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:50,069
Similarly for the ions
we get the ion Larmor radius

381
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:52,945
and the frequency 
for the exchange in momentum

382
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:55,078
between ions and electrons,
the other way around.

383
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:59,358
If we say that the plasma 
is at the thermodynamic equilibrium

384
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:03,152
for example with two temperatures
for ions and electrons that are similar,

385
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:07,836
then the perpendicular 
diffusion coefficients are also similar

386
00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:12,558
because actually the effective 
collision frequency difference

387
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,390
compensates the difference
between the two Larmor radii.

388
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:19,798
So in that case, in fact we don't need,

389
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:22,337
or the plasma does not need,
to set up an ambipolar field

390
00:25:22,337 --> 00:25:23,768
to get equal fluxes.

391
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:27,627
So we have a situation in which there's 
a so-called ambipolarity,

392
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,192
in a natural way.

393
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,758
I also notice, although 
we will not demonstrate that explicitly,

394
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:35,800
that a diffusion equation that's similar
to that for particles

395
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,412
is valid for heat.

396
00:25:38,698 --> 00:25:40,668
So here's a diffusion equation
for heat.

397
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:47,307
The variable here is the temperature,
and we have a coefficient χ

398
00:25:47,307 --> 00:25:51,893
which plays exactly the same role
as D for particles.

399
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:54,084
It's called the <i>heat diffusivity.</i>

400
00:25:54,197 --> 00:25:56,389
And in this case, as we have done before,

401
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,151
I assumed that to be a constant

402
00:25:58,151 --> 00:26:00,994
so I could take it out 
of the differential operator.

403
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:05,140
χ has the same characteristics as D

404
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:10,932
and can also be obtained 
from identifying a typical step size

405
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:14,141
and a characteristic frequency,
or a typical collision time.

406
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:17,098
We have said together
that the typical step size

407
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:19,931
is the Larmor radius,
just like for D.

408
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:22,264
What is the characteristic frequency?

409
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,645
Well, it will be the frequency 
of Coulomb collisions

410
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:27,079
like in the previous case,

411
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:29,711
but for heat transport,

412
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:31,631
it would be that 
for the transfer of energy

413
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,540
as opposed to for
the transfer of momentum.

414
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:36,468
That's the difference number one.

415
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:38,862
the difference number two
is that for heat transport,

416
00:26:38,862 --> 00:26:41,328
actually collisions between <i>all</i> particles,

417
00:26:41,328 --> 00:26:44,568
and not only unlike particles,
contribute to diffusion.

418
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:48,018
We don't care which particles collide

419
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:50,762
as long as they transfer energy.

420
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:54,909
So there is no effect leading
to a zero net transport

421
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:56,849
if particles are identical.

422
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,023
So that means that the evaluation
of the diffusion coefficient,

423
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:02,536
although based on the same principle,

424
00:27:02,536 --> 00:27:07,287
is somewhat different
in quantitative terms.

425
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,928
Let's consider both directions
along the magnetic field

426
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,581
and across the magnetic field.

427
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:15,757
Along the magnetic field,
χ‖e,

428
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:19,409
for electrons will be the thermal speed
for the electrons squared,

429
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:23,779
divided by the sum 
of the relevant collision frequencies,

430
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:27,718
again for the exchange of energy
which I call <νE> as you have done

431
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:29,794
in the first part of the course,

432
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:33,755
electron and ions 
or electrons and electrons.

433
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:38,753
And that corresponds
to a constant of order of one,

434
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:44,515
times the square of the thermal speed
divided by the collision frequency

435
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:47,571
for momentum exchange,
which we normally refer to.

436
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:50,984
For the ions, 
it will be something very similar,

437
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,505
except of course that there will be 
the collision frequency

438
00:27:55,112 --> 00:27:59,481
between ions here 
and the ion thermal speed squared.

439
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,296
And we can notice by simply looking 
at these two expressions

440
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:06,656
that the parallel heat transfer
will be dominated by electrons,

441
00:28:06,656 --> 00:28:09,663
in other words, electrons
we contribute to the transport

442
00:28:09,663 --> 00:28:16,234
along the magnetic field of heat,
in a much, much larger proportion

443
00:28:16,234 --> 00:28:20,002
because of the much, much larger value
of the thermal speed,

444
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:22,388
for similar temperatures
than that of the ions.

445
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:27,612
Let's look at the direction 
across the magnetic field.

446
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:29,980
We do the exact same reasoning,

447
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:34,157
considering the appropriate 
collision frequencies

448
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:35,781
and we get something for the electrons

449
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:39,068
that's of the order -

450
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:41,576
although there's a factor here

451
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:45,787
of ρLe² times the collision frequency

452
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:47,257
for the momentum exchange.

453
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:51,555
So it's not very different
from the diffusion of particles.

454
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:56,818
And for the ions, again,
it's something that refers

455
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:01,125
to the collision frequency
between ions and ions.

456
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:05,109
But because the Larmor radius 
of the ions is so much larger

457
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:06,765
than that of the electrons,

458
00:29:06,765 --> 00:29:10,537
the perpendicular heat transfer
will be dominated by the ions,

459
00:29:10,537 --> 00:29:15,041
so the opposite situation to that
of the parallel heat transport.

460
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:18,036
In summary, in this lecture 
we have gone back

461
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:19,799
to some of the basics of plasma physics

462
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,668
to study the classical transfer mechanisms
in fusion plasma.

463
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,198
We have see
the classical diffusion results

464
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,497
from the random walk
of ions or electrons,

465
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:32,077
that undergo Coulomb collisions,

466
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:34,372
that is collisions dictated by 
the electric field.

467
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:38,628
In the presence of 
a background magnetic field,

468
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:40,776
the transport across this field

469
00:29:40,838 --> 00:29:44,789
is dictated by the size 
of the Larmor orbits of the particles.

470
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,150
We have seen that
the transport along the field

471
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,417
is dominated by the electrons

472
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:52,030
while the transport across the field
is dominated by the ions.

473
00:29:53,211 --> 00:29:56,170
In the next lecture, we'll compare
the predictions of this classical theory

474
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,719
with the experimental data
from fusion devices,

475
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:03,165
and we'll discuss how we can actually 
go beyond the classical paradigm

476
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:05,405
and explain the experimental data,

477
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:10,179
and what are the transport mechanisms
that actually play in the fusion devices.
