00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,204
In this last lecture of the course

2
00:00:02,204 --> 00:00:04,136
we aim at providing a complete overview

3
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:06,540
of the basic issues we're facing
to doing fusion on Earth

4
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:09,535
and on the possible solutions
we are progressively implementing

5
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:11,363
to achieve the burning plasma regime

6
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:13,384
and to construct a reactor.

7
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:17,241
As most parts of this course,
this lecture, which lasts two weeks,

8
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:20,365
and is taught together by myself
and by Dr. [inaudible],

9
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:22,906
an expert of Tokamak physics,

10
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:25,171
will be a mix of formal
mathematical derivation

11
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:27,109
and more qualitative presentations.

12
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:30,453
We will focus on the magnetic
confinement approach

13
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:33,951
and illustrate the different
magnetic confinement schemes

14
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,491
that are considered for reactors,

15
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:40,094
but we will concentrate
on the most promising scheme so far:

16
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:42,050
the Tokamak.

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,308
We discuss its main elements,

18
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:46,853
the macroscopic plasma equilibrium in it,

19
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:48,945
and its operational limits.

20
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:53,889
With a brief flashback to some
of the basic properties of plasmas,

21
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:56,396
we will study the transport
of particles and heat

22
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:58,552
across the confining magnetic fields.

23
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:03,271
We will find that in Tokamaks, turbulence
dominates other collisional effects

24
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,715
and illustrate how we
can partially defeat it

25
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:08,350
to obtain advantageous
high-confinement regimes.

26
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:11,827
Having clarified how
we keep the plasma stable

27
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:13,822
in a Tokamak magnetic cage,

28
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:16,521
we will examine how we can heat it
to thermonuclear temperatures

29
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:18,965
using neutron beams and waves.

30
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:20,730
The very different frequency ranges

31
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,013
related to the dynamics
of electrons and ions

32
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:25,841
imply not only diverse physical
mechanisms for the heating

33
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:27,805
but also different technologies,

34
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:30,537
which we will briefly touch upon.

35
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:33,939
Finally, we will illustrate a so-called
<i>burning plasma regime</i>

36
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:37,474
in which the plasma will produce
significant amounts of fusion power,

37
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:40,846
and we will illustrate
the road map to fusion energy.

38
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:44,092
We go from the present
experimental device to ITER,

39
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:45,669
currently under construction,

40
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:49,314
which will demonstrate the scientific
and technological feasibility of fusion

41
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:53,928
and demo the step following ITER,
which aims at proving

42
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:56,622
that the commercial deployment
of fusion is possible.
