00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:09,435
Welcome to the course on plasma physics 
and applications to fusion energy,

2
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:11,387
astrophysics, and industry.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,137
My name is Duccio Testa 
and in this lecture,

4
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:17,004
we will discuss the tokamak concept.

5
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:20,909
We will start with the main elements 
and properties of a tokamak.

6
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:23,838
We'll look first at the magnetic field 
and plasma current,

7
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:27,748
then at plasma shaping, 
after the safety factor,

8
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:30,130
and then at the equilibrium in a tokamak.

9
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:34,459
We'll then describe briefly 
the largest tokamak

10
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:38,099
currently operating in the world,
which is the JET tokamak in England

11
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:42,850
and then we'll conclude this lecture with 
a few words on the spherical tokamaks.

12
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:48,497
In this drawing here, we see 
a sketch of the tokamak

13
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:50,317
and of it's main elements.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,773
The first element we need to talk 
about is the toroidal field coil.

15
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:59,247
It's this structure here 
and as it's name indicates

16
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:02,359
the toroidal field coils
produce the toroidal field

17
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,546
that goes in the toroidal direction.

18
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:10,982
There is a current that flows in the coil 
so the field is along the toroidal angle.

19
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:15,819
The second element that we need 
to discuss is the method

20
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:18,027
to produce the plasma current.

21
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:21,096
We do this by a transformer action.

22
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:26,058
What we do, we drive a current 
in the inner poloidal field coils.

23
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:28,993
These are these green structures here.

24
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,961
This is the primary of 
the transformer circuit.

25
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:39,117
The plasma itself, this pink element here,
is in fact the secondary

26
00:01:39,117 --> 00:01:43,591
of the transformer itself.
So by producing a flux ring

27
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:46,353
to the inner poloidal field coils

28
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:49,141
changing the current, 
ramping up and down the current,

29
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:52,476
in the inner poloidal field coils,
an electric field is driven

30
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:54,129
in the toroidal direction,

31
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:56,281
which produces the plasma current.

32
00:01:57,147 --> 00:02:00,591
The plasma current produces 
the poloidal magnetic field.

33
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:05,915
The resulting magnetic field is helical,
because we have a toroidal field

34
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:08,834
in the toroidal direction,
and the poloidal field.

35
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:15,065
And we see here in black
the helical path of the field line.

36
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,658
We have then the third element 
is this grey structure

37
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:23,653
that are wound around the tokamak: 
these are the outer poloidal field coils

38
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:28,790
and these are used to control the 
plasma position and the plasma shaping.

39
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,042
Now let's explain in more details 
the geometry of a tokamak

40
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:36,489
and we will use this drawing here.

41
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:42,661
A tokamak is in fact a cylinder 
with its ends folded up together.

42
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:48,778
So we have two angles: the first is 
the toroidal angle Ф

43
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:54,427
that goes in the plane on the cylinder 
and then we have the poloidal angle, θ

44
00:02:54,427 --> 00:02:58,444
that describes the plane perpendicular 
to the toroidal angle Ф.

45
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,985
Then we can describe the tokamak geometry
using effectively

46
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:06,114
two systems of coordinates.

47
00:03:06,114 --> 00:03:09,802
The first one is a quasi-Cartesian
coordinate system

48
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:15,645
(R, Z, Ф), are the coordinates 
along the radial direction [R],

49
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:19,838
Z the vertical coordinate,
Ф the toroidal angle

50
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:27,009
or we can use quasi-cylindrical 
coordinate (r,θ,Ф) ,

51
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:30,629
r is the radius [measured form the center]
of the poloidal cross-section,

52
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,992
θ is the poloidal angle 
and Ф is again the toroidal angle.

53
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:42,622
You have two main quantities, 
R₀ is the <i>major radius</i> of the tokamak,

54
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,845
and then if we consider the last surface 
in the poloidal cross-section

55
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:52,879
it has a radius a, 
this is the <i>minor radius</i>

56
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:59,446
and the ratio between R₀ and a
is called the <i>aspect ratio</i> of the tokamak.

57
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:03,985
Now here again is a sketch of a tokamak.

58
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:07,856
Let's look at the radial dependence 
of the toroidal field

59
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:10,003
and of the plasma current.

60
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:13,184
Remember, the toroidal field is 
produced by the toroidal field coil,

61
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:17,790
this structure that is wound around 
the poloidal cross-section.

62
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,740
Current flows in this structure 
and therefore the toroidal field

63
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,504
has 1/R dependence.

64
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:30,669
The toroidal field is higher at 
the center of the tokamak

65
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,795
and this is lower towards the 
outer boundary of the tokamak.

66
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:36,290
This allows us to define 
the high-field side

67
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,551
and the low-field side of 
the plasma cross-section

68
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,254
Obviously, the toroidal field is higher

69
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:47,290
in this region of the plasma: this is 
the <i>high-field side</i>, and is lower

70
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,717
in the outer region of the plasma:
this is the <i>low-field side</i>.

71
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:56,246
Now what about the plasma current?

72
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,770
In a typical tokamak, 
the plasma temperature is peaked

73
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,076
at the center of 
the poloidal cross-section.

74
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:09,685
So if we describe-- if you look at 
the radial coordinate R,

75
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,719
goes in this direction, this would be 
the center of the poloidal cross-section.

76
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:22,492
The plasma temperature T is 
peaked in the center.

77
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:27,054
We know that the resistivity
has an inverse dependence

78
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:30,881
on the plasma temperature, 
so the resistivity is smaller

79
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,358
at the center
of the poloidal cross-section.

80
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:37,862
And this tells us
that the plasma current is larger

81
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:41,997
where the temperature is larger 
because this is where

82
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:43,764
the plasma resistivity is smaller.

83
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,368
This obviously is
the typical tokamak situation.

84
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:50,334
There are different methods

85
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:53,594
to produce the plasma current
and therefore we may end up

86
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:56,415
with a slightly different profile of J.

87
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,979
Now let's look at plasma shaping.

88
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:04,541
In particular, plasma shaping is produced 
by the outer poloidal field coils,

89
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:08,163
so we start from a superposition
of magnetic fields produced by coils

90
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:10,663
and by the plasma current.

91
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:14,451
These outer poloidal field coils 
that are labeled P2, P3, P4,

92
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:19,275
in fact are used to control 
the radial position of the plasma,

93
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:23,016
the vertical position of the plasma 
and produce plasma shaping.

94
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,389
And here we see two examples
of possible plasma shaping.

95
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,116
The first one: if we produce 
a quadropole field

96
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:34,895
using the outer poloidal, the coil, 
then the quadrupole field

97
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:41,350
elongates the plasma and depending on 
the polarity plus on top and bottom,

98
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:45,045
minus minus, left and right, 
then we have a plasma

99
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:47,350
that is elongated in 
the horizontal direction.

100
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:53,270
If we invert the polarity minus 
on top and bottom, plus left and right,

101
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:57,552
then we elongate our plasma 
in the vertical direction.

102
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:01,839
If we have a hexapole magnetic field 
then we have a plasma

103
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,897
that tends to have a more 
triangular cross-section

104
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:11,847
and this is an example taking 
this polarity of the fields

105
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,976
produced by the outer 
poloidal field coils.

106
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,149
We have a plasma that it triangular 
toward the right.

107
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:22,677
Plasma shaping is very important 
because it is one of the possible methods

108
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:27,636
that we have to control instabilities 
and to optimize the performance

109
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,336
of a fusion reactor.

110
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:34,083
Here in Lausanne, we have a tokamak, 
the TCV tokamak.

111
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:38,200
Its acronym stands for
<i>Tokamak à Configuration Variable</i>.

112
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,619
It's a tokamak that is optimized 
for the study of plasma shaping.

113
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,678
Here we see a sketch
of the TCV tokamak

114
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:49,624
and here are some examples
of the plasma shapes

115
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:51,621
that we have obtained on TCV.

116
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:54,569
TCV is optimized for the study
of plasma shaping

117
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:57,663
because we have a large number 
our outer poloidal field coils

118
00:07:57,663 --> 00:08:04,631
as indicated by these pink structures 
on the left and right of our plasma

119
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:09,066
and we see that by changing 
the current and the polarity

120
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:14,894
of these coils then we realize 
an incredible number of plasma shapes.

121
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:18,544
We start from plasmas that are
rather elongated

122
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:22,191
and sort of a quasi-triangular at 
top of the machine,

123
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:26,109
-this configuration here- to plasmas
that are really triangular

124
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:28,594
towards the bottom,
again at top of the machine,

125
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:32,825
plasmas that are basically like a 
droplet at top of the machine,

126
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:35,268
or like a droplet
at bottom of the machine.

127
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,081
So here there is really a huge range
of plasma shapes that can be obtained.

128
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:43,703
Now let's look at the MHD equilibrium 
in a tokamak.

129
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:47,043
Just as a reminder the MHD equilibrium 
is basically given by

130
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:51,326
the force balance condition, 
j x B = ∇p.

131
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:56,875
What this condition tells us
is that we have nested flux surfaces

132
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:01,047
that coincide with isobaric surfaces 
on which the current flows.

133
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:03,423
Here we have a sketch

134
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:10,069
of these flux surfaces that are indicated 
in blue along the toroidal direction

135
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:16,850
and we can label these flux surfaces 
by the value of the magnetic flux ψ

136
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,379
that is captured by these surfaces.

137
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:26,560
We have an element that tells us 
the confinement efficiency: this is β.

138
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,580
β is the ratio between 
the plasma pressure nT

139
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,497
and the magnetic field pressure 
or B² / 2 µ₀

140
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:38,314
We can express 
the MDH equilibrium condition

141
00:09:38,314 --> 00:09:42,719
as an average over flux surfaces and 
express it in terms of the poloidal flux.

142
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,803
This leads us to 
the <i>Grad-Shafranov</i> equation

143
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:47,634
that we will see in the next slide.

144
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:52,226
So let's look again at these two figures 
to understand the poloidal fluxes.

145
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:55,781
In the top figure, the flux 
that you are looking at

146
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:58,528
goes along the toroidal direction

147
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:02,147
so is the flux of the magnetic field 
along the toroidal direction

148
00:10:02,147 --> 00:10:06,751
that is captured by a surface 
in the poloidal plane

149
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,416
and this would be the toroidal flux.

150
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:13,110
The poloidal flux is 
actually the opposite.

151
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,250
The poloidal flux ψp is the flux 
that is captured

152
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:24,317
on a poloidal surface AP that is limited 
by a boundary Kt

153
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,893
that it's in the toroidal direction.

154
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:33,215
We express the Grad-Shafranov equation 
in terms of the poloidal flux ψp

155
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:37,967
because for the solution of 
the Grad-Shafranov equation

156
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:42,340
we use measurements of magnetic fields
and fluxes at the plasma edge

157
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,923
and what these measurements are 
are measurements of poloidal fluxes,

158
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:50,396
so this is why we express 
the Grad-Shafranov equation

159
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,393
in terms of the poloidal flux.

160
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:56,731
Here we have the Grad-Shafranov equation.

161
00:10:56,731 --> 00:11:00,328
Basically again it starts by the usually 
equilibrium condition

162
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:02,470
j x B = ▽p

163
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,656
the equation is here on the top line.

164
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:12,907
We see that it is a very complicated 
equation that has an operator ∆*.

165
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:15,798
This is an equation 
in terms of the poloidal flux

166
00:11:15,798 --> 00:11:21,268
ψ(R,Z) [subscript omitted for simplicity] 
which contains two functions:

167
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:24,342
the derivative p' 
of a pressure p( ψ(R,Z) )

168
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:29,267
and a slightly more complicated function 
F( ψ(R,Z) ) and its derivative F',

169
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:33,885
F we can say is a functional 
of the toroidal field,

170
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:36,970
BФ and F is a function of the flux.

171
00:11:37,515 --> 00:11:40,765
This operator ∆*, 
we see contains

172
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:45,939
second order derivatives 
with respect to the R and Z coordinates.

173
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:50,364
So this turns out to be
an elliptical equation in the flux

174
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:54,016
of two functions p and p',

175
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:57,809
F and F' that are both function 
of the magnetic flux,

176
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:00,095
specifically of the poloidal flux.

177
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:06,287
Since we have a derivative, 
we need boundary conditions

178
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:09,763
and these boundary conditions are provided 
by measurements of the poloidal

179
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:13,581
and radial magnetic field and the fluxes
at the plasma edge.

180
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,335
For the solution, we start with
an initial guess for the pressure [p],

181
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:22,868
and the F function that we provide 
as a function of the flux,

182
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,852
and using constraints 
on this solution.

183
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:29,044
The constraints are provided
by measurements

184
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:31,144
of the plasma pressure profile,

185
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:34,856
by measurements of the profile 
of the pitch of the magnetic field lines,

186
00:12:34,856 --> 00:12:39,584
and those measurements must be 
expressed in terms of ψ,

187
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:42,250
i.e. fitted to flux functions.

188
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:46,096
What we show here in this graph
is an example of a solution

189
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:48,027
of the Grad-Shafranov equation.

190
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:52,802
Again, this orange structure here

191
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:57,281
are the cross-sections of the coils 
that are used to produce the fields

192
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:59,700
and shape the plasma 
and control it's position.

193
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,895
These black triangles here,- we see 
we have many around the poloidal

194
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:08,623
cross-section of the plasma-

195
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:12,630
indicate the positions of 
the coils and flux loops

196
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,005
that are used to measure 
the magnetic field fluxes

197
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,176
that provide the constraints 
to the solution

198
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:19,821
of the Grad-Shafranov equation.

199
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,365
The solution, as we see here,

200
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:25,174
is expressed in terms
of equilibrium flux surfaces.

201
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:28,912
These are equidistant contours
of constant pressure and magnetic flux.

202
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:34,069
Using this graph we can define 
a few quantities.

203
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:38,198
First, we can look at the center
of the outermost flux surface.

204
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:41,693
This surface is described by this red line

205
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:43,950
and we see that the center is here.

206
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:49,139
The position of the center
of the outermost flux surface

207
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,460
is the magnetic axis.

208
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:55,711
What we see is that if we look, for 
instance, at the innermost flux surface,

209
00:13:55,711 --> 00:14:01,649
the innermost circle here, 
the center of the innermost flux surface

210
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:05,309
does not coincide with the center 
of the outermost flux surface.

211
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,540
There is a shift and this is called 
the <i>Shafranov shift</i>.

212
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,660
It is the radial displacement of 
the center of each surface,

213
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,813
with respect to the magnetic axis.

214
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:18,807
What we also note is that flux surfaces 
are more closely spaced

215
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,794
on the low field side of the plasma.

216
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:25,165
Now we can look at the typical
equilibrium profiles in tokamak

217
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:29,918
and we take a real case is a discharge 
from the JET tokamak

218
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:33,355
and we look at the profile
at one particular time point.

219
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:38,885
First, in a tokamak, the equilibrium 
is 2D axisymmetric

220
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:42,925
and for usual operating conditions

221
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:48,307
the pressure, p, the toroidal current jФ, 
typically peak on the magnetic axis.

222
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,029
The toroidal field, the BФ, we've seen 
already as 1/R dependence

223
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,492
and the ratio between the poloidal 
and the toroidal field varies

224
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:04,487
from 0.1 to 0.25 by going from 
the high field side to the low field side.

225
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:08,936
The poloidal field is zero 
on the magnetic axis.

226
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:11,991
So here we have a graph
on these quantities.

227
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:14,197
In blue is the toroidal field,

228
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:16,705
larger on high field side of the plasma,

229
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:19,403
smaller on the low field side 
of the plasma.

230
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:23,575
The plasma pressure is indicated 
with the black line.

231
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:26,870
We see it's peaked at the plasma center

232
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:30,644
and this one has a really a wide profile.

233
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:36,107
This is the toroidal current density
J in green, again peaked

234
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:41,632
at the plasma center 
and the poloidal field, Bθ,

235
00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:46,217
is indicated in red. It changes sign 
by going through the magnetic axis

236
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:48,702
because the poloidal field,
if you move around

237
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:53,996
the poloidal cross-section, obviously 
goes up on the low-field side

238
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:58,523
and then goes down on the high-field side,

239
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:01,552
so it changes sign by going 
through the magnetic axis.

240
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:06,334
Now there's just one more element 
that allows us to fully describe

241
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,134
the tokamak: it is the<i> safety factor</i>.

242
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:12,083
We remember that the field lines 
follow a helical path

243
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:16,455
around the toroidal direction
and we see this line here

244
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,219
describes the field line.

245
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:21,627
So we can find the pitch angle
of the magnetic field line:

246
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:24,867
it is the ratio between the poloidal field
and the toroidal field.

247
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:29,420
Then by using the pitch angle 
we can define the safety factor

248
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,813
and we can take an approximation 
for a large aspect ratio tokamak,

249
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:40,114
it means that R₀, the major radius 
is much larger than a,

250
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,822
the minor radius, and we can take 
this condition as averaged

251
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:45,290
over flux surfaces.

252
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:49,593
The safety factor, q, becomes only 
a function of r,

253
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:52,291
the minor radius of 
the poloidal cross-section

254
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,813
and we see that it depends
on r/R₀ ,

255
00:16:55,813 --> 00:17:00,130
the major radius, and is the ratio between
the toroidal and the poloidal field.

256
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:04,833
The importance of the safety factor is
that it is a measure of the plasma current

257
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:10,738
contained within the radius r
and in particular at the plasma edge

258
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:16,321
when r = a, the minor radius, 
the safety factor is inversely proportional

259
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:18,915
to the total plasma current, Ip.

260
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,858
The safety factor is 
very important in tokamaks

261
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,365
because there is a link with 
the plasma stability.

262
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,038
In fact, we find that 
in tokamak instabilities

263
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:31,912
are generally associated with 
rational values of the safety factor.

264
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,085
It's a resonance condition between 
the perturbation of the magnetic field

265
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:40,869
and the pitch angle
of the equilibrium magnetic field.

266
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:47,128
We can usually decompose our perturbation
into toroidal, n, and poloidal, m,

267
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:50,879
mode numbers
and the rational values of m/n

268
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:54,353
are therefore described by elements, 
1/1, 2/1, and 3/2.

269
00:17:54,642 --> 00:17:59,673
So if you look here at this tokamak, 
what would be a (2,1)

270
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:02,823
m=2, n=1 perturbation?

271
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:09,150
It's a perturbation that goes around
twice in the poloidal direction, m

272
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,490
while only going around once 
in the toroidal direction.

273
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:17,794
So the m=2, n=1 component
would be a component that, as I said,

274
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:20,356
goes around twice
in the poloidal direction,

275
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:22,143
once in the toroidal direction.

276
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,876
So let's look at the perturbation.

277
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:27,593
Let's say we start at this point here.

278
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:32,023
We want to go around twice 
in the poloidal cross-section,

279
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,855
once in the toroidal cross-section,

280
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,274
so we start with this.

281
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,823
So this is our (2,1) perturbation.

282
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:47,371
A (3,2) perturbation would be one
that goes three times around

283
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:51,554
the poloidal cross-section, while going 
twice along the toroidal angle.

284
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:54,439
So we start again from here

285
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:58,833
and there it is.

286
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,912
So this would be the (3,2) perturbation,

287
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:08,455
three turns in the poloidal direction, 
two turns in the toroidal direction.

288
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:13,005
Now we can look at a typical 
safety factor profile in a tokamak

289
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:16,567
and again, we'll take an example 
from the JET tokamak,

290
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,672
the same discharge that we've seen before.

291
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:21,430
The safety factor increases 
from the plasma center

292
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,826
where q is typically around 1,
towards the edge.

293
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:29,195
This is typical situation 
for the safety factor

294
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:34,422
of a monotonic safety factor profile
that is linked to a current profile,

295
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:38,694
current density profile Jφ
that is peaked on the magnetic axis.

296
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:42,081
We can have slightly different 
current profiles.

297
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,674
There, for instance,
can be produced by waves

298
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:50,165
or by pressure gradient and then 
the safety factor can actually change.

299
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,892
So if you have a current profile 
that is peaked slightly off axis,

300
00:19:56,407 --> 00:20:02,314
like this one here, then this will 
produce a safety factor profile

301
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:07,642
that is above one in the plasma center 
and that has two minima.

302
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:14,661
We have two minima here
of the safety factor profile

303
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:20,737
and the value at the plasma center 
is larger than one.

304
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,100
And one advantage is that since 
the safety factor is above one

305
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,373
at the plasma center, 
we remove all instabilities

306
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:34,846
that are associated with the 
(1,1) mode from the plasma center.

307
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:41,712
However, we have resonant values 
of the q-profile

308
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:43,417
that can appear twice,

309
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:51,143
here and here, this would be a 
(3/2) resonance

310
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:55,598
so that is: the resonance condition
is met twice and therefore

311
00:20:55,598 --> 00:21:00,858
if the perturbation grows to occupy 
all this region of the plasma

312
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:04,098
between two resonant surfaces 
then it's a huge perturbation

313
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:08,826
and this can have significant consequences 
on the performance of the discharge.

314
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:12,571
Now we can look
at the typical sequence of events

315
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,358
in a tokamak discharge.

316
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,943
We start with the current 
in the primary field coils, Ipf.

317
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:22,815
It is first ramped down 
to a negative value,

318
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:27,641
then at some point we start ramping up 
towards zero.

319
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:31,205
At this moment we inject 
some gas in the plasma,

320
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:32,583
not a lot:

321
00:21:34,732 --> 00:21:37,918
around 0.01 gram or there about.

322
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:43,768
The current in the primary field coils 
ramps up, and we see

323
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:48,082
that this is where the plasma current 
also starts to ramp up.

324
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:51,448
This is the point where we start
having a breakdown.

325
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:55,854
So when the current in the
primary field coils goes towards zero,

326
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,158
this is what this is called 
the primary reconnection current

327
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:03,753
in the inner poloidal field coils
and at this moment we know

328
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:06,219
if the breakdown has 
been sustained or not.

329
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:13,053
This time scale is very short, typically
of the order of a few milliseconds,

330
00:22:13,053 --> 00:22:14,465
1 to 3 ms.

331
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:18,803
If the breakdown has been sustained, 
we keep up ramping the current

332
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:22,134
in the poloidal field coil,
the plasma current ramps up,

333
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:24,198
and then we get to a flat-top

334
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:27,073
and at the end of the discharge 
we ramp it down.

335
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,894
For the magnetic field, we usually start 
with a pre-magnetization.

336
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:38,347
In fact, if you see the toroidal field 
starts to ramp up before we ramp up

337
00:22:38,347 --> 00:22:41,076
the current in the poloidal field coils.

338
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:46,760
This is the phase that is called 
the pre-magnetization of the plasma

339
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,779
and this is useful to facilitate 
the breakdown.

340
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:55,525
We then again have a flat-top 
for the toroidal field

341
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:58,434
and then the ramp down phase 
at the end of the discharge.

342
00:23:01,818 --> 00:23:05,791
We can now look at a video
of a real JET discharge,

343
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:10,996
a real plasma of JET
and we will see flashes of light.

344
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:14,582
This is where and when 
the plasma is formed.

345
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:19,204
The patches of light indicate
where there is radiation

346
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:21,202
from the plasma to the wall.

347
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:30,308
So we see the plasma is 
formed here at the bottom,

348
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:34,537
(there are flashes of light), it 
fills then the poloidal cross-section

349
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:39,096
and at this moment the plasma is terminated,
this is the ramp down phase, again,

350
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:41,391
at the bottom of the tokamak.

351
00:23:48,144 --> 00:23:52,871
We can now talk very briefly 
about the history of the tokamaks.

352
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:56,769
Tokamaks have been used
in fusion research since the late 50s.

353
00:23:56,957 --> 00:24:02,405
In fact, the first tokamak that started
operation was the T-1 tokamak in 1957

354
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:04,744
at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow.

355
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:09,795
Now, there are around 40 tokamaks 
that are currently operating worldwide.

356
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:13,969
We have tokamaks in the USA, in Europe, 
in India, Iran, Brazil,

357
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:17,040
South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia.

358
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:21,091
We will talk a little bit more 
about the JET tokamak.

359
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:25,100
JET is an acronym that stands 
for Joint European Torus.

360
00:24:26,004 --> 00:24:28,878
It is in England, close to Oxford.

361
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:34,299
The first JET plasma was in June 1983 
and currently it is the largest

362
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:36,828
operating tokamak in the world.

363
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:42,222
We see here is a photo
of the inside of the JET tokamak.

364
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:47,225
We superimpose a typical plasma, 
we see these lights here

365
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:51,475
where the plasma radiates to the wall,
top, bottom,

366
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:54,072
and a little bit on the low field side.

367
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:56,934
The JET tokamak is currently 
the sole operating

368
00:24:56,934 --> 00:25:00,695
magnetically confined fusion device
which has the capability

369
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:03,322
of deuterium-tritium operation.

370
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,939
One of the main highlights
of the JET tokamak

371
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:11,828
was a 50:50 DT experiment
that was carried out in 1997.

372
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:16,282
During this DT experiment
we achieved a peak fusion power

373
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:20,359
of around 16 megawatt, this is 
currently the world record

374
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:25,710
and the peak fusion energy gain 
Q_DT of order 0.62

375
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:30,345
raised up to 0.95, so quite close to 1 
when we consider transients.

376
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:36,953
We have here a photo of the JET tokamak.
On the outside we see lots of elements

377
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:41,671
and let me just tell you about 
a few design and operational parameters.

378
00:25:41,671 --> 00:25:44,677
The major radius of the JET tokamak 
is 3m,

379
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:48,583
the minor radius is larger 
than one meter, 1.25 meter.

380
00:25:49,158 --> 00:25:52,679
The typical magnetic field 
and plasma current 3.5 tesla

381
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,815
and 3.5 MA but operation is possible 
up to a value of the magnetic field

382
00:25:57,815 --> 00:26:03,685
on the magnetic axis BФ₀ of 4 Tesla,
a plasma current up to 6 MA.

383
00:26:04,684 --> 00:26:07,834
We have additional heating power 
up to 40 MW.

384
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:12,609
Typical value of the electron density 
and temperature in the plasma center

385
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:15,750
are ne₀ , electron density 
at the plasma center between

386
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,864
2 and 5 x 10¹⁹ particles per meter cubed,

387
00:26:19,864 --> 00:26:23,250
peak electron temperature 
and ion temperature at the plasma center

388
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,993
between 5 and 15 keV.

389
00:26:25,873 --> 00:26:30,023
The typical energy confinement time τE
is on the order of half a second,

390
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:34,074
and this gives a maximum 
triple product n τE T,

391
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:39,240
which is of the order of 2.6 x 10 ²⁰ keV
per meter cubed per second.

392
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:44,119
We have a flat-top pulse length 
that is between 20 and 60 seconds

393
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:49,189
and the materials of which 
the wall of JET is built

394
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:50,943
are beryllium and tungsten.

395
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:55,809
Now JET is an experiment 
about the physics of fusion

396
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:57,924
but also about technologies,

397
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:00,008
and one particular technology 
we'd like to focus on

398
00:27:00,008 --> 00:27:01,709
is the remote handling technology.

399
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:06,135
Remote handling enables work 
inside the JET vessel,

400
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:08,931
without human presence.

401
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:13,047
Remote handling is carried out 
by a dexterous force-reflecting

402
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:15,812
master-slave servo manipulator.

403
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,478
The slave unit is transported inside 
the torus on the end

404
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:21,914
of a ten meter long
articulated robot

405
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:26,598
and the master unit is driven 
by experienced operators

406
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:28,518
situated in the control room.

407
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:32,926
We have here a video that shows 
a few examples

408
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:37,552
of remote handling operation in JET
and in particular there is a focus

409
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:42,045
on the installation of antennae,
the TA antennae

410
00:27:42,045 --> 00:27:45,737
that are used to drive and detect
<i>Alfvén eigenmodes</i> on JET.

411
00:27:45,737 --> 00:27:48,926
We are particularly keen on this video 
because the TA antenna

412
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:50,972
is something that we designed and built

413
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:53,539
here at CRPP in Lausanne.

414
00:27:54,495 --> 00:27:58,344
Now so far we have described 
what we normally call

415
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,563
the "conventional" tokamak concept.

416
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,838
We see an illustration here.

417
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:08,364
The conventional tokamak concept is 
a tokamak which has a large aspect ratio,

418
00:28:08,364 --> 00:28:13,583
R₀/a typically in excess of 3, 
between 3 and 4,

419
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:16,568
3.5 for instance, in the case of JET.

420
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:21,129
The spherical tokamak concept 
we see here in this graph

421
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:25,112
has an aspect ratio of R₀/a
that is close to 1,

422
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:27,843
much smaller than a conventional tokamak.

423
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:31,537
We see here in fact the relative scale 
of the spherical tokamak

424
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:34,242
and the conventional tokamak.

425
00:28:34,242 --> 00:28:38,152
Here we have an example of 
a spherical tokamak, again in the UK.

426
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:44,065
The main advantage of a spherical tokamak 
is that despite the fact that in general

427
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:46,891
we achieve a lower plasma pressure,

428
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,357
there is a higher value of β, 
which is the ratio of the plasma pressure

429
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:52,035
to the magnetic field pressure

430
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:57,393
and this is because the spherical tokamak 
is a more compact structure,

431
00:28:57,393 --> 00:29:02,175
and so a smaller

432
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:04,541
magnetic field is needed 
for confinement,

433
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,539
which basically increases β.

434
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:10,656
However, as we see here
in the photo the discharge

435
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:16,614
of a spherical tokamak, the plasma
can get really close to this column here,

436
00:29:16,614 --> 00:29:19,833
that's called the "central column" 
in the spherical tokamak.

437
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:24,482
This central solenoid
is then exposed to the plasma

438
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:27,445
and therefore care must be taken 
to avoid the plasma

439
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:29,623
touching the center solenoid.

440
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,714
Now let's summarize our lecture.

441
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:37,060
Tokamaks have been invented in the 50s 
and there are around

442
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,147
40 currently operating tokamaks worldwide.

443
00:29:41,188 --> 00:29:45,005
In a tokamak, the plasma is confined, 
thanks to the superposition

444
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:46,888
of different magnetic fields.

445
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:51,445
For the JET tokamak -it's a DT tokamak-

446
00:29:51,612 --> 00:29:55,137
holding the world record
of fusion power and fusion gain

447
00:29:55,137 --> 00:29:58,515
and it is a great example
of fusion technologies,

448
00:29:58,515 --> 00:30:00,404
for instance, remote handling.

449
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:04,643
It's important to know that tokamak 
are pulsed devices,

450
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:07,617
the plasma current is driven 
by transformer action.

451
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:11,870
In the next lecture, we will look 
at the <i>stellarator</i>

452
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:18,441
that is an example of confinement
that in principle can be steady state.
