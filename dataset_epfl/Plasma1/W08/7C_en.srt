00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:08,592
Welcome to the course
Plasma Physics and Application

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,453
to Fusion Energy,
Astrophysics and Industry.

3
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:13,951
My name is Duccio Testa,

4
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:16,412
and in this lecture we will be discussing

5
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:19,384
performance and operational 
limits of tokamaks.

6
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:23,038
First, we will look 
at critical parameters

7
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:24,415
for a fusion reactor.

8
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:28,190
This will lead us to describing
operational limits.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,279
We will see that there are
two kinds of operational limits:

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,925
<i>soft</i> and <i>hard</i> limits.

11
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:36,140
This will lead us to describe
three different kinds

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,551
of operational limits
on the plasma current,

13
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,971
on the density,
and on the pressure.

14
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:45,435
And finally, we will end up 
with describing <i>disruptions</i>,

15
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:49,348
which are the ultimate consequence
of violating these operational limits.

16
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:51,760
Now let's looks at the fusion performance—

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,687
let's briefly review 
what we did in lecture six.

18
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,333
What we found is 
that for thermonuclear fusion

19
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,452
to be economically attractive,
we need an engineering fusion energy gain,

20
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:04,948
QE, that is in the range 
between 2 and 10.

21
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:10,964
And this corresponds 
to a physics fusion energy gain, Q,

22
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:13,577
that has to be in the range of 10 to 40.

23
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:19,574
We also know that, to achieve 
this sufficiently high Q,

24
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:25,515
we need to have a sufficiently high value
of the triple product n T τE.

25
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:28,380
We ask ourselves a question:

26
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:33,247
What are the factors
limiting the fusion energy gain, Q?

27
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:39,104
Now, the first thing that we know
is that the energy confinement time

28
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:43,179
is observed to increase
with the plasma current Ip.

29
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:49,083
The fusion reactivity is proportional
to the square of the plasma density.

30
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:53,568
And then if we work in
the typical temperature range

31
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:58,596
that is optimal for a fusion reactor,
which is between 5 and 15 keV,

32
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:02,209
in this temperature range,
the fusion power P

33
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:07,973
increases as (n T)², so the fusion power

34
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:10,596
is proportional to the square 
of the plasma pressure.

35
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:15,183
Now we have immediately seen
that there are three main factors

36
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:17,367
for fusion performance:

37
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:21,897
plasma current, Ip, that leads 
to the energy confinement time,

38
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:24,325
then density [n], and pressure, p.

39
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:28,905
And in fact, these three quantities,
IP, n and p, are limited

40
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:30,819
by different mechanisms.

41
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,370
These are the operational limits
in tokamaks.

42
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:36,984
If we approach these operational limits,

43
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:41,765
then we end up in disruptions
when we go over this limit,

44
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:46,162
and this is a hard limit
for the operation of a plasma,

45
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:50,763
or we end up with confinement degradation,
and this will be a soft limit.

46
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:55,618
Now the way to describe
these operational limits in tokamaks

47
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:57,409
is the <i>Hugill diagram</i>

48
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:01,391
that provides a link between
the plasma current and the density

49
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,978
for which safe operation 
is allowed in tokamaks.

50
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:09,412
The Hugill diagram describes
the quantity 1/qa —

51
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:11,781
qa, the safety factor
of the plasma edge,

52
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:14,959
that we have seen is a measure
of the total plasma current —

53
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,240
as a function of what we call
the Murakami parameter

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,104
that is proportional
to the plasma density n.

55
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,577
So what we have here is
the definition of the axes

56
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,913
of the Hugill diagram:

57
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:33,585
on the x-axis, the Murakami parameter:

58
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:37,753
<n>, written here with brackets,

59
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:41,583
is the volume average plasma density,
which is multiplied by R₀,

60
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,794
the position of the magnetic axis,
divided by Bφ₀,

61
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:47,294
the value of the on-axis toroidal field .

62
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,170
This is the Murakami parameter.

63
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,622
On the y-axis we have 1/qa.

64
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:53,869
That is proportional
to the total plasma current.

65
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,468
So the first limit, 
- it's a hard limit -,

66
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:01,926
is given by the total plasma current,
and this limit is set

67
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:09,020
by global MHD instabilities
that impose 1/qa < 0.5.

68
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,468
This is really a hard limit.

69
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:16,141
It's independent of the plasma density.

70
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,929
Then we have a density limit,
it's a soft limit,

71
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:21,852
it's called the Greenwald density limit.

72
00:04:21,852 --> 00:04:26,616
This tells us that if we want
to operate at a larger density,

73
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,787
then we need to increase 
the plasma current,

74
00:04:28,787 --> 00:04:30,914
and correspondingly, by increasing
the plasma current,

75
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:32,643
we can work at a larger density.

76
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:38,112
This is basically a line 
that is oblique in the y-x diagram.

77
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:43,606
What we have here is our definition
of the operational space of a tokamak

78
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,961
in this range here.

79
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:51,027
This area is

80
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:53,907
the safe operational space for a tokamak.

81
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:58,798
On the top, we have in fact
a limit on the total plasma current

82
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:04,063
and this diagonal line is
a limit on the density.

83
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:08,461
It is important to note
that if we shape the plasma,

84
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:12,802
then we can exceed 
the Greenwald density limit.

85
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:15,272
In this sense, it is a soft limit.

86
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:19,672
Another operational limit
is due to the plasma pressure.

87
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:23,785
In fact, the ideal β-limit
is set by the occurence

88
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:26,009
of ideal MHD instabilities.

89
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,665
These are instabilities that work
on a very fast time scale,

90
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:34,225
and in fact it is not possible to control

91
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:36,062
them in real time.

92
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,610
If we collect data from many experiments,
as shown in this graph here,

93
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,365
for many different machines,

94
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:48,241
we find that there is in fact a scaling
between the maximum value of β

95
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:52,677
in percent, and the ratio
between the plasma current Ip,

96
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:55,565
the minor radius a, 
and the toroidal magnetic field,

97
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,138
on axis Bφ₀.

98
00:05:58,294 --> 00:06:03,671
If you look at this graph,
where we have the toroidal β plotted

99
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:06,172
as a function of Ip/aBφ₀,

100
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:10,673
we notice that the different machines
are basically all aligned

101
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:15,970
under this dotted line
that corresponds to a value, βn = 3.5.

102
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:20,537
Three point five is the definition
of the normalized βN , β divided

103
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:24,355
by this normalization factor, Ip/aBφ₀.

104
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:29,401
This range of normalization,
Cβ — βn in fact can be

105
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:35,297
between two and five and increases
when we optimize the plasma shape.

106
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,093
So if you look again at this graph,
we see that the first machine

107
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:42,120
like TOSCA AND TFTR,
these were circular machines.

108
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,464
The plasma cross-section was a circle.

109
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:48,997
In fact, all these machines are set up

110
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:52,749
at the limit of βn = 3.5,
if not even below.

111
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:57,860
However, we note that there is
one particular machine in this graph,

112
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,954
that is the DIII-D machine,
for which in fact, for certain values

113
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:06,646
of Ip/aBφ₀, clearly, we obtain
a βTOR that exceeds

114
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:08,720
this 3.5 limit.

115
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,143
But if we draw a line taking this value,
this line would correspond to βn

116
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:18,072
in excess of 4, perhaps even 5.

117
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:22,321
So this tells us what we can do
to increase the β limits,

118
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:24,272
or the plasma pressure limit on a tokamak,

119
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:27,644
because this DIII-D machine
is a machine that is shaped —

120
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:31,116
the poloidal cross-section is elongated

121
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:35,008
and it actually has
a quasi-triangular shape.

122
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:40,091
So in fact, by optimizing
the plasma shape, we can go

123
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:43,502
beyond this traditional Troyon limit,

124
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:45,779
βn = 3.5.

125
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:51,012
In fact, this also defines the range
of operation that you can expect

126
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,341
in future plasma devices, such as ITER.

127
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,527
What we find, however,
is that resistive MHD modes

128
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:02,132
can degrade the confinement at β
below the Troyon limit,

129
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:07,642
so we do not manage
to get to this value of βn = 3.5,

130
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:09,777
due to these resistive MHD modes.

131
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:14,020
However, these modes are resistive,
so they work on a much slower timescale

132
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,110
than ideal modes, and then we can do
real-time control of these instabilities.

133
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:23,390
Now if we really exceed
hard operational limits,

134
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,571
what we end up with is a disruption.

135
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:30,237
Here we have a plot that describes
the evolution of a plasma current

136
00:08:30,237 --> 00:08:33,473
for a JET discharge
that ends up in a disruption.

137
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:37,209
It's characterized here
by the sudden drop of the plasma current.

138
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,831
If we lose the plasma current,
and we see the time scale here

139
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:46,064
is very short, a millisecond,
then the plasma confinement is lost,

140
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:48,660
because we completely lose
the poloidal magnetic field.

141
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:52,090
What is important to note
is that stellarators

142
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,595
are in principle disruption-free,
because there is

143
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:58,251
no inductively driven toroidal
plasma current;

144
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:00,787
all magnetic field is provided
by external coils.

145
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:06,617
We can look here at a photo
of a disruption in JET,

146
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:11,910
and we see these red patches
along the plasma wall.

147
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,851
We see one here, one here at the
bottom of the machine, and clearly

148
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:19,372
in this area of the machine,
on the high field side.

149
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:23,592
In fact, these red patches are areas

150
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:25,722
where the plasma touches the wall.

151
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:30,728
So in a disruption, we can have damage
to plasma-facing components

152
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:34,808
when the heat flux exceeds
the limits of the materials.

153
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:39,558
So if you look at future fusion devices
such as ITER,

154
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:42,798
we can only have 
five disruptions that are allowed

155
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:46,490
over its entire 30-years lifetime.

156
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:51,360
In fact, the problem 
of disruptions is so major,

157
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,774
that we are studying
disruption mitigation techniques

158
00:09:55,774 --> 00:09:57,276
that are under development.

159
00:09:57,276 --> 00:10:00,550
These mitigation techniques work
on a real-time basis,

160
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,627
and in fact, the principle we can see 
here, if you go back again to this plot

161
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:09,302
of the plasma current, we note
that just before the plasma current drops,

162
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:12,700
there is a slight spike
in the plasma current,

163
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,082
where I can just highlight this section.

164
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:19,435
The plasma current is flat,
there is a spike, and then it drops.

165
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:25,646
This is a very short timescale,
on the order of a millisecond or so.

166
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:28,876
But in fact, this spike 
in the plasma current

167
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:31,440
is what we call a disruption precursor.

168
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:36,052
If we can detect it, and we 
usually can detect it very efficiently,

169
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,963
then it is possible to apply
disruption mitigation techniques

170
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:43,102
that in fact mitigate the damage
to the plasma wall

171
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,287
due to a disruption.

172
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:47,553
We can now summarize
what we have seen today.

173
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,476
The plasma current Ip, plasma density n,
and plasma pressure p

174
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:57,262
are of the utmost importance
for optimizing a fusion reactor.

175
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:02,421
These parameters are constrained
within a limited operational range,

176
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:06,296
which is described by theoretical 
and empirical scaling laws.

177
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:10,922
If you approach these operational limits,
and when we exceed them,

178
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:14,936
this may lead to disruption,
which is a hard limit,

179
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:18,936
or to confinement degradation,
which would be a soft limit.
