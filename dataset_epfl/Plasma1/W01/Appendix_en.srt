1
00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:04,444
In this short appendix I will give you
all the details necessary

2
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:06,617
to derive the grad B drift.

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:10,165
So the situation is the one
of a magnetic field,

4
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:13,128
The count goes out from the plane.

5
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:17,376
And with a gradient
in this direction.

6
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,643
Perpendicular to B,

7
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:24,961
it means that the fill lines
will become more compressed

8
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,713
by going this direction.

9
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:33,381
What is the trajectory of a particle
moving in this magnetic field?

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,972
Let's consider a positively
charged particle.

11
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:42,240
Because of the vigorous B motion,
the particle will tend to gyrate.

12
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:47,604
Now, while it gyrates,
it will find regions

13
00:00:47,604 --> 00:00:51,311
where the magnetic field
is stronger, here.

14
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:56,718
And with a stronger magnetic field,
the normal radius will become smaller

15
00:00:57,122 --> 00:01:01,481
-- so, the normal radius,
curvature radius of the trajectory

16
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:03,023
will become smaller.

17
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:06,662
The particle then will go
back into a region

18
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:10,676
where the magnetic field is weaker,

19
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:14,888
and therefore the normal radius is larger.

20
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:21,324
And then we'll go back into regions where
the normal radius is smaller,

21
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:25,816
we'll turn around and come back, etc.

22
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:30,711
Practice what we will have also,
in this case,

23
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:37,012
well, we will have motion of a particle
that is rather complicated

24
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:43,207
but with the degrading center
that moves upwards in the direction

25
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:46,816
that is perpendicular
to both grad B and B.

26
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:52,331
Okay, let's try to study
this analytically.

27
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:55,307
We will consider
the limit of normal radius

28
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:59,193
that is much smaller
than the typical scale

29
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:02,991
over which the magnetic field varies.

30
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:07,330
Where with zero, for example, B(zero),

31
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,137
I will denote the value
of the magnetic field

32
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:17,233
or of its gradient
at the particle guiding center.

33
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,431
What is the advantage of doing that?

34
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:25,386
If we want to know what is
the magnetic field acting on the particle,

35
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:28,532
we can expand around the guiding center.

36
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:34,942
And if we estimate this quantity here,

37
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:42,546
this will be of the order of ρ, grad B,

38
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:47,636
that is much smaller than B(zero),

39
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:54,137
and therefore we will be able to neglect
all the other terms of higher order.

40
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:59,950
Therefore, what we want to solve
is basically the Newton equation

41
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:06,672
with the magnetic field that
we can expand as here.

42
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:19,775
Now, if we look at this equation,
we notice that <i>this</i> term,

43
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:22,132
because of this ordering,

44
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:25,597
this first term will be much larger
than the second one.

45
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:28,701
Therefore what we do,
we decompose the velocity

46
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:35,224
as the sum of a velocity that satisfied
medium order term of this equation

47
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:37,170
plus a perterbation.

48
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:43,896
Well, v(zero) is the leading order term
to one that satisfied the first order term

49
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:45,694
here of this equation.

50
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:51,948
And also, v' will take into account
this small correction.

51
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:56,722
We expect that that v'
will be much smaller than v(zero).

52
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:01,532
Therefore v'
will satisfy the equation

53
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:07,625
where we can neglect the higher order term

54
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:18,574
as this term is given by the product of
two small quantities, v' and grad B.

55
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:20,266
all grad B.

56
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:25,546
Now, what we are interested in here
is in solving this equation

57
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:28,926
is getting the average v',

58
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:34,861
the v' that actually represents
motion -- steady state motion

59
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:38,291
of the guiding center, the drift.

60
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:45,350
So now averaging over one gyroperiod,
this equation here,

61
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,937
the first term will give zero,

62
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:51,604
the second one will lead to-

63
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:56,701
well, it's all proportional to the charge
so we can drop the charge,

64
00:04:56,701 --> 00:05:07,623
we will have v' + B(zero)
+ the gyroaverage of the second term

65
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:16,181
and we can actually solve this equation
by crossing it with B(zero)

66
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:18,876
in order to get v'.

67
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:29,790
Now, as v' is perpendicular
to B(zero) in this direction --

68
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:34,595
we have the average of v',

69
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:38,711
this double-cross product can be solved

70
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:42,269
as we've done for
the case of B(cross) B(drift),

71
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:47,024
and as I was saying,
the average of v'

72
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:51,204
would be equal to 1/B(zero)^2 --

73
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:58,541
B(zero) cross r.grad B(zero) crossed
-- still crossed with B(zero).

74
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:03,492
Now, to make things a bit easier,
let's fix some axis.

75
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:10,005
We will put a system of coordinate
with the x-direction pointing downwards,

76
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:12,101
the y-direction here

77
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:16,826
and the z-direction pointing
in the direction of the B field

78
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,358
outwards from this plane.

79
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:28,461
Therefore, if B(zero) = B(zero)ez,
as it is in the z-direction,

80
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:35,923
and similarly, this term here,
v(cross) r.grad B

81
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:40,324
is in the z-direction,
more precisely,

82
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:48,077
so if B is in the direction of z,
therefore if B(zero) = B(zero)z

83
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:55,042
and this term here can be evaluated
and will still be in the direction of z,

84
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:59,835
more precisely, it will be given by,
taking into account

85
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:03,214
that the derivative is
only in the y-direction,

86
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:09,404
but the derivative of B
along the y-direction,

87
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:16,023
that's the difference of particle position
along y with respect to the guiding center

88
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:18,525
which is located at y(zero).

89
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:24,102
Well, then, if we try to
evaluate this term here,

90
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:33,492
what we will have is that we will have to
evaluate v(zero) cross y - y(zero)

91
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:34,639
dB/dy,

92
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:41,117
well, here, you can now develop v(zero)
along its y- and x-component,

93
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,254
and therefore this will be equal to
the y-component of v(zero) --

94
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,981
this will result into the x-component

95
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:55,455
plus the component due to v(zero)x.

96
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:05,140
Now, if we are careful, we actually know
what is v(zero)y and v(zero)x,

97
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,685
as these are solutions
of the equation here

98
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:14,289
that is the solution of an equation
with uniform static magnetic field.

99
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:22,028
Therefore we have that the particles
in circular motion,

100
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:24,471
v(zero) does a circular motion

101
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,125
and v(zero)x will be given by ...

102
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:36,516
while v(zero)y will be given
by oscillation with the same frequency

103
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,738
just shifted by π/2.

104
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:45,461
And the y-y(zero) can also be evaluated
and will be equal to v(zero)

105
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:54,294
divided by the omega cyclotron frequency
sin of omerga ct + φ cyclotron frequency

106
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:01,577
-- time + φ -- φ here is a phase shift

107
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:05,961
that will be determined by the initial
condition of the particle.

108
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:13,491
Now we can plug this expression here
of v(zero)x v(zero)y

109
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:16,487
and y-y(zero) into here,

110
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:21,601
evaluate the gyroaverage,

111
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:24,209
cross it with B,

112
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,192
and what do we obtain?

113
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,233
v'

114
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:35,576
And if you do all the calculation,
what you get is

115
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:43,572
gyro average v' with B = m,
the mass of the particles,

116
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:57,956
divided by 2B(zero)^2,
v(zero) of the particle/charge dB/dy ex.

117
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:02,361
This is the result in this specific case
in this geometry.

118
00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:06,450
If we look at the most general case,
what we have

119
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:15,127
is a drift that is given always by
the same coefficient in front

120
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,093
m 2B(zero)^3

121
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:25,622
B(zero)^2q B(zero) cross
the gradient of B(zero).

122
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:32,621
This drift, which is also very important
in plasma physics

123
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:36,001
is the so-called <i>grad B drift</i>.
