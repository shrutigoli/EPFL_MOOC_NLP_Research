1
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:07,107
Welcome.

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:10,047
Welcome to the Plasma Physics
course of the EPFL.

3
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,041
What is the trajectory
a charged particle

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,710
in given electric and magnetic fields?

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,535
In the past module
we focused our attention

6
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:22,895
on the simplest possible scenario,

7
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:27,339
that is the one of a constant,
uniform magnetic field.

8
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:33,534
We will now turn our attention
to more complicated settings.

9
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:38,922
We will first consider the one
of a constant electric and magnetic field,

10
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:41,394
and then we will turn our attention

11
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:44,704
to the case of a non-uniform
magnetic field.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,369
We've studied the trajectory
of a charged particle

13
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:51,951
in a static uniform magnetic field.

14
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,984
Let's complicate a little bit
the scenario.

15
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:58,247
Let's add, on top of
the static uniform magnetic field,

16
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:00,724
a static uniform electric field.

17
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,744
How will a particle move
under the effect of these two forces?

18
00:01:05,744 --> 00:01:10,737
This is what we will see now,
but let me already anticipate

19
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,514
that the result will be quite surprising.

20
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:18,187
So what we want to solve
is a Newton equation

21
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:21,222
of a particle with charge q,

22
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:25,643
that is subject to
an electric and a magnetic field,

23
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:30,370
with the electric and magnetic fields
that are constant.

24
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:35,996
To approach this problem,
we will decompose these equations

25
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:40,442
in a direction parallel and perpendicular
to the magnetic field.

26
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:43,724
Let's start from the direction
parallel to the magnetic field.

27
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:46,595
Along the parallel direction,

28
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:50,288
we will have the mass
times the acceleration

29
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:54,121
is equal to the parallel electric force,

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,737
and of course the (v × B) force
will have no component

31
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:00,814
in the parallel direction.

32
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,155
What does it mean?

33
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,864
Well, this is a very simple equation
to be solved,

34
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:09,564
which gives us a uniformly
accelerated motion.

35
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:13,575
The perpendicular direction is,
of course, more complicated.

36
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:18,301
In this direction,
what we will have to solve is mass,

37
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:23,795
times the acceleration
in the perpendicular direction,

38
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:29,432
equal to the electric and magnetic force
taken in the perpendicular direction.

39
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:34,130
So what is the motion
induced by these forces?

40
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,308
Well, let's start to consider
a simple case.

41
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:41,021
Let's imagine that we have
a magnetic field

42
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,631
that comes out of this plane,

43
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:48,359
and an electric field that points upwards.

44
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:53,858
So let's place a particle,
a positively charged particle,

45
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:56,195
q > 0

46
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:59,492
and let's study the trajectory
of this particle,

47
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:03,510
subject to these
electric and magnetic fields.

48
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,493
Okay, the particle is at rest.

49
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:08,945
The first thing that it will do
is that it will be accelerated

50
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:11,725
by its electric field, upwards.

51
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,526
Therefore the particle
will start to move upwards.

52
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:18,448
At the same time,
it will be subject to the magnetic field,

53
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,104
and therefore its trajectory
will be curved.

54
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,847
And then the particle
will start to move down,

55
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,792
and while moving downwards,
the electric field will slow it down.

56
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:36,293
When its electric field slows it down,

57
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:38,793
then the velocity decreases,

58
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,943
and when the velocity decreases,

59
00:03:40,943 --> 00:03:44,370
the Larmor radius
of the particle decreases.

60
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,311
Therefore the particle
subject to the magnetic force

61
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:54,790
will move and will turn this way,

62
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,808
and then will be accelerated again

63
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:00,489
in the direction of the electric field.

64
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,650
Again, larger Larmor radius,

65
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:06,725
then the particle will move downwards,

66
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:09,307
at the same time will be slowed down,

67
00:04:09,497 --> 00:04:12,396
and the Larmor radius
will become smaller

68
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:15,155
and then the particles will come up...

69
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:18,105
This will be the trajectory.

70
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,666
If you want,
the guiding center of this particle

71
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:26,557
will move in this direction,

72
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:29,140
in a direction that is perpendicular

73
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,768
to both the electric field,
and the magnetic field.

74
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:38,008
Let's take the case of
negatively charged particles,

75
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:40,192
that is initially at rest.

76
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:44,885
Well, the particle will be accelerated
by the electric field,

77
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,924
this time downwards,

78
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,011
because the particle
is charged negatively.

79
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:55,911
And then the particle will be subject
to the magnetic field.

80
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:57,997
It will gyrate

81
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,692
with a certain Larmor radius,
and then the particle

82
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:06,281
because of the gyration will continue
to move it in this direction,

83
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:10,551
but while moving in this direction,
the particle will be slowed down,

84
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:14,319
and therefore its Larmor radius
will become smaller,

85
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:17,552
and then the particle
will continue to move.

86
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,281
Will be slowed down, etc.

87
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:26,999
The result is that
the particle's guiding center

88
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:32,520
will still move in the same direction
as the positively charged particle.

89
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:36,184
So what do we expect from this image?

90
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:39,797
Basically that there will be
a periodic motion

91
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,402
on top of which
a secular drift is present.

92
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:49,132
So let's try first to understand
what is this drift,

93
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:55,966
by averaging the trajectory
over one gyro period.

94
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:04,331
So we have to take this equation here,
for perpendicular velocity,

95
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:08,428
and average over one gyroperiod.

96
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:14,105
The averaging I will denote
with these brackets,

97
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:21,284
and therefore what we will have
to evaluate is < m dv⊥/dt >.

98
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:27,145
The average over a gyroperiod
will be equal to zero,

99
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:31,561
and the gyroaveraging,
the right-hand side of this equation,

100
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:35,263
we will have that this has
to be equal to

101
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,797
the gyro average of E⊥,

102
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:44,211
plus the gyro average <v⊥ × B>.

103
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:48,793
Now, as E⊥ and B
are constant quantities,

104
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:55,750
we can write this equality as
the gyro average < v⊥> × B,

105
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,711
equal to minus E⊥.

106
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:05,040
And now we can extract the value of < v⊥>

107
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:08,880
by crossing this expression with B.

108
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:13,576
In fact, we will have this...

109
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:17,904
which using standard vector formula

110
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:25,001
is equal to - < v⊥> B² ,

111
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:30,844
and this has to be equal
to - (E⊥ × B),

112
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:38,607
from which we can obtain immediately
the gyro averaged value < v⊥>,

113
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:45,874
a quantity that we will call ve,

114
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:53,915
and is equal to 
ve = (E⊥ × B)/B².

115
00:07:57,065 --> 00:08:01,831
Now this will actually be the velocity
of the guiding center

116
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:06,065
that if you notice has,
in the picture we have drawn,

117
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,788
it's perpendicular to E, and to B,

118
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:13,260
and does not depend on the charge,

119
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,774
both positive and negative charges
move in the same direction.

120
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:24,164
Okay, so this is the averaged motion,
how about the real motion?

121
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:28,580
I mean the full motion,
the difference between the,

122
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:32,450
-if you want-, the actual motion

123
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,120
of the particles and the drift.

124
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:43,801
We can decompose v⊥
as the sum of the ve velocity,

125
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:50,040
plus the 'perturbed' quantity,
if you want to call it this way,

126
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,259
that will give this oscillation
that we see here.

127
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:57,007
We will write therefore that v⊥

128
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:01,427
will be equal to ve

129
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:07,629
plus the difference between v⊥ and ve,

130
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:14,538
that is, a quantity that we will call v⊥'.
[-> v⊥ = ve + v⊥' ]

131
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:20,259
Okay, what is the equation
that v⊥' is subject to?

132
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:28,084
Well, we can rewrite the Newton equation
that we have written here,

133
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:31,674
in terms of ve and v⊥',

134
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:34,000
and this will be equal to m ...

135
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:37,533
the derivative of
the perpendicular velocity

136
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:41,596
that we have expressed in terms
of these two quantities,

137
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:43,682
with respect to time.

138
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:47,602
And ve is a constant quantity,
therefore this will be

139
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:54,414
equal to m dv⊥’/dt,

140
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,228
and this will be given by the forces
that we have written here.

141
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:06,759
Well, we have to decompose 
v⊥ as ve + v⊥' .

142
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:15,952
And this is equal to q E⊥ + ...

143
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:21,748
- we can explicitely write
the value of ve-,

144
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:28,116
and then let's rewrite
q v⊥' × B .

145
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:33,638
Well, if you notice, this quantity

146
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:38,293
is actually given by -q E⊥,

147
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:45,010
and therefore will cancel out
with this q E⊥,

148
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:51,454
and what we will obtain is simply
q v⊥' × B.

149
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:55,672
So now look at the equation
that we have obtained

150
00:10:55,672 --> 00:11:01,009
by comparing this term here,
and this term here.

151
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:06,452
This is exactly the equation
that we have seen before

152
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,751
that gives a circular motion.

153
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:15,088
So what are the conclusions
of our exercise?

154
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,577
Well, that the motion,
of a charged particle

155
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:23,593
in a static and uniform electric field
is given by the superposition

156
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:28,238
of a gyromotion and a drift motion
of the guiding center.

157
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:38,027
The drift motion is the ve term
that we have introduced here,

158
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,878
and it's an important quantity
in plasma physics

159
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,338
that is called the <i>E × B drift</i>.

160
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:52,394
The second observation that we want to do

161
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:56,090
in this still relatively simple case

162
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:01,016
is that the E × B drift
is independent of charge.

163
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:06,800
Here in this expression
there is no charge that appears.

164
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,914
This is why the guiding centers, both for
the positive and negative particles

165
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:13,148
are moving in the same direction.

166
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:20,035
By extending the observation
that we have just done,

167
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:23,467
to the case of non-uniform electric field,

168
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:29,097
we can observe that the particle
is expected to move

169
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:31,521
in a perpendicular direction to it,

170
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:37,396
and therefore along the isocontour lines
of the electrostatic potential.

171
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:42,866
In other terms, the gyro center's motion
is along the isocontour lines

172
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,180
of the electrostatic potential.

173
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:53,866
Let's in fact imagine
we have a magnetic field

174
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:56,735
pointing out of the page,

175
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,078
and let's imagine we 
have an electrostatic potential

176
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,766
on the plane perpendicular to B,
with some isocontour lines.

177
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:14,929
Now as the E × B velocity
is in the direction perpendicular to E,

178
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:19,815
and that E is perpendicular
to the isocontour lines

179
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:24,082
of the electrostatic potential,
we will have that the particle,

180
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:28,262
the charged particle,
will move around,

181
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:33,046
following the isocontour lines
of the electrostatic potential.

182
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:38,525
The drift that we have just seen
can be easily generalized

183
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:42,238
to whatever force,
uniform constant force,

184
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,755
that acts on the charged particles.

185
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:51,144
Basically, if we have to solve
the Newton equation with a constant force,

186
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:57,232
on top of the Lorentz force,
( the v × B force ),

187
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:01,385
well if we solve this equation
exactly following

188
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:04,735
what we have done earlier
with the electric field,

189
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:11,524
we will find that the particle moves
with the gyrocenter,

190
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:16,119
following, moving with the drift

191
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:19,993
that is given by what we will call vf ,

192
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:24,854
and is given by the perpendicular
component of the force [F⊥] ...

193
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:28,869
- perpendicular to
the magnetic field,- ... × B,

194
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:34,370
divided by qB².

195
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:39,777
So let's see a couple
of applications of drifts,

196
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:44,176
of these drifts that
we have introduced here.

197
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:48,759
The first one is the case of
the gravitational force.

198
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,368
Let's suppose we have a magnetic field

199
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:56,076
pointing out of the plane,

200
00:14:57,117 --> 00:15:01,795
and then a gravitational force
in this direction.

201
00:15:02,312 --> 00:15:04,740
Will the plasma fall?

202
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:10,408
So, more precisely, let's suppose
that we have a plasma here,

203
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:15,629
and we are curious to know if,
subject to the gravitational force,

204
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:17,750
the plasma will fall.

205
00:15:18,437 --> 00:15:20,477
Well, this is not actually the case,

206
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:25,644
because the particles will follow a drift,

207
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:27,688
will move according to a drift

208
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:32,786
that for the ions goes in -making

209
00:15:32,786 --> 00:15:36,287
the cross product between g and B,-

210
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:38,281
goes in this direction,

211
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:42,683
so this will be the drift of the ions.

212
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:49,399
So the electrons
will move in this direction.

213
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:52,891
Let's not forget that
there is a charge dependence

214
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:59,193
on the expression of the drift
associated with the gravitational force.

215
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:04,305
This is different than what we have
for the electric force.

216
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:10,905
And therefore the electrons
will move in this direction.

217
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:18,165
So just because of the presence
of the gravitational force,

218
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,804
the plasma will not fall.

219
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:24,097
However, if we are careful,

220
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:27,564
what will happen because of
the presence of these two drifts?

221
00:16:27,742 --> 00:16:34,123
Well, we will have that
a sort of positive charge will accumulate

222
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:36,899
on this side of the plasma,

223
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:42,508
while negative charges will accumulate
on his side of the plasma.

224
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:47,593
And what will be the result of
the accumulation of these charges?

225
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:52,151
It will be an electric field,
that points in this direction.

226
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:58,146
And when we have, here,
an electric field, a magnetic field,

227
00:16:58,688 --> 00:16:59,989
what is the result?

228
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:03,598
it's an E × B drift,

229
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:06,457
that is in this direction.

230
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:11,492
The E × B drift is independent
of the charge of the particles,

231
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:15,004
therefore, at the end,
the plasma will fall down,

232
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:22,053
but through a much more complicated
process that one could think of

233
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:27,361
by looking just at the resulting effect
of the gravitational force.

234
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,196
The second application that
I would like to discuss with you

235
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:34,344
is the <i>curvature drift</i>.

236
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:39,566
Let's imagine we have magnetic field lines
with some curavature.

237
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:45,904
And we call this curvature,
the curvature vector, RB.

238
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:51,946
Now, a particle will tend to move
along the magnetic field lines,

239
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:58,502
and as the motion in the direction,

240
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:04,563
perpendicular, across B
is sort of resisted.

241
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:09,780
Therefore, while moving
along the field line,

242
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,019
the particle will feel a centrifugal force

243
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:19,030
that is the classic expression
that we know.

244
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:24,294
And therefore now, in the presence
of a force and a magnetic field,

245
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:27,666
we will have a drift
that we can evaluate

246
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,931
using the expression,
and will be given by,

247
00:18:31,964 --> 00:18:36,134
we'll call it vd, curvature drift,

248
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,198
which is the centrifugal force × B,

249
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:44,745
and using the expression
for centrifugal force,

250
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:48,282
this will be given
by the following expression.

251
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:52,697
This, as I was saying,
is what in plasma physics

252
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:55,367
is called the curvature drift,

253
00:18:55,808 --> 00:19:01,130
and it's also an important quantity,
in plasma physics.

254
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:06,945
Let's now consider the case
of a non-uniform magnetic field,

255
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:11,319
one in which there is
a gradient of the magnetic field

256
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:15,084
perpendicular to
the magnetic field itself.

257
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,860
The scenario is therefore
the following one,

258
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,748
we have a magnetic field
that points out of the plane,

259
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:24,552
and which is subject to a gradient,

260
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,705
in this direction,
perpendicular to B therefore.

261
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:36,132
So let's suppose that
we have a charged particle.

262
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,113
Let's suppose that
is positively charged.

263
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:48,633
Now this particle may move,
and because of the v × B force

264
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:51,735
will tend to gyrate,

265
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:57,509
and while it starts to gyrate,
it will experience regions

266
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:00,692
where the magnetic field
may become stronger,

267
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:03,757
and when the magnetic field
may become stronger,

268
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:06,840
the Larmor radius will become smaller.

269
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:10,648
And then when the particle goes back

270
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:15,392
it will experience regions
where the magnetic field is weaker,

271
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:18,401
and therefore the Larmor radius is larger,

272
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:24,123
and then again regions where
the magnetic field is stronger,

273
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:28,207
and therefore
the Larmor radius smaller, etc.

274
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:32,014
What is the result of such a motion?

275
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:35,895
It is again, the one that can be described

276
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:40,318
by the motion of the guiding center

277
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:43,105
of the particle in this direction.

278
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:49,785
Now, what is the velocity of the drift
of this guiding center?

279
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:52,395
Well, the calculation
is fairly complicated,

280
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:58,502
and you can find it in an appendix
to the present lecture.

281
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:01,015
Here I will just give the result,

282
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:04,761
it is what you actually
will need in the future.

283
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:09,341
That is the v due to the gradient
of the magnetic field

284
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:16,877
is equal to the mass
of the particle divided by 2B³

285
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:21,806
v² of the particles, divided by the charge

286
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,839
times the magnetic field

287
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:30,275
cross the gradient of the magnetic field.

288
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,953
As a matter of fact, as we see here,

289
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:41,055
the guiding center with the drift,
on a direction that is perpendicular

290
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:43,733
to both ∇B and B.

291
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:47,907
This is what is called the <i>grad-B drift</i>.

292
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:54,014
In the present module,
we have focused our attention

293
00:21:54,014 --> 00:22:00,072
on the trajectory of a particle
in a given electric and magnetic field.

294
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:04,803
In the past lecture we had focused
our attention on a quite simple case,

295
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:09,865
the one of a uniform
and constant magnetic field.

296
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:14,253
Here we have considered
slightly more complicated cases.

297
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:16,338
First of all, we have looked
at what happens

298
00:22:16,338 --> 00:22:20,919
when there is a constant
uniform electric and magnetic field,

299
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:25,110
and then we have looked
at what is the particle trajectory

300
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,907
when the magnetic field is non-uniform.

301
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,710
We have pointed out that in all cases

302
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,579
the particle trajectory can be described
as the superposition

303
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:41,078
of a guiding center drift motion
plus a gyromotion,

304
00:22:41,078 --> 00:22:44,406
and we have given
the expression of this drift motion

305
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:48,899
in all the relevant cases
that we have analyzed.
