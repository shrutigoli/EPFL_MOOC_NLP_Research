00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:09,531
Welcome; welcome to the plasma physics 
course of the EPFL.

2
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:14,696
In the past module we have given a
rigorous definition of plasma.

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,541
We have now seen how that plasmas
are made of electrons and ions,

4
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:25,364
charged particles, charged particles 
that move under the effect of electric

5
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:26,810
and magnetic field.

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,499
Now, these electric are magnetic field
are actually generated self-consistently

7
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:35,483
by these charged particles that 
constitute the plasma.

8
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:42,816
Well if we want to describe in a 
self-consistent way, we have to--

9
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,213
at the same time describe the generation 
of these electric and magnetic field,

10
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:52,453
and the motion of the 
particles subject to that.

11
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:58,298
This is a complex nonlinear phenomenon 
and the analysis of it will be

12
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:01,413
the subject of the future lectures.

13
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:09,638
Here in these first modules, we will start
with the simplest study,

14
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:13,942
that is, we will assume that the electric 
and magnetic fields are given

15
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:18,214
and that the charged particles move 
under the effect of these

16
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:20,755
[given] electric and magnetic fields.

17
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:25,675
We will study what is the 
trajectory of these particles.

18
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:32,063
In the present module, we will start 
from the simplest scenario, that is,

19
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:37,013
of a constant in time, 
uniform magnetic field.

20
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:42,306
By studying the dynamics -the trajectory- 
of charged particles in this constant

21
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:44,271
and uniform magnetic field,

22
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:50,764
we will also learn about 
the magnetic properties of plasmas,

23
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:52,562
and we will have the opportunity

24
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:56,258
to introduce the concept of 
magnetic moment.

25
00:01:58,089 --> 00:02:00,881
So let's start with the simplest case.

26
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:04,997
The motion of a particle in a static 
and uniform magnetic field.

27
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:10,265
What we basically want to do is 
to solve the Newton equation

28
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:13,033
with the Lorentz force, basically,

29
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:21,695
with B constant. We will look at 
the non-relativistic limit.

30
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:26,842
Well, this equation can be solved 
by using brute force,

31
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:30,119
really by solving all components, 
all the three components,

32
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:32,461
all the three coupled components of it,

33
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:37,700
or, by studying a bit into detail
the properties of

34
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,333
the particle motion subject 
to Lorentz force.

35
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:44,224
Let's take the second approach.

36
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:48,241
The first thing that we want to understand
and estimate is what is

37
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,483
the variation of kinetic energy.

38
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,138
Well we can study the time derivative

39
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:58,685
of the kinetic energy,

40
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:06,354
which is given by mv ⋅ dv/dt.

41
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:10,341
dv/dt is given by Newton's equation,

42
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:17,119
that it is given by q (v × B )/m.

43
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:24,531
Now, (v × B ) is pendicular to v ,
so if we take the dot product with v

44
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:27,370
what we obtain is zero.

45
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:31,643
In other words, d/dt of the 
kinetic energy is constant [≡0]

46
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:34,548
which means that

47
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,764
v² is constant.

48
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,621
The second thing that we have 
to notice is that

49
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:47,818
the direction parallel to magnetic field [‖]
and one perpendicular to it [⊥]

50
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:49,584
are quite different.

51
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:51,581
It's useful to

52
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:57,266
decompose the velocity as 
the sum of a parallel

53
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:59,549
and a perpendicular component.

54
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,932
Parallel and perpendicular to B.

55
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:09,604
That is, v parallel [v‖] is defined 
as the projection of v along B,

56
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,384
taking account the direction of B,
and v perp [v⊥] is equal

57
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,582
to v-v‖.

58
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:25,947
We can project the Newton equation 
along to parallel direction,

59
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:33,630
which gives therefore the 
time variation of v‖,

60
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:41,088
which will be equal to the projection 
of the Lorentz force along the B direction

61
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,948
and this will be equal to zero,

62
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:47,328
which implies that v‖ is constant.

63
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:55,775
But we also have that
v² = v⊥² + v‖²

64
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:59,689
and as both v‖ is constant

65
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:05,154
and the v total is constant 
then v⊥ is constant.

66
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:10,479
Now what do we have is that

67
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:17,258
the derivative of v⊥ is 
perpendicular to v⊥.

68
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:23,455
At the same time, the modulus of 
v⊥ is constant.

69
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:26,801
The only possibility is that the

70
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:34,612
particle has, in the perpendicular plane,
a uniform circular motion

71
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:40,347
whose property can be obtained 
by balancing the centrifugal force

72
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,919
with the Lorentz force,

73
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,414
where we have introduced 
two quantities here ρ,

74
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:53,293
That is ρ = (m v⊥ ) / ( |q| B)

75
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:59,210
which is the radius of the circular motion
that is also called <i>Larmor radius</i>

76
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:05,512
or <i>cyclotron</i> radius; and this 
motion will be associated with

77
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:10,295
the frequency that we will denote 
with omega c [ωc]

78
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,309
That is given by 
ωc = v⊥ / ρ

79
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,651
And the frequency of this 
uniform circular motion

80
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:23,191
is also called <i>cyclotron frequency</i>.

81
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:31,863
These are two fundamental 
quantities in plasma physics.

82
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:39,035
What is the consequence of all these

83
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:45,050
observations? Well, that 
a charged particle,

84
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:48,100
in the presence of a magnetic field,

85
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:52,498
-a uniform magnetic field- moves

86
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:57,325
with a trajectory that is a helical.

87
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:02,145
Basically it's motion in 
the direction parallel

88
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:08,195
the magnetic field lines is not affected,
while in the perpendicular direction

89
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:12,168
it goes through a uniform circular motion.

90
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,765
Okay what I have drawn here is the case 
of a positive charge,

91
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:22,932
and in fact, for q>0

92
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:27,144
we will have a left-handed rotation 
with respect to B

93
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:30,615
while if q<0,

94
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:36,222
we will have a right-handed rotation 
with respect to B.

95
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:43,775
In this particle motion we can 
observe that there is an instantaneous

96
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:46,857
center of rotation that moves

97
00:07:47,762 --> 00:07:52,194
in this simple case, 
in the direction parallel

98
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:53,901
to the magnetic field,

99
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:02,701
that in this simple case moves with 
the uniform motion along B.

100
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:14,721
Just by looking at this simple case, 
the motion of this charged particle

101
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:19,122
in the magnetic field, 
we can infer the properties,

102
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:21,567
the magnetic properties of a plasma.

103
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,996
So as we've seen in the presence 
of a magnetic field,

104
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:31,490
- this is case of a positively 
charged particle -

105
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:38,206
and now a charged particle therefore 
produces a current loop.

106
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:49,227
As we know, there is a magnetic moment [μ]
associated with a magnetic loop.

107
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,443
What are the properties of this vector 
magnetic moment [μ] ?

108
00:08:55,443 --> 00:09:05,200
Its intensity is given by the 
current times the area of the loop.

109
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:13,806
In the present case, the current 
will be given by the charge

110
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:21,777
times the cyclotron frequency 
divided by 2π ,

111
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:27,399
multiplied by the area which is 
π [times] ρ².

112
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:35,550
If we substitute the correct expressions 
for ωc and for ρ we obtain that this

113
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,810
quantity will be equal to the mass

114
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:42,860
times the perpendicular velocity squared

115
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:49,290
divided by 2B, which is the 
perpendicular kinetic energy

116
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:51,787
divided by B.

117
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:57,736
The direction will be opposite to B.

118
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:02,424
Both for q>0 and

119
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:04,413
q<0.

120
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:12,255
In other words, this magnetic moment 
vector will be something directed like that.

121
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,161
So what this is consequence of all this ?
That actually, because of the motion

122
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,721
of both negative and positive particles,

123
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:28,418
the magnetic field imposed

124
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:33,753
- applied- externally will be reduced by

125
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:38,768
the [perpendicular] motion of 
the charged particles in a plasma.

126
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:42,243
In other words, plasmas have 
<i>diamagnetic</i> properties.

127
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:49,184
In other words, the plasma tends 
to reduce the amplitude

128
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:52,137
of externally applied magnetic fields.

129
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,618
Let me make an observation 
about the magnetic moment.

130
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:06,854
In fact, the magnetic moment is 
an adiabatic invariant.

131
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,137
What do I mean with this?

132
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:16,069
Let me just remind a result 
that is given by analytical mechanics.

133
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:23,274
In fact, the analytical mechanics books 
tell us that the action,

134
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:33,584
let's call it J that is given by 
the integral of p dq of a coordinate q

135
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:36,058
and it's conjugate momentum p,

136
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:42,647
well, J -this action- is constant,

137
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,487
or better, we will say 
it's an <i>adiabatic invariant</i>

138
00:11:53,572 --> 00:11:57,270
under a slow change of 
an external parameter.

139
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:03,116
This is valid under the assumption 
that the motion is periodic if

140
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:08,193
there is no change of 
an external parameter

141
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:18,692
and we have indicated with this integral,

142
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,400
the integral over one period.

143
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,146
What does it mean?

144
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:37,278
Let's suppose that we have a motion 
of a particle that is periodic,

145
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:44,031
for example, the motion of this particle 
in the presence of a magnetic field.

146
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,336
Then we evaluate this integral,

147
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:54,127
and we find that 
this integral is constant,

148
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:59,590
even when you change

149
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:03,243
slowly an external parameter 
that could be, for example,

150
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:10,065
the magnetic field. Even when you change 
this external parameter slowly,

151
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:18,506
then what you find is that although 
the trajectory of the particles can change

152
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,631
because the magnetic field is

153
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:25,678
changing, then this parameter [the action] 
will remain constant.

154
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:31,035
What we say is that that is 
an adiabatic invariant in the sense

155
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:37,825
that it will be constant if the change 
of the external parameter

156
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:44,956
is slow in comparison to the period, 
to the frequency of the

157
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:49,749
motion.

158
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,622
Okay, in the case of the magnetic moment,

159
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:04,432
let's see how we can apply this theorem, 
that the analytical mechanics gives us.

160
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,578
We can take q equal to x

161
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:14,198
and we will take one direction 
perpendicular to B

162
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,044
and the conjugate moment 
will be given by m vx.

163
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,965
Now if we evaluate the action of

164
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:32,224
this coordinate x and it's conjugate 
moment m vx, what do we have?

165
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:37,812
This will be given by m vx,

166
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:43,150
this expression here, we can divide and 
multiply by dt

167
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:48,994
which is therefore equal to m vx² dt,

168
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:54,329
and the integral over a gyro-period 
can be written as the integral

169
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:59,118
from time zero to time 2π / ωc

170
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,902
and then we can write vx² as v⊥² ...

171
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:15,764
and then with the oscillating component 
ωc t plus a gyro-phase [φ]

172
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:21,735
this will need to be integrated over time,
and by doing this integral,

173
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:23,508
what do we obtain?

174
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:31,254
It's (π m v⊥²) / ωc .

175
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:37,388
Which is 2π m / |q|

176
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:46,739
by expliciting the cytron frequency,
and this is equal to 2π m

177
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:52,042
divided by the absolute value 
of the charge times μ,

178
00:15:56,346 --> 00:16:00,549
which is exactly the magnetic moment

179
00:16:02,574 --> 00:16:04,604
besides a constant factor.

180
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:11,383
Therefore, what do we learn from 
this theorem of analytical mechanics?

181
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:15,367
That the magnetic moment remains constant.

182
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:21,986
This quantity remains constant here, 
even if the magnetic field can vary

183
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:28,832
in time, it can vary in space, 
then if this variation is slow

184
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:35,791
with respect to cyclotron period,
and despite the fact that the trajectory

185
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,650
of the particle may change,

186
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:41,934
this quantity will remain constant.

187
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:48,618
In the present module, we have focused 
our attention on the trajectory

188
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:52,028
of a particle in a fairly simple scenario.

189
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:55,436
The one of a constant uniform 
magnetic field.

190
00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:01,450
We've pointed out that in this case 
the trajectory of the particle

191
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,373
is helical.

192
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:08,358
And by looking at the trajectory 
of this particle,

193
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:12,404
we've pointed out what are the magnetic 
properties of a plasma.

194
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:18,082
In particular we have shown that 
the plasmas are diamagnetic media

195
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:23,100
and we also talked about 
the magnetic moments.

196
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:28,664
We've shown that magnetic moments 
are actually adiabatic invariants

197
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:30,623
of the particle motion.

198
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,379
In the next module, we will consider more
complicated electric and magnetic fields.

199
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:41,129
We will look at what is the trajectory 
of the charge particles in this.
