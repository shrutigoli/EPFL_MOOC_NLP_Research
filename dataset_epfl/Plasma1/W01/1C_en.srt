00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:06,013
Welcome!

2
00:00:06,013 --> 00:00:09,387
Welcome to the Plasma Physics
course of the EPFL.

3
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:10,858
In the past module,

4
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:13,941
we started to introduce
the rigorous definition of a plasma.

5
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:18,681
We have introduced
the definition of the Debye length

6
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:22,657
and now, today,
with the present module

7
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:27,367
it's time give a look at
the last two definitions that we need,

8
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:32,894
the one of <i>plasma frequency</i>
and <i>collision frequency</i>.

9
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:37,049
These two definitions will allow us
to draw the conclusion

10
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,640
and draw the parameter space of plasmas.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,136
We start at the beginning, with
the definition of plasma frequency.

12
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:47,134
We consider a simple scenario,

13
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:52,786
let's consider a plasma 
that is a slab of electrons

14
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:57,406
with number density n₀.

15
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:07,798
We will assume that ions
are a fixed background

16
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:13,991
with the same density as the electrons.

17
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:20,883
And then we will displace the electrons
with respect to the ions by a certain ∆x.

18
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,868
So what is the situation here?

19
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:36,040
We have the ions

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,032
and the electrons,

21
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:49,314
and the electrons have been displaced
with respect to the ions by a certain ∆x.

22
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:52,631
What we want to evaluate

23
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:57,001
is the frequency
of the resulting oscillations.

24
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:05,206
The electrons have been displaced

25
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:09,366
and therefore they will tend to be

26
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:13,526
attracted back towards the ions.

27
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:15,807
And these, as we will see,

28
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:18,969
will cause an oscillatory motion
of the electrons

29
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:23,909
with respect to
the background fixed ions.

30
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:25,795
And what we want to evaluate

31
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:29,113
is the frequency
of this resulting oscillation.

32
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:34,583
The first thing that we have to do
is to evaluate the electric field.

33
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:44,064
We do it by solving Gauss's law.

34
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:48,927
Now, what is the charge
that is present in our system?

35
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:55,419
Well, we will have a region
where the charge is positive,

36
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:02,801
then a region
where the charge is about zero,

37
00:03:04,222 --> 00:03:09,482
and then a region
where ρ will be negative.

38
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:16,022
This will be the first region,
second region and third region.

39
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:23,191
What we are mostly interested in
is the electric field in region 2.

40
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:29,041
Now, if E is equal to zero

41
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:33,819
at the left end, here,

42
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:42,496
then in region 2,
by integrating the Gauss Law

43
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:51,684
we will have that E = n₀ e ∆x / ε₀

44
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:56,045
I have integrated the charge
that is present in region 1

45
00:03:56,045 --> 00:04:00,885
because of the displacement
of the electrons towards region 3.

46
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:08,274
We can now write the equation of motion
for the electrons

47
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:14,768
as we know the electric field
that they will be subject to

48
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:20,708
and that the acceleration of the electrons
times the mass

49
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,642
will be equal to the force

50
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:27,952
that is -e E.

51
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:36,333
This will be equal to minus-
with what we have just evaluated

52
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:42,863
n₀ e²
divided by ε₀, [times] ∆x.

53
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:56,787
Which implies that the second derivative
with respect of time of displacement

54
00:04:56,787 --> 00:05:01,493
depends on a quantity
that goes linearly with ∆x.

55
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,266
This is actually the equation
of an oscillator,

56
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,672
an oscillatory motion equation

57
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:16,252
with a frequency that is given
by this term, here.

58
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:19,095
This is a frequency squared.

59
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:25,907
It's an extremely important quantity
in plasma physics that has a name.

60
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:30,075
It's called the <i>electron plasma frequency</i>

61
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:35,035
and it's typically denoted
with ωpe.

62
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:45,736
So, a couple of observations;

63
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:52,156
The plasma frequency,
which we have just introduced here

64
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:58,496
is the square root of (n₀ e²)/(ε₀ me).

65
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:03,874
It can be written as,
--by dividing and multiplying by Te--

66
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:13,613
as the product of these two functions.

67
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:19,668
And the first one, if you remember,

68
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:24,410
is a quantity that we have just introduced

69
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,367
and is exactly equal to
one over the Debye length,

70
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,793
the electron Debye length.

71
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:34,441
While the second one
is what we are used to seeing

72
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:38,445
as v thermal of the electrons (vth).

73
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:41,006
So there is a easy correlation

74
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:44,305
between the plasma frequency
and the Debye length

75
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:49,162
that passes through
the thermal velocity of the electrons.

76
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:56,162
Second observation;
how much is the plasma frequency?

77
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:03,151
Well, in Hertz,
the frequency of the plasma oscillation

78
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:10,011
can be written as 8,980,
square root of n₀,

79
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:17,105
where, n₀ has to be expressed
in particles per cm³.

80
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:25,095
Before going to the details
of the collision frequency in plasmas

81
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:30,103
let's try to remind us how
collisional processes can be described.

82
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:36,043
Let's imagine that we have 
a certain density of target particles,

83
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:40,260
we will call it ntarget,

84
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,723
and then an incoming particle,
for example, an electron

85
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:48,080
that enters, moves towards
these target particles

86
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,488
with a certain velocity, vin.

87
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:57,018
Now, each part of this particle
as seen from the electron, coming in,

88
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:02,681
will have a collision area
that we will denote with σ.

89
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:07,383
This is also known as a cross-section.

90
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:15,123
Now, the frequency of collisions

91
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:20,113
will be proportional
to the density of the target

92
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,500
times the collisional area
of each target particle,

93
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,200
the cross section, σ
times the incoming velocity.

94
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,739
The faster the electron goes
through this target,

95
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:38,732
the more particles
it will effectively see

96
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:41,120
in the unit of time.

97
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,730
Therefore, the higher
will be the collision frequency.

98
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:49,626
Now, an electron
moving throughout a plasma,

99
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,506
what kind of collision
can it have?

100
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:56,476
Well, it can have collision with neutrals,

101
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:06,541
and the collision frequency associated
to the collisions with neutrals [νcoll]

102
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:11,219
will be given by the density
of the target particles,

103
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:15,017
- it will be the neutral density [nn] -
times the incoming velocity

104
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:20,507
which can be approximated as the
thermal electron velocity [vth,e]

105
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:23,636
times the cross section [σ].

106
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:28,383
For neutral collisions
the cross-section can be very close

107
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:33,083
to the Bohr size of the atom.

108
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:42,032
More precisely, π a₀² where

109
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:45,861
a₀ , the Bohr radius,

110
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:51,731
is the order of 1x10⁻²⁰ m².

111
00:09:56,232 --> 00:10:00,052
But the electrons can also
do Coulomb collisions,

112
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:04,392
collisions with other charged particles.

113
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:13,773
And for example, an electron
can impact against another electron

114
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,790
while moving,

115
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:21,080
and its trajectory can be deviated
because of the Coulomb force.

116
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:27,139
This interaction,
this deviation, becomes important

117
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:33,032
when the Coulomb interaction energy
is comparable to the kinetic energy.

118
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:50,341
And how can we estimate
the Coulomb interaction energy?

119
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:55,701
Well, we can introduce
the impact parameter.

120
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:01,664
Basically the distance
of closest approach

121
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:06,657
that we will denote with b.

122
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:09,579
[b = closest approach] if the particle
would continue

123
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:13,489
along its unperturbed trajectory,

124
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:16,830
and therefore
the Coulomb interaction energy

125
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,719
will be given by e² / (4 π ε₀ b )

126
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:30,839
and kinetic energy will be
of the order of me (vth,e)²

127
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,763
from which we obtain that the 
deflection the electron

128
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:40,406
impacting against another electron

129
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:44,973
will become important when
this ratio is about one,

130
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:48,188
which means when the impact parameter

131
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:59,721
is about
e² / (4 π ε₀ me vth,e²)

132
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:03,926
And this, for reasons
that will become clear later,

133
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:08,536
it's what we tend to call b_π/2,
- b 90 degrees- parameter

134
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:16,835
And now we have all the elements
to estimate the collision frequency

135
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:18,617
due to Coulomb collisions.

136
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:21,038
It's a very rough estimate.

137
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:26,167
We will look more into the
details of the collision frequency,

138
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:29,207
of Coulomb collision frequency
later in the course,

139
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:35,187
but basically each particle, each electron
can be associated with an area,

140
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:40,077
with a radius b_π/2

141
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,926
and the collision frequency
will be given by

142
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:52,020
the electron density [n₀] times
the incoming velocity of the particles

143
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,322
- which can be assumed to be
the thermal velocity [vth,e] -

144
00:12:55,322 --> 00:13:03,002
times the cross section
that is π b_π/2².

145
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:08,467
And if we plug in the numbers
that we have just evaluated here

146
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:34,034
this will be equal to
( π n₀ vth,e e⁴ ) / (16 π² ε₀² me² vth,e⁴ )

147
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:37,121
which is also equal to

148
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:55,143
( n₀ e⁴ ) / (16 π ε₀² me² vth,e³ )

149
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,147
Now in the rest of the present lecture

150
00:13:58,147 --> 00:14:02,526
we will actually neglect
the collisions with neutrals

151
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:09,016
and we will take into account
only Coulomb collisions,

152
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:15,638
which are the most interesting collisions
you can look at in a plasma.

153
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:21,533
It is now time to put everything together;

154
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,946
the three definitions
that we have just given,

155
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,402
Debye length, plasma frequency,
collision frequency,

156
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:30,644
to find out where we actually
find plasma in nature,

157
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:35,494
in which parameter regime
plasmas can be found.

158
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:40,340
I'll briefly recall the definition
that I have given.

159
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,040
Plasmas are ionized gases, 
globally neutral,

160
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,140
that display collective effects.

161
00:14:53,961 --> 00:15:00,515
The two key concepts, we had said, were 
<i>globally neutral</i> and <i>collective effects</i>,

162
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:04,935
so let's review them in view
of what we have just introduced.

163
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:14,834
Globally neutral: that means

164
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,548
that the size of the plasma

165
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:21,188
has to be much larger
than the Debye length.

166
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:25,560
This is, in fact, the Debye length,

167
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,320
the scale length at which
quasi-neutrality can be violated.

168
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:36,278
And this will also tell us
that the plasmas are,

169
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:38,987
not really neutral,
but what we typically say

170
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:42,104
are quasi-neutral on scale lengths

171
00:15:42,104 --> 00:15:46,954
that are larger or of the order
of the Debye length.

172
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:53,557
This is in fact the scale length
at which any charge is screened

173
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:58,539
and therefore its effect is not felt
farther away.

174
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:05,649
Second concept is the one
of collective effects.

175
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:10,419
And this implies two things.

176
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:16,219
On the one hand we need to have
that one-to-one interactions are weak.

177
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,381
We want the plasma to interact

178
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:22,018
through collective
electric and magnetic fields

179
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:25,906
that are generated collectively,
as I was saying,

180
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:30,406
and NOT that the interaction
pass through collisions

181
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:33,709
due to one-to-one particle interaction.

182
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:36,439
And this, as we have seen

183
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:43,819
occurs when the number of particles
in a Debye cube is much larger than one.

184
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:48,787
But it also implies one other thing,

185
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:54,927
that the frequency,
collective motion of the plasma,

186
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,490
is larger than the frequency
of collisional processes.

187
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,314
And using the definition
that we have just introduced

188
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:09,186
of the plasma frequency
and the collision frequency

189
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:13,566
we have that this is given by

190
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,900
the plasma frequency

191
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,670
times [the inverse of] the collision 
frequency that we have just derived.

192
00:17:29,454 --> 00:17:33,736
And if we put these
under the same square root

193
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:36,823
we find that--

194
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:42,983
which can be written as--
introducing the Debye length,

195
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:46,454
as sixteen pi.

196
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:51,254
The Debye length cubed,
this is actually the Debye length cubed--

197
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:56,887
times n₀.

198
00:17:56,887 --> 00:18:00,405
And this is equal to 16 π ,

199
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:02,972
this is the number
that we have seen already seen

200
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:07,443
many times today, ND

201
00:18:07,443 --> 00:18:11,045
and this has to be
much bigger than one.

202
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:12,816
In other terms,

203
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:15,346
both these conditions
lead us to say

204
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:22,456
that plasma is an ionized gas
for which <i>ND</i> is much bigger than one.

205
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:31,247
We introduce also another parameter, g,

206
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:38,206
that is defined as one over 1/ND
and this has to be much smaller than one

207
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:42,081
and this is
the so-called plasma parameter.

208
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:45,859
So, when do we have a plasma?

209
00:18:45,872 --> 00:18:49,052
We have a plasma when ND
is much bigger than one.

210
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:54,412
Let's see on a plot that represents
temperature and density

211
00:18:54,427 --> 00:18:57,160
when this actually occurs.

212
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,990
We can represent the temperature
in Kelvin

213
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:11,900
and the density in electrons
times centimeters to the minus three.

214
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:21,507
And we will have--
let me put some scale.

215
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:29,125
The first line that I can draw

216
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:35,325
represents when <i>ND</i> is equal to one.

217
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:41,143
The second line I draw

218
00:19:41,143 --> 00:19:45,701
is for ND = 1. x 10¹⁰.

219
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:52,887
Therefore plasma will lie above
this part of the plane,

220
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:56,813
they need to have ND >> 1

221
00:19:56,813 --> 00:20:01,553
and in this part of the plane
we can find all the plasma we know

222
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:05,545
in the universe.

223
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:10,795
The solar corona, for example,
lies in this region.

224
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:17,674
Ionosphere, plasmas in the ionosphere

225
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:22,754
are located here in the parameter space.

226
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:27,697
Magnetospheric plasmas are here.

227
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:36,433
Plasmas used for fusion application
lie in this region.

228
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:42,528
And then, for example, gas discharges,
they are here.

229
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:46,525
These are the plasmas
that we will actually consider

230
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,755
throughout our course.

231
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:51,808
Let me point out one thing
that is important

232
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:54,069
for the remainder of the course,

233
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:59,039
it's that in the range
of parameters considered

234
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:06,525
we can ignore, first, relativistic effects,

235
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:13,789
second, quantum effects.

236
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,550
The goal of the present lecture

237
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,867
was to give
a rigorous definition of a plasma.

238
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:20,682
We have said that a plasma--

239
00:21:20,682 --> 00:21:23,857
a plasma is a ionized gas
which is globally neutral,

240
00:21:23,857 --> 00:21:26,463
and that displays collective effect.

241
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:27,933
What does it mean?

242
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:30,997
Well, to answer this question
we have introduced three definitions.

243
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:35,530
The first one is the Debye length,
plasma frequency and collision frequency.

244
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,759
In working around those
we have pointed out

245
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,726
that the plasma is globally neutral

246
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:43,750
when its size is larger
than the Debye length,

247
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,821
on the one hand,

248
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:46,800
and on the other hand,

249
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,460
which displays collective effect
when there are a number of particles

250
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,016
in a Debye cube
that is much larger than one.

251
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:58,326
Under this condition,
particles in an ionized gas

252
00:21:58,338 --> 00:22:01,909
do not interact
through one-to-one interaction,

253
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:03,799
through one-to-one collision,

254
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,940
but rather through
the electric and magnetic field

255
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,614
that they have collectively generated.

256
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:14,271
Based on this observation,
we have drawn in a parameter space

257
00:22:14,271 --> 00:22:17,451
represented by density and temperature,

258
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:23,851
what ND (number of particles
in a Debye cube) equal to one line falls.

259
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:28,990
And we have made sure that
the plasmas we know in nature

260
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:32,765
fall in a region above this line,

261
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:34,627
and this is actually the case.

262
00:22:34,627 --> 00:22:38,456
And we have localized
in this parameter space

263
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,635
where the plasmas
that we will use

264
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:44,255
and we will look
throughout this course are.
