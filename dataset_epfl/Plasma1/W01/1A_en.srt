00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:06,719
Welcome!

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,457
Welcome to the Plasma Physics
Course of EPFL.

3
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:13,723
My name is Paolo Ricci, I am here
at the EPFL,

4
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,391
professor in Theoretical Plasma Physics

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,771
and today I would like to tell you
what a plasma is

6
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:24,221
and where plasmas can be found,
in nature and the laboratory.

7
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:29,091
I will briefly tell you
what the word <i>plasma</i> means

8
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:34,771
and I will go with you
through a brief history of plasma physics.

9
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,257
So, what is a plasma?

10
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:45,407
Well, we all know that
if you increase the temperature of a solid

11
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:49,289
then you can destroy
the crystalline lattice structure

12
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,016
and you can end up with a liquid

13
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:56,805
If you furthermore increase
the temperature of the liquid,

14
00:00:56,805 --> 00:01:03,215
then the kinetic energy
of the atoms increases

15
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:06,658
and the distance between atoms
also increases

16
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:09,188
and what you end up with
is a gas.

17
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:12,582
Solid, liquid, gas;

18
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:15,651
the three states of matter
that we all know.

19
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:19,169
But what happens when you increase
furthermore the temperature,

20
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:23,806
let's say beyond 10,000 Kelvin,
just to give a number?

21
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:27,456
Well, then the kinetic energy
of the atoms of the gas

22
00:01:27,456 --> 00:01:33,106
becomes so high that when they collide,
the electrons can be stripped away.

23
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:39,212
Matter becomes a collection
of ions and electrons.

24
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:43,488
This is what we call <i>plasma</i>,
the fourth state of matter.

25
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,054
Plasma is therefore ionized gas,

26
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:49,988
that can be reached
if the temperature of the gas

27
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:55,028
is sufficiently high that the electrons
can be stripped away from the atoms.

28
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:59,031
We deal most of the time
in our everyday life

29
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:01,677
with gases, liquids, solids.

30
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:05,672
So, where are plasmas?
Where can plasmas be found?

31
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:08,312
Well, actually there are
a number of examples

32
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:10,518
of plasmas in nature and in the laboratory.

33
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:15,778
To start with, stars.
Stars are made of plasmas.

34
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:20,000
As a matter of fact,
most of the visible matter in the Universe

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,275
is in the plasma state.

36
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,625
But there are also examples
of plasmas in nature

37
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,194
on our planet.

38
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:31,151
Here is a lightning: this is a plasma,
and there are other examples

39
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,034
that can be found on our planet.

40
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:39,294
For example, the aurora borealis
is a beautiful evidence of plasmas

41
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:41,730
that can be found on our planet.

42
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,950
And there are also man-made plasmas,
neon lamps are an example of plasmas.

43
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:54,724
And this is not it, because
in a number of laboratories worldwide,

44
00:02:54,724 --> 00:03:00,104
matter is heated at very high temperature

45
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:04,865
in order to reproduce
the nuclear fusion reaction

46
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:06,994
that occurs in a star.

47
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:09,911
Here is, for example, one of these devices

48
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:14,728
that is used to heat up matter
at such a high temperature,

49
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:18,938
the TCV tokamak in Lausanne.

50
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:22,863
The idea of using on our planet
the fusion reaction

51
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:27,250
that occurs in a star to produce energy

52
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:35,319
that is clean, sustainable,
without emission of greenhouse gases,

53
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,588
nor of long-lived radioactive waste.

54
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:44,658
We have mentioned stars,
we have mentioned neon lamps.

55
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:48,226
Clearly these are very different systems,

56
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:52,276
characterized by
very different temperatures, densities.

57
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:57,721
Well, in reality the plasma state
spans a huge range

58
00:03:57,721 --> 00:04:01,151
of temperature and density.

59
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:04,842
If we look at what is the state of matter

60
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:09,372
as a function of density and temperature,

61
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,087
density which we measure

62
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:13,287
in particles per meter cubed,

63
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,543
and temperature,
which we measure in Kelvin,

64
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:26,456
we observe that the solid, liquid
and gaseous state

65
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:32,162
occupy a very small portion
of this huge parameter space.

66
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:36,251
All the rest is occupied by plasmas.

67
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:39,901
At very high density
and high temperature

68
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:45,571
one can find that the plasma state
is present in the solar core.

69
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:50,653
At slightly smaller density
but a higher temperature

70
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:55,133
one can find that plasmas that
are found in machines that are used

71
00:04:55,142 --> 00:05:00,252
for obtaining the nuclear fusion reaction
on our planet.

72
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:05,732
And solar corona
is at slightly smaller density

73
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:07,992
and temperature.

74
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:13,662
Neon lamps are at similar density
but lower temperature.

75
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:17,108
And the temperature
comparable to the solar corona

76
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,022
but at lower density,

77
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:24,925
one has the plasmas
that are found in nebulas

78
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,389
or in the solar wind.

79
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,875
And at even lower temperature,
one can have plasmas

80
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,759
that are found in the interstellar space.

81
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:38,037
And the word <i>plasma</i>,
where does it come from?

82
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,524
What does it mean?

83
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:43,349
It's actually a Greek word
that means 'a moldable substance,'

84
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:45,532
'jelly'.

85
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:50,142
It was given by Irving Langmuir,
a Nobel Prize winner,

86
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,752
one of the pioneers in the study
of Plasma Physics.

87
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:57,843
He was studying mercury arc discharges

88
00:05:57,843 --> 00:06:01,623
and found that this substance, the plasma,

89
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:07,593
was diffusing in the vacuum chamber
as a jelly in a mold.

90
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:14,308
So, when did scientists start
to work on plasma physics?

91
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:19,718
The earliest studies date
to the 1920s, 1930s.

92
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:24,262
A few of these scientists,
among which Irving Langmuir,

93
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,200
who I was citing,

94
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,284
started to work on ionospheric plasmas

95
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:33,194
because these were affecting
radio transmission,

96
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:38,510
and at the same time,
on the gaseous electron tubes,

97
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:41,647
these were devices that were used,
for example,

98
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:47,688
to rectify current
in the era before semiconductors.

99
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:53,003
In the 1940s, Hannes Alfvén,
another Nobel Prize winner

100
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:55,320
working on Plasma Physics,

101
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,986
discovered the magnetohydrodynamic
plasma waves, now called Alfvén waves,

102
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:05,115
these are the fundamental waves
in plasmas

103
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:09,346
and Alfvén proposed that
they had an impact

104
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,766
on the dynamics
of astrophysical plasmas.

105
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:17,424
But the largest development
of plasma physics

106
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:21,990
came in the 50s where a few countries,

107
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,500
the United States, the United Kingdom,
Soviet Union,

108
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,734
started to work on
magnetic fusion research.

109
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:36,174
Basically, on reproducing the reaction
that occurs in the stars

110
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:37,901
to produce energy.

111
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:42,533
This was initially an offshoot
of the nuclear weapons program.

112
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:50,832
However the progress in this research
was much slower than initially thought.

113
00:07:50,832 --> 00:07:54,491
And research, which up to that moment

114
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:59,711
had been classified and carried out
independently by these three countries,

115
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,492
was unclassified

116
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:07,460
during the Second UN Conference
on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy

117
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,695
that took place in Geneva in 1958.

118
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:19,493
In general, the development of devices
which could reproduce on our planet

119
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:21,806
the fusion reaction
that occurs in the stars

120
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:25,947
has been the strongest drive
to the study of plasma physics.

121
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:30,494
The mainstream avenue, research avenue
that has been followed,

122
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:34,314
is one of the construction
of the tokamak device.

123
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:38,087
Starting from the earliest device,
a number of tokamak have been built

124
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:39,240
in the world.

125
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,573
For example,
I'm showing here the TFTR tokamak

126
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:45,306
that was built in the United States,

127
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:48,692
or the largest existing tokamak
in the world,

128
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:52,748
the JET tokamak,
which is in the United Kingdom.

129
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:58,328
Along with the mainstream tokamak
approach, a number of other approaches

130
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:00,321
have been followed
in order to make

131
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:02,163
energy from fusion a reality.

132
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:04,241
And just to mention two of those,

133
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:08,397
the Stellarator,
here is the W7-X Stellarator

134
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:09,707
in Germany,

135
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:14,017
or the National Ignition Facility
in the United States.

136
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:17,952
And nowadays, the ITER device.

137
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:21,027
The ITER device is a tokamak,

138
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,807
the largest experiment
that is being built on our planet

139
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:29,958
with the goal of showing that
it's feasible to use the fusion reaction

140
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,078
to produce energy on our planet.

141
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:39,246
And together with the development
of fusion devices

142
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,579
the study of space
and astrophysical systems

143
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:45,444
has been a strong drive
for plasma physics.

144
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:49,758
Starting from the 60s,
satellites have been launched

145
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:53,627
and have provided us
with a huge amount of data

146
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:56,607
on the activity of the solar surface,

147
00:09:56,613 --> 00:10:01,613
of the solar wind or the dynamics
of the earth and magnetic fields.

148
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:07,319
And these have become
key areas for plasma physicists.

149
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:08,906
At the same time,

150
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:12,545
plasma physicists
have devoted their attention

151
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,539
to the study of astrophysical systems.

152
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:18,680
Just to give an example,
the astrophysical jets,

153
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,526
the jets that are shot out
from the stars,

154
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:25,896
from active galactic nuclei
or from black holes.

155
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,049
But this is not it!

156
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:33,929
Since the 80s, industry
has made massive use

157
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:37,312
of technologies based on plasmas.

158
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:42,542
Here are examples of where,
in our everyday lives,

159
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:45,543
plasma technology enters.

160
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:48,705
Starting from the plasma TVs
that we all know.

161
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:54,565
Well, the semiconductor industry
makes a huge use of plasma physics.

162
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:59,365
And also the plasma deposition technology

163
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:02,135
is used on many of the materials

164
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:06,220
that we encounter
in our everyday life.

165
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,750
Plasma medicine is a growing field
of plasma physics.

166
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:17,761
Let me conclude this
first module of the Plasma Physics course.

167
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:22,395
This module has been devoted to
introduce the plasma state.

168
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:27,175
Plasmas are ionized gases
which can be found in the Universe

169
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:28,640
much more frequently

170
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,510
than what our everyday experience
would suggest.

171
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,906
Now, why do we study plasma physics?

172
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:40,063
Well, the main drive
of plasma physical research

173
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:43,029
has been provided by fusion.

174
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:47,058
Fusion research, the quest
for a source of energy

175
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:51,850
which is clean, sustainable,
with no production of greenhouse gases

176
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,837
nor of long-lived radioactive waste.

177
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:59,596
But understanding plasma physics
is essential to uncover the dynamics

178
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:02,114
of astrophysical systems.

179
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:07,524
And plasmas are playing a crucial role
in industry today.

180
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:10,854
Let me conclude-

181
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:14,805
Let me conclude by saying
that studying plasma physics

182
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:16,828
is extremely challenging.

183
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:20,671
From a theoretical point of view,
dealing with plasma

184
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:26,541
means dealing
with electrically charged particles

185
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:30,501
which move under the effect
of the electromagnetic field

186
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,084
that they have themselves produced.

187
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:37,176
It means dealing with a complex,
non-linear medium,

188
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:43,426
and therefore, the most sophisticated
numerical techniques,

189
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:48,149
the most advanced computers
that exist today in the world,

190
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:52,341
advanced analytical techniques,
they have all been used

191
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:55,650
to uncover the dynamics of plasma.

192
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,960
From an experimental point of view,
well, as you can imagine,

193
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,069
taking measurement of a plasma
is very difficult,

194
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:10,849
it's not possible in most cases,
to stick probes inside a plasma.

195
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:12,301
Its temperature is too hot.

196
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:16,104
And therefore to infer
what's going on inside a plasma,

197
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:21,634
one has to use smarter ways,

198
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,853
which typically require
a multidisciplinary approach.

199
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:32,337
Well, disentangling
the complex physics of plasmas

200
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:36,542
will be the objective of this course.
