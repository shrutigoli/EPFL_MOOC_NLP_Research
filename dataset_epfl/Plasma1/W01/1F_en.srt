00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:09,317
Welcome to the plasma physics
course of the EPFL.

2
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:12,513
How can we confine a plasma?

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,688
Today we will address this question.

4
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:18,616
We will use the concept
that we have introduced

5
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:24,283
into past lectures to describe
single particle trajectories

6
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:26,904
in a given electromagnetic field.

7
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:31,076
We will see that particles
can be confined in devices

8
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:33,944
that are characterized
by open field lines,

9
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:37,404
the so-called magnetic mirrors,
and also devices

10
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:43,482
where magnetic field lines are closed,
such as the stellarators and tokamaks.

11
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:46,363
So how can we confine a plasma?

12
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:49,857
We've seen that in the presence
of a magnetic field

13
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,960
particles follow a trajectory
that is basically a helix.

14
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,651
Therefore a magnetic field
provides confinement

15
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:09,124
in the direction perpendicular to it
but not in the direction along it.

16
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:33,264
So if we want to confine plasma
we have to somehow limit

17
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:35,552
the loss of charged particles

18
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:40,555
that occur along the magnetic field.

19
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:42,503
This can be done in two ways.

20
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:47,672
The first one is still to use
open field lines

21
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:53,924
but reducing the losses
along the magnetic field

22
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:56,532
by noticing that there is a force,

23
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,212
that acts on magnetic moments,

24
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:05,082
that can in principle limit 
the flow of particles

25
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,723
along the magnetic field lines.

26
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:11,733
In fact, associated
with each charged particle,

27
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,413
there is a magnetic moment

28
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:18,322
and there will be a force,
one that I have written here,

29
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:20,887
that actually acts on it

30
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:25,115
and can limit the flow of particles.

31
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:29,819
For example, if we have
a two-ring current,

32
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:38,003
we will create an axially 
symmetrical magnetic field,

33
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:41,691
here I [drawed] axis of symmetry,

34
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:46,613
which will be characterized
by field lines that have

35
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,303
the following shape.

36
00:02:54,957 --> 00:03:00,090
In this configuration, there is a gradient
of the magnetic field

37
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,270
and particles will feel a force
that can push them

38
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,562
towards this central region,
confining the particles also

39
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:15,032
in the direction parallel
to the magnetic field.

40
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:18,924
This is the principle that is used
by magnetic mirrors.

41
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,638
The second possibility is to use
closed magnetic field lines.

42
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:34,559
In fact, if we close 
the magnetic field lines,

43
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:39,460
basically we avoid the losses
that occur at the end of those.

44
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:44,363
This configuration can be done,
for example, if we create

45
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:48,823
a toroidal device — 
that's a donut-shaped device —

46
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:53,746
here I will just represent 
a section of it.

47
00:03:56,328 --> 00:04:00,180
So this device will extend
over the full angle

48
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,020
and here I am just drawing half of it.

49
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,264
We will have a system of current
that will run in this direction.

50
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:17,897
By doing this, we will have
magnetic field lines

51
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:23,914
that will run 
throughout this toroidal device,

52
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:28,098
this donut-shaped device,
and will create

53
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:32,169
closed magnetic field lines
which in principle perfectly confine

54
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:37,537
the charged particles, as the losses
at the end of the magnetic field lines

55
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:41,452
are avoided by closing the field lines.

56
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:44,212
This is the principle that is used

57
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:48,308
in devices such as tokamaks
and stellarators.

58
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,113
So let's give a look more into the details

59
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:56,434
of how an open field line 
magnetic configuration

60
00:04:56,434 --> 00:05:00,833
can actually work
and how can it confine particles,

61
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:05,519
and similarly for the closed 
magnetic field line configuration.

62
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:11,861
So let's start with the description
of the particle confinement

63
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,627
that is provided by a magnetic mirror.

64
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:19,071
As we will point out,
only a certain category of particles

65
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:22,385
can actually be confined
by this configuration.

66
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:27,622
So let's look at a cross-section
of the magnetic mirror.

67
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:31,683
We will have the two coils
that provide the current

68
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:34,465
that generates the magnetic field.

69
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:38,929
The magnetic axis will be here

70
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:46,431
and the magnetic field lines will,
as we have seen just before,

71
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:48,332
have the following shape.

72
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:57,646
Along the axis of symmetry
there will be a point

73
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:00,162
where the magnetic field is minimum.

74
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:04,362
That is here, at the center
of the magnetic mirror,

75
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,519
and a point where it's maximum,

76
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:12,462
that is here where 
the current rings are located.

77
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:19,198
What we are dealing with is
therefore an axially symmetrical system.

78
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:26,669
For its description, as is
typically the case

79
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,673
for an axially symmetrical system,
it is useful to use

80
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,861
a cylindrical coordinate system

81
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:38,695
with coordinates r, theta, and z.

82
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:44,401
R is the distance from the axis,

83
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:48,357
z is the coordinate along the axis,

84
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:53,764
and theta will be the direction,
the angle around the axis.

85
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:59,377
We will focus on particles
with the guiding center

86
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,326
that falls on the axis.

87
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:08,599
Basically, particles that gyrate

88
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:19,272
What we are going to do
can be easily generalized

89
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,540
along the magnetic axis.

90
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,548
to particles that are 
not exactly on the axis,

91
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:25,933
but just move 
along the magnetic field lines

92
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,840
that are around the axis.

93
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:32,433
It's just that the algebra
is much more complicated.

94
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:38,978
Now, the [inaudible] B force is acting
in the direction perpendicular

95
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:41,002
to the magnetic field lines.

96
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:44,358
And as the magnetic field lines
are not straight,

97
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:47,135
they are actually curved, we expect

98
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:51,912
that a force will act in this direction,

99
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:56,257
therefore with a component
along the z direction

100
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:59,332
that can actually confine the particles.

101
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:04,281
Let's look at the z component
of the force, which is the one

102
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:09,452
that is actually able to confine
the particles axially, and we will have

103
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:12,875
this component F(z),

104
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:17,603
which is the z component
of the [recource b] force.

105
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:23,450
If one does the calculation,
it is found to be equal to q,

106
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,719
the absolute value of the charge,

107
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,550
times v(⊥) interradial magnetic field.

108
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:40,102
Now since the magnetic field
is divergence-free

109
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,912
and here I have written to divergence

110
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:48,015
in terms of the cylindrical coordinates

111
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:52,146
we are using, then we have
data with an approximation

112
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:56,896
that are valid in this system
that is B(z) much larger than B(r).

113
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:05,426
B(r) on axis equal to zero.

114
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,500
By integrating this expression
with this hypothesis, we find

115
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:17,956
that B(r) is equal

116
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:21,580
to [(- r/2) (dB(z) / d(z))],

117
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,645
which, as b(z) is much larger 
than b(r), can also be written

118
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:33,325
as [-r/2 modulus of gradient of b].

119
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:38,577
This expression can be replaced here,
used to replace b(r),

120
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:44,991
and what we obtain is
that f along the z component

121
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:54,383
is equal to [-qv(⊥)B(r)]

122
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:57,105
replaced with this expression.

123
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:02,101
Now r is the distance

124
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:10,371
of the particle from the axis

125
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:15,334
and this is approximately 
the Larmor radius.

126
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,982
If we replace the expression

127
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:28,122
of the Larmor radius
into this formula here,

128
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:29,953
we have that this is equal

129
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:36,394
to [-(mv⊥^2(2b))]

130
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:38,836
times the gradient of b.

131
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:43,573
Here we recognize the magnetic moment.

132
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:51,380
We have basically retrieved
the formula[ic] expression of the force

133
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,902
acting on a charged particle
which is associated

134
00:10:55,902 --> 00:11:00,020
to a magnetic moment
that we have just drafted

135
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,122
in the previous slide.

136
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,143
So there is actually a force
that basically, I think, to confines

137
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:12,813
the particles in this central region
of the magnetic mirror.

138
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:16,750
What are the particles
that are therefore actually confined

139
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,743
by this configuration?

140
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:26,929
All of them, or just
some particular particles,

141
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:29,152
categories of particles?

142
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:34,767
To address this question,
the first thing that we point out

143
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:38,467
is that as we have seen
in the previous lecture,

144
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:43,921
the magnetic moment is a constant
of the particle motion.

145
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:47,239
[Therefore 1/2]

146
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:53,447
(mv(⊥)^2)].

147
00:11:54,157 --> 00:12:00,043
At the center of the magnetic mirror,
at the location of B(min) —

148
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:06,816
minimum magnetic field —
divided by the magnetic field,

149
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,612
B(min), this will be equal

150
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:16,124
to the same quantity evaluated

151
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:19,709
where the magnetic field is maximum.

152
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:26,517
Here I am denoting with c and e

153
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:30,084
the particle velocity at the center

154
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,849
of the magnetic mirror and at the edge.

155
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:41,108
So with v(⊥)c and v(⊥)e,
two perpendicular velocities

156
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,552
at B(min) and at B(max).

157
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,363
We will use a similar notation

158
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:50,490
for the parallel velocities.

159
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:56,877
There is another quantity
that is conserved.

160
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,726
That is kinetic energy.

161
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:01,232
Therefore

162
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,206
the kinetic energy at the center 
of the magnetic mirror —

163
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,989
of the particles located
at the center of the magnetic mirror

164
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:17,311
will be equal to the same quantities
evaluated when the particles

165
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:20,462
is at the edge of the magnetic mirror.

166
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:29,707
So when is a particle confined?

167
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:32,699
A particle is confined if it is reflected

168
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:35,991
while moving towards the end

169
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:38,683
of the magnetic mirror.

170
00:13:39,446 --> 00:13:41,886
The particle is reflected if,

171
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:50,940
while moving towards B(max),
therefore towards the end

172
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,280
of the magnetic mirror,
[B(ǁ)] vanishes —

173
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:05,085
that is, if the kinetic energy
becomes only equal

174
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:07,765
to the perpendicular kinetic energy.

175
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:11,178
What does this mean in practice?

176
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:17,744
For particles to be reflected, 
the magnetic moment

177
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:25,489
that is equal to 1/2((Mv⊥c^2)

178
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,483
divided by B(min)),

179
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:35,626
which, as we have seen 
here, is equal to ...

180
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:45,682
1/2((Mv(⊥)e^2)/B(max)),

181
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:50,157
this has to be greater

182
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:55,007
than the same quantities

183
00:14:55,007 --> 00:15:00,117
where we have actually added
the parallel velocity.

184
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:06,419
This quantity here is actually
the kinetic energy

185
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:14,039
divided by the maximum magnetic field.

186
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:21,575
The kinetic energy can be expressed
here by using the quantities

187
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:24,227
at the the center of the magnetic mirror.

188
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:33,098
Now we can compare

189
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:37,817
[this quantity] with this one

190
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,336
and what we obtain is 
that a particle is reflected

191
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:49,074
if the ratio

192
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,442
between the perpendicular
velocity at the center

193
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:56,922
of the magnetic mirror
and the total velocity

194
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:04,281
is larger than the ratio 
between B(min) and B(max).

195
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:10,501
In other words,which are 
the particles that are confined?

196
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,492
We can represent the particles

197
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:19,097
as they are at the center
of the magnetic mirror,

198
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:28,602
drawing the v(⊥)c

199
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:33,409
and [v(||)c] axes.

200
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,952
This equation here

201
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:41,084
will point out that there are two lines

202
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:47,999
that will define the region 
in [inaudible] space

203
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:50,540
where the particles are lost

204
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:56,281
along the magnetic field lines,
that is, here — these are

205
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,757
the so-called loss cones.

206
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:03,574
The regions in [faith] space
which are the ones

207
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:09,413
that I am pointing out
where particles are actually confined

208
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:14,230
while moving along the axis
of the magnetic mirror.

209
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,665
An example of a magnetic field mirror
is provided in nature by the Earth —

210
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,620
the dipolar field of the earth.

211
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:27,285
Earth is surrounded
by a dipolar field

212
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:30,081
and there are charged particles

213
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:35,401
that move, subject to the presence
of this magnetic field.

214
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:39,662
Particles therefore stream
along the magnetic field lines

215
00:17:39,662 --> 00:17:41,711
because of the Lorentz force

216
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:49,838
and once they approach the magnetic poles
the feel a stronger magnetic field

217
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:52,401
which actually pushes them back.

218
00:17:55,398 --> 00:18:01,626
This of course leads to an acculumation
of charged particles in this region

219
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:04,064
of the Earth's magnetic field.

220
00:18:06,434 --> 00:18:12,364
So we have seen that by using
an open field line configuration —

221
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:17,204
the magnetic mirror — one can confine
a certain class of particles.

222
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:22,811
If we were able to close 
the magnetic field lines,

223
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,168
which in principle
is not extremely complicated,

224
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:32,225
then in principle we would be able
to completely eliminate the losses

225
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:34,796
at the ends of the magnetic field lines.

226
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:40,899
But unfortunately, as we will see here,
things are not so simple

227
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:47,168
and it is not so easy to confine particles
by using closed magnetic field lines.

228
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:54,486
To see that, let's consider
the toroidal device

229
00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:58,258
that we were sketching previously

230
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:03,240
where a set of coils carrying a current

231
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,779
create the magnetic field lines
that are closed.

232
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:21,317
According to Ampère's law, 
the intensity of the magnetic field

233
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:26,228
that is created 
by these current-carrying loops

234
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,652
is given by [inaudible][zero] —

235
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:36,661
the number of current-carrying coils —

236
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:41,923
divided by 2πi, the current
carried by each of the coils,

237
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:44,170
divided by r, where r

238
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:51,395
is basically the radius of curvature

239
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:53,218
of the magnetic field lines.

240
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,651
This implies that the magnetic field
is not homogeneous, and it's curved.

241
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,293
Drifts are therefore present.

242
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:13,465
Which drift?
The curvature drift, first of all...

243
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:23,254
and the [grad B] drift.

244
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:34,201
So what is the dynamics
of a particle subject to these drifts?

245
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:38,018
In other words, what is
the particle dynamics

246
00:20:38,018 --> 00:20:40,119
in a purely toroidal field

247
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,562
such as the one that I have drawn here?

248
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:50,992
Let's take a cross-section
of this toroidal device

249
00:20:51,774 --> 00:20:56,944
that I am drawing here
with the magnetic field lines

250
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:01,918
that are coming out from the plane.

251
00:21:04,812 --> 00:21:10,433
What we have is that the [grad B]
will be in this direction

252
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:16,292
and also -rb, the curvature
of the magnetic field lines

253
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,002
will be in this direction.

254
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:22,081
Therefore, if we evalute

255
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:26,699
the curvature drift
and the [grad B] drift,

256
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:30,710
we will see that they all,
both of them, are going

257
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,978
the same direction.

258
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:36,505
What does it mean?

259
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:40,867
Well, the two drifts [will] sum up

260
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:47,634
and they will induce motion

261
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:52,956
of the particles that will depend 
on the charge of the particles.

262
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:58,051
Particularly, what we will observe
is that charged particles —

263
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:03,225
a positively charged particle
will drift towards the bottom

264
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:09,680
of the device, while negatively 
charged particles

265
00:22:10,418 --> 00:22:14,372
will drift towards the top
of the device.

266
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:23,414
This will imply, as charge
will tend to accumulate,

267
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:31,424
that a region with negative charges
will be created on the top

268
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:37,122
of the device, and a region
with positive charges

269
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,305
at the the bottom of the device.

270
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:43,591
This will actually generate
an electric field

271
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,180
in the vertical direction.

272
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:49,409
In the presence of a magnetic field,

273
00:22:50,226 --> 00:22:53,758
this will give [origin]
to our [Icarus B] drift.

274
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:59,172
That will lead to a loss 
of confinement of the particles

275
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:03,164
from the device.

276
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:08,372
In other words,
a purely toroidal magnetic field

277
00:23:08,372 --> 00:23:13,054
is not able to confine particles,
charged particles.

278
00:23:13,723 --> 00:23:18,502
An [Icarus B] drift will be generated,
which will lead to a complete loss

279
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:20,578
of particles from the device.

280
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:24,814
So what is the solution to this problem?

281
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,104
It is to create 
a poloidal magnetic field,

282
00:23:28,938 --> 00:23:31,513
a magnetic field in the poloidal plane,

283
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:36,599
if you wanted the plane 
perpendicular to toroidal B,

284
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,934
and the goal
of this poloidal magnetic field

285
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:45,811
is to short-circuit
the charge accumulation.

286
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:51,707
This can be done — 
first possibility —

287
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:54,489
by driving a current inside the plasma.

288
00:23:56,429 --> 00:23:58,925
This is what is done in tokamaks,

289
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:03,678
as you will see in future lectures,

290
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:09,152
or by breaking the axial symmetry,

291
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:13,272
which is what is done in stellarators.

292
00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:15,395
How can we confine a plasma?

293
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:17,123
This is the question
that we have addressed

294
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,594
in today's lectures

295
00:24:18,594 --> 00:24:22,998
by using the concept 
of single-particle trajectory

296
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:25,996
that we have learned
in the past lecture.

297
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:31,941
A magnetic field can confine particles
in the direction perpendicular to it.

298
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:36,286
But the particles flow very rapidly
along the magnetic field lines,

299
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:38,921
and therefore in this direction
cannot be confined.

300
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,582
We've pointed out two strategies
to avoid this problem.

301
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:46,852
The first one is to create
a gradient of the magnetic field

302
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:51,501
and this confines particles,
is actually able to confine particles,

303
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:53,871
and is what is used in magnetic mirrors.

304
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:58,182
However, only a certain class of particles
depending on the ratio

305
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:02,884
of perpendicular 
and parallel velocity, can be confined.

306
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:06,797
The second approach is
to close the magnetic field lines.

307
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,322
In this way we avoid

308
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:14,185
losses in the parallel direction.

309
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:19,602
However, we have pointed out
that a [purely] toroidal magnetic field

310
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,866
is not sufficient to confine particles.

311
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:26,017
More complicated configurations,
such as the one realized

312
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:30,794
in stellarators 
and tokamaks, are necessary.

313
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:37,865
We have just given a brief introduction
to the confinement of plasma

314
00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:40,343
in this lecture, and there will be

315
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:44,241
a number of lectures in the future
that will be devoted

316
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:47,452
to this specific aspect
of plasma physics.
