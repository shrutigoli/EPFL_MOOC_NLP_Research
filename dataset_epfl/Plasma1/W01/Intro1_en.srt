1
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:02,784
When a gas is heated
above a certain temperature,

2
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:07,074
or it is subject to strong
electromagnetic fields, it gets ionized,

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:10,230
and a transition towards
the so-called fourth state of matter,

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,250
plasma state, is observed.

5
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:16,498
Being constituted by electrical charges,
ions and electrons,

6
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:19,197
a plasma responds
to electric and magnetic fields

7
00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:22,312
including those
that are produced by itself.

8
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:25,232
It actually turns out the plasma
is an extremely complex medium

9
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:27,614
characterized by non-linear phenomena

10
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:30,952
that occur over a very wide range
of temporal and spatial scales.

11
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:35,471
Understanding the plasma behavior
is thus extremely challenging,

12
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:38,520
and before turning our attention
to the applications,

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,124
it is necessary to disentangle,
at least partially, this complexity

14
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:44,464
uncovering together
some of the basic phenomena

15
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:47,235
that characterize the plasma state.

16
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:50,625
This is, in fact, the goal
of the first three lectures.

17
00:00:50,637 --> 00:00:52,282
These will be devoted to the study

18
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:54,909
of the most important
basic phenomena in plasmas

19
00:00:54,909 --> 00:01:00,334
and to the models that are typically used
to describe the plasma dynamics.

20
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,694
A warning: these studies will require

21
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:05,427
the use of relatively advanced
analytical techniques.

22
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:10,263
This might result tough at first,
but your efforts will be rewarded.

23
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:13,425
During the first lecture
you'll be introduced

24
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:16,532
to the basic concepts
related to the plasma state.

25
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:20,310
A rigorous definition
of plasma will be given.

26
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,617
The most important spatial-temporal scales
for the plasma will be introduced.

27
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:29,426
The trajectory of electrically
charged particles will be evaluated

28
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:32,004
in assigned electromagnetic fields.

29
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:37,173
As you will see, this is already enough
to shed some light on a principle

30
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:39,074
behind the confinement of plasma,

31
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:41,822
for example,
for fusion energy applications.

32
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:44,433
This lecture will be given
by professor Paolo Ricci,

33
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:47,244
the head of the theory group at CRPP.
