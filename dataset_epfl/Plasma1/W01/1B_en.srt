1
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:06,075
Welcome.

2
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:09,857
Welcome to the Plasma Physics
course of the EPFL.

3
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:12,668
In the past module,

4
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:17,354
we have given a very short introduction
of the plasma state.

5
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:22,016
It's now time to become a bit more precise

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,967
and to give a rigorous definition
of plasma.

7
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:29,659
In order to do that, 
we need the three definitions:

8
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:32,044
first one is the <i>Debye length</i>,

9
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:34,735
the second one is the <i>plasma frequency</i>,

10
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,889
and the third one 
is the <i>collision frequency</i>.

11
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:41,171
In the present module, 
we will focus on the Debye length.

12
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:47,502
Plasma frequency and collision frequency
will the focus of the next module.

13
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,447
By using these three concepts,

14
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:54,618
we will see what is 
the parameter space of plasmas.

15
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:59,821
So let's start. Let's start by giving
the definition,

16
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:02,403
the rigorous definition of a plasma.

17
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:06,404
Plasma is an ionized gas.

18
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:10,489
This is what we have pointed out
during the first lecture

19
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:15,274
Now, let me be more rigorous 
about what a plasma is.

20
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:20,294
It's an ionized gas 
that is globally neutral

21
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:23,531
and that displays collective effects.

22
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:33,126
Two key words: the first one 
is <i>globally neutral</i>,

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,246
and the second one is <i>collective effects</i>.

24
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:40,376
What do they exactly mean?

25
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:45,115
Well, to address this, 
we need to give three definitions.

26
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,676
The first one is the one of Debye length.

27
00:01:51,516 --> 00:01:54,807
The second, is the one 
of plasma frequency,

28
00:01:56,557 --> 00:01:59,501
and the third one 
is of collision frequency.

29
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:04,035
Once we have given 
these three definitions,

30
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:08,496
we will be able to see 
where plasmas can be found in nature.

31
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:14,820
In the present module, 
we will focus on the Debye length.

32
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:22,871
And in the next one, we will look at 
plasma frequency and collision frequency.

33
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:27,887
Okay, let’s start by giving 
the definition of Debye length.

34
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:31,215
In order to do that, 
we will consider a simple scenario;

35
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:36,011
the one of a plasma that 
is initially neutral.

36
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,325
As a matter of fact, plasma comes from
the ionization of matter.

37
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:47,409
We expect in a plasma that the number
of negative charges is equal

38
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:50,111
to the number of positive charges.

39
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:53,530
Now in this plasma 
that is initially neutral,

40
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:58,091
we insert a charged particle, 
a test charge.

41
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:02,708
And what we study 
is the electrostatic potential

42
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,602
that forms around this test charge.

43
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:13,099
As we will see in finding out 
what this electrostatic potential is,

44
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,682
a length will appear 
which is the Debye length.

45
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:24,560
So let’s start by considering plasma 
that is initially neutral, and therefore,

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,098
for which the electron density
is equal to the ion density,

47
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:34,348
and is equal to n₀.

48
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:41,626
We will assume that we are dealing
with singly ionized ions

49
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:45,554
therefore that Z,
the number of positive charges

50
00:03:45,554 --> 00:03:48,941
per ion, is equal to 1.

51
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,666
We have therefore a system

52
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:55,629
where there are a number of ions
and of electrons,

53
00:03:57,014 --> 00:04:00,187
which have the same density.

54
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:04,742
And what we do in 
this initially neutral plasma,

55
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:09,942
is to introduce a charge,
that we will call a <i>test charge,</i>

56
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:11,865
with charge qt,

57
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:16,139
and we want to learn about
the potential

58
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,934
that will form around this test charge.

59
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,609
And we want to learn what about

60
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:26,445
the potential that will form around
this test charge.

61
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:29,289
Well, to answer this question,

62
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,566
what we have to do is to solve 
a Poisson's equation,

63
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:36,708
where the laplacian square of Φ

64
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:41,215
is equal to the charges present 
in the system

65
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:47,082
that are given by the test charge 
that is located r = 0,

66
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:52,323
plus the charges of the ions
that will depend on r,

67
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:55,997
and the the charges of electrons.

68
00:04:56,861 --> 00:05:01,005
Well, in order to make some progress,
we have to somehow state

69
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:06,254
what are the ion 
and the electron densities.

70
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:14,095
For the ions, we say that they are heavy.
When we introduce the test charge,

71
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:17,627
they are so heavy that they don't move,

72
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:20,352
so as a first approximation
we can assume

73
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:24,439
that they constitute 
a fixed positive background

74
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:29,306
with therefore, an ion density
that is constant

75
00:05:29,306 --> 00:05:31,130
and will be equal to n₀

76
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:33,263
How about the electrons?

77
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:36,199
The electrons are light,
and therefore they move.

78
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,101
We have to write down
an equation of motion

79
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:42,546
if we want to study where they will go.

80
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:45,953
This will be given by the electron mass

81
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:49,919
times the derivative
of the electron velocity,

82
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,645
This will be equal to the forces
acting on the electrons

83
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:57,724
which are given by the electric field
and the pressure.

84
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:04,134
Now, pressure can actually be written
in terms of temperature and density

85
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,032
through the <i>Boltzmann constant</i> KB

86
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:14,138
In order to simplify the notation
in plasma physics,

87
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,213
we tend to agglomerate

88
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:19,487
the Boltzmann constant 
inside the temperature

89
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:26,703
and therefore we'll redefine KB
times the temperature T,

90
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:29,341
simply as the temperature.
KB T -> T.

91
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:32,476
Therefore temperature
will actually be measured

92
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:37,830
in terms of energy, Joules [J]
or electron volts [eV] , for example.

93
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:40,604
Now, to make some progress,

94
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:44,337
this is already a fairly 
complicated equation,

95
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,855
we make some hypotheses.

96
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:53,219
The first one is that
the electrons are very light.

97
00:06:53,219 --> 00:07:00,440
They basically respond immediately
to the insertion

98
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,763
of this charged particle into plasma,

99
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:09,707
which corresponds basically
to take the limit of the electron mass

100
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:13,564
to go to zero. 
Second hypothesis: we will assume

101
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:18,755
that the electric field is given by
minus the gradient

102
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:20,935
of the electrostatic potential

103
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:26,943
and finally, we will assume
that electrons are isothermal,

104
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:31,085
therefore, the electron temperature
is about constant.

105
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,186
What is the consequence 
of this hypothesis?

106
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:38,206
The left-hand side will be equal to zero.

107
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:46,479
And this will be given by the
gradient of the electrostatic potential,

108
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:47,991
the electric field.

109
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:55,035
Then we will have 
the pressure term contribution

110
00:07:55,035 --> 00:08:00,953
where we can assume that the 
electron temperature Te is constant.

111
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:06,731
We can bring everything 
under the same grad symbol

112
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:13,535
and therefore we will have that e∇ϕ 
minus Te [times ∇ne/ne]

113
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:20,862
and we will write that this ∇ne/ne as the
gradient of the [natural] logarithm of ne.

114
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:23,117
Well it is as to be equal to zero.

115
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:32,926
Which means that (eϕ-Te log ne)
has to be equal to a constant,

116
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:38,550
which means that the electron density
will be given by

117
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:45,006
n₀ exp (eϕ/Te),

118
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:51,700
where the constant has been determined by
expecting that

119
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,788
when there is no perturbation, 
--no electric field--,

120
00:08:55,788 --> 00:09:03,050
the electron density will be equal to
the initial density, n₀.

121
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:06,674
Well, what does it mean 
if we insert this expression

122
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:10,050
for the ion density and electron density

123
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,224
into the original Boltzmann equation
that we were looking at ?

124
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:16,896
We will have that the laplacian of ϕ

125
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:20,414
will be equal to 1/ε₀ ...

126
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:23,182
we have to keep this charge,

127
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:29,581
and then we can place the expression
for the ion density

128
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:32,412
and the one for the electron density.

129
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:37,729
Now we can actually make an hypothesis
that we will discuss later

130
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:46,372
that eϕ/Te, this term here,
is much less than 1,

131
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,134
basically the perturbation is small.

132
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:56,357
If we do this hypothesis, we can expand
this exponential at the first order.

133
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:59,780
At the zero-th order, it will give us 1

134
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,490
therefore, positive 
and negative charges will cancel

135
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,026
and then we will have a term
that is linear in ϕ.

136
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:21,754
Basiscally, what we will find is -qt/ε₀
times the Dirac δ(r), plus e² n₀ ε₀ Te,

137
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,774
the term that comes from

138
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:28,417
the Taylor expansion 
of this term, times ϕ.

139
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:36,024
This will be therefore equal -qt δ(r)/ε₀...

140
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:40,394
If you look at this term here,

141
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:45,178
you'll find that this is the inverse
of a length square.

142
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:51,745
We call this length the electron
Debye length, λDe

143
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:58,626
and therefore this equation
becomes 1/λDe² ϕ

144
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:11,105
where the Debye length is equal to
the square root of (ε₀ Te)/(e² n₀)

145
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:14,557
This is the electron Debye length,

146
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:19,609
one of the most important quantities
in plasma physics.

147
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:21,997
So we have reduced the problem

148
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:25,859
of finding electrostatic potential 
around the test particle

149
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:30,707
to the solution of the following equation,

150
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:37,084
--where I have brought on the 
left-hand side, all the terms in ϕ--:

151
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:40,899
this equation can be solved.

152
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:43,722
I spare you all the details.

153
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:46,117
Well, let me just mention 
that one has to work

154
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:50,659
in spherical coordinates, but without
going into the details,

155
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:55,824
let me just give the solution 
of this equation that tells you

156
00:11:55,824 --> 00:12:01,569
that the electrostatic potential
will depend on the distance

157
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:12,503
from the test particle r,
as 1/(4πε₀) qt/r

158
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:18,309
times exp (-r / λDe).

159
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,578
And here we notice something interesting:
that the electrostatic potential

160
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:33,117
that we would expect for a charge
in a vacuum 1/(4πε₀) qt/r

161
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:37,428
is modified by the presence
of the plasma that is this term here,

162
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:39,295
by this exponential.

163
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:44,197
So how does this electrostatic potential
looks like if we try to draw it?

164
00:12:47,106 --> 00:12:50,951
Well, first of all let's plot 
that the standard Coulomb potential

165
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:58,999
1/(4πε₀) qt/r, 
it will have a shape like this one.

166
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,541
And if we plot the potential
that we obtain in a plasma,

167
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:09,581
we observe that there is an 
exponential factor here

168
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:15,957
who's argument is always negative,
which will provide screening.

169
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,181
Now where this screening
will become important,

170
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:26,284
is when we are at distances r
of the order of the Debye length.

171
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:32,323
This is when the deviation 
from the Coulomb potential

172
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:34,743
will become important.

173
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,511
So, what is the effect of the plasma?
It is actually to screen,

174
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:48,385
the potential 
that the charge particle

175
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:49,999
would have in vacuum.

176
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:54,416
What do we have here
which is the case of a plasma,

177
00:13:54,416 --> 00:14:00,595
is a screened potential that we will call 
<i>Debye screened potential.</i>

178
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:04,727
So let me make a few observations.

179
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,585
The first one is that in order 
to describe the plasma,

180
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:13,777
we have used concepts to like density.

181
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:21,429
If you want, we forgot about the fact that
charged particles in a plasma are discrete.

182
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,271
We have used a statistical approach

183
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:36,395
that makes sense only if 
inside of the volume given by λDe³,

184
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:41,087
there is a high number 
of electrons or ions

185
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:51,165
in other terms, if n, the plasma density
times λDe³,

186
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:56,282
this is what we will call <i>ND</i>,

187
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:59,358
number of charged particles
in a Debye cube,

188
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,227
is much greater than one. (ND >> 1)

189
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:09,582
Otherwise if this is not respected,
then the treatment that has lead to say

190
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:15,111
that the Coulomb potential is screened
with respect to in vacuum,

191
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:17,950
is not valid anymore.

192
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,990
We would have to look at the single,
discrete nature of the particles.

193
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:26,270
Second observation.

194
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,991
If we want to give an estimate 
of the Debye length,

195
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:35,941
this will depend basically
on temperature and density

196
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:46,697
and will be given by 6.9 square root of 
(Te/n₀) in cm

197
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:51,726
If you express
the electron temperature in Kelvin,

198
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:57,142
and the density in terms of particles 
per centimeter cube,

199
00:15:57,142 --> 00:16:04,719
or you can also express λDe³
as 7 x 10⁻²

200
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:10,492
√(Te/n₀) in meters.
Erratum: it should be 7 x 10⁻³ √(Te/n₀)

201
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:15,948
But in this case, you have to express
the electron temperature in eV

202
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:22,354
and the density in particles per m³.

203
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:26,169
So what is the conclusion?

204
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,307
What have we known by doing this exercise?

205
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,463
The first conclusion that we can draw

206
00:16:34,463 --> 00:16:38,313
is that in order to have a deviation 
from neutrality

207
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:41,142
or to be more precise 
from quasi-neutrality

208
00:16:41,142 --> 00:16:44,307
which is the initial state of system,

209
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:54,557
well, we need to have the electron density
which is given by n₀ exp (eΦ/Te)

210
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,545
becomes different from n₀.

211
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:05,964
This can occur only for distances
that are smaller than the Debye length.

212
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:11,896
In fact, at distances that are larger than
the Debye length, the perturbed potential

213
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,138
will tend to zero,

214
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:19,178
and therefore ne 
will tend to be equal to n₀.

215
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:28,072
Now let me point out that this procedure
requires to have ND >> 1.

216
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:35,058
There is a second conclusion 
that we can draw, which is quite important.

217
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:39,985
So let's go back to the hypothesis
that we have done in the previous slide,

218
00:17:39,985 --> 00:17:47,786
where we have assumed that eΦ/Te << 1.

219
00:17:47,786 --> 00:17:53,184
Well, does it make sense?
After all Φ goes to infinity

220
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:54,806
for r going to zero.

221
00:17:54,806 --> 00:18:01,543
But actually it doesn't make 
much sense physically to go to r=0.

222
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:06,933
There is minimal distance up to which

223
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:10,672
looking at this equation makes sense.

224
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:17,262
In fact, what we have to do
is to evaluate the electrostatic potential

225
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,648
at the minimal distance 
that makes sense to look at,

226
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:25,997
where therefore the Debye screening 
will not have not intervened yet.

227
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:31,479
And this minimal distance will be given 
by the typical distance

228
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,649
between particles in plasma,

229
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:40,148
which will be given by 
the cubic root of 1/n₀.

230
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:47,490
Therefore, if we want to evaluate
the eΦ/Te,

231
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:53,650
we can write this as -- 
use this expression for eΦ

232
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,511
with the minimal distance 
given by this expression

233
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:03,989
and then we can multiply 
and divide it by n₀ to the two-thirds,

234
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,406
we will get therefore the numerator n₀

235
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:17,039
and now we can recognize a quantity
that is the Debye length here,

236
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:25,494
in fact this will be given by 1/4π
one over the Debye length square,

237
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:30,271
1/n₀ to the two-thirds.

238
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:34,915
And here with this, this can be put
in relation with ND,

239
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:45,382
and this is equal to 1/4πND
to the two thirds.

240
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:51,493
And this is okay because 
we have already required that ND

241
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:53,773
is much bigger than 1.

242
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:58,553
The result will be much smaller than 1
as we've asked.

243
00:19:58,553 --> 00:20:00,532
So what is the conclusion?

244
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:06,756
Actually we can draw one consequence
from what we have just written here.

245
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:14,017
And this will be much, much smaller than 1

246
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:20,732
because we have already required that ND
is much larger than 1.

247
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:24,947
Well, actually by looking at this,
we can notice one thing:

248
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:31,461
it is that one to one interaction
between particles is weak

249
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:38,870
if eΦ/Te << 1,

250
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:44,538
which means for ND >> 1.

251
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:49,947
In fact if ND >> 1
then the electrostatic potential

252
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:55,016
that acts between two charged particles

253
00:20:55,016 --> 00:21:02,736
will be much smaller than 
the electron temperature,

254
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:09,090
and therefore, the one-to-one interaction
between particles will be weak.

255
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:16,395
In the present module, we have started
to introduce the fundamental concepts

256
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:22,193
that are required, in order to give
a precise rigorous definition of a plasma.

257
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:26,646
In particular, we have introduced
the concept of the Debye length.

258
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:32,115
We have see the quasi-neutrality
of a plasma is a concept

259
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:38,996
that makes sense at distances
that are beyond the Debye length.

260
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:42,008
Second thing, we have pointed out

261
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:50,463
that one-to-one particle interactions 
are weak, if the number of particles

262
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:54,063
in a Debye cube ND 
is much larger than 1.

263
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:58,662
In the next module, 
we will look at the definition

264
00:21:58,662 --> 00:22:01,329
of plasma frequency 
and collision frequency,

265
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:07,066
and through these we will fully understand
the rigorous definition of plasma

266
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:10,878
that we have given here in this module

267
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:15,983
and we will look at what is the 
typical parameter space of plasma.
