00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:07,986
Welcome to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,837
Today we will discuss
the heating of the plasma

3
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:12,246
to thermonuclear temperatures,

4
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:15,275
that is temperatures that are needed
for a fusion reactor to work.

5
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:18,637
We will start by discussing Ohmic heating,

6
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:21,954
that is the heating of the plasma
by an electrical current,

7
00:00:22,318 --> 00:00:24,590
and the limitations of that method.

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,607
Therefore we will illustrate
the need for additional plasma heating,

9
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:32,713
additional meaning in addition to
the Ohmic heating method.

10
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:35,873
We will then focus
on the first of the systems

11
00:00:35,873 --> 00:00:39,561
that they will consider for a reactor:
the neutral beam injection.

12
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,315
We will explore
the processes that take place

13
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:45,581
as the beam is injected into the plasma,

14
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:49,499
the components that are needed
for the beam-injection system,

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:55,433
the neutralization of the beam before
its injection to the tokamak plasma,

16
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:58,674
and the requirements
that the beam needs to satisfy

17
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:01,595
in order to be useable on large devices,

18
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,174
for example on the ITER Tokamak.

19
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,709
We will illustrate the example
of the NBI system

20
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:11,203
that is operational on JET,

21
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:16,233
and we'll say a few words about the design
of the NBI system for ITER.

22
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:19,815
Finally, we'll discuss
the advantages and disadvantages

23
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:23,707
of the NBI heating method
for a reactor in the future.

24
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:28,154
First I'd like to remind ourselves
that we need power

25
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:31,227
to initiate the plasma discharge,

26
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:34,676
that is to ionize the gas
that we inject into the tokamak.

27
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:37,962
That's fairly intuitive.

28
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:40,472
On the other hand, what may be
a little bit less intuitive,

29
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:42,779
is that we also need a certain power level

30
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,396
to overcome what's called
a <i>radiation barrier</i>.

31
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:49,893
The radiation barrier comes about because
the emission from light impurities

32
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:53,807
that are present in our gas,
and then in the plasma,

33
00:01:54,764 --> 00:02:00,391
has a maximum for temperatures
that are typically of a few tens of eV,

34
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:03,467
typically below 100 eV.

35
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:06,905
And if the power that we inject
into the tokamak

36
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:09,119
is lower than a certain critical value

37
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,431
that is associated
with this impurity emission,

38
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:16,063
then the temperature will never
be able to exceed this value

39
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,210
that corresponds to the maximum

40
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,953
of the emission of the light
by impurities.

41
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:26,848
Typically, for a midsize tokamak,
we have taken the example here

42
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:30,121
of, say, a two-meter major radius tokamak,

43
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:34,602
you need something like a megawatt
to fully ionize your gas,

44
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:36,545
to make the plasma,

45
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:42,590
and you need more than that,
something like 4-5 MW

46
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,346
to overcome this radiation barrier.

47
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:48,681
It's only after that level,
once the radiation barrier is overcome,

48
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:52,589
that we manage to keep
increasing the temperature

49
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,646
towards values that are
of interest for thermonuclear reactions,

50
00:02:57,086 --> 00:03:02,082
and the efficiency and therefore
the slope of the curve

51
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:04,915
of the increase of temperature

52
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:08,417
with the additional power
injected into the plasma

53
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:13,502
of course depends on the levels
of transport the plasma has, and so on.

54
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:17,527
As you remember,
the concept of tokamak is based

55
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:22,173
not only on external fields
that are produced by coils,

56
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,634
mainly in the toroidal direction,

57
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:27,879
but also by transformer action,

58
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:32,473
that is by swinging the flux

59
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:37,194
produced by the primary coil
of the transformer,

60
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:41,960
and therefore inducing
an electromotive force in the plasma ring

61
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:47,017
which therefore provides a drive
for a current through the plasma.

62
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,871
Now, as the resistivity,

63
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,337
as we have learned
in the first part of this course,

64
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:57,369
is proportional to T^(-3/2),

65
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,532
the profile of the current
that will be driven into the plasma

66
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:08,276
will be strictly related to the profile
of the temperature of the plasma itself.

67
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:11,152
So that's the first observation,

68
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:13,180
but the second observation
is even more important,

69
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,080
and that is that the Ohmic power,
let's call it Pohmic,

70
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,571
that I can dissipate into the plasma,
and in this case

71
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:22,514
I'd like to heat the plasma
by passing current through it.

72
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:27,299
is obviously equal to the loop voltage

73
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:31,086
that's generated
by this transformer action,

74
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:34,382
times the current
that flows into the plasma, Ip.

75
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:38,181
That's the resistance of the whole plasma,

76
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:40,872
times the current, square,

77
00:04:40,872 --> 00:04:44,048
and that is proportional
to the resistivity [Î·]

78
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,637
times the current density square,

79
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:50,048
so we will have a direct dependence
on the resistivity,

80
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:55,454
therefore it will have
a dependence upon T^(-3/2).

81
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,697
So if on one hand this current is
efficient in producing the poloidal field

82
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:05,189
and needs to complete
the magnetic field structure

83
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:08,419
for trapping the plasma into the tokamak,

84
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:16,461
this current is progressively more
and more inefficient at heating the plasma

85
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:18,273
as we increase its temperature.

86
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,798
We can therefore discuss why we need,

87
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:24,989
specifically, additional plasma heating.

88
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:27,760
I like to illustrate that
in a semi-quantitative way,

89
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:31,410
in a plot in which I represent vertically

90
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,312
the power corresponding to different
channels in the plasma, say in MW.

91
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:38,840
Say we take a logarithmic scale,

92
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,393
say 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 MW,

93
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:48,683
and I represent that as
a function of the temperature,

94
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:52,399
say in keV, of the plasma.

95
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,980
So we have just learned
that the Ohmic heating

96
00:05:55,809 --> 00:06:01,148
will go down with the power
of temperature to the 3/2,

97
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:04,412
so say it will take a curve of this kind.

98
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,387
I can also represent the horizontal axis
with a logarithmic scale.

99
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:20,834
This is 10 keV, and then say all the way
to the right we have 100 keV.

100
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:27,450
So the Ohmic heating power
goes down to a very low level

101
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:32,603
before the plasma can reach
the temperature of the order of 10keV.

102
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:36,938
The example taken here,
semiquantitatively, is an example

103
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,498
of a -say- 1 meter major radius tokamak.

104
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,954
So this is the Ohmic power,

105
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:48,477
going down with the power
of T, temperature.

106
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:53,327
Now, in a reactor
we will count at some point

107
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:59,061
on the power provided by the heating
due to the alpha particles

108
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:02,692
that are issued
by fusion reactions themselves,

109
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:06,203
and that will be coming about
when the plasma temperature

110
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:10,790
will be larger than a few keV's
so say it will be something like that.

111
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,910
So this is the alpha heating power.

112
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,633
And if we had no losses
it would be no problem,

113
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,997
because we would use the Ohmic power

114
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:24,604
all the way to the point,
which would be around a few KeV,

115
00:07:24,604 --> 00:07:28,492
where the alpha particle
heating would take over.

116
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:30,416
But, we of course do have losses.

117
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:34,516
We have losses in the form of radiation,
like bremsstrahlung,

118
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:41,757
but also losses in the form
of a convective and conduction transport

119
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:46,542
of ion and electron heat,
in particular, of ion heat.

120
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:53,936
So let's put even the lowest possible
loss power that we can have,

121
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:56,456
that of bremsstrahlung,

122
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,782
and in all the circumstances
we can think about in practice,

123
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:05,368
this bremsstrahlung level will be higher

124
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:08,644
than the level at which
the curve of Ohmic power

125
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:10,735
crosses that of the alpha heating power.

126
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:19,079
So even without invoking any transport
from conduction and convection,

127
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,381
which we actually know would
dominate the bremsstrahlung,

128
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:28,015
so I can even perhaps just trace it,

129
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:29,510
something like that,

130
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:32,301
just call it <i>heat transport</i>.

131
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:37,222
Even if we reduce that to a minimum level,
below bremsstrahlung level,

132
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:40,618
which would be, in practice,
very, very difficult to do,

133
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:43,016
we will have a gap, here,

134
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,493
that is a region

135
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:50,536
where we will not be able

136
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,322
to connect the Ohmic power
to the alpha heating power.

137
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:56,135
In other words, we have
a shortfall of power in this region,

138
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,869
which is in the region
of a few keV of temperature

139
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:05,787
where we need to do something,
and do something means

140
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:11,614
heating the plasma
by other means than Ohmic power.

141
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:16,751
So this gap needs to be filled
by what we call <i>additional heating</i>.

142
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:22,010
So let's briefly review what options
do we have for heating the plasma,

143
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,587
in addition to passing
electric current through it,

144
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,185
which is what we refer to
as <i>Ohmic heating</i>.

145
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:31,936
We may heat the plasma
by injecting a beam,

146
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:37,605
of very energetic neutral particles
that will become ions,

147
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:39,991
once they are entering the plasma.

148
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:45,204
And these particles will transfer
their energy and momentum

149
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:49,174
by collisions to the plasma particles,
and therefore will heat the plasma,

150
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:54,464
or we can inject waves into the plasma.

151
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:56,911
We have seen,
in previous parts of this course

152
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:01,077
that there are several possibilities
for waves to exist in plasma,

153
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:02,656
at different frequency ranges.

154
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:04,634
We can inject waves that resonate,

155
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:07,207
for example the electron species,
that would be high frequency,

156
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,823
or we can inject waves
that resonate with the ion species,

157
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:11,374
that would be lower frequency.

158
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:15,158
And in both cases, we can transfer
power from these waves,

159
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:19,102
that we can inject
using transmission lines

160
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:22,264
and antennas that are close to the plasma

161
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:26,106
to the plasma, therefore heating it
to thermonuclear temperatures.

162
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:31,225
Today, as we said, we will focus
on the first of these methods,

163
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:34,021
that is the neutral beam heating.

164
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,363
So the idea here is to inject, somehow,

165
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:42,150
energetic ions into the plasma,

166
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:45,521
that would give the energy
to colder plasma particles.

167
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:48,098
By energetic ions, we mean ions
that don't belong

168
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:49,948
to the thermal distribution
of the plasma itself,

169
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:53,776
so there should be much more energetic

170
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:56,676
than the energy corresponding
to the plasma temperature.

171
00:10:57,796 --> 00:11:01,440
But how can we inject a beam of ions

172
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:04,250
into a very complicated magnetic field

173
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,635
that we had actually prepared, and set up,

174
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:09,088
in order to avoid the leaking of plasma

175
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:11,351
out from our confinement volume.

176
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:15,433
Such field will of course prevent
the penetration of ions from outside

177
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:19,069
as it prevents the escape

178
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,637
of ions from inside.

179
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,745
So here's the idea: we can use
neutral particles at high energy

180
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:26,711
to get into the plasma,

181
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:29,183
because neutral particles of course
don't feel the influence

182
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:31,793
of the magnetic field
that provides confinement.

183
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:36,017
And then let them be ionized
by the plasma itself.

184
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:38,423
So once they are in the plasma,
they progressively become

185
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:41,071
a beam of energetic ions,
which then, in turn,

186
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:45,824
can transfer, by Coulomb collisions,
their energy to the plasma,

187
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:47,765
ions and electrons.

188
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:50,142
That's the idea of the neutral beam.

189
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,290
What are the main components
in a neutral beam?

190
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,135
In order to illustrate them I've taken
a very simplified, of course, layout

191
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:00,635
of the neutral beam injector
that we use on the JET tokamak.

192
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,158
Let's run through
the different elements here.

193
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:07,353
We have, of course, a source of gas

194
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:11,569
that's injected into the source
of ions for the beam,

195
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:14,625
in this example,
and in the injector in the JET,

196
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:20,217
the ions are positive ions
that are created by an arc discharge.

197
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:23,120
There are other options, in fact.

198
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,915
For example, one can use rf waves

199
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,235
to create the plasma

200
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:32,550
from which we extract
the ions for the injector.

201
00:12:33,642 --> 00:12:35,957
We'll discuss that option
a little bit later.

202
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:38,942
Then once we have a source of ions,

203
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:42,723
we need to extract
the ions and accelerate them.

204
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:46,105
But it's actually relatively easy
to accelerate ions,

205
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:50,523
or charged particles in general,
because they can be accelerated

206
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:53,728
by a set of electrostatic grids

207
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:57,405
that provide them with the energy

208
00:12:57,405 --> 00:13:00,553
corresponding to the potential difference
that we apply to the grids.

209
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,819
So now we have a beam of ions
that are highly energetic.

210
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,230
What we need to do is to neutralize them

211
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,383
before they are injected
into the tokamak system.

212
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:17,235
As we said, the ions will not be able
to penetrate into the tokamak volume

213
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:20,967
if they are still ions,
that is if they are still charged.

214
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,908
So we need a chamber
that neutralizes them.

215
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:28,351
We can inject a gas to do that,

216
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:31,800
and attach an electron
onto the ions, in this case,

217
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,289
because we were starting
with positive ions.

218
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:37,405
Of course this process
will not be 100% efficient,

219
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:40,591
so what we need to do is to get rid of
the ions that remain ions,

220
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,394
by deflecting them using a magnet

221
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:44,661
and by collecting them on an ion dump,

222
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:47,006
which will need to be,
of course, actively cooled,

223
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:52,047
and then in the presence
of a very high vacuum,

224
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:56,217
pass this beam of particles
that are still energetic,

225
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:58,203
because they were accelerated
once they were ions,

226
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:00,166
but they are now neutral,

227
00:14:00,564 --> 00:14:03,121
to, finally, the plasma.

228
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:07,934
We focus now on what happens
in the plasma

229
00:14:08,404 --> 00:14:12,244
once the neutral particles
at high energy are injected into it.

230
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:15,532
So we focus on the processes that occur

231
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:19,145
as the beam arrives into the plasma.

232
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:22,202
We have, essentially,
three possible processes.

233
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:25,105
First, we can have ionization by ions.

234
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,817
I take the example of a hydrogen beam,

235
00:14:30,817 --> 00:14:33,036
so the notation is a little simpler.

236
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:34,469
So I have the beam,

237
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:38,458
hydrogen particle, that's a neutral,

238
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:43,903
which encounters an ion,
a positive ion in the plasma,

239
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:45,537
and gets ionized.

240
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:48,150
So of course there will be the creation

241
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,570
of a positive ion in the beam,

242
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,354
and of a free electron.

243
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:56,990
We can also have ionization by electrons.

244
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,169
I still have my beam particle,

245
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:05,292
which in this case encounters an electron,
and gets ionized by it,

246
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,474
with, of course, the release
of an additional electron,

247
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:11,769
so we have two electrons
plus an ionized beam particle.

248
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:16,790
Or we can have a third process,
which we call a <i>charge exchange</i>.

249
00:15:20,363 --> 00:15:23,087
So here there is no direct ionization,

250
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:26,605
but there is an exchange of charge
between the neutral beam particle

251
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:29,027
and the plasma ion,

252
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:34,315
so that I have now an ionized
neutral beam particle,

253
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:37,728
and a neutral particle that was

254
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,652
that was an ion in the plasma.

255
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:44,877
So of course these are binary processes

256
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,967
that we can treat
as collisional processes,

257
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:53,255
that is, represent them in terms of
their effective cross section.

258
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:58,307
And the effective cross section
will tell us which process

259
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:01,480
is the most likely to occur,
depending on the parameters,

260
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,785
for example, depending on
the energy of the beam.

261
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:08,703
I noticed that the charge exchange process

262
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:12,111
will also lead to the emission of light,

263
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:14,957
and the emission of light
will contain the signatures

264
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:20,261
of the properties of the ion motion
in the plasma,

265
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,223
namely: ordered flows,

266
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:28,050
in terms of the Doppler shift
of the line emission,

267
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,148
or the thermal motion,

268
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:33,808
in terms of the Doppler broadening
of the line emission.

269
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:37,990
So the charge exchange process
is used also to diagnose

270
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,422
both ion velocities and ion temperatures.

271
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:44,980
Let's represent qualitatively
the cross sections

272
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,041
for the different processes.

273
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:51,405
And I do that as a function
of the beam energy,

274
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:56,021
and let's just take as a reference
a deuterium beam.

275
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,411
I consider a scale in keV,

276
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:04,437
say 10, 100 and 1,000.

277
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,398
That is one MeV in a logarithmic scale,

278
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:11,290
and on the vertical scale
I considered the cross section

279
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:14,812
in square meters.

280
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,843
Again, on the log scale, 10â»Â²Â¹, 10â»Â²â°

281
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:26,594
half way, and 10â»Â¹â¹ at the top.

282
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:33,171
So let's start with the process that has
the largest cross section at low energy,

283
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:36,246
and that is the charge exchange process.

284
00:17:36,877 --> 00:17:40,910
And qualitatively it has a cross section

285
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,948
that goes down with energy in this way.

286
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:50,325
So this is a charge exchange process

287
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:55,309
that we represent with
a cross section called Ïch (sigma_ch).

288
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:03,037
At high energy, we have the ionization
by ions that dominate.

289
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:06,353
And again, in a qualitative way,

290
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:10,050
I draw the cross section
for that, in green.

291
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,009
Let's call that Ïi.

292
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,821
What about the ionization by electrons?

293
00:18:13,821 --> 00:18:18,158
That, in general, is actually smaller,
or has a smaller cross section

294
00:18:18,158 --> 00:18:19,859
than the other two.

295
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,345
And of course its value will depend

296
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,880
on the electron temperature.

297
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,609
For example, for the case of 10 keV,

298
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:35,693
say I take the temperature
for the electron of 10 keV,

299
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:37,818
and this is the cross section

300
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:43,528
for electron ionization,

301
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:48,689
or better, for ionization
of the beam by electrons.

302
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:53,253
So we see that at low energies
the process is dominated

303
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:56,788
by charge exchange,
whereas at high energy,

304
00:18:57,222 --> 00:19:00,300
the dominant process
is ionization by ions.

305
00:19:01,691 --> 00:19:05,288
Now we are ready
to represent what happens

306
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:07,234
as the beam penetrates into the plasma.

307
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:09,301
We know what processes are happening.

308
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:12,886
We even know which ones are dominating,
depending on the energy.

309
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,454
So what's the evolution
of the beam intensity?

310
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:22,954
I can write the equation
that describes that

311
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:28,185
as the variation of the intensity
of the beam with distance --

312
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:31,124
and I write that in a one-dimensional way,

313
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:32,884
to keep things simple--

314
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:36,423
is equal to minus
the density of the targets,

315
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:38,967
that is the density of the plasma

316
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:42,446
times the cross section
for charge exchange,

317
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:44,716
[plus] cross section for ionization by ions,

318
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,881
and the term that corresponds

319
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,811
to the ionization by electrons.

320
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:53,113
Let's write that, that's <Ïe ve>,

321
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:57,257
integrated over the plasma distribution
divided by the beam velocity,

322
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:01,924
of course, times the intensity.

323
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,620
I just notice that
for the third term it's different,

324
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,538
because the dominant velocity
in the collisional process

325
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:11,646
is between the beam ions and the electrons

326
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:14,829
is actually that of the electrons.

327
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:17,803
What is the solution
to this kind of equation

328
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:20,083
is, of course, an exponential.

329
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:24,026
So let's say Iâ
is the initial intensity,

330
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:25,928
and the exponential is a function

331
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:28,770
of the penetration distance
into the plasma,

332
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,261
and is parameterized
by a parameter Î»,

333
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:37,426
that we can call the <i>penetration depth</i>.

334
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:43,153
So what we have is something like that.

335
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:49,138
As we say, x is the distance
into the plasma,

336
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:52,990
the intensity will go down exponentially

337
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,620
as we go into the plasma.

338
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,279
There's a point at which the density
is 1/e times the initial intensity,

339
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,319
corresponds to our penetration depth.

340
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:06,412
So what is Î» determined by?

341
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:11,168
We said that at low energy,
charge exchange dominates,

342
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,246
so the cross section
for charge exchange is much larger

343
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:21,739
both than Ïi
and then the equivalent term

344
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,318
for the interaction with electrons.
[<Ïe ve> / vb]

345
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:29,365
Therefore the penetration
depth in this case will be

346
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:32,491
1 over the density of the plasma,

347
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,041
times the charge exchange cross section.
[ Î» â¼ 1/(np Ïch) ]

348
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:39,344
At high energy, we have
a situation in which

349
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,076
it is the ionization
cross section for ions,

350
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,710
to ionize the beam,

351
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:49,582
that dominates,

352
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:55,368
therefore the penetration
depth will be given by

353
00:21:56,293 --> 00:22:01,581
1 over the plasma density
the ionization cross section for the ions

354
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:06,121
onto the beam particles.
[ Î» â¼ 1/(np Ïi) ]

355
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,800
I can now represent, in a plot,

356
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,865
as a function of the beam energy,

357
00:22:13,995 --> 00:22:16,314
the penetration distance

358
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,941
and diffraction of the beam
that remains neutral.

359
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:24,434
Say if we go from zero to one,

360
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:31,008
and we have something like
10, 20, 30, 40,

361
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:36,678
say 100 and 300 keV
of energy for the beam.

362
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:42,059
So my penetration distance
will go higher and higher

363
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,601
as I will increase the beam energy.

364
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,935
I represent this in meters,
so it will go to macroscopic distances

365
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:53,322
such as meter or a few meters,

366
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:56,846
as I increase the energy of the beam

367
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,728
above a few hundred keV.

368
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:04,002
I have a qualitatively represented
this curve with a knee,

369
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:08,655
and that knee corresponds
to the energy at which

370
00:23:09,474 --> 00:23:12,653
I have a transition between a process

371
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:14,847
that's dominated by charge exchange,

372
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:18,572
and a process that's dominated
by ionization by ions.

373
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,930
In this example, I consider qualitatively

374
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:26,467
a deuterium beam in a deuterium plasma.

375
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,647
Together with a penetration distance
increasing with the beam energy

376
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:35,651
of course we have the opposite effect

377
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:39,283
for the neutral fraction,

378
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:42,408
that is the fraction of the beam
that remains neutral, that will go

379
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:49,561
from almost 100% to almost 0%

380
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:53,186
as we go higher and higher in energy.

381
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:59,706
So one key point here is that
for plasmas that are large,

382
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:03,699
so we need to go to a meter or more

383
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:05,820
into the plasma with our beam,

384
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,239
we need to go to hundreds of keV or more

385
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:12,394
for the energy of the beam.

386
00:24:12,394 --> 00:24:15,891
So for large plasma
we need large beam energies.

387
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:18,978
The other point that
we need to be careful about

388
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:22,161
is that on the opposite,
for small plasmas,

389
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:26,716
we need, and we must use,
low beam energies.

390
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:32,338
Otherwise the beam will not
be absorbed by the plasma at all,

391
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,504
and will pass through the plasma,

392
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:39,110
and impinge on the walls
on the other side of the injection port,

393
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,545
and therefore potentially
damage the machine,

394
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:43,404
so that's so-called <i>shine-through</i>,

395
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:46,856
and the shine-through determines
the minimum plasma density

396
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:49,098
at which we can operate a beam.

397
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:51,643
Having established
what we need for the beam,

398
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:56,688
let's go back a little bit
to a key point in the beam system,

399
00:24:56,688 --> 00:24:59,241
that is the neutralization of the beam

400
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:02,877
before it's actually injected
into the machine,

401
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,246
into the tokamak.

402
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:07,930
And if we represent the efficiency

403
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,050
with which we neutralize the beam

404
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,220
as a function of the beam energy,

405
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,321
here it's in terms of keV
per atomic mass unit,

406
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:23,231
we notice that this efficiency,
which is decent at low energy,

407
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:28,261
say energy of the order
of 10, or 20, or 30 keV,

408
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:33,521
for hydrogen, for example,
it goes down very significantly

409
00:25:33,521 --> 00:25:35,993
as we go towards energies

410
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:40,072
that are of the order of 100 keV.

411
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,232
It goes down
for the case of positive ions.

412
00:25:43,232 --> 00:25:47,323
That's the case we have illustrated
in the example taken from JET,

413
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:52,439
and this is the same, or similar,
for the different species

414
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:54,477
that we have in the beam.

415
00:25:54,864 --> 00:25:59,392
So there's no way we can have a beam
of several 100s of keV,

416
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,960
hydrogen or deuterium,
with positive ions,

417
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,728
the reason being that
the neutralization efficiency

418
00:26:05,728 --> 00:26:08,492
will be very, very, very small.

419
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:09,920
What can we do then?

420
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,635
Well, we can look at the blue curve,

421
00:26:11,635 --> 00:26:14,322
which corresponds
to the neutralization efficiency

422
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:18,205
for beams made with negative ions,

423
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:21,423
and notice that although
that does go down some,

424
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:25,476
it remains at levels
that are still tolerable

425
00:26:25,476 --> 00:26:30,310
and compatible with the operation
of reactors, say at least 60%,

426
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:35,789
all the way up to say
an MeV for hydrogen here,

427
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:39,182
so all the way up to
the energy that we need

428
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:44,112
in order for our beam to reach
a penetration distance

429
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:45,624
of the order of a few meters,

430
00:26:45,624 --> 00:26:48,819
that is the size of ITER

431
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:51,695
and the future reactors that
we are foreseeing to have.

432
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:56,448
The reason for that is that
the neutralization for the negative ions

433
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,162
is much easier
because of the low affinities,

434
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:02,749
less than an eV, typically 0.75eV,

435
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:06,500
of the additional electron
that's attached to the hydrogen.

436
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:10,047
So because we need
large penetration depth,

437
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:12,793
and that implies large energy,

438
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,517
for large and dense plasmas
we therefore need

439
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:22,618
and <i>must</i> use negative ion beams.

440
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:25,188
So what happens in the plasma

441
00:27:25,188 --> 00:27:29,556
once we manage to get the beam into it?

442
00:27:29,556 --> 00:27:31,449
Well, the plasma, and that's of course

443
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,871
the reason why we do it, will be heated.

444
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:36,281
Let's look at that
a little bit more into the details.

445
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,614
So, where is the heating from?

446
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:41,252
The heating comes from the collisions

447
00:27:43,017 --> 00:27:48,392
between fast ions from the beam,
and plasma electrons or ions.

448
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:51,444
You have seen,
in the first part of the course,

449
00:27:51,444 --> 00:27:54,984
how one treats collisions,
in particular Coulomb collisions,

450
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:57,926
these are the ones we're considering now,

451
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:01,990
so the energy transfer
is of course what we want,

452
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,985
because that's corresponding
to plasma heating.

453
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:06,792
So how does that work?

454
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:12,426
We can represent this heating
in terms of power,

455
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:19,771
and that will be equal to minus
the energy deposited by the beam,

456
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:23,693
divided by a typical time

457
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:27,382
over which the particles
will be slowing down--

458
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:30,743
these are the suprathermal particles
injected by the beam,

459
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,629
we call that the <i>slowing down time</i>, --

460
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,757
times two therms,

461
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:38,659
one corresponding
to the heating of the electrons,

462
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:43,177
and the second one corresponding
to the heating of the ions,

463
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:46,148
so this is the part going to the ions.

464
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,747
The critical energy,

465
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:57,186
which we refer to as Ecrit
in this formula,

466
00:28:58,394 --> 00:29:02,500
is given by about 15 times
the electron temperature,

467
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:09,097
times the mass of the beam

468
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:10,664
divided by the electron density,

469
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:15,244
times the sum of
a different species of the density

470
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:22,332
ZiÂ² divided by the mass of the species,

471
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:26,716
and in most cases
this is not that different

472
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:29,629
from taking something like 15 times Te,

473
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:34,619
and that critical energy,

474
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:37,529
this critical energy is the energy

475
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:39,913
at which the heating of the electrons

476
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:43,655
is equivalent to that of the ions.

477
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:45,977
So we can have say two situations,

478
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:51,010
if the beam energy
is much larger than the critical energy,

479
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:55,271
the heating will be mainly on electrons.

480
00:29:57,554 --> 00:30:01,419
Whereas if we have the opposite situation

481
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:04,933
the heating will be mainly of the ions.

482
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:09,410
Now this will be the case
of future large devices,

483
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:16,146
whereas this is the case
of present devices.

484
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:22,414
So we have seen that the heating
of the plasma comes about

485
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:26,044
because we inject neutrals at high energy

486
00:30:26,044 --> 00:30:28,138
that become energetic ions,

487
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:33,523
typically at present we inject energies
of the order 100 keV,

488
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:36,874
in ITER we will inject energies
of the order of 1MeV.

489
00:30:38,217 --> 00:30:41,459
The injection geometry is also
an important parameter

490
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:45,745
because that determines the character
of the orbits of these energetic ions.

491
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,632
If the injection is tangential,

492
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:52,122
that is as parallel as possible

493
00:30:52,122 --> 00:30:54,936
to the toroidal direction,

494
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,094
we will start with mostly passing orbits,

495
00:30:57,094 --> 00:31:00,244
that is orbits,
as you can see in this movie,

496
00:31:00,244 --> 00:31:03,919
that are circulating around the tokamak,

497
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,894
but of course there
will be some collisions,

498
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:08,608
and the collisions scatter
the circulating particles

499
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:11,645
into trapped orbits, as you can see,

500
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:16,493
not only from the representation
in real space on the left,

501
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:19,875
but also from the representation
in the velocity speeds on the right,

502
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:25,906
where the ions are going from passing,

503
00:31:25,906 --> 00:31:29,318
to being trapped by collisional effects,

504
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:34,144
this is a simulation in a realistic
tokamak environment.

505
00:31:34,537 --> 00:31:36,708
So these are the characters
of the orbits that we have

506
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:41,821
for the fast, or energetic ions
that are injected from NBI.

507
00:31:42,512 --> 00:31:45,975
That's important not only for the heating

508
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:50,482
and the possibility of driving
a non-inductive current in the plasma

509
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:55,630
with these energetic particles,
but also for the potential interaction

510
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,142
that these particles can have
with plasma instabilities

511
00:31:58,142 --> 00:32:01,554
as we will see in a lecture in the future.

512
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:06,271
I would like now to discuss briefly

513
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:09,280
some concrete examples of NBI system.

514
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,931
First of all a system that exists,

515
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,226
and in fact has been operational

516
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:14,547
for a number of years, that of JET.

517
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:19,809
JET has different injectors, 2x8,

518
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:22,602
both for radial and tangential injection,

519
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:27,962
at either 80keV or 130keV of energy.

520
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:34,036
This is sufficient for the beam to go into
the core of the JET plasma,

521
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:37,560
and these energies, as we said before,

522
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:40,828
don't require negative ion technology

523
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:46,059
because the neutralization of
positive ions is sufficiently efficient.

524
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:51,111
The JET system has up to
34MW of total power

525
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:53,081
in its recent upgrades.

526
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:55,299
You can see the size of the system here,

527
00:32:56,418 --> 00:33:00,222
which is almost the same
as that of the entire tokamak.

528
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:03,051
We can look at some of the details.

529
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:07,388
Here is the layout of the system,
with the one injector

530
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:10,021
with eight ion sources,

531
00:33:11,613 --> 00:33:16,036
with insulators and seals
that you can see in the layout here,

532
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,773
and you can see in the actual picture

533
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:20,730
when the system was installed,
on the right.

534
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:27,369
Each of these tubes has
a so-called <i>PINI extraction system</i>,

535
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:29,212
that's a Plug-in Neutral Injector.

536
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:33,184
This particular technology
was developed for JET.

537
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,696
We can notice the electromagnet

538
00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:41,135
to deflect the non-neutralized ions,

539
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:45,885
the dump for those that in fact
need to be evacuated

540
00:33:45,885 --> 00:33:47,789
because they're not neutral.

541
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:51,576
And the calorimeter that measures
how much power we are actually injecting.

542
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:56,839
On this side there would be a port
that would lead us to the JET plasma.

543
00:33:58,438 --> 00:34:00,174
So this is the same picture as before,

544
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:04,150
but now we are looking at that port
that leads into the JET plasma,

545
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,192
the port is about 20 cm of width,

546
00:34:08,605 --> 00:34:12,207
for a height of about 80 cm.

547
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:17,576
I just put the picture because
I'd like to stress the point that

548
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:20,010
the divergence of the beam
is an important parameter.

549
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:25,582
We can't impinge with the beam
on the walls of the duct

550
00:34:25,582 --> 00:34:27,753
that takes us to the machine,

551
00:34:28,144 --> 00:34:30,857
both because we would damage
the beam duct,

552
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:33,666
but also because as soon as
we deposit some power here

553
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:38,915
there will be significant outgassing
from the beam wall interactions,

554
00:34:38,915 --> 00:34:41,769
and this outgassing would block
the propagation of the beam,

555
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:46,664
which would therefore never even
reach the plasma volume.

556
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:49,447
So we said that
the beam works by generating

557
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:52,131
fast neutrals that become fast ions.

558
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:55,498
Let's look at the evidence
for the presence of these fast ions

559
00:34:55,498 --> 00:34:59,618
in a JET tokamak in a few examples.

560
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:05,935
In this case we were actually injecting
some tritium into the plasma,

561
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:08,536
using what we call tritium NBI <i>blips</i>,

562
00:35:08,536 --> 00:35:11,538
so small amounts of tritium

563
00:35:11,538 --> 00:35:15,268
injected in the NBI system.

564
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:19,117
And what we can do in this case,
is to measure the profiles of emission

565
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:24,376
of the 14MeV neutrons that issued
from the D-T reactions in the plasma.

566
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:27,266
And by looking at
the different lines of sight,

567
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:28,725
both vertical and horizontal,

568
00:35:28,725 --> 00:35:31,353
we can tomographically reconstruct
such emission profiles,

569
00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:33,481
and these are examples of that

570
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:38,054
in slightly different situations,
so we won't go into any details,

571
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:42,836
but they indicate essentially
where the fast ions are,

572
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:46,089
that were injected with the NBI.

573
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:49,041
And depending on the values of the current

574
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,695
and the field in the plasma,
which are varied, here,

575
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:54,614
and depending on the injection geometry

576
00:35:54,614 --> 00:35:58,430
in the first two cases
on the left: off-axis,

577
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,516
and in the third case: on-axis,

578
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:02,188
we can have slightly different profiles,

579
00:36:02,188 --> 00:36:06,087
or in fact significantly different
profiles for the fast ions.

580
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:09,738
So this confirms
that we are actually injecting

581
00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:14,559
the fast ions into the plasma
where we think they are going,

582
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:20,024
[and in this case] Let me now just say
a few words about the NBI system

583
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:23,699
that's being designed
and constructed for ITER.

584
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:26,397
For heating and current drive,

585
00:36:27,212 --> 00:36:29,631
we will have two, at least initially,

586
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:33,669
two tangential beams
of negative ions, deuterium.

587
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:40,163
Because of the size of ITER,
these would be in the MeV range

588
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:43,601
for the energy,
in fact would be about 1MeV,

589
00:36:44,347 --> 00:36:46,580
a power of 33MW,

590
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:49,209
similar to that of JET,

591
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,491
but for much longer duration of a pulse,

592
00:36:52,112 --> 00:36:54,786
3,600 seconds.

593
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:59,213
There will also be a third beam,
for diagnostic purposes.

594
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:02,072
As we mentioned,
the charge exchange process

595
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:06,035
provides light, that carries information
about the ion temperature

596
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:09,162
and about the ion ordered
velocity, as well.

597
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:11,883
Now in order for that process to dominate,

598
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:14,321
remember that we need
to have low energies,

599
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:19,829
and therefore we inject in the beam,
we will be injecting in the beam in ITER

600
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:24,703
at an energy of about 100keV
for diagnostic purposes,

601
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,473
a beam that won't have, of course,
much of a power,

602
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:29,401
of the order of 3MW.

603
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:34,508
So here you see a layout
of the geometry of injection

604
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:37,731
into the ITER tokamak, seen from the top.

605
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:43,031
And you see a CAD drawing
of the three systems,

606
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:45,297
the two heating and current drive systems

607
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:50,817
and the diagnostic beam,
into the ITER system.

608
00:37:51,577 --> 00:37:53,672
Now the source itself,

609
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:57,568
and the whole beam accelerating system

610
00:37:57,568 --> 00:38:00,880
and the neutralization for ITER
is a challenge,

611
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,978
and that's why it's still
the subject of significant R&D.

612
00:38:06,457 --> 00:38:11,028
There will be a very large
surface source,

613
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:13,492
with a couple of square meters of surface

614
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:16,602
which needs to produce
a very large current density,

615
00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:20,287
something like 300A/mÂ²,

616
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:24,135
with a high degree of uniformity
across the surface.

617
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,752
The concept used is so-called MaMuG,

618
00:38:28,752 --> 00:38:34,588
that extracts and accelerates the ions
produced from this source.

619
00:38:34,588 --> 00:38:36,941
Multi-Aperture Multi-Grid
Accelerator System,

620
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,042
each step is 200 kV.

621
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:42,262
For the source itself,
the technology,

622
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:46,299
based on the radio frequency
production of a plasma

623
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:49,948
is used, as opposed to arc discharges.

624
00:38:49,948 --> 00:38:54,723
The choice was based on
the reliability tests

625
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:58,506
having been made in different devices,
and also on the need of having

626
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:03,442
very low maintenance requirements

627
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:07,687
for the system, once it's operational.

628
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:12,117
I'll just highlight the fact that
the negative ions are produced

629
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:18,049
on surfaces
that are covered with cesium,

630
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:24,017
it has been deposited on them,
so low work function surfaces,

631
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:28,062
and this is a surface production
of a plasma.

632
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:33,197
We're talking about, of course,
the source for the neutral beam,

633
00:39:33,197 --> 00:39:35,250
as opposed to the volume production

634
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:39,755
we have seen in,
for example, the JET system,

635
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:44,017
which is based on arc discharges.

636
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:47,671
So this is the source,
that's the acceleration stage,

637
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:52,421
the neutralizer has quite a large volume,
the Residual Ion Dump, the calorimeter,

638
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:54,651
so all the elements we have seen for JET,

639
00:39:54,651 --> 00:39:57,472
and of course there will be a valve
and a set of bellows

640
00:39:57,472 --> 00:40:01,685
to connect the whole system
to the tokamak.

641
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:06,731
We are now ready to discuss,
in a simple way,

642
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:10,517
the possible advantages and disadvantages
of the NBI heating system.

643
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:12,977
We have seen that the interaction between

644
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,453
the beam and the plasma is fairly simple.

645
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:19,749
There are three essential processes,

646
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:21,658
of which in fact two dominate:

647
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:25,463
charge exchange and ionization by ions,

648
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:27,271
depending on the beam energy.

649
00:40:27,822 --> 00:40:29,926
The beam has an advantage
that can be used

650
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:32,475
to drive current non-inductively,

651
00:40:32,475 --> 00:40:36,344
if it's directed in a tangential way.

652
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:41,692
It also has the advantage that
it can provide fuelling of the plasma,

653
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:44,716
and in fact provide fuelling on the plasma
in the core of the plasma,

654
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:46,962
if the penetration depth is sufficient.

655
00:40:47,598 --> 00:40:50,402
And in fact these advantages
are the reason why

656
00:40:50,402 --> 00:40:54,694
in present experiments I can say that
the NBI represents the workhorse,

657
00:40:54,694 --> 00:40:57,274
particularly for
high-performance operation.

658
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,215
On the other hand,
there may be some cons.

659
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:06,760
The position of the power
is not that localized,

660
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,040
so it may be a little bit difficult
to determine exactly

661
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,079
a localization for the heating
or the current drive.

662
00:41:15,194 --> 00:41:19,595
The beam implies a relatively large
beam duct, as we have seen,

663
00:41:19,595 --> 00:41:22,639
so there would be a relatively large
opening in the chamber

664
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,219
to make the beam pass through.

665
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:29,330
That means that we have to be careful 
about the leaking of neutrons

666
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,656
out of the thermonuclear region,

667
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:34,789
and also we're losing some surface

668
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:37,635
that we could use for the blanket
to breed tritium.

669
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:44,005
The present technology of the beams
has relatively low electrical efficiency,

670
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:47,541
which of course in
the future reactor is a problem,

671
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:53,640
and also, even if we go
for negative ions at large energies,

672
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:59,397
at large energies we do have relatively
small neutralization efficiency,

673
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:01,731
not much better than 60%.

674
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:05,487
For these two potential problems,
nevertheless,

675
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:09,974
there are significant R&D activities
going on to improve the situation.

676
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:12,417
We'll just give you one example of them.

677
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,986
This example is provided by
the so-called SIPHORE concept,

678
00:42:16,986 --> 00:42:21,539
in which a new technology
for the plasma source [is developed]

679
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:26,402
This technology is based on
the resonant antenna

680
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:28,476
that drives the plasma,

681
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:30,884
using helicon waves.

682
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:34,584
In fact, helicon waves
are a kind of waves

683
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:38,506
that you have seen in a previous course,

684
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:41,141
focused on the physics of plasma waves.

685
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:45,560
We can refer to them also
as <i>whistler</i> waves.

686
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:49,667
Incidentally, this reminds you
of the importance of plasma waves

687
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:52,778
in many, many applications.

688
00:42:53,465 --> 00:42:56,805
Once the plasma is producing that source,

689
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:04,034
and ions are extracted
from that source region,

690
00:43:04,034 --> 00:43:05,744
of course they need to be neutralized,

691
00:43:05,744 --> 00:43:08,165
and we have seen that
the neutralization efficiency is

692
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:09,992
one of the problems we're facing.

693
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:14,918
But the idea in this proposal
is to use light

694
00:43:15,525 --> 00:43:20,202
to increase efficiency
by providing photoneutralization.

695
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,239
Photoneutralization acts
by photodetachment,

696
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:28,223
so we have a negative ion,
in this case the example of hydrogen,

697
00:43:28,223 --> 00:43:30,733
on which we inject a photon,

698
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:35,301
and that provides neutralization
of that negative ion,

699
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:37,045
and of course the emission
of an electron,

700
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:39,997
which can then be deflected
by the electron magnet later on.

701
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:42,962
This is a concept
that's been investigated,

702
00:43:42,962 --> 00:43:46,642
and may potentially provide
both higher electrical efficiency

703
00:43:46,642 --> 00:43:48,483
for the plasma production in the source,

704
00:43:48,483 --> 00:43:52,522
and higher neutralization efficiency
using laser light.

705
00:43:52,939 --> 00:43:55,620
In summary, we have seen
that additional heating is required

706
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,227
for thermonuclear reactors.

707
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:59,850
By additional heating we mean
heating that comes

708
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:03,304
on top of the Ohmic heating,
which is a consequence

709
00:44:03,304 --> 00:44:05,832
of electrical current
flowing into the plasma.

710
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:08,808
The first system
we have investigated today

711
00:44:08,808 --> 00:44:10,849
was the neutral beam injector.

712
00:44:11,436 --> 00:44:15,925
A neutral beam provides a solution
that has a number of advantages,

713
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:19,233
but some drawbacks,
although some of the drawbacks

714
00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:22,419
can be overcome,
and that's why we are doing

715
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:26,397
significant amounts of research
and development on this issue.

716
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:29,757
In the next two modules, we'll investigate
how we can heat the plasma

717
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:31,938
using plasma waves
at different frequencies.
