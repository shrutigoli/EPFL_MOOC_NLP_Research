1
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:07,980
Welcome to the course on plasma physics 
and applications.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,509
We have seen in the last lecture that 
we need to go beyond ohmic heating

3
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:13,570
of a plasma to reach 
thermonuclear conditions,

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,426
that is beyond the heating that can be 
provided by the electric current

5
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:17,809
that flows into the plasma.

6
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:22,013
Today, we will address the heating 
and current drive

7
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:24,531
that we can obtain using waves 
in a plasma.

8
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:29,911
We will explore what waves are available 
for heating and current drive

9
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,580
in tokamaks in particular.

10
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:36,735
We will investigate 
the fluid dispersion relation

11
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:39,298
that you have derived in 
the first part of the course

12
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:44,058
and how that can be used to decide 
what waves can be

13
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:46,505
employed for heating the plasma.

14
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:53,148
We'll investigate the resonance between 
waves and particles

15
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:57,609
that are necessary to transfer energy 
from the waves to the plasma

16
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:00,627
and then we'll focus on two systems:

17
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,912
the ion cyclotron resonance 
heating system,

18
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:09,458
that's based on the resonance between 
the wave and the ion population.

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,940
We will look at the excitation, 
propagation, and absorption of the wave

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,275
that carries the energy 
in this frequency range

21
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,934
and at practical systems that 
we have available today.

22
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:25,295
For example, in JET and that 
we are developing for ITER.

23
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:30,905
We will then look at the lower hybrid 
wave system for basically driving

24
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:33,142
non-inductive current in the plasma

25
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:39,078
and explore some of the antenna features 
again for an existing system

26
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:41,939
that of JET and for the system 
for seen for ITER.

27
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:47,135
I just remind you that among 
the different possibilities

28
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:50,153
we have to heat the plasma, in addition 
to the electrical current

29
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:53,845
that we have seen is not sufficient 
to reach thermonuclear temperatures,

30
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:56,959
we have the injection of a neutral beams

31
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,689
that we have explored in the last lecture

32
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:02,627
and the injection of 
electro-magnetic waves,

33
00:02:02,627 --> 00:02:05,547
which is, again, the subject of 
this particular lecture.

34
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:09,015
That works by having a transmission line

35
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:13,126
to which we couple power 
from an external generator,

36
00:02:13,752 --> 00:02:16,754
an antenna, that's used 
to launch the waves.

37
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:21,550
Of course, the waves themselves, 
they have to propagate into the plasma

38
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,777
and need to be absorbed at some 
layer possibly in the core of the plasma.

39
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:31,955
In fact in general, not only for the waves
but also for the neutral beams

40
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:35,896
that we have seen last time, 
the heating effect can be combined

41
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:38,874
with a driving of current 
non-inductively.

42
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,967
By non-inductively, I mean driving 
a current that's not based on

43
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:46,761
the transformer action that's the
main principle of the tokamak idea.

44
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:51,504
That means that we can in fact, 
lengthen the tokamak pulses

45
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,168
in principle all the way to steady-state

46
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:56,498
and we can use the this 
non-inductive current

47
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:01,834
to locally modify the current profile
and cure instabilities

48
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,592
that can develop in the plasma.

49
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:07,728
Current drive requires direct 
momentum injection

50
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:11,611
that can be, for example, 
achieved using NBI,

51
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:13,955
so these are just particles going 
in a particular direction,

52
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:16,226
that transfer momentum by collisions,

53
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,901
or by modifying the phase 
space distribution of plasma particles,

54
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,950
for example, using waves.

55
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,739
And indeed let's focus on using waves.

56
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:32,108
Magnetized plasmas support 
the propagation of many modes,

57
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:34,577
some of which you have 
already seen in

58
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:37,457
the first part of the course ,
and these modes can be used

59
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:41,837
to transfer energy, being coupled 
via an antenna to the plasma core.

60
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,587
In order to launch your wave 
into the plasma,

61
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:52,076
the frequency and/or the wavelength 
of the antenna wave

62
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,466
must be chosen to satisfy 
the plasma dispersion relation.

63
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,957
We also need to choose the frequency 
and the wavelength,

64
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:02,791
so that the energy is
the deposited in a layer

65
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:06,169
corresponding to a plasma resonance
that's where we want

66
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,670
to deposit the energy,

67
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,041
that is typically in the 
core of the plasma,

68
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,378
not on its surface, not on its edge.

69
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:18,761
I'd like to remind you the main properties
of the plasma dispersion relation.

70
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:24,351
First, in the direction parallel 
to the local ambient magnetic field,

71
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:29,448
which we call B₀, and using 
the fluid model that you have developed

72
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:31,369
and used in the first part of the course.

73
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,977
Here we can represent 
the dispersion relation

74
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:36,949
in terms of the frequency of the wave

75
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:40,646
as a function of the wavenumber 
of the wave

76
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,656
and we notice that there are different 
branches, that is, different solutions

77
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,695
of the dispersion equation, corresponding 
to different propagating modes

78
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:52,805
R and L refer to the polarization 
of the wave.

79
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:57,001
The right hand polarization corresponding 
to the electric field

80
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:01,684
turning clockwise as 
the wave propagates.

81
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:05,413
Then the left hand polarization, L, 
is the other one,

82
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:08,595
the electric field is turning counter-clockwise
as the wave propagates

83
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:10,730
into the plasma.

84
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,948
And because of this character of their 
polarization the R and L waves have

85
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,478
different resonances 
-in the fluid sense here-

86
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:25,745
with electron and ion populations 
respectively.

87
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:30,664
So the R wave is the one that resonates 
with the electron population

88
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:36,624
because it's electric field rotates 
in phase with the motion of the electron,

89
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:39,386
of course, if we reach 
the frequency at which

90
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:45,832
we also go on a same period as 
the electron gyromotion

91
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:47,442
around the field line.

92
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:50,104
The same happens for the L wave 
but for the ions

93
00:05:50,104 --> 00:05:53,123
and of course that would be
at much lower frequency.

94
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:58,320
So this could be two resonant frequencies 
at which we could transfer energy

95
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,492
into the plasma using waves

96
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,837
but we notice that this 
parallel propagation

97
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:05,987
and to launch parallel propagating waves

98
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:09,510
into a tokamak plasma, 
or in fusion devices in general,

99
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,802
is actually quite complicated 
if the device has a toroidal geometry.

100
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:17,703
So we look at the dispersion relation 
in the direction perpendicular

101
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:20,722
to the magnetic field, 
which is quite different.

102
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:26,082
And our little sketch here of the antenna 
injecting energy into the plasma

103
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:30,799
reminds us that this would be the direction
we would prefer, in practical terms.

104
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:36,647
Again, frequency versus wavenumber,
here we have branches that are

105
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:42,293
indicated as XM, <i>extraordinary mode</i>, 
or OM, <i>ordinary mode</i>

106
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:45,622
depending on the direction of 
the oscillating electric field

107
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:47,893
with respect to the magnetic field.

108
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:50,289
We also have as we have seen 
in the previous picture

109
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:55,880
bands in which there is no solution of 
the dispersion relation.

110
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:59,512
That implies that frequencies 
corresponding to these bands,

111
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:04,985
for example, in this case don't correspond
to any propagating mode in a plasma.

112
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,344
We have two resonances corresponding 
to where the frequency remains

113
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:15,457
finite and the wave number 
goes to infinity

114
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:20,882
respectively the lower hybrid 
and the upper hybrid resonances,

115
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:24,698
lower and higher frequency.

116
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:29,877
These will be resonances that could transfer
effectively power into the plasma.

117
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:33,661
In the fluid sense, 
a resonance corresponds

118
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:38,555
to the situation in which the index 
of refraction goes to infinity

119
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:42,717
and so there should be absorption of 
the power from the wave to the plasma.

120
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:47,510
However, the fluid model only gives us 
a general framework

121
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,072
to consider which waves can propagate 
and in which geometry in a plasma,

122
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,282
particularly in the presence 
of a magnetic field.

123
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:56,590
But to describe how the wave energy 
is actually transferred

124
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,263
to the plasma we need to go 
beyond the fluid model.

125
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,978
In principle, we need to 
treat the plasma kinetically

126
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:07,456
so that we don't forget that there are 
frequencies corresponding

127
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:12,704
to different ions or electrons.
the two the main species

128
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:14,528
that we have in the plasma.

129
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:19,380
In this frame we can have a resonance 
between the wave and the particle,

130
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:22,875
a resonance 
that corresponds to a situation

131
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:27,311
in which the particle feels in 
its reference frame

132
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:31,000
an essentially constant force 
because the electric field is

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,609
in phase with its motion.

134
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:36,880
So typically we can write 
(ω - k⋅v) is equal

135
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,022
to a multiple of the cyclotron frequency,

136
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:45,681
(ω - k⋅v) is the frequency that 
the particle perceives for the wave

137
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:47,876
because it's a Doppler shifted frequency.

138
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:51,738
v is the velocity of the particle, 
k is the wavenumber of the wave

139
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:56,945
and when that Doppler shifted frequency
corresponds to either zero

140
00:08:56,945 --> 00:09:00,281
or other multiples of 
the cyclotron frequency

141
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:04,769
then we can have an acceleration 
of the particle

142
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:07,966
that is, an effective transfer of energy
from the wave to the particle.

143
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:11,138
We can sketch this situation 
in a simple way:

144
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:16,191
take a magnetic field in the plasma

145
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:21,407
that goes into the board 
and there would be

146
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:26,343
an electron circulating around

147
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,442
the magnetic field lines and

148
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:36,133
we can sketch the situation of a resonance
in which the electric field

149
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:38,831
has the right frequency

150
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,051
and the right polarization

151
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:45,224
to resonate with the electron.

152
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:50,394
meaning, it is essentially providing 
a force that's constant

153
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,782
as seen by the electron.

154
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:55,724
So they can be energisation of 
the electron in a very effective way.

155
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,153
The other point I'd like to underline is 
that in the model

156
00:10:01,153 --> 00:10:03,994
that goes beyond the fluid approach 
in which we consider

157
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:07,579
a distribution of particles 
that are not corresponding

158
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:09,998
to a single velocity for 
all the individuals,

159
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:14,735
we can indeed have cyclotron resonances 
also for waves that do not propagate

160
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:16,279
along the magnetic field.

161
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,511
So if I sketch the situation

162
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,749
in the geometry of a tokamak, I have

163
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:32,038
the resonance corresponding 
to the cyclotron frequency

164
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:36,478
being equal to the frequency of 
the wave as seen by my particle

165
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,963
corresponding to a particular layer.

166
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:42,351
Let's color this layer in 
a different color here.

167
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:47,028
So it is important to say also that 
this layer is not infinitely narrow

168
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:48,695
because of two reasons.

169
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:53,288
First of all, because there's 
a distribution in their parallel velocity

170
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:58,780
of the particles and if k‖
is not zero that will give a certain width

171
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,558
to this wave particle resonance

172
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:04,821
and second of all, also because 
the cyclotron frequency in particular,

173
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:08,037
of course, for the case of electrons, 
is subject to the relativistic effect

174
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:12,709
in which essentially the mass of 
the electron which appears

175
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:15,152
in the definition of the 
cyclotron frequency

176
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,529
is a function of velocity.

177
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,678
So the resonance becomes velocity 
dependent and of finite width

178
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:24,683
which is much more effective 
for an energy exchange

179
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,959
between particles and waves.

180
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,335
So wave particle resonances help
us in transferring

181
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:34,620
the wave energy into the plasma 
and it also

182
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:41,068
reminds us that that can happen even 
in perpendicular or oblique propagation

183
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:45,740
at the cyclotron frequencies as perceived 
by the moving particle

184
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,561
is their frame of reference.

185
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:50,525
Let's estimate the order of 
magnitude of

186
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:53,886
the frequencies that we are 
considering here both for the ions

187
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:55,618
and for the electrons.

188
00:11:56,452 --> 00:12:01,465
The resonance with the ions occur 
at the ion cyclotron resonance frequency,

189
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:05,983
which would be used for heating 
and the order of magnitude

190
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:10,279
of that frequency-- if we speak of course 
the frequency is the

191
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,211
angular frequency divided by 2 π

192
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:16,891
is about 15 times the value of 
the magnetic field in tesla

193
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:22,096
if the frequency is expressed in MHz
and that's for a hydrogen species,

194
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:23,741
for protons that is.

195
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:26,170
So that means that if we have

196
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:32,116
a field of say 3T, we have about
45 MHz of frequency

197
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:35,355
for the ion cyclotron resonance.

198
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:39,303
As it is intuitive if we now consider 
the case of electrons,

199
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:43,602
the frequency for their electron 
cyclotron resonance will be much higher

200
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:51,411
and that's about 28 B in GHzH
if B is expressed in tesla.

201
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:54,317
So for a typical tokamak device

202
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:59,356
of today and of tomorrow we have 
something between

203
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:02,554
100 and 180, 200 GHz.

204
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,320
Let us now concentrate on the cases 
of ICRH, ion cyclotron resonance heating.

205
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:10,681
Let's bring up again the 
dispersion relation

206
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:15,873
because we need to now choose 
which wave we use to carry the energy

207
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:19,491
that we want to launch into 
the plasma core from our antenna.

208
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:24,883
Now the cyclotron frequency 
for the ions is typically here

209
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:28,901
and is much lower than 
the lower hybrid frequency,

210
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,303
which corresponds to a resonance.

211
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:31,922
So we are on the branch

212
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:36,850
for the extraordinary mode here, 
that's well below the first resonance.

213
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,236
So we are in a range that's actually 
reasonably well described

214
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:45,861
even in the context of the MHD model 
corresponding to so-called

215
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:49,124
compressional Alfvén wave 
or fast magnetosonic wave.

216
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:52,510
We'll refer to this wave as 
the <i>fast wave</i> for simplicity.

217
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:57,770
This is the next mode, so we have 
to have a wave that has an electric field

218
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,887
oscillating perpendicularly 
to the ambient magnetic field.

219
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:10,413
So in practice what we'd like to do is 
-say this is our tokamak cross-section-

220
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:16,281
is to have an antenna 
that's sitting towards the edge of

221
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:19,811
the device, of course, 
that launches a wave,

222
00:14:21,298 --> 00:14:26,045
which is the fast wave and that wave 
should reach the resonance

223
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:30,960
corresponding to, for example, 
the ion cyclotron resonance

224
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,794
of the ion species we want to heat.

225
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,081
So if I represent here 
the ion cyclotron frequency

226
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:53,553
for that species, that will be 
q B(R) / mi

227
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:56,613
typically the field goes as 1/R,

228
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:58,631
so I can draw that in a simple way

229
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:02,973
and the resonance corresponds 
to the point--

230
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:05,068
let's call this resonance

231
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:10,022
where fCI -- so the ion cyclotron frequency
is equal to the frequency

232
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:13,669
I provide the plasma with, that is 
the antenna frequency.

233
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:20,694
Let's call that fant, the frequency 
of the wave I'm launching with my antenna.

234
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:25,034
At the resonant layer

235
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:29,750
effects a little bit more complicated 
than we have the pretention of

236
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,053
explaining here occur, but in general, 
we expect an absorption

237
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:39,070
of the power that we launch 
from the antenna by the plasma.

238
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:42,056
Now without going into the details 
of this phenomenon

239
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:45,141
which is relatively complicated, 
I just noticed that the fast wave

240
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:49,570
cannot propagate if the density 
is below a certain value,

241
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,553
so you will need to tunnel through

242
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:55,040
a cut-off region at 
the edge of the plasma,

243
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,828
which is thin enough for the wave 
to tunnel through it

244
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:00,881
but which we can't completely 
disregard in our model.

245
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:05,350
The wave physics in a tokamak plasma
is rather complex,

246
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:09,548
and one of the aspects of these 
complexity is that tokamak plasmas

247
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:12,136
contain more than one ion species.

248
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:14,966
That means that the dispersal relation 
is more complicated

249
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:18,649
but at the same time it has the advantage 
of allowing different schemes

250
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,381
for the wave propagation.

251
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:26,285
For example, we can use a scheme 
in which we absorb the energy

252
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,691
of the wave

253
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:31,725
by a minority ion species, 
at the first harmonic.

254
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:35,051
So that means that we chose 
the frequency or the antenna corresponding

255
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:37,597
to the cyclotron frequency, 
for example, hydrogen

256
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:40,358
say in a deuterium plasma
or Helium 3.

257
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,412
Again, for example, the deuterium plasma.

258
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:45,828
Or, we can use the second harmonic

259
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:50,448
of one of the main ion species, 
for example, in a DT plasma

260
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:54,063
we can launch a wave at two times

261
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:56,124
the cyclotron frequency for the tritons.

262
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:59,238
That's indeed one of the schemes 
foreseen for ITER.

263
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:02,182
Or we could use this called 
<i>ion-ion hybrid resonance</i>

264
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:04,838
which we have not calculated in the models

265
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:09,108
but which essentially is 
the resonant frequency

266
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:12,228
that's given by the fact that we have 
two different ion species

267
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:15,136
and the value of 
this resonant frequency is

268
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:18,867
between the cyclotron frequency 
of the heavier species

269
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:22,583
and the cyclotron frequency 
of the lighter one, and other schemes.

270
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:28,176
Now in all the schemes the wave fields 
at the resonant frequency

271
00:17:28,662 --> 00:17:32,123
give energy to the perpendicular motion 
of the resonant ions,

272
00:17:32,123 --> 00:17:35,334
therefore, creating an isotropic 
distribution function

273
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,809
and mostly trapped ions orbits.

274
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:42,337
Depending on which scheme 
we choose for the absorption,

275
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:46,421
which determines the way the energisation

276
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:48,817
of the resonant ions take place,

277
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,804
then we can have a collisional
energy transfer that

278
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:56,364
can be to either the plasma bulk ions 
or the plasma electrons.

279
00:17:56,853 --> 00:18:00,792
If we create very energetic resonant ions

280
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,606
then the collisional transfer will be 
mainly on electrons,

281
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:08,346
whereas if the energetic resonant ions

282
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:13,539
have a lower energy spectrum then 
the collisional transfer will be

283
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,873
primarily to the plasma bulk ions.

284
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:20,534
This figure illustrates the complexity 
both of the wave field,

285
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,354
we are generating with an antenna

286
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:26,816
and the ion cyclotron resonance 
frequency scheme,

287
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:31,532
and the orbits of 
the energetic ions that are

288
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:37,470
in fact energized by absorbing 
the power of the ICRH antenna.

289
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:43,251
Now we can look a little bit at
the details of the antenna system

290
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:45,917
that we need to launch the fast wave,

291
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,426
that is our energy carrier to plasma core.

292
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:54,619
So in this schematic way: we come 
with a coaxial line

293
00:18:55,174 --> 00:19:00,897
in the plasma we connect 
that to a metal plate,

294
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:04,740
we call it a "strap", then 
we have a certain current.

295
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,699
Close the circuit to ground this current,

296
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:09,623
which of course would be 
an oscillating current

297
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:13,631
at 10's of MHz of frequency.

298
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:21,243
This oscillating current will give rise 
to an oscillating magnetic field,

299
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:24,416
let's call that Bant for B-antenna.

300
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:28,534
And of course, an oscillating 
electric field as well.

301
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,886
So let's draw that geometry.

302
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:37,512
So we say the Bant, in fact, 
respects the right hand rule.

303
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:43,061
Let's say the electric field of that wave 
that we're launching is

304
00:19:43,825 --> 00:19:46,591
along the direction of 
the oscillating current,

305
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:51,018
the magnetic field of the wave 
we're launching is perpendicular to it

306
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:56,955
and then say there is 
a background magnetic field,

307
00:19:57,334 --> 00:20:02,217
B₀ in this direction, and the wave 
propagation vector

308
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:05,346
that could be in a direction oblique

309
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:10,187
to the magnetic field of the tokamak.

310
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:15,161
So this is the way to 
respect the polarization

311
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:18,856
we need to have, because we want 
to have an electric field of the wave

312
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:22,251
that is perpendicular to B₀,
that's an essential element

313
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:26,990
for launching the fast 
magnetosonic wave.

314
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:30,332
Now what we want to have is

315
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:33,548
a transfer of the--

316
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:39,320
if you like, the oscillating current

317
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:42,940
energy into the wave energy.

318
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,298
What we don't want to have is 
an acceleration of charged particles

319
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:52,318
in the proximity of the antenna 
with the large electric fields

320
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,139
that are provided by the antenna itself.

321
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:57,444
So we like to avoid that 
by putting a screen,

322
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:02,350
which we refer to as a <i>Faraday screen </i>
in front of the antenna,

323
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,219
that at least in the direction of B₀,

324
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:07,480
in the direction of 
the ambiant magnetic field,

325
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:11,153
prevents the creation of electric fields

326
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:16,766
and that is done by having 
conductors that are aligned

327
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:18,923
with the magnetic field lines.

328
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:22,516
So the Faraday screen is there 
for a structure

329
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:25,979
that short-circuits electric fields,
at least in the direction

330
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:29,784
of the local magnetic field,
which will be the dangerous direction

331
00:21:29,784 --> 00:21:32,481
for the acceleration of 
the charged particles.

332
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:36,776
Of course, the acceleration of 
charged particles by the electric field

333
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:40,728
is possible in parallel 
to the magnetic field.

334
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,444
Acceleration of fast particles of ions, 
in particular, we want to avoid

335
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:50,739
because that will lead to a very 
energetic collisions of these ions

336
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:54,366
onto the material surfaces 
around the antenna, on the antenna itself,

337
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:59,693
both damaging these surfaces and
producing a very strong impurity influx.

338
00:22:01,377 --> 00:22:05,591
So how does an antenna 
for ICRH look like in practice?

339
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:12,417
Here's a picture of several 
antennas of the JET tokamak.

340
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:16,777
We have the 'old' version that 
has been used for many years

341
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:20,445
that has two straps per antenna

342
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:26,564
producing a power surface 
density of a little less

343
00:22:26,564 --> 00:22:28,730
than two megawatts per square meter

344
00:22:28,902 --> 00:22:33,279
and the more recent concept that has 
been tested in the last few years,

345
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,251
so called ITER-like antenna because 
it's sort of a prototype

346
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:42,000
for the installation on ITER
and each model has four straps,

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,389
which allows to reduce the electric field 
produced by the antennas locally

348
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:57,406
and a higher power density of about 
8 megawatts per square meter.

349
00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:04,376
You can also see the bars that produce 
the Faraday screen in both cases.

350
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:11,006
One of the issues of the antennas 
in a tokamak is the question of

351
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:14,230
impedance matching, of course, 
the impedance of the load

352
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:18,807
has to matched to that 
of the transmission line

353
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:20,983
and the generator to optimize 
the power transfer

354
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,981
but the antenna plasma system 
has an impedance that can vary

355
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:27,555
with the plasma conditions, 
in particular at the edge,

356
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:31,392
including variations of 
the conditions that are

357
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:35,578
associated with very high frequency

358
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:39,072
and very violent instabilities 
that happen at the edge.

359
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:42,691
So the different concepts also need 
to address this issue

360
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:45,621
by compensating one strap 
with the other, for example,

361
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:49,439
and develop some sort of resilience 
with respect to the sudden variation of the load

362
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:52,493
that edge phenomena can lead.

363
00:23:52,835 --> 00:23:55,887
We've seen the antenna systems in JET.

364
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:57,562
Let's take a look at the whole system.

365
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,887
Going back from the antenna, which is 
of course installed in the vacuum vessel.

366
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:07,640
You can even see the two straps 
in easier way here

367
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,181
because they are sketched 
without the Faraday screen.

368
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:15,699
There is a vacuum feed through.

369
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,952
There is a set of coaxial 
transmission lines

370
00:24:17,952 --> 00:24:22,393
to transmit the power with 
very small levels of losses.

371
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:28,752
The frequency of the ICRH system 
in JET is between 30 and 55 MHz.

372
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:36,230
You have the switches that allow 
you to test your generators on dummy loads

373
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:39,606
or of course to inject the power
to the transmission line

374
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:40,988
that eventually goes to the antennas

375
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:42,991
and you have the generators.

376
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:45,598
We have mentioned before that ICRH works

377
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:48,584
by generating energetic ions 
because they are the ones

378
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:53,002
that resonate with the waves
and it's interesting to see how

379
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:57,163
these ions are actually measured 
and how we verify that they are

380
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,827
in fact generated by the ICRH mechanism.

381
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:07,022
The example shown in this slide is 
an experiment done at JET

382
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:12,038
in which the frequency of 
the ICRH system is chosen to be

383
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:15,344
the third harmonic of 
the cyclotron frequency

384
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:19,168
of alpha particles, i.e. ⁴He ions

385
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:21,636
And how do we observe them?

386
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:24,722
We observe them by measuring 
the emission profiles

387
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:27,841
in the tomographic way,

388
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,492
gamma rays that that produced 
by nuclear reactions

389
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:34,765
between the α-particles and 
the beryllium impurities

390
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:39,752
that are present in the plasma and 
the point is that these nuclear reactions

391
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:44,585
have a threshold for the energy of 
the α-particles,

392
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:48,182
in other words, they occur only 
if the energy of the α's

393
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:51,034
is larger than about 2MeV.

394
00:25:51,423 --> 00:25:55,320
So if we see a signature of this reaction 
in the form of emission of γ-rays,

395
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,248
we are sure that we have energized 
these α-particles

396
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:04,652
using ICRH at least to levels 
of about 2MeV.

397
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:11,809
And this is in fact the profile of 
these γ-rays emissions.

398
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:17,945
We can briefly take a look at the system 
for ICRH that's foreseen for ITER.

399
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:22,687
The frequency is actually very 
similar to that in JET

400
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,550
between 40 and 55 MHz,

401
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:33,350
power up to 20 MW, 
and for a duration of 3600 seconds.

402
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:36,590
There are eight coaxial lines 
and one of the features

403
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,122
that characterizes the ITER system

404
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:41,529
and that's one of the pictures 
that have been tested in JET

405
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:44,582
using this so-called ITER-like antenna,

406
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,823
is that the antenna has 
to come on a port plug,

407
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:51,097
in other words, it has to be inserted 
as sort of a part of an arm

408
00:26:51,097 --> 00:26:54,445
that comes into a port, 
into an opening of the vessel..

409
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,841
Here we see a picture of the antenna

410
00:26:58,153 --> 00:27:00,798
as it's been drawn now.

411
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:02,751
You can also see how big that is.

412
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:06,601
It's quite a sizable object 
and you can also see that

413
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:08,165
it has several straps.

414
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:11,060
It's the same concept as the ones 
we have described before, but

415
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:18,507
he has an even larger number of straps to
try to reduce the strong electric fields

416
00:27:18,662 --> 00:27:19,988
in proximity of the antenna.

417
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:23,802
It has also the Faraday screens 
we have described before.

418
00:27:24,887 --> 00:27:29,040
To model the propagation 
and the absorption of ICRH waves

419
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,115
is a non-trivial exercise.

420
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:35,357
We have seen the dispersion 
relations in terms of,

421
00:27:35,357 --> 00:27:38,219
of course, ω versus k
that means in Fourier space

422
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:42,604
assuming that everything is 
of infinite size and uniform,

423
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:44,971
which is of course not 
the case in tokamaks.

424
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:49,031
The fast wave we'd like to use 
to carry the energy to the plasma core

425
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:51,283
has a relatively large vacuum wavelength.

426
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:56,321
That means it cannot be properly 
described in a simple Fourier formalism.

427
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:59,719
A full-wave calculation needs to be done.

428
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:02,896
And this is an example of 
such a calculation.

429
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:07,765
On the right here you see 
just a still picture of

430
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:11,616
the field produced by the antenna

431
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,110
in ITER, in front of the antenna of ITER

432
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:20,872
and on the left you can see 
a movie that models

433
00:28:21,823 --> 00:28:25,502
the propagation and the evolution 
of the electric field

434
00:28:25,502 --> 00:28:29,089
in the ICRH heating of the ITER plasma.

435
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:33,684
We're now ready to briefly discuss 
in a qualitative

436
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:38,780
and somewhat personal way,
the pros and cons of the ICRH.

437
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:43,571
As an advantage we have an accessible 
and a relatively cost effective source

438
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:44,818
and component technology.

439
00:28:44,818 --> 00:28:48,756
We are in a frequency range between 
say 20 and 120 MHZ,

440
00:28:48,756 --> 00:28:51,212
that is fairly easy to work with.

441
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:53,786
We can have a very good 
coupling efficiency

442
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:56,738
and we can choose a mechanism

443
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,875
for the absorption that preferentially 
heats the ions or the electrons,

444
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,371
which can be an advantage as 
it gives us quite a flexibility

445
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:07,615
in the operation of the system.

446
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:12,685
On the other hand, among the 
disadvantages that I can think of,

447
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:14,990
we have a fairly complex wave physics:

448
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:17,934
the absorption mechanism 
is not straightforward

449
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:22,585
and we have, even more 
dramatically, a problem

450
00:29:22,585 --> 00:29:26,075
with the strong electric fields 
at the antenna.

451
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,824
The strong electric fields, especially 
when rectified by nonlinear phenomena

452
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:35,150
such as at the rf-shield can damage surfaces,
can produce impurity influx

453
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:38,744
and therefore can really reduce 
the lifetime of the antenna itself

454
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:41,187
and of the components around it.

455
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:45,513
It is also quite difficult to match the
load, particularly in the presence of

456
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:51,517
variations of the edge conditions 
such as caused by instabilities

457
00:29:51,517 --> 00:29:53,248
at the edge of the plasma.

458
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:57,330
The antenna itself requires quite 
a large surface

459
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:01,850
in the chamber, a surface that, of course
cannot be used for purposes

460
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:04,315
such as breeding tritium in a blanket.

461
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:09,716
And in terms of the current drive, 
the efficiency is relatively low,

462
00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:13,325
so there's not a large amount 
of current driven by a given amount

463
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:15,757
of power in the ICRH.

464
00:30:16,657 --> 00:30:18,677
In order to drive current 
more efficiently, in fact

465
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:21,930
we normally think of using 
a different kind of wave.

466
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,371
That's the lower hybrid wave.

467
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,844
Considered for heating and current drive ,
but we should say nowadays

468
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,440
primarily only for current drive,

469
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:35,894
the concept of lower hybrid interaction 
is based on the wave-particle resonance.

470
00:30:36,087 --> 00:30:40,000
So this is the resonance for which, say, 
the n in front of

471
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:43,021
the cyclotron frequency is equal to zero.

472
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:47,829
So we're really going-- if you like with 
a wave that propagates

473
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:50,619
at the same speed as a group of particles,

474
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:54,183
which are therefore referred 
to as resonant particles.

475
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:57,806
And if we take that as sort of 
in an optimization process

476
00:30:57,806 --> 00:30:59,754
for the electron population,

477
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:02,032
we can evaluate the frequency 
at which that occurs

478
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:05,651
to be about 1.3 times the square root 
of the temperature,

479
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:08,335
the temperature is expressed as <i>keV</i>

480
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:10,803
divided by the parallel 
wavelength of the wave

481
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:12,442
expressing in centimeters

482
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:14,939
and frequency would be expressed in GHz.

483
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,208
So if we take a 16 keV plasma,

484
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:23,899
a few centimeters of a parallel wavelength

485
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:27,295
we have something of the order of 
a few GHz

486
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:33,812
for this wave particle resonance
that corresponds to one portion of this

487
00:31:35,216 --> 00:31:37,728
lower hybrid branch 
in the dispersion relation

488
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:41,481
for the fluid wave in a plasma.

489
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,312
Again, it's the extraordinary mode 
that we're dealing with.

490
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:47,958
Now we are already quite 
to the right of this plot,

491
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:52,222
which means that ω/k is pretty small,

492
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:56,039
we are in a regime that 
can be represented well

493
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,096
by the electrostatic wave approximation.

494
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:01,755
So we have a wave 
that's primarily electrostatic,

495
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,643
meaning that the perturbed 
magnetic field associated

496
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:07,624
with the wave is generally negligible.

497
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:14,776
Typically for electrostatic waves we have 
the need to have an antenna in the plasma.

498
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:18,101
There's a minimum density that's required 
to launch such a wave

499
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:21,503
and so we need to be pretty much 
in contact with the plasma,

500
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:24,620
which we've seen is not necessarily 
an easy condition to satisfy.

501
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:30,359
What is the fundamental mechanism
for driving the current using this wave?

502
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:34,507
Say we have a wave particle resonance,

503
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:38,062
so there is an acceleration 
of a class of particles,

504
00:32:38,062 --> 00:32:41,013
the class of particles that resonate 
with the waves

505
00:32:41,013 --> 00:32:45,865
and that has a smaller energy 
than the wave to begin with,

506
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,227
on average would be accelerated.

507
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,381
The class of particles
that resonate with the wave

508
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:57,761
but that start with velocity
that's slightly larger than that

509
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:58,694
corresponding

510
00:32:58,694 --> 00:33:04,654
to the wave phase velocity, on average 
will in fact lose energy to the wave.

511
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:07,217
So the distribution function that 
we're representing here

512
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:12,657
in a 1-D plot in a very simple way 
would be modified.

513
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:18,283
Again, we will push particles that are 
going a little slower than the wave

514
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:21,357
to the right so we accelerate them.

515
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,857
That means that if we look at 
the overall structure

516
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:27,029
of the distribution function
we have made that asymmetric.

517
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:32,068
Say these are electrons, that means 
on average we have changed

518
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:35,951
the average velocity of the population, 
that means that we are driving current

519
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:40,701
and the lower hybrid interaction 
because of this resonant feature

520
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:42,210
is quite efficient in doing that.

521
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,908
That means we can have 
a relatively large current

522
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:47,737
driven in the plasma, 
per unit wave power.

523
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:52,997
Let's see how an antenna looks 
like that can launch lower hybrid waves

524
00:33:53,805 --> 00:33:55,796
of use for current drive.

525
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:59,961
To do that we need to provide 
a certain directivity of the wave

526
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:01,510
with a well defined spectrum.

527
00:34:01,855 --> 00:34:06,316
To do that we have decided to go 
in general for the idea of

528
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:12,462
what we call a <i>grill</i>,
that's an antenna made up by

529
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:16,180
several, many phased wave guides.

530
00:34:17,073 --> 00:34:21,983
So the phasing of the wave guides allows 
the good definition of the spectrum

531
00:34:21,983 --> 00:34:25,271
of the wave number of the wave 
and therefore to direct

532
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,889
the propagation of the wave 
in one particular direction.

533
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:32,484
So this is an example of 
a lower hybrid antenna

534
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:37,035
with, again we call it lower hybrid grid, 
installed in the JET tokamak plasma.

535
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:41,510
And as an example of a complete 
lower hybrid system

536
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,692
I also use that of JET.

537
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:48,021
The frequency is 3.7 GHZ 
and so far the maximum power

538
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:52,760
that we have delivered to the plasma
is slightly about 5 MW.

539
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:57,142
And as in the other system 
we go back from the plasma

540
00:34:57,142 --> 00:34:59,993
from the antenna we have seen 
in the form of a grill

541
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:05,401
there's s set of a feed-throughs here 
and then there are transmission lines

542
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,815
and they pass through the concrete wall 
of the torus hall

543
00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:13,388
and then of course they are connected 
to the generators,

544
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:17,041
which are klystrons.

545
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:21,914
A lower hybrid system 
is also foreseen for ITER

546
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:27,729
with a frequency of 5 GHZ 
and a power up to 20 MW.

547
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,959
Although it's foreseen only for 
the second stage of installation

548
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:33,722
of heating upgrades, 
not for the first stage of operation.

549
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:39,728
The idea is to use this primarily for 
driving current in a plasma non-inductively

550
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:42,645
but because of the plasma density in ITER,

551
00:35:42,645 --> 00:35:45,400
it will only be possible 
to drive current off-axis.

552
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:49,662
Nevertheless that will be of interest 
to control the current profile

553
00:35:49,662 --> 00:35:52,868
and control the regime of 
operation of the plasma.

554
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:57,917
We are now ready to discuss very briefly 
and qualitatively advantages

555
00:35:57,917 --> 00:36:00,259
and disadvantages 
of lower hybrid current drive.

556
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:05,452
First of all, as was the case for ICRH

557
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:09,315
there is a technology for the source 
and for the components

558
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:12,799
that's relatively easily accessible 
and cost effective.

559
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:15,363
We are in the few GHz range 
of frequencies

560
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:18,565
where several applications 
in different domains exist.

561
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:23,355
However, the main advantage 
that we foresee for lower hybrid

562
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:28,261
is the ability of driving current 
in the plasma in a very efficient way,

563
00:36:28,513 --> 00:36:33,111
at least in some ranges of 
the density values in the plasma.

564
00:36:35,374 --> 00:36:42,222
On the disadvantage line, there's also 
the same kind of problematic

565
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:44,344
that we have for ICRH, having an antenna

566
00:36:44,344 --> 00:36:46,696
that needs to be in direct contact 
with the plasma,

567
00:36:47,198 --> 00:36:49,672
which can lead to damages 
of the antenna itself

568
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:54,789
from the plasma and to the impurity 
production by antenna itself

569
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:56,901
or by the surrounding surfaces.

570
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:58,820
It's also difficult to match the load,

571
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:03,325
the load that's constituted by the 
antenna and the plasma together

572
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:05,537
that's therefore varying with time

573
00:37:06,535 --> 00:37:09,408
and the heating efficiency 
is generally quite poor

574
00:37:09,408 --> 00:37:12,628
as is difficult to access 
the core of the plasma

575
00:37:12,628 --> 00:37:14,957
if we go to higher and higher densities.

576
00:37:16,826 --> 00:37:19,040
In summary, we have seen 
that cyclotron resonances

577
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,860
can be reached by fast waves for ICRH.

578
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:28,505
We have seen that lower hybrid waves 
are primarily used for current drive

579
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:31,727
in addition of course, 
to the ohmic current drive

580
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,347
by the transformer action.

581
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,008
We have seen that both for ICRH 
and lower hybrid

582
00:37:37,008 --> 00:37:40,051
the direct interaction between 
the antenna and the edge plasma

583
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,503
constitutes a major drawback.

584
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:46,898
In the next module, we'll discuss 
the electron cyclotron resonance heating.

585
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:51,546
It's physics basics and some 
of the technology aspects of it.
