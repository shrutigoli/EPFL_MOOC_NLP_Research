00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:07,737
Welcome to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:09,536
Today, in our last lecture,

3
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:11,972
we will complete the discussion
of thermonuclear fusion.

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,374
We will try to address the questions

5
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:16,871
of what are the last steps
of research and development

6
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:19,487
that are needed to produce
electricity from fusion?

7
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:22,375
And, how do we close
the gaps in our knowledge

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:26,056
and connect what we do today
on the present experiments

9
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,621
to ITER and DEMO?

10
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:31,484
I remind you that ITER will be
the machine that we'll demonstrate

11
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:34,770
the scientific and technological
feasibility of fusion on Earth,

12
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:38,331
while DEMO will be the ultimate step,

13
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:40,268
that is, the step that will demonstrate

14
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:42,387
that fusion power
can be deployed commercially.

15
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:46,905
To begin our discussion,
I'd like us to remind ourselves

16
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:49,546
of the progress in magnetic
confinement fusion

17
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:51,502
represented in this slide

18
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:55,441
in terms of the so-called
fusion triple product

19
00:00:55,441 --> 00:01:01,775
that is the product of the density
of the fuel, the plasma that is the ions,

20
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:04,120
the confinement time for the energy,

21
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,782
and the temperature of the ions.

22
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:10,226
This triple product is represented

23
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:13,939
as a function of the central
ion temperature in KeV.

24
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:17,169
The different points correspond
to different experiments around the world,

25
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:22,316
in fact by far, not all of the experiments
are represented in this chart.

26
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:26,875
Nevertheless, we get the feeling that
from the early '70s to the '80s and '90s

27
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:30,436
we have made terrific progress
towards the reactor condition

28
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:34,514
that we need to achieve for the plasma
to actually produce energy.

29
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:38,855
We notice that the white points here

30
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:42,833
correspond to the actual
full deuterium-tritium experiments

31
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:48,515
performed at TFTR in Princeton, US,
and at JET in England.

32
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:53,022
These points, in fact,
don't correspond necessarily

33
00:01:53,022 --> 00:01:57,780
to the best triple product
that we can achieve.

34
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:04,277
I think the record today still remains
with the JT-60, a great machine in Japan.

35
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:08,340
We're still a little bit far
from what we need to achieve,

36
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:12,390
that is, a fusion gain
of about 10 in ITER,

37
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,151
and a step beyond that
would be the demonstration

38
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:21,562
for an actual reactor to work
which would require a fusion gain

39
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:25,289
of the order of, say, 30 to 40.

40
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:28,597
Not necessarily to ignition,
as we have said in previous lectures.

41
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:32,464
Different parts of the world,
different countries,

42
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:37,179
have defined or are defining
their strategies to get the fusion power.

43
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:41,387
The different approaches
are often complementary,

44
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:44,449
but also reflect the degree of urgency
that is perceived

45
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:47,611
in different parts of the world
for a new energy source

46
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:50,107
that is compatible
with sustainable development.

47
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:55,365
Being in Europe myself,
and the whole staff of this course,

48
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:59,193
we will base the lecture on the roadmap
that we have developed in Europe

49
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:02,915
which I think is a good example of
a combination of pragmatism and ambition.

50
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:08,885
The European roadmap aims
at producing fusion electricity by 2050.

51
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,319
This requires the construction
of DEMO around 2030.

52
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,664
It also requires an early
involvement in industry

53
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,867
and of course, international collaboration

54
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,733
beyond the borders of Europe.

55
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:26,005
I'd like to say a few words
about the main missions

56
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:30,694
into which the European roadmap
to fusion power is structured,

57
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:33,738
without the pretension of being
exhaustive in this description.

58
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:39,529
There are several missions
that have to do with fusion technology,

59
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:45,724
and other missions that have to do with,
say, more plasma physics related problems.

60
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:47,805
Let's go through the missions.

61
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:52,514
The first mission is to optimize
the operation of the plasma.

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,105
We can have two approaches,
the inductive operation of the tokamak,

63
00:03:58,617 --> 00:04:04,943
in which the current is driven primarily
by the transformer action,

64
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:09,539
and the possible steady-state
regime of operation

65
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:15,222
in which current may be driven primarily
not by the ohmic transformer,

66
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:20,029
but by external sources of momentum

67
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,624
and by the intrinsic source
of current in the plasma

68
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:26,614
due to its own profiles.

69
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,277
We need to understand how
we can optimize these scenarios

70
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:33,906
in order to get
to the conditions for a reactor.

71
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:38,176
We also need to address
the question of the heat exhaust,

72
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:40,708
as we have discussed
in previous lectures.

73
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:44,238
Both in what we call
the baseline configuration,

74
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:47,189
that is what we have
in our hands today,

75
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,368
and in configurations
that are more advanced

76
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:52,138
with possible innovative solutions
that we are exploring in parallel

77
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:53,974
with that baseline.

78
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,056
We need to address
the question of materials,

79
00:04:58,056 --> 00:05:05,413
how we'll cope with a very large
neutron irradiation in particular

80
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:08,717
from the tokamak plasma.

81
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:12,202
We need to worry
about how, in practice,

82
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:14,506
we can breed tritium.

83
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:17,502
We have discussed the principles
behind the idea

84
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:19,939
of breeding tritium in a blanket,

85
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:23,533
but we need to test different
concepts for the blanket

86
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:27,500
that will be tested in ITER,
but it also will be tested in parallel.

87
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,771
An important element of fusion is,
of course, the safety of it.

88
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:36,855
The fusion technology
can be completely safe,

89
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:39,910
but we need to really demonstrate
all the details

90
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,752
of this particular feature.

91
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:46,089
We need to get to DEMO.

92
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:49,494
As I said before, in the European view,

93
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:53,181
we need to get to DEMO
construction around 2030

94
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:59,241
in order for DEMO to operate
and tell us what the conditions are

95
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:02,902
in which we can deploy
fusion power commercially,

96
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:05,635
so we need to concentrate already now

97
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:10,104
on trying to identify
what the best concept for DEMO can be.

98
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:14,765
Another point in the European roadmap

99
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,840
that is highlighted as really a mission,

100
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,019
is to keep the cost of electricity
from fusion relatively low.

101
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:28,956
The idea here is that if we go on a path
that leads us to gigantic experiments

102
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:32,592
and unsustainable costs
for fusion reactors,

103
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:36,926
that path would not lead
to the real deployment of fusion

104
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:38,853
as a commercial energy source,

105
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:41,002
so we need to keep that in mind.

106
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:44,661
Finally, last but not least,

107
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:47,783
we have the line of the stellarator.

108
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:51,965
This is not the main line in the roadmap,

109
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:54,364
which is based primarily on tokamaks,

110
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:57,479
but it's a line that can provide
some sort of insurance policy

111
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,207
against possible problems
from the tokamak line.

112
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:06,183
Stellarator machines
may be a generation behind

113
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:11,542
in terms of readiness for the achievement
of the conditions for fusion,

114
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:14,439
but they have, as discussed
in previous lectures,

115
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,457
quite interesting potential
advantages over tokamaks.

116
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:20,754
In fact the largest stellarator ever built

117
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:24,393
will become operational
this very year in Germany.

118
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,411
That's Wendelstein 7-x

119
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:29,523
So how do we connect
the different devices

120
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:32,710
and their findings on the way to ITER?

121
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:36,873
One way to look at that
is a so-called step ladder approach

122
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,046
that we have taken in Europe.

123
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:45,451
I represent here the three machines
that are of similar shape:

124
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:51,586
- ASDEX Upgrade in Germany,
- the JET European device in England,

125
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,097
and 
- ITER.

126
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:56,327
As you can notice, the difference
between the machines

127
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:59,513
is really primarily the size,

128
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:05,838
so extrapolations from ASDEX to JET
are relatively easy, as it should be

129
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:09,021
relatively easy to extrapolate
from JET to ITER,

130
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,904
because a number of conditions
are kept similar.

131
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,656
Particularly we notice that ASDEX Upgrade,

132
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:19,814
which we will discuss
a little bit more in detail,

133
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:21,641
as we will for JET,

134
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:24,404
has a full metal wall now,

135
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:30,237
JET has a combination
of tungsten and beryllium,

136
00:08:30,237 --> 00:08:32,926
as is foreseen for ITER,

137
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:39,706
so there will also be the possibility
of investigating the problem

138
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:43,722
of having some kind of materials
facing the plasma

139
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:46,263
that will be the same as in ITER.

140
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:52,661
The sizes are more or less in scale here.

141
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,603
You also notice that there is a number in
megajoules, represented here,

142
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:03,114
that's the energy content of the plasma
going from 1 MJ for ASDEX to 20 MJ for JET

143
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:07,319
and to 350 MJ for ITER.

144
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:10,725
In addition to really
having this stepladder

145
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:16,317
that provides similar devices
but just very different sizes,

146
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:21,298
we also in Europe are contemplating
using other experiments

147
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:27,148
that explore approaches that are
alternative to these machines

148
00:09:27,338 --> 00:09:30,102
belonging to the stepladder
approach, if you like.

149
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:34,308
For examples, alternatives
in a sense that we can explore

150
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,967
innovative ways of addressing
the plasma exhaust problem,

151
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:41,443
and these devices that are
at the moment present

152
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:43,973
in the European program
are the MAST device,

153
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:48,573
which is a spherical tokamak
in Culham, UK,

154
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:54,573
and the TCV device, which is
a tokamak of variable shapes

155
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,372
which is in Lausanne, Switzerland.

156
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:00,612
It's also important to have
different kinds of devices

157
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:06,650
so that validation
of numerical models and codes

158
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:10,570
can be done on a variety
of scales and conditions.

159
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:16,378
The combination of these smaller
tokamaks, smaller than JET, that is,

160
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:19,490
is referred to in Europe
as the <i>Medium Size Tokamaks</i>

161
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,096
and that's an important part
of our roadmap.

162
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:30,426
Again, these medium size tokamaks
at present are three:

163
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:33,318
ASDEX Upgrade in Germany,

164
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:37,165
which has a major radius
of about 1.6 meters,

165
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:40,304
a minor radius up to 80 centimeters,

166
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:43,767
slightly less than 4 T
for magnetic field,

167
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:47,165
and up to 2 MA
of plasma current.

168
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:53,908
The MAST spherical tokamak in UK
is significantly smaller.

169
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:59,555
It's 85 cm of major radius,
65 cm of minor radius,

170
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:02,318
you immediately notice
how close the two values are,

171
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:05,338
and that's why it's referred to
as spherical tokamak.

172
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:12,406
For the moment, magnetic field
has been limited to about 0.5 T,

173
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:18,065
but as I'll say in a moment,
there'll be significant upgrades to that

174
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:21,723
and the current is up to
almost 1.5 MA.

175
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:25,873
In the Tokamak TCV, we have
a similar size to MAST

176
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:30,452
in terms of major radius
but a conventional aspect ratio,

177
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,875
which implies a much smaller minor radius

178
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:39,422
of about 25 cm with a very
elongated cross-section.

179
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:45,754
The field is also up to about 1.4-1.5 T

180
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:49,073
and about 1 MA
of maximum plasma current.

181
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:53,380
These medium size tokamaks 
in Europe are foreseen,

182
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,292
as we see on the roadmap,

183
00:11:56,292 --> 00:12:02,066
to provide inputs for the physics
and the technology even on

184
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:06,528
the steady state approach
to plasma operation.

185
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:14,056
They also are very important in exploring
the question of the heat exhaust,

186
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,254
in particular by pushing advanced 
configurations that are now

187
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:19,672
impossible on JET.

188
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:24,487
I'd like to say a few words
about the individual devices.

189
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:28,510
First, the ASDEX Upgrade,
which is the largest of the three,

190
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,893
and it's also the one that has
the most complete set of heating systems.

191
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:40,414
It has the Ion Cyclotron
Resonance Heating up to 8 MW

192
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,597
in a range of 30 to 60 MHz, which is
the same range as in JET and ITER.

193
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:56,130
It has the Electron Cyclotron Resonance
Heating system up to 6 MW,

194
00:12:56,772 --> 00:13:00,040
140 GHz of frequency,

195
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:03,008
and a Neutron Beam injection,

196
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:08,462
20 MW at energies up to 100 KeV,

197
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,668
with the possibility
of injecting beams tangentially,

198
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:16,520
that is, to also drive
non-inductive current by beams.

199
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:23,333
Among the interesting
ancillaries to ASDEX

200
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,441
in addition to a very large
and complete set of diagnostics,

201
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:29,114
there is the injection of pellets.

202
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:33,652
This is a way to fuel the core
of the plasma in addition

203
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:37,279
to what the neutron beam can provide

204
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,617
and it's a system
that's specifically designed in order

205
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:46,237
for the pellets to reach more effectively
the very center of the plasma.

206
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:50,195
Exhaust studies are possible on ASDEX

207
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:55,323
at very high ratio of the power
over the major radius,

208
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:57,377
which is an important figure of merit,

209
00:13:57,427 --> 00:14:01,542
because the power
will be concentrating in a thin layer

210
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:06,456
around the divertor, and we need
for ITER and <i>a fortiori</i> for DEMO

211
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:10,884
to really reach very high
values of this ratio.

212
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:16,131
There will also be the possibility
of studying the limit on beta

213
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:19,950
with the heating systems
that are now implemented

214
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,239
and to use electron cyclotron
current drive

215
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:28,686
for the control of MHD instabilities.

216
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:36,202
ASDEX Upgrade has also internal coils
for the control of edge instabilities,

217
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:39,901
as we have discussed in other lectures,
the plasma at the edge

218
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:42,265
develops very, very strong gradients

219
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:46,112
which can, in turn, give rise
to very violent instabilities

220
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:48,743
called <i>edge localized modes</i> or ELMs

221
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:57,000
which can throw out on a very short
timescale a lot of energy and particles,

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,621
and that may be damaging the first wall,

223
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:02,861
so this is something to be
either avoided or mitigated,

224
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:07,625
and the use of coils
such as those represented here

225
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:11,215
can help in mitigating
these instabilities,

226
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:14,390
and the conditions in which
this method can work

227
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:19,406
both for ITER and potentially for DEMO
need to be understood.

228
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:24,791
We said that MAST is a spherical tokamak,
with a relatively low field,

229
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:28,938
but it is being upgraded and the version
of MAST that will be upgraded

230
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,733
is part of this European
medium size tokamak circle.

231
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:37,233
In particular, there will be
enhancements in the toroidal field

232
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:41,338
-- and that will significantly
improve the confinement,

233
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:45,852
in the central solenoid for increasing
the value of the plasma current

234
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,707
and the duration of the plasma pulse;

235
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:53,360
and in the plasma shaping capabilities,
to explore different configurations.

236
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:56,766
There will be an off-axis
neutral beam injector

237
00:15:56,857 --> 00:16:00,724
so that the control of the profile
will be possible.

238
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:06,280
There will be a new 
innovative configuration

239
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,222
for the divertor called Super-X
for a better power handling.

240
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,082
This is a very important exploration,
so let's say a few words about that.

241
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:20,722
The Super-X divertor
is represented here on the left

242
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:24,385
in a short movie
that illustrates its functioning,

243
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:30,047
particularly the Super-X Divertor
leads to longer connection lengths,

244
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,842
and because it takes the plasma
from the boundary

245
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:38,559
and brings it basically to a more
external chamber and larger values of R

246
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,965
it also leads to a reduced heat flux

247
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:50,389
and because of the surface on which
the heat is deposited will be larger.

248
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:54,146
The TCV tokamak in Lausanne,
Switzerland, where we are,

249
00:16:54,146 --> 00:17:01,145
is also part of this medium size
tokamak group in Europe.

250
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:07,088
The reason for that is that
it can provide significant input

251
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:12,031
on different physics questions,
including the question

252
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:19,522
of potential innovative configurations
for the divertor problem.

253
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:25,177
The reason why TCV can do that is
that it has an extreme flexibility

254
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,966
in its shape, both at the core
and at the edge.

255
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:33,866
The illustrations that are going
in front of you here are proof of that.

256
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,350
You can see different shapes
that are achieved on the TCV

257
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,038
and you can also see a specific shape
that is achieved on the TCV

258
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:45,315
which is the so-called <i>snowflake divertor</i>.

259
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:48,584
It has for the first time
been demonstrated on TCV.

260
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:51,267
Again, it's an innovative
configuration for the divertor

261
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:54,657
to improve the question of the heat flux

262
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,907
to that divertor target plate,

263
00:17:57,318 --> 00:18:00,973
and possibly even the stability
with respect to ELMs.

264
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:06,896
TCV is endowed with a very powerful
and flexible electron cyclotron

265
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:09,490
heating and current drive system.

266
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,789
At the moment, with six gyrotrons
that work at the second harmonic

267
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:24,955
for a total of 3 MW,
and 1.5 MW total of 3 gyrotrons

268
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:27,016
working at the third harmonic,

269
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:29,547
that is 118 GHz.

270
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,275
The flexibility in the system is not only

271
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:38,214
because of the frequency choice
between the two harmonics

272
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:42,188
but also because of the possibility
of injecting the beams

273
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,998
in different parts of the vessel
with different angles

274
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:51,878
to both heat the plasma locally,
treat instabilities locally,

275
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:54,377
and drive current non-inductively.

276
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:58,649
TCV is also undergoing
very major upgrades

277
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,215
both for ion and electron heating.

278
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:10,313
A neutral beam of 1 MW and about
30 KeV of energy is being installed.

279
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:18,390
Two dual-frequency gyrotrons
of 1 MW each, at 126 GHz

280
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,563
corresponding to the third harmonic,

281
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:23,042
or 84 GHz corresponding
to the second harmonic,

282
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:24,906
are being procured.

283
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:33,094
You see here the different gyrotrons
that are installed on the TCV plant

284
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,277
or that will be installed soon
on the TCV plant

285
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:39,953
with the transmission lines that take
the microwave power to the tokamak.

286
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:44,336
The tokamak will also be heated
by a neutral beam injector

287
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:47,839
that's being procured at the moment,
about 1 MW of power.

288
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:52,844
Naturally, one of the main elements in 
the European roadmap towards fusion power,

289
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:56,771
perhaps also in the world roadmap, is JET.

290
00:19:57,168 --> 00:20:01,822
You can see that JET here
appears as a major element

291
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:05,022
in the development
of the inductive plasma operation.

292
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:09,572
JET is not really foreseen to operate
in very advanced modes of operation

293
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:13,335
with the large fraction of the current
driven non-inductively,

294
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:16,708
but it has to contribute
to a number of open issues

295
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:19,219
related to the inductive scenario.

296
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,982
JET has a major radius
of about 3 m,

297
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:27,796
minus radius of about 1.25 m,

298
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:30,751
and the field goes
up to almost 4 T,

299
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:35,478
with a current
up to about 6 MA..

300
00:20:36,664 --> 00:20:40,234
JET is devoted at present
to really prepare the construction

301
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:41,803
and the operation of ITER,

302
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,953
acting as a testbed for the technology

303
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:46,860
and the plasma scenarios
that are foreseen for ITER.

304
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,877
In particular, JET
has an ITER-like wall.

305
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:54,639
It has the same combination
of materials as ITER will have,

306
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:56,211
beryllium and tungsten.

307
00:20:56,211 --> 00:21:00,321
JET will explore in this ITER
relevant conditions

308
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:05,748
how to prevent or mitigate the edge
instabilities we mentioned before,

309
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:09,378
that is, these very short
and very violent plasma outbursts

310
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:12,620
that can eject large heat
and particle loads on the vessel wall

311
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,815
that must be avoided
or mitigated for ITER.

312
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:24,646
JET is also placed where there is
very large development in remote handling,

313
00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:29,352
and this is a technological aspect
that is very important to fusion.

314
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:32,283
We need to learn how to operate
inside the fusion reactor

315
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:35,703
which is a hostile nuclear environment
for human beings.

316
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,610
Finally, JET is the only machine
in the world now

317
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,032
that can do DT plasmas.

318
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:50,020
Doing DT plasmas implies, of course,
preparing directly for ITER operation.

319
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:53,159
Just as an example
of the importance of the JET

320
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,549
data points for ITER,

321
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,045
I show here the figure
that we have seen before in the course:

322
00:21:58,045 --> 00:21:59,768
the empirical transport scaling.

323
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:03,127
Which has been used a basis 
for the ITER design.

324
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:09,002
As discussed before, this scaling is based
on a variety of devices.

325
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,520
It implies that we can plot
the confinement time from the experiment

326
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:20,875
as a function of the confinement
time from the scaling law

327
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,753
and get a very good correlation,
so in other words,

328
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:28,271
a scaling law is representative
of the variety of experiments.

329
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,943
Now, all of the experiments
apart from JET

330
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:34,771
are in a region relatively far away
from ITER .

331
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,692
You can see this is a log-log plot.

332
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:42,551
The points that are by far the closest
to ITER those are coming from JET,

333
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:48,482
so it's essential to have really
the minimum possible extrapolation to ITER

334
00:22:48,482 --> 00:22:54,161
in order to be sure, or to improve
the reliability, of our predictions

335
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:57,267
for ITER, in particular in this case,
for confinement time,

336
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,702
but this is just an example.

337
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:03,265
There are several areas for which
such proximity is essential.

338
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:11,984
JET has achieved a triple product
of about 2.6 x 10²⁰ m⁻³ keV seconds,

339
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:17,617
close to the record
ever achieved anywhere,

340
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:22,819
and it has achieved the record
fusion power on Earth

341
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:27,472
with 16 MW, obtained
in the end of 1997 in DT,

342
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:31,938
with a fusion gain about 0.6

343
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:36,863
One point I like to underline
in the European roadmap,

344
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:39,353
on which I focused
for this lesson, of course,

345
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:41,334
is not the only one in the world.

346
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,540
Even the European roadmap is based on
a number of international collaborations.

347
00:23:46,653 --> 00:23:48,856
I'd just like to highlight one.

348
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,763
This IC stands, in fact,
for international collaboration

349
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:57,082
and this is a picture which I took here
in a simplified and enlarged version

350
00:23:57,201 --> 00:24:02,991
of the Japanese tokamak
JT-60 Super Upgrade

351
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:06,555
which is being completed at the moment,

352
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:14,303
which will contribute
very significantly to the R&D needed

353
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:17,726
in particular for steady-state
operation of the plasma.

354
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:20,127
This is a superconducting tokamak

355
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:24,021
about the size of JET,
3 m major radius,

356
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:29,383
not very different
minor radius either, 1.2 m,

357
00:24:31,956 --> 00:24:36,425
up to 2.25 T
and up to 5.5 MA,

358
00:24:36,537 --> 00:24:39,691
so it will really concentrate
on the steady-state advanced regimes

359
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:41,299
that JET cannot address.

360
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,675
This is an example of complimentarity

361
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,152
in the world program, in fact

362
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,080
beyond the European frontiers.

363
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:56,544
I now come to what I would say is
<i>the</i> main element of the European roadmap,

364
00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:58,024
and that is ITER

365
00:24:58,024 --> 00:25:00,172
and you can see that the image of ITER

366
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:03,543
in fact, appears
in many different locations here

367
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,082
and that's because ITER
is the cornerstone

368
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:10,298
for a variety of the missions
we have highlighted before.

369
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:14,599
ITER will be the first burning plasma.

370
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:19,329
ITER will be the first demonstration
of scientific and technological

371
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:22,531
feasibility of fusion
and also of its safety.

372
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:28,760
ITER is designed to produce plasmas
with a fusion gain Q ≥ 10,

373
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,568
so that's the goal.

374
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:34,873
But that will not be done
for small amounts of power.

375
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,682
For fusion power they should
exceed half a gigawatt [0.5 GW]

376
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:44,063
and for a duration
of at least 500 seconds.

377
00:25:46,816 --> 00:25:49,358
ITER has a size of about
6 m, major radius,

378
00:25:49,358 --> 00:25:51,866
2 m, minor radius.

379
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:55,040
The plasma volume is slightly less
than 1,000 cubic meters.

380
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:58,769
The toroidal field is 5.3 T,

381
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:02,278
and the current flow in the plasma
of about 50 MA.

382
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:03,901
Here you can see the construction site

383
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:06,697
for ITER in Cadarache
in the south of France

384
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:09,645
which is in fact evolving
every day at present

385
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:13,083
as you can see.
Here is an image of the layout of ITER

386
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,719
with a human being
represented in the bottom

387
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:20,030
reminding us
of the scale of the project.

388
00:26:20,952 --> 00:26:26,346
Just to highlight one of the novelty
elements of the ITER plasmas

389
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:30,711
I have represented here
the foreseen Q=10 scenario

390
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,009
so that's the one
we promised to achieve.

391
00:26:33,507 --> 00:26:36,036
With 15 MA, 500 MW fusion power,

392
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:38,800
and you see here
as a function of the time

393
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,455
in the discharge,
which lasts 700 seconds,

394
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:43,727
you see the Q, i.e. the fusion gain,

395
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,717
going up to 10 and then coming
back down at the end of the discharge

396
00:26:46,717 --> 00:26:51,141
but the point I want to make
is that we really have

397
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:54,721
a different regime in ITER compared
to what we have in machines today,

398
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:57,935
even on the DT experiments
we have done on TFTR and JET.

399
00:26:58,098 --> 00:27:01,915
Look at a plasma α-particles power.

400
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,034
It's about one fifth
of the total fusion power,

401
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:07,560
so it's about 100 MW,

402
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:14,037
and if we take a single shot,
one shot of ITER of this kind,

403
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:19,083
we'll have energy in alphas that would be
of the order of 50 gigajoules [50GJ].

404
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,637
This is to be compared
with the total energy

405
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:26,176
that we have ever produced in all
the DT experiments in the world so far,

406
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:28,806
particularly in JET and TFTR,

407
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,536
which is 10 times less.

408
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:35,999
So, one single shot of ITER will produce
10 times more α-particles energy

409
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:39,237
than the whole history of fusion so far.

410
00:27:40,335 --> 00:27:42,784
Without going into details
of the ITER design,

411
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:45,516
which is extremely complex,
as you can imagine,

412
00:27:45,516 --> 00:27:49,603
I'd just like to highlight in this picture
the main components of ITER.

413
00:27:50,721 --> 00:27:53,521
Starting from the top here,
the central solenoid.

414
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:58,102
This is the superconducting coil
of niobium and tin,

415
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,248
six modules of it.

416
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:04,573
Then we see the vacuum vessel
which is being constructed.

417
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:06,926
It's divided into 9 sectors.

418
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:12,343
A very important piece of the project

419
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:16,524
is the toroidal field coils,
represented here

420
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:17,970
in orange.

421
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,461
These coils are made of niobium tin,
and there are 18 of them,

422
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:27,169
whereas there are 6 poloidal field coils,
- you can see here

423
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:29,778
a cross section of one,

424
00:28:29,778 --> 00:28:31,995
they are made of niobium titanium.

425
00:28:33,315 --> 00:28:36,300
We can also see the machine supports

426
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,457
and going to the other side,
you can see the divertor structure here.

427
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:46,494
The divertor is made of what are called
<i>cassettes</i>, 54 cassettes.

428
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:49,844
These are modular elements
that can be replaced

429
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:52,598
on a relatively short timescale.

430
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:57,159
There are 8 cryopumps,

431
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,885
very large size.

432
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:02,650
There are many openings

433
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,982
to access the inside of the tokamak.

434
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:08,558
The example here is that of the

435
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:10,032
ICRH antenna

436
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:13,530
which comes on a port plug
as we've discussed in a previous lecture.

437
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,139
Six of these port blocks
are dedicated to heating,

438
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:18,823
three are dedicated
to the test blanket modules

439
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:22,393
two are for limiters and remote handling,

440
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,523
and the others are for diagnostics.

441
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:29,294
A blanket module is shown
here, as an example,

442
00:29:29,294 --> 00:29:33,207
and of course, the whole
of the machine is enclosed

443
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:38,089
in what I believe will be the largest
cryostat ever built.

444
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:44,484
In this picture you see the different
diagnostic systems foreseen for ITER.

445
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:48,448
Again, we will not go into any details

446
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:54,262
but you can imagine that the challenges
we had for hot plasmas in general,

447
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:58,181
are, of course, applicable to ITER,
but on top of those,

448
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,432
--which implies that you cannot put
any material surface

449
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,489
inside the plasma
to measure anything,

450
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:08,745
and that you really need to be clever
in interpreting your data

451
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:12,167
from known thermal components
on the plasma, etc..

452
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:16,970
In addition to this, we have 
a hostile nuclear environment so far.

453
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,347
For example, neutron irradiation,

454
00:30:19,347 --> 00:30:24,293
so there's a strong implication of that.

455
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:31,067
For example, on the difficulty
of having mirrors close to the plasma

456
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:35,731
for light to be extracted
at different wavelengths.

457
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:38,947
There's also the question
of the feed-throughs

458
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:40,885
for the diagnostic passages.

459
00:30:40,885 --> 00:30:45,440
They need to be compatible
with the machine safety constraints,

460
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,561
and so on.

461
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:51,185
You can see a survey X-ray measurement,

462
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:55,786
you can see ultraviolet
of different kinds for spectroscopy,

463
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:59,790
another spectroscopy system for X-rays,

464
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,851
reflectometry for the divertor region,

465
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:06,347
Thompson scattering
for the divertor region,

466
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:09,456
infrared viewing,
electron cyclotron emission,

467
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:14,626
for electron temperatures,
motional Stark effect,

468
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:18,867
for having the internal structure
of the magnetic field,

469
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:20,929
Thompson scattering, more at the edge,

470
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,721
--There will be Thomson
scattering in the core, of course,

471
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:27,238
so a large variety of diagnostics
which different partners of ITER

472
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,496
are building,

473
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:31,465
all, of course, compatible
with the constraints

474
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:34,463
that will be dictated
by the machine environment

475
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:37,806
that will be very different
from what we are used to today.

476
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:42,532
So there are challenges in building
the individual components for ITER,

477
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:44,563
each one being state of the art,

478
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:48,066
each one being subject
to a number of constraints,

479
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:53,582
including constraints on availability,
maintainability, and durability,

480
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:57,558
but it will also be a major challenge

481
00:31:57,981 --> 00:32:00,098
to put these pieces together.

482
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:03,641
What you're seeing here
is a movie that represents

483
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:06,073
the assembly of ITER.

484
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:11,375
We say that this is the world's
largest puzzle ever constructed.

485
00:32:12,352 --> 00:32:18,583
It will be quite a challenge to really
assemble all of these pieces together

486
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:21,569
in a relatively short time.

487
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:26,949
ITER is not the end
of research for fusion.

488
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:31,929
ITER will demonstrate that fusion
can be controlled on Earth,

489
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:34,552
scientifically and technologically,

490
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,734
but we need one step more.
We need DEMO.

491
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:42,686
DEMO will demonstrate that fusion energy
is also possible commercially.

492
00:32:44,227 --> 00:32:50,309
DEMO will need to have
a fusion power gain of 30 or a bit more

493
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:55,670
with a fusion power of the order of 3 GW,

494
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:59,266
corresponding to electrical power
of the order of 1 GW

495
00:32:59,266 --> 00:33:01,477
and it will need to work in steady-state.

496
00:33:04,136 --> 00:33:07,048
In my opinion, this is a personal opinion,

497
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:10,005
the areas where more
innovation is needed are:

498
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:14,881
- the exhaust heat from the plasma,
- the breeding of tritium,

499
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:16,455
- the materials.

500
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:21,061
Several concepts are under development
in different parts of the world.

501
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:24,362
There's a European concept
being developed in Europe,

502
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:26,767
maybe even two versions of that.

503
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:31,433
There's a concept in Japan, a concept
in the US, in Korea, and in China.

504
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:36,303
While I don't want to go into
any details for the different concepts,

505
00:33:36,303 --> 00:33:40,988
I stress once more that there are
elements of competition,

506
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:42,496
which is, of course, natural,

507
00:33:42,496 --> 00:33:44,692
but there are also elements
of complementarity

508
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:47,112
among all of these approaches.

509
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:51,640
In summary, we have seen
that roadmaps to fusion

510
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,110
are being developed
in different countries,

511
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,642
in different parts of the world.

512
00:33:55,642 --> 00:34:00,605
They all recognize the need to develop
enabling technology in nuclear environment

513
00:34:00,701 --> 00:34:02,979
which is something
that we've not seen so far.

514
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:06,617
We need to involve industry
in the progress

515
00:34:06,617 --> 00:34:10,076
towards the DEMO step,
towards a fusion reactor.

516
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:13,349
We need to address materials issues.

517
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:16,116
Materials are a very crucial element
of fusion technology.

518
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:21,611
We need to optimize the magnets
that'll be superconducting for high field.

519
00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:25,711
All of these are elements
of fusion technology

520
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:29,665
that are absolutely essential;

521
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:32,846
yet, I believe we can say
that plasma physics for fusion

522
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:34,866
is really far from being complete.

523
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:37,704
For example, we don't know how
to operate a steady state tokamak

524
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:41,490
at high field, high density,
and high temperature.

525
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:45,618
We have made enormous progress
in controlling the plasma,

526
00:34:45,618 --> 00:34:46,928
in controlling its instabilities

527
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:50,791
but we don't know yet how to control
the fast ions entirely, for example.

528
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:57,452
We don't know yet what is the best
magnetic configuration at the edge

529
00:34:57,452 --> 00:35:00,614
in order to alleviate the problem
of the plasma exhaust.

530
00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:04,074
These are just examples
of plasma physics related problems

531
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:07,062
that are not fully understood,

532
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:09,480
not fully addressed,
and not fully optimized

533
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,254
to get as efficient as possible
to the fusion reactor.
