00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:07,651
Welcome to the course
on plasma physics and applications.

2
00:00:08,193 --> 00:00:10,462
Today we will continue
our discussion on how

3
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:13,748
we can heat the plasma 
and drive current in it using waves.

4
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:18,455
After a brief reminder
of the fluid dispersion relation —

5
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:23,078
that is the condition
that we need to impose

6
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:25,590
in order for the waves 
to propagate in a plasma —

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,548
and a brief reminder of the concept
of wave-particle resonance,

8
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:31,585
which is the mechanism 
by which we transfer energy

9
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:33,894
from the wave to the plasma,

10
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:37,429
we will focus on the electron 
cyclotron resonance heating system.

11
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:44,332
We will see in some degree of detail
what are the physical mechanisms

12
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:45,822
that are behind it,

13
00:00:45,822 --> 00:00:48,649
how we can avoid 
the reflection layers

14
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,363
for the wave in the plasma
that we refer to as cutoffs

15
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,747
in order to reach 
the absorption layers in the plasma

16
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:56,730
that we refer to as resonances.

17
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,931
And how we can use 
the two polarizations that characterize

18
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:04,820
the perpendicular propagation
of the wave in a plasma

19
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:09,305
in order to do that —
the ordinary and the extraordinary mode.

20
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:16,259
We will see how we can build
a source of microwaves

21
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:20,855
that gives the power 
that we need to heat the plasma

22
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:24,425
at the frequency we need 
to operate — that is the gyrotron.

23
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:29,688
Then we will illustrate a couple 
of examples of actual systems

24
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:32,403
that are based on the ECRH
principle to heat the plasma

25
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:33,986
and drive current into it.

26
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:37,317
One that already operates
in an actual tokamak,

27
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:40,435
is the system on the TCV tokamak
here in Lausanne

28
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:44,417
and the system that we foresee for ITER.

29
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:49,104
As a brief reminder,
I'll just highlight the fact

30
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:53,188
that in magnetized plasmas
we can have the propagation

31
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:54,340
of many modes.

32
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,896
These modes can be used
to transfer energy,

33
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,334
typically via an antenna
or a launcher into the plasma core.

34
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:03,407
That's the basic principle
of heating plasma using waves.

35
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,317
But I'd also like to remind you
that the frequency

36
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:10,180
and/or the wavelength 
of these waves must be chosen

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,226
in order to satisfy 
the plasma dispersion relation,

38
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:16,449
that is, the condition for the wave
to exist and propagate in the plasma.

39
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,642
We also need to choose a scenario —

40
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:21,688
that is a combination 
of frequency and wavelength —

41
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:24,508
in order to allow the wave
to deposit its energy

42
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:26,702
in a layer that corresponds
to a plasma resonance,

43
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:28,146
typically in the plasma core.

44
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,572
Again, as a reminder, 
I'll just highlight

45
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:36,131
the fact that we have found
that in a fluid model

46
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,661
there are no cyclotron resonances
for propagation,

47
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:43,417
other than along 
the magnetic field of the plasma.

48
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:48,314
This is a dispersion relation
that we found in the fluid model

49
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:52,860
in the direction perpendicular
to the magnetic field

50
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,652
and we see that the resonances
corresponding to the situation

51
00:02:56,652 --> 00:03:00,557
in which the wave number
goes to infinity for a finite frequency

52
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:04,114
corresponds to the lower hybrid
and upper hybrid frequencies,

53
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:08,184
respectively, so no resonance
for the cyclotron frequency.

54
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:14,191
However, we have already seen
in the last lecture

55
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:16,812
that in the kinetic model,
that is the model that goes

56
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,807
one step beyond the fluid approach,

57
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:21,593
considering that the velocities 
of the particles are not all the same,

58
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:24,075
--so we have distributions
that characterize the plasma--

59
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:27,887
in this model the wave-particle 
resonances exist and occur

60
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:32,811
when the frequency seen
by the moving particle,

61
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:35,662
which is of course the frequency
that we launched in the plasma

62
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:38,259
Doppler-shifted by the k · v there

63
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,943
corresponds either to zero,

64
00:03:40,943 --> 00:03:44,071
which means the plasma wave moves

65
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:48,766
with a phase velocity that corresponds
to the velocity of the particle

66
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:52,142
or to multiples
of the cyclotron frequencies.

67
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:57,230
So we do have cyclotron resonances
in this more advanced model,

68
00:03:58,082 --> 00:04:01,392
even for waves that do not propagate
along the magnetic field.

69
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:05,950
So the game here is
to reach these resonances,

70
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,967
avoiding the cutoffs,
which are the reflection points.

71
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:15,008
Reflection points are characterized
by an index of refraction going to zero

72
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:16,818
that is typically finite ω

73
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:20,201
and a wave number going to zero.

74
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:24,411
Although the resonances
cannot be identified

75
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:27,448
by the fluid model,
at least in perpendicular propagation

76
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:30,775
or oblique propagation 
in general, the cutoffs can.

77
00:04:31,423 --> 00:04:34,968
In fact, in this dispersion relation
that we have already seen before,

78
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:38,780
we can identify already cutoff points

79
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,729
such as ωL and ωR

80
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:46,581
for the extraordinary mode (XM), the mode 
in which the oscillating electric field

81
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:50,458
is perpendicular
to the ambient magnetic field,

82
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:54,447
or the ωp cutoff,
which is the well-known cutoff

83
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:58,690
for the ordinary mode, which corresponds
to the polarization of the wave (OM)

84
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,491
such that the oscillating electric field
of the wave is actually parallel

85
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:04,909
to the ambient magnetic field.

86
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,018
So these are general concepts
that apply to different kinds of waves

87
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:14,497
and we're now focusing on the electron
cyclotron resonance heating scheme.

88
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:17,868
The idea here is to transfer
power to the electrons

89
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,429
at the cyclotron resonance
or at its harmonics.

90
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:25,374
If I take the fundamental 
cyclotronic frequency,

91
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:29,397
so n = 1, if you like,
in the previous expression,

92
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:32,899
and if I express that 
in terms of gigahertz [GHz],

93
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:38,759
the value that I have is about 28 times
the magnetic field expressed in tesla.

94
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:44,296
So for a three-tesla device,
we have something on the order

95
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:47,628
of 100 GHz of frequency
for the electron cyclotron resonance.

96
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,247
At these high frequencies,
the vacuum wavelengths

97
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:54,969
are relatively small —
they are in the millimeter range.

98
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:59,384
That implies that the wave propagates
in a quasi-optical manner,

99
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:04,176
also that the wave is — reasonably
well described in Fourier formalism

100
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:07,655
and one can use ray or beam tracing
to the describe the propagation

101
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:09,380
of it into the plasma.

102
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:14,716
Because the wave is a well-focused beam

103
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:18,251
we can have local absorption
and therefore local heating

104
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:20,212
and even local current drive.

105
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:24,609
Another important point is
there is no need for an antenna

106
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:27,860
to be placed inside a plasma,
because of this quasi-optical propagation

107
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,787
of the wave.

108
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,534
We need to have a launcher
and/or mirror to steer the beam

109
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,078
in the direction we'd like to go.

110
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:40,463
The polarization of the wave
can be determined by different components

111
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:43,177
and controlled by the orientation
of the waveguides and mirrors.

112
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:48,230
If we inject the wave with
a parallel wave number that's not zero,

113
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,568
in other words we give it 
a direction with a component

114
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:54,300
along the magnetic field that's not zero,

115
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:56,684
we can drive current with the wave.

116
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,359
So now we have to choose 
the frequency and the polarization

117
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:07,614
that are adequate to guarantee two things—
to guarantee what we call accessibility,

118
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:12,722
that is, again, to reach the resonance
avoiding the cutoff,

119
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:16,919
which normally is implied by the presence
of a density that's too high.

120
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,545
I notice that in fact, there is
no minimum density requirement

121
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:23,789
for this scheme, as opposed
to ICRH and lower hybrid

122
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:28,739
and also, in order to have
a good power absorption in a plasma.

123
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:32,337
The first scheme we can think of is
the so-called ordinary mode.

124
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:35,553
As I said before, this is a mode
in which the wave electric field

125
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:38,874
is parallel to the ambient magnetic field.

126
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,668
Let's illustrate the scenario
that we can operate with.

127
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:45,411
This is my tokamak plasma cross-section.

128
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:50,694
I'm coming for practical reasons
from the low field side,

129
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:54,227
that is, from the outside part
of the tokamak

130
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:59,440
and I inject my wave
in the radial direction,

131
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,200
perpendicular to B₀,
to the ambient magnetic field.

132
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,806
Now this is the ordinary mode,

133
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:09,151
so if I take a reference frame here,

134
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:14,169
I would have a propagation
that would be in the radial direction,

135
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:19,858
a wave electric field
that would be aligned

136
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:23,668
with the magnetic field —
of course the wave electric field

137
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:26,238
will oscillate up and down its sign,

138
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:29,067
and from the plasma point of view,
we need to consider

139
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:32,219
where are the cutoffs
and where is the resonance.

140
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:40,015
Suppose I choose a frequency
for my wave that corresponds

141
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:44,542
to the cyclotron frequency
at the center of the plasma,

142
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,201
or roughly at the center of the plasma.

143
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,508
I'd like to reach that resonance,

144
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:52,364
but what do I have to make sure of?

145
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:55,874
I have to make sure that I don't hit
a cutoff before that.

146
00:08:55,874 --> 00:09:00,747
The cutoff for the ordinary mode
is the plasma frequency [ωp] cutoff,

147
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:05,342
so there will be a region
that will be inaccessible to my wave

148
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:09,509
because the frequency will correspond

149
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:13,888
to a density that will be larger
than the cutoff density.

150
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:17,059
I'm illustrating that
in a profile of the density itself.

151
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,964
The black region above the cutoff density

152
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:22,240
is inaccessible.

153
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,461
So in the example here,
I have my wave coming

154
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,238
and before it reaches the resonance,

155
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:31,796
which is corresponding
to the wave frequency

156
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:34,514
being equal to the local 
cyclotron frequency—

157
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:36,592
and I was hoping 
that that would be in the center—

158
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:40,816
I hit the cutoff relative to the ωp,
to the plasma frequency

159
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:43,872
which you have seen 
in the previous part of the course.

160
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:48,973
So I can't have access
to this resonance I was trying to reach.

161
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:53,746
The only way I can go about that
is to reduce the density

162
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:58,033
in order to reach the resonant frequency

163
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:01,533
corresponding to fc before I reach
the corresponding cutoff.

164
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,766
So say I take a lower density.

165
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:07,940
Then I can indeed heat the plasma

166
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:14,064
by heating the resonance
before I reach the cutoff,

167
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:16,083
which corresponds to a reflection point.

168
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:21,422
So O-mode heating is possible
but only up to a certain density value.

169
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,641
Let us now explore a second option
that we have for the polarization,

170
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,812
the so-called extraordinary 
mode or X-mode

171
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:35,309
in which the oscillating field of the wave
is perpendicular to the magnetic field.

172
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:39,153
As we have seen, the dispersion relation
for this mode is quite different

173
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:40,902
from the ordinary mode.

174
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,426
Let's consider first the first harmonic,

175
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:47,445
that is, we have 
the frequency of the wave,

176
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:51,695
roughly chosen to be corresponding
to the resonance frequency

177
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:56,132
of the electron cyclotron motion
at, say, the plasma core.

178
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:03,456
I draw my tokamak, 
I inject as before from the low field side

179
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:07,028
with a waveguide that launches
the waves towards the core.

180
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:10,239
Polarization now is different.

181
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:13,789
We have the wave electric field
that's perpendicular

182
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:16,533
to the ambient magnetic field,

183
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:19,894
and the wave vector that is
perpendicular to both

184
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:21,722
and is directed
in the radial direction.

185
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:26,360
So we have, say, the cyclotron frequency

186
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,333
roughly in the center.

187
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,002
That's the fc resonance.

188
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:33,228
But for the extraordinary mode,

189
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,624
we also have the upper hybrid resonance,

190
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:43,079
whose shape is dictated
by the combination of the magnetic field

191
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,880
and of the plasma density.

192
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,184
And we have the x-mode cutoff,

193
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:52,494
which is well represented by 
the fluid, the special relation,

194
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:56,653
which is to the right-hand side
of the upper hybrid resonance.

195
00:11:56,653 --> 00:12:00,313
So this is my resonance,
upper hybrid resonance,

196
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:02,096
and this is the cutoff layer.

197
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:07,677
So in fact, that means
there's a forbidden area

198
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:10,175
for propagation between the two.

199
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,235
And if the wave comes
from the low field side,

200
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:17,942
it's bound to meet first the cutoff layer

201
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:22,010
before it can have a chance
of meeting the upper hybrid

202
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,633
or the electron cyclotron resonance.

203
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,598
So this cannot work

204
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,048
because the wave 
cannot reach any resonance.

205
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,997
So what can we do
to improve the situation?

206
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:38,136
The idea is to go to higher harmonics —

207
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:44,560
say the second or even third harmonic
of the electron cyclotron frequency.

208
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:47,781
Let's take the example
of the second harmonic.

209
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:53,020
The frequency of the wave
will be chosen to correspond roughly

210
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,696
to two times the electron 
cyclotron frequency

211
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:59,390
in the plasma core
or close to the center.

212
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:07,941
I'm still coming from the low field side
with my wave, exact same way as before.

213
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:17,346
Electric field perpendicular to B₀
and with a wave vector

214
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:18,627
that's directed radially.

215
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:21,017
Why does this help me?

216
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,797
What have I done to improve the situation?

217
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:29,120
Well, I have essentially taken
the first harmonic resonance

218
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,709
and the upper hybrid resonance
and the cutoff all the way to the left.

219
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:38,503
I have moved them all the way to the left

220
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:43,774
so that they can be —
the fc can even be outside a plasma —

221
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:46,156
it doesn't really matter anymore.

222
00:13:46,663 --> 00:13:49,994
Upper hybrid would be
somewhere in the plasma, of course —

223
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:55,131
this is my upper hybrid layer —
this is the X-mode cutoff.

224
00:13:55,723 --> 00:14:01,561
And the point is that the resonance
that I'm trying to reach,

225
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:05,221
which is the 2fce resonance,

226
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:08,583
is now in front of the cutoff layer.

227
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:13,088
So my wave coming from the right
can indeed hit that resonance

228
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:17,686
before it hits any cutoff layer,
so before it's reflected back

229
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:20,830
from the plasma
back to the antenna on the launcher.

230
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:24,801
So this is a situation
which we can envisage

231
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:26,891
to heat the plasma

232
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:31,489
and even, if we direct
the wave in a particular direction,

233
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:33,585
drive current non-inductively through it.

234
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:36,751
Now we note we can't really 
continue the scheme —

235
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:41,132
we can think of having 
the third harmonic also,

236
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:48,668
and therefore increase the density value
corresponding to the X-mode cutoff

237
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:52,546
but we can't do that indefinitely
because we have, first of all,

238
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:57,702
a reduced absorption efficiency
as we go to higher and higher harmonics.

239
00:14:58,326 --> 00:15:02,091
Second of all, it will become difficult
to have the availability

240
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:06,910
of high-power sources
at such increasingly high frequencies.

241
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,555
In fact, as we said, 
the fundamental frequency

242
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:15,425
for a 3-4 teslas device
is of the order of 100 GHz.

243
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:20,103
If we take the second harmonic,

244
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:23,407
that will be 200 GHz,

245
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:25,758
which is already quite difficult
for a high-power source.

246
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,018
What kind of power sources 
do we have in this range?

247
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:32,026
This is illustrated in the picture

248
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:35,363
where we can see the power
that sources can provide

249
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:37,481
on a logarithmic scale,

250
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,864
see, 100, 10 kilowatt and 1 megawatt,
as a function of the frequency.

251
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:47,242
100 GHZ is in this range,

252
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:49,892
where we can see that the power
that can be provided

253
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:54,575
by relatively simple 
and conventional sources

254
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:58,839
such as the traveling wave tube 
amplifier [TWT] or the Magnetron

255
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:01,472
or the Klystron
is actually very, very small.

256
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:06,403
We're not yet in the frequency range
where lasers can provide power,

257
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:08,036
so what can we have as a source?

258
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:09,878
We have something 
that's called a gyrotron.

259
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:12,050
That's typically a source that covers

260
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,503
the 10 to 100, 150, 200 GHz
range of frequency.

261
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,277
What is a gyrotron?

262
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:24,464
Let's look at the basic principles
behind its functioning

263
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:25,774
in very simple terms.

264
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,338
The function is based on the so-called
cyclotron resonance master instability,

265
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:33,992
which is a relativistic effect
associated with the bunching

266
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:37,847
of the electron motion
as they gyrate around the field lines.

267
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:40,982
There are three essential 
components in a gyrotron.

268
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:43,593
There's an electron beam that's annular,

269
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:47,683
which is produced by a cathode,

270
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:52,070
here, illustrated by this shadowed area,

271
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:56,152
the electron beam propagates
in the axial direction here

272
00:16:56,152 --> 00:17:00,446
guided by a strong magnetic field
which is produced by the coils

273
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:04,542
of which we see the cross-sections here,
which again confines the electrons

274
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:07,948
but also determines the frequency
at which they gyrate

275
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:09,680
around the field lines.

276
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:15,501
Where the electron beam propagates
and where the magnetic field is produced

277
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,198
and where it's actually flat
in its intensity,

278
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:21,738
we have a resonant cavity.

279
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:25,738
That's the third component 
of the gyrotron.

280
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,845
It's essentially a cylinder
with a smoothly varying cross-section

281
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,949
and its resonant cavity allows
resonant interaction

282
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:35,459
between the electrons 
and the modes in the cavity —

283
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,445
again, wave-particle resonance.

284
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:41,608
The same kind that we are 
actually using, in some sense,

285
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:44,664
to heat the plasma
once the wave is launched into it.

286
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:48,415
So what remains to be done
is simply to extract the energy

287
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:51,038
from this cavity using a window

288
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:56,545
in the form of a particular polarization
for an electromagnetic wave

289
00:17:56,545 --> 00:18:00,804
that will propagate in waveguides 
all the way to our tokamak plasma.

290
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:04,666
Naturally, we need to dump the energy

291
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,666
of the remaining electrons

292
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:13,297
that have passed through the cavity
and that have provided their energy

293
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:14,762
or part of their energy

294
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:17,584
to the electromagnetic wave in the cavity.

295
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:22,557
Here we see a broken view
of the gyrotron — its layout.

296
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:26,253
Once again, there's a cathode
on this side, the annular beam,

297
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:29,630
which is now represented
in a yellow color;

298
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:36,085
the guiding magnetic field,
which is produced

299
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,265
by a superconducting coil, typically;

300
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,401
the resonant cavity;
and the output window,

301
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,423
through which we extract
the electromagnetic wave

302
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,631
in the form of a beam.

303
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:52,490
The window typically needs to allow

304
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,386
close to 100% of the power 
to be extracted,

305
00:18:56,386 --> 00:19:00,565
so it has to absorb very low amounts 
of the microwave power

306
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:04,815
and typically is made
of a CVD diamond.

307
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:11,283
Then we of course have
the collector that collects the electrons

308
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,216
and their remaining energy.

309
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:16,905
Let's look at the layout
of an existing ECRH system —

310
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,308
that's the system that we have
on the TCV tokamak in Lausanne.

311
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:24,499
There are two kinds of sources
at two different frequencies,

312
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:28,676
although all of them are gyrotrons,
we can see here the different sources

313
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:34,167
installed tens of meters away
from the tokamak

314
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:39,544
and connected to the tokamak
by oversized, overmoded waveguides

315
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:43,596
which guarantee the transport
of the wave energy

316
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,216
with very low amounts of losses.

317
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:48,960
Then there is an injection
of the wave energy

318
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,540
into the tokamak plasma.

319
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,421
More specifically, to give you an idea
of the parameters of the ECRH system,

320
00:19:57,737 --> 00:20:00,762
we have two subsystems.

321
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:06,036
The one at the second harmonic X-mode,
this is exactly the schema

322
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:10,208
of operation we illustrated
in simple terms a few minutes ago.

323
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,744
We refer to that as X2.

324
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:16,598
The actual frequency is about 83 gigaherz.

325
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,271
There are six sources at this frequency,

326
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:25,974
each one having half a megawatt,
and we inject their power

327
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:29,200
through side launchers,

328
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:34,505
both to heat the plasma
in determined locations

329
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:36,423
inside the tokamak,

330
00:20:36,423 --> 00:20:41,623
and to launch waves
with a particular direction,

331
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:44,450
therefore to drive a current
in the plasma,

332
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,317
which we refer to as the ECCD scheme —
electron cyclotron current drive scheme.

333
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:52,627
Second harmonic X-mode 
has a cutoff density

334
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:56,869
of a few times 10¹⁹ per cubic meter.

335
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:59,729
If we see the top view
of the injection points of the tokamak,

336
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:04,964
we can see that by moving
the steering mirror,

337
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:08,658
we can in fact give an angle
to the injection of the wave

338
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:11,508
and determine the propagation
in one direction or the other

339
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:14,736
and therefore determine,
also, current drive

340
00:21:14,736 --> 00:21:16,071
in one direction or the other.

341
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:19,480
Current drive can be off-axis
or on-axis depending,

342
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,813
again, on the choice 
of the injection geometry.

343
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:27,266
The second subsystem that we have

344
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:30,637
is the system working
at the third harmonic X-mode,

345
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:33,147
referred to as X3.

346
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,946
The frequency is 
in this case 118 GHz.

347
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:41,863
We have so far 3 sources
of half a megawatt each.

348
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,694
They are injected from the top.

349
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:48,348
As I said before 
in very qualitative terms,

350
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,750
as we increase the harmonic number,

351
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:54,018
so as we go higher and higher
in frequency,

352
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:56,509
the absorption efficiency
is less and less.

353
00:21:56,509 --> 00:22:01,520
That's exactly why we inject from the top,
so we have actually more plasma

354
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,633
to go through in order 
for the absorption to reach good levels,

355
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,326
even at the third harmonic.

356
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:10,986
The advantage of the third harmonic 
is that its cutoff density,

357
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:15,638
the density above which
the wave cannot penetrate to the core,

358
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:20,599
is higher, about 1.2 x 10²⁰
per cubic meter.

359
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:26,691
So we do inject these waves,
first of all to heat the plasma,

360
00:22:27,536 --> 00:22:29,489
and how does plasma respond?

361
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:32,547
I'd like to show just one
very simple example.

362
00:22:32,547 --> 00:22:35,547
This is the profile 
of the electron temperature,

363
00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:37,816
expressed in millions of degrees.

364
00:22:39,277 --> 00:22:42,986
In the ohmic situation,
that is the plasma which is only heated

365
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,749
by the electrical current flowing in it,

366
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:50,642
we have a fairly low and even 
a fairly flat temperature profile.

367
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:55,160
If we inject these waves
at the second harmonic or the X-mode,

368
00:22:55,198 --> 00:23:00,191
then we have very big 
and very high-profile,

369
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:03,961
reaching values above 150 million degrees.

370
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:07,152
Another important point
that was discovered

371
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:12,802
in a number of experiments including TCV
is that using ECRH power,

372
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:16,596
locally deposited in
particular points in a plasma

373
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:21,868
some instabilities can be controlled 
or even suppressed completely.

374
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:25,326
That's the case 
of the so-called tearing modes,

375
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:30,929
which are instabilities that develop
in the core of the plasma

376
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:35,799
and provide a change even in 
the topology of the plasma,

377
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:38,909
creating islands in the magnetic 
fields inside the plasma,

378
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:45,146
therefore leading to a loss of heat
from the core of the plasma.

379
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:51,407
You can see in this movie
that this instability can develop

380
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:55,642
in the TCV tokamak 
and can actually lead

381
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,587
to a degradation of its performance.

382
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:02,147
The point is that if we can inject
a microwave beam

383
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:09,153
exactly on top of that instability —
the details of interaction

384
00:24:09,153 --> 00:24:15,000
between the beam and the magnetic island
are too complicated to be discussed

385
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,674
in this course — we can actually eliminate
this instability, eliminate this bubble

386
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:23,386
that leads to a degradation of performance.

387
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:29,671
Let's now look at the ECRH system
as it is being developed for ITER.

388
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:35,800
ITER has a higher magnetic field than TCV,
so it would be very hard,

389
00:24:36,296 --> 00:24:40,378
if not impossible, 
to find sources of microwaves

390
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:45,736
at the second or third
harmonic of the fce.

391
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:49,591
That's why we're actually working
with a so-called O1 scheme,

392
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:51,921
that is, the first scheme
we have seen together,

393
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:55,475
the ordinary mode, 
being injected to deposit energy

394
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:58,217
at the fundamental frequency f = fce.

395
00:24:58,217 --> 00:25:01,849
In ITER that corresponds to 170GHz.

396
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:06,862
The system foresees 24 gyrotrons
of 1 MW each

397
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:08,514
in continuous wave operation -

398
00:25:08,514 --> 00:25:13,641
that's of course 24 MW —
that will be used for a number of things

399
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:17,041
in addition to heating: for ionizing
the plasma to begin with

400
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,741
and initiate the discharge,

401
00:25:20,528 --> 00:25:24,886
of course to heat the plasma core,
to drive current non-inductively,

402
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:27,342
to control the plasma current profile,

403
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:32,355
and lengthen the ohmic pulse, eventually,

404
00:25:33,287 --> 00:25:35,677
and, as we have seen
in the example of TCV,

405
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:41,825
very importantly, to control 
the instability development.

406
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:45,301
In fact, in ITER, this will be
the primary goal

407
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,124
of the ECRH system.

408
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:51,864
Here you see an image
of the layout of the system

409
00:25:51,864 --> 00:25:56,626
with the gyrotron sources —
with 24 of them, quite far away

410
00:25:56,626 --> 00:26:00,343
from the tokamak hall,

411
00:26:01,313 --> 00:26:04,766
a set of transmission lines,
and a set of launchers

412
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:08,516
for injecting the power
into the tokamak plasma.

413
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:13,004
There will be one equatorial launcher
to inject the power

414
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:16,290
at the equatorial plane of ITER,

415
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:21,137
and besides the details
into which we will not go.

416
00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:25,107
I'd like to note that there's a steerable mirror
so that there's a toroidal steering range

417
00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:28,726
from 20 to 45 degrees
in the toroidal direction.

418
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:32,557
This is a development
that's been undertaken in Japan.

419
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:38,114
There will also be a launcher
from the top of the device,

420
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:42,078
referred to as the upper launcher,
which is being developed

421
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:45,249
in a European context, 
and that launcher,

422
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:50,614
- which in TCV is about 1 m long,-

423
00:26:50,614 --> 00:26:56,393
in this case is almost 5 m long,
something that weighs 50 tons,

424
00:26:57,286 --> 00:27:00,964
and it has to pass 
8 times 1 MW beams.

425
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:04,991
at again, the electron cyclotron 
frequency for the ITER core,

426
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:06,899
which is about 170 GHz.

427
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:11,145
So the idea here is to be able
to steer in real time

428
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:15,325
the microwave beam to locally heat
and stabilize the plasma instability

429
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:17,233
in the same way we have discussed before.

430
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:20,883
It's important to preserve 
the focusing of this beam,

431
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:26,405
even after a very long travel
from the original source

432
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:32,306
so that the beam can be injected
in a very localized way

433
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:36,998
at a resonant surface and have
a very good current drive efficiency

434
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:40,492
for the local cure of the instability.

435
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:45,187
Let me just briefly discuss
the advantages and disadvantages

436
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:50,815
as I see them — a personal point of view
of ECRH heating and current drive

437
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:55,526
for ITER but also in general
for fusion reactors.

438
00:27:56,762 --> 00:28:02,904
First of all, the high frequency of ECRH
allows quasi-optical propagation,

439
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:06,559
so you can have a source
that is very far away from the plasma.

440
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:09,087
There is no need for an in-vessel antenna.

441
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:13,151
There is a high degree 
of flexibility, which allows

442
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:17,761
localized heating and current drive
and therefore a very good degree

443
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:21,156
of capability of controlling instabilities
locally in the plasma.

444
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:25,958
There's an instrinsic advantage,

445
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:29,498
at least a very important 
potential advantage,

446
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:33,802
in the high electrical efficiency
of the sources for microwaves.

447
00:28:34,953 --> 00:28:39,133
They are foreseen to go
up to 50% in efficiency,

448
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:43,296
which is very important 
for the fusion reactors in the future.

449
00:28:44,211 --> 00:28:45,739
Some drawbacks can be mentioned.

450
00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:48,114
There is still the issue
of the density cutoffs,

451
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:51,344
which are different in different schemes,

452
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:54,546
so we cannot heat above a certain density,

453
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,774
and of course, electron cyclotron
resonance heating

454
00:28:57,774 --> 00:29:01,322
heats electrons which don't provide
fusion reactions, so we will have to have

455
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:05,098
a collisional transfer 
of the electron energy to ion energy

456
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:09,455
after we have deposited our heating
to the electrons used in the ECRH.

457
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,600
I'd like to mention that the question
of the reliability of the high-frequency

458
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,772
and high-power sources is
being addressed at the moment —

459
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:22,040
the hope is to go to very high levels
of reliability in the future

460
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,930
so that will become actually 
a pro rather than a con.

461
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:33,178
So as a summary of these three lectures
on additional heating of the plasma,

462
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:37,092
I put here a table
with the systems foreseen for ITER,

463
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:41,092
that in a sense summarizes
the state of the art in this field.

464
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:46,532
For ITER we are foreseeing to have
a neutral beam injector

465
00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:49,251
with a power of 33 MW.

466
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:52,118
Of course we can't define
the frequency for that;

467
00:29:52,118 --> 00:29:55,202
it's not based on the wave principle.

468
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,250
That's for heating and current drive.

469
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,575
We have an ICRH system of 20 MW

470
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:07,386
with a frequency 
between 40 and 55 MHz

471
00:30:07,386 --> 00:30:11,592
resonating with the ion species
in the core of the heated plasma,

472
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:13,599
mostly for heating.

473
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:21,165
We are anticipating to install the lower
hybrid heating and current drive system,

474
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:22,714
but only in the second stage,

475
00:30:22,714 --> 00:30:28,375
so that's not the system that's foreseen
for the first stage of the ITER operation.

476
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,445
Also, with a power 
of about 20 MW

477
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:35,429
and a frequency corresponding 
to the lower hybrid wave

478
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:38,381
in the core of the ITER plasma 
of about 5 GHz.

479
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,490
Finally, we are also preparing
an ECRH system

480
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,845
which will have 24 MW of power,

481
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:49,845
as we have seen,

482
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:52,266
at a frequency 170 GHz,

483
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:55,229
and the reason I put this in green,
is that this is the only system

484
00:30:55,229 --> 00:31:00,341
that would be needed
for day 1 of the ITER operation.

485
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:04,173
We are now ready to very briefly
summarize this lecture.

486
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:09,903
We have seen that ECRH waves
are used to heat bulk electrons

487
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:11,923
and to drive current in the plasma.

488
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:18,564
The high frequency of these waves
leads to quasi-optical properties of them,

489
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:22,489
and to local absorption,
which is essential for heating,

490
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:26,784
for driving current, and for controlling
instabilities in the plasma.

491
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:30,899
There is no need for in-vessel antennas,
so all the problems we have discussed

492
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:35,636
for ICRH and lower hybrid 
waves are overcome.

493
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:41,040
Of course, the ECRH system
is foreseen in ITER —

494
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,050
for ionizing the plasma to begin with,

495
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,802
for heating the plasma,
for driving current in the plasma,

496
00:31:45,802 --> 00:31:49,362
and most importantly
for controlling these instabilities.
