00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:07,510
Welcome to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:10,028
Today we will discuss the regime
that we refer to as

3
00:00:10,028 --> 00:00:13,182
the <i>Burning Plasma Regime</i>
and the role of fast ions in it.

4
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:17,215
We will start by defining 
what a burning plasma is

5
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:20,119
and by highlighting its specificities.

6
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:24,563
We will describe the fast ions 
and their role in the external

7
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:26,458
and the self-heating of the plasma.

8
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:29,941
We will then look at the losses
that fast ions can be subject to

9
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:31,896
because of a number of reasons:

10
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:33,623
- inhomogeneities in the field,

11
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,258
- low frequency plasma modes,

12
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:37,673
- turbulence,

13
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:40,106
- or resonant interaction with Alfvén waves.

14
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,921
We’ll then say a few words
about the stability of the burn

15
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:44,543
and its control.

16
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:47,621
I would like to start 
by reminding ourselves

17
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:49,478
about the DT fusion reaction.

18
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:53,370
The one we’ll use for ITER
and the first generation of reactors.

19
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:58,699
As we have said already together
we have a tritium and a deuterium ion

20
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:03,500
that fuse, producing a neutron,
at 14 MeV of energy

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,040
and a helium nucleus
at 3.5 MeV of energy;

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,944
that’s an alpha particle [α-particle]

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,725
The neutron has two jobs:

24
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:14,553
it will react to the lithium 6 
that would be present in the blanket

25
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:18,948
to produce the tritium
that we need for the reactions themselves,

26
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:23,938
and of course it will be used
to heat a fluid around the plasma

27
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:26,344
that will be used to generate electricity.

28
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:32,662
The α-particle has 
one single task for us

29
00:01:32,662 --> 00:01:33,749
which is very important.

30
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:39,025
It has to be kept in a plasma 
and heat the plasma ions in the core

31
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,310
so that they maintain reactivity.

32
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:43,632
We call that the plasma self-heating.

33
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:45,758
So what is a burning plasma?

34
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:47,430
Let’s recall the energy balance.

35
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,940
We have a possible variation
of the energy contained in a plasma

36
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,514
because the α-particles heat it,
if we have fusion reactions,

37
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:59,193
or because we put power from the outside,

38
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:02,193
the so-called additional or external heating.

39
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:04,476
And of course with the minus sign

40
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:07,502
we have to include the term for the losses

41
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,360
that we have said in the past 
being dominating in general

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,735
by direct losses,

43
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:15,673
represented by a single parameter
which is the energy confinement time.

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,688
Let’s express 
the fusion energy gain Q.

45
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:23,626
That’s the fusion power
divided by the input power,

46
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:28,007
and because the α-power
is about one-fifth of the total,

47
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:33,246
we can write - that’s about 
five times the power

48
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:36,406
in the α-particles
divided by the input power.

49
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:40,168
So if we are interested
in the heating fraction

50
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:43,980
that comes from the α's, 
the α-heating fraction, fα

51
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,606
which is the power in the α's
divided by total power,

52
00:02:48,697 --> 00:02:54,422
that can be presented in terms of
a very simple expression containing Q.

53
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:56,226
That’s Q / (Q + 5).

54
00:02:57,197 --> 00:03:00,057
So the experiments
we have performed so far

55
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:04,663
have reached a Q of less than,
say about 0.7,

56
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:08,043
which corresponds to an 
α-heating fraction of less than 12%.

57
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:11,798
So really the α-heating term
is sub-dominant

58
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:15,231
compared to what we heat the plasma
with from outside.

59
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,220
Even here if we had reached <i>breakeven</i>
which corresponds to Q=1,

60
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:22,824
the α-heating fraction
would be only about 17%.

61
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:28,768
So the limit at which we start
to have a different regime is Q=5,

62
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:33,839
because at Q=5 we have an 
α-heating fraction of 50%.

63
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:42,911
So what goes on starting from that value 
of Q, to higher and higher values of Q’s ?

64
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:46,535
It is what we call the 
burning plasma regime.

65
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:51,910
This is the burning plasma regime
because the plasma in a sense

66
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,523
is a dominated in its heating 
by its own by-products.

67
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:59,625
Of course the limit is exactly Q=5
but if you have Q=10

68
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:03,607
then we have an α-heating fraction
which is about 67%

69
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:08,018
and going all the way to 100%
when we reach ignition

70
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:11,595
at which point of course 
the gain goes to infinity.

71
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:15,646
We don’t have burning
plasmas as of today.

72
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:20,589
So we can only speculate
on what their specificities will be.

73
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:23,386
First of all, we need to reach
high performance,

74
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,639
so burning plasma would be, 
sort of by definition,

75
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,694
high-performance plasma
in a tokamak reactor.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,219
It will be close to the operational limits
that we can have.

77
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:37,304
It will have very large heat flux
on the plasma facing components,

78
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:39,709
as large as you can cope with generally.

79
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:43,290
It would be a nuclear environment, 
something we don’t have, again, today.

80
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,743
There will be 
a lot of radiation involved,

81
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:49,242
there will be the issue 
of the retention of tritium,

82
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:53,339
for example
in the first wall of the tokamak,

83
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:56,029
there will be the issue of dust production
that contains tritium,

84
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:00,133
there will be the issue of course 
of the need for breeding the tritium

85
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,974
using the blanket modules
outside the plasma.

86
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:08,037
In terms of the plasma
physics specificities,

87
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:12,761
also, we expect something 
different from today, for a few reasons.

88
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:16,751
First of all, it will be at
very high density and temperature

89
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,560
compared to what we have today,

90
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:21,778
which implies we are in a regime

91
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:24,762
where we have even lower 
and lower collisionality

92
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:28,282
compared to what we have today 
in present devices

93
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:32,517
and perhaps even more importantly
in terms of basic physics,

94
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:34,517
we have a very small ratio

95
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:39,762
between the size
of the plasma particle orbit

96
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:41,589
and the size of the device.

97
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,215
This is not just a detail.

98
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:45,359
This implies that the turbulence,
for example,

99
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:49,103
that can develop in the system 
in which the particle trajectories

100
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:53,811
are much smaller than 
the typical scale length of the system

101
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,238
could be very different.

102
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:57,944
And of course, last but not the least,

103
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,649
we have a very large 
isotropic population of α's

104
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,634
which will be, again 
by definition of a burning plasma,

105
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,154
the dominant source of heating.

106
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:09,880
This implies that there will be a coupling
between the profile of the α-power,

107
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,916
the profile of the pressure of the plasma,
the safety factor profile,

108
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:19,724
the profile of the electric field,
the profile of transport parameters,

109
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:23,108
the profile of the helium concentration 
and so on and so forth.

110
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,139
So all these elements 
will be coupled in the burning plasma,

111
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:29,892
whereas in today’s experiments, 
they are completely,

112
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:32,552
or at least partly,
decoupled from each other.

113
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:37,493
These are the main elements 
that we need to study

114
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:39,772
and issues that we need to solve

115
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:42,826
to get the burning plasma 
and to control it.

116
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:45,658
First of all, we have to reach 
the burning plasma condition of course,

117
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:48,526
so we need to identify 
which heating scenarios, for example,

118
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:52,802
we can have in approaching
the burning plasma conditions.

119
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:54,912
We need to understand 
what a transport

120
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:59,049
and turbulence behavior would be like
in these conditions.

121
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:01,221
In particular 
what would be the effect

122
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,258
of different isotopic masses
in the plasma.

123
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,282
We know that there are differences
in the transport

124
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:09,519
that we don't fully understand 
between for example

125
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,791
deuterium and tritium plasmas.

126
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:15,305
We need to learn how to sustain 
the burning conditions.

127
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:18,021
We need to really make sure
that the self-heating process

128
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,566
is not affected by any major instabilities

129
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,833
or any major problem 
that can rise in the plasma.

130
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:28,732
Among the problems
that we have to worry about

131
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:33,538
are the losses of the fast ions
that are of course, those that guarantee

132
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,641
the self-heating process 
in the form of α's

133
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:37,388
produced by fusion reactions.

134
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:41,173
We need to see
if the stability of the plasma

135
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:45,769
is affected by the presence of fast ions
and in which way is it affected.

136
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,006
We also need to have a thought
on the stability of the burn

137
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:52,626
and how we control it.

138
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,482
Now thinking about the reactor, 
we need to make sure

139
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:58,751
that the conditions
for the plasma to burn are compatible

140
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:02,498
with the operation of a reactor 
from which we want to extract energy.

141
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:06,498
I’m thinking about the interaction
between the plasma and the wall,

142
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,968
the exhaust of power and particles,
how we get rid of the helium ashes,

143
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:12,645
for example in particular,

144
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:15,775
helium ashes being 
essentially the α-particles

145
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,755
that have given up their energy
by collisions,

146
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:21,690
and that we don’t need 
any more in the plasma.

147
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:25,349
We need to worry about the heat loads,

148
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:29,913
the high recycling regimes in which 
we have a lot of particles

149
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:31,453
that are reinjected in the plasma

150
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:35,160
to the interaction between 
the plasma itself and the walls.

151
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:38,332
Operating with a large fraction of power

152
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:42,672
that is radiated out from the plasma.

153
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:48,417
How we can mitigate disruptions
and other violent events

154
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,488
at the plasma edge,
such as the <i>Edge Localized Modes</i>

155
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:55,822
that we have investigated briefly
in the previous lecture.

156
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:59,147
We have to worry about the retention
of tritium in the walls

157
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:02,624
and avoid or limit the production of dust.

158
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,281
We also need to see
how these phenomena

159
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:09,911
can be extrapolated 
and what they imply

160
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:12,019
for the operation of the reactor.

161
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:14,515
We need to worry
about breeding tritium,

162
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:18,309
which is a very important element
for the economy of fusion in the future,

163
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:23,197
how we can burn tritium efficiently,
and the thermo-dynamical efficiency

164
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:27,081
of the reactor itself, for example,
giving some constraints

165
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:30,667
on the operational temperatures 
for the reactor and so on, and so forth.

166
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:34,357
These are many, many elements 
that one needs to look at

167
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:38,859
for a burning plasma and for a reactor
to be compatible with burning plasma.

168
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:41,802
Now we don’t have the pretention
to really investigate

169
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:44,039
all of these in this lecture,
in this course.

170
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,890
I like just to give a few highlights
about the specific chapter

171
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,591
in which we discuss 
how we can sustain the burning conditions.

172
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,555
So we'll look at the self-heating process,
the fast ion losses,

173
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:58,391
the stability of the plasma
in the presence of fast ions,

174
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:01,995
and we'll say just a few words 
about the control of the burn

175
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:03,546
and its stability.

176
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:08,020
So why are fast ions
so important in the plasma external

177
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,400
and self-heating process?

178
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,223
I remind that here in this sketch,

179
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:17,750
we of course here have the plasma 
in which inject power from outside

180
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,507
and we have reactions
that produce α-particles

181
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:25,039
which carry about 20% of the energy
which must be kept in the plasma.

182
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:27,503
And the neutrons
that come out of the plasma

183
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,070
with about 80% of energy.

184
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,250
So the loop works as follows:
we heat the ions, they fuse,

185
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:37,988
they produce α-particles and therefore
a significant α-particles power.

186
00:10:38,218 --> 00:10:44,260
Which will therefore, subsequently,
be given to the electrons

187
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,767
via collisional process.

188
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:50,743
As we have seen when we discussed
the neutral beam injection heating method,

189
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:56,699
if the energy of the fast particles
is very large,

190
00:10:56,867 --> 00:11:01,573
the collisional process will first give
this energy to the electrons

191
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:02,766
rather than to the ions.

192
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:07,276
This is why I have represented this loop
as the collisional processes giving energy

193
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:08,751
from the α's to the electrons,

194
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:12,159
which in turn have to
thermalize on the ions.

195
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:15,877
It will be sort of indirect heating
of the ions via the electrons.

196
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:19,045
This is if we count on
the α-particle heating,

197
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:23,395
but similarly we have the same situation
for the fast ions

198
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:27,209
if we count on ICRH or NBI,
because in those cases

199
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:30,342
you produce fast ions
they will then again,

200
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:36,501
depending on the energy, giving it
to the electrons or directly to the ions.

201
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:40,215
So fast ions are very important 
in the process of heating a plasma

202
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:43,760
both from external sources, 
at least for ICRH or NBI,

203
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,109
and for the self-heating via the α's.

204
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,938
This is just to sketch,

205
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:52,645
sort of what we hope 
the fusion process will be like.

206
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,565
We count on the α's
slowing down collisionally

207
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,561
on the background electrons and ions.

208
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,930
Is that really happening?

209
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,641
A number of experiments
have been performed to verify that.

210
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:09,041
Take one example here
to check that in a simple situation,

211
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,865
that indeed is the case.

212
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:15,532
Here we see the result
of a trace tritium experiment in JET.

213
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:19,536
Very small amounts of tritium 
are injected in a deuteron plasma

214
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:25,097
with blips of the neutral beam injector
in which we put tritium.

215
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:30,297
So what we cause are DT fusion reactions
which in the tritons injected by the beam

216
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:33,043
and the plasma which contains deuterons.

217
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:37,009
And of course this DT reactions
produce 3.5 MeV α's,

218
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,380
just like any DT reaction.

219
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:45,169
What we’re looking at in practice
are the emission profiles of γ-rays

220
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:49,986
which are issued from the reaction
of the high energy α's

221
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:53,593
with beryllium impurities
that are present in the plasma.

222
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,263
Now the interesting property
of this reaction is that

223
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:58,522
it’s a treshold reaction.

224
00:12:58,522 --> 00:13:02,530
In other words it happens only
if the α's have a certain energy,

225
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,411
typically above 2 MeV.

226
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:10,504
So the emission of γ-rays
is a signature of the presence of α's

227
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:14,859
with an energy 
that’s about 2 MeV or more.

228
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,486
We can therefore take
the decay time of such an emission,

229
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:23,805
or in practice decay time 
of the measured radiation

230
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:27,905
in the γ range of frequencies
to get an estimate

231
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:32,581
of the slowing down time of the α's
and of course of the beam tritons,

232
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:37,133
slowing down time
that is supposed to be given

233
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,194
by the interaction with electrons.

234
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:42,326
And that’s what we see in this plot.

235
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:46,525
This is in the vertical direction,
the decay time of the γ radiation

236
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,264
as a function of the calculated
slowing down time

237
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:51,038
according to classical theory.

238
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,813
And we see that in the situation
which we have a few MA of current

239
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:57,674
in the JET tokamak,

240
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:03,525
and the magnetic field between 
2.2 and 3.5 tesla,

241
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:07,891
around that, we have a very good
correspondence

242
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:11,932
between the two typical 
characteristic times.

243
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:15,300
So in these plasmas which are quiescent,
so we don’t have

244
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,699
any major instabilities present.

245
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:22,426
The slowing down that we observe,
indeed follows classical theory.

246
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:28,092
So everything seems to work
according to what we expect.

247
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:32,221
If the α's slow down
collisionally on electrons

248
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:36,499
as classical theory predicts,
we should see

249
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,258
from the point of view of electrons,

250
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,503
an increase in the temperature.

251
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:43,323
Because the power from the α's
goes directly to the electrons.

252
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:47,416
That was the purpose
of two very significant

253
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,963
experiments in the TFTR.

254
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:53,568
The tokamak at Princeton,
USA and in JET.

255
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:56,760
First in TFTR,

256
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,120
the electron heating
by the α's was seen quite clearly

257
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,984
comparing in deuterium only plasma
which is in blue here.

258
00:15:07,494 --> 00:15:11,464
This is the profile of the electron 
temperature with a very similar plasma

259
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:16,238
but in which there is a 50-50 mixture
of deuterium and tritium.

260
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:19,738
And you see there is
a significant difference

261
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:22,558
or at least a measurable difference
between the two profiles

262
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:26,935
in the presence of DT which means 
in the presence of α-particles.

263
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:29,453
There is a heating by electrons.

264
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,303
If we take the difference
between the DT case

265
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:36,038
and the pure deuterium case,
this difference appears of course

266
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:38,476
in a much more clear way.

267
00:15:39,484 --> 00:15:41,949
And you can see that,
that difference occurs more

268
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:45,509
in the core of the plasma
where the α-particle power

269
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:46,848
is deposited.

270
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:50,577
A similar experiment 
was performed at JET as well.

271
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:55,134
Here we plot the results 
in a somewhat different way:

272
00:15:55,134 --> 00:16:00,009
it is the core electron temperature
as a function of the α-particle power

273
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,666
from the fusion reactions.

274
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:07,259
And we can see that we have 
different mixtures of DT

275
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:12,542
indicated in the brackets here 
from 0% to say around 50-60%.

276
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:18,463
Of course 0% or even close to 100%
the effect is zero,

277
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:23,335
in the sense there
is no heating of the electrons

278
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:26,692
because of the α-particle 
power because there is essentially

279
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:29,099
no DT reaction taking place.

280
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,953
The optimal situation,
is close to 50%

281
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:39,285
where we have about 1.2, 1.3 MW
of α-particle power

282
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:42,316
and that results in a very clearly 
measurable heating

283
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:43,997
of the electrons in the core.

284
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:45,551
So α's are doing their job.

285
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:47,327
They’re slowing down
collisioning on electrons

286
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:49,704
and they’re giving their power
to the electron channel.

287
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:54,445
So why do we have to worry about
these self-heating processes

288
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,219
or external heating process?

289
00:16:56,219 --> 00:17:00,236
Well the question is whether
that collisional slowing down

290
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:02,996
is always happening in the way
we hope it would happen

291
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:08,546
as we have just seen
in the two very simple situations

292
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:13,280
in that there were no major instabilities,
no major pertubations

293
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,328
to the quiescent plasma.

294
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:18,102
What we worry about is 
if we have fast ion losses

295
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:21,658
for different reasons,
then they will influence the power

296
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:23,897
that will be transferred
from the α's to the electrons

297
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:25,714
as well as the power 
that will be transferred

298
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:30,413
from the fast ions issued by collisional,
by additional heating.

299
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:34,073
In this case power can be transferred
to electrons or to the ions

300
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:35,877
depending on the energy of the fast ions.

301
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:39,359
But in all of these cases, 
if fast ion losses are present,

302
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,736
this transfer will be affected 
and therefore,

303
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:43,759
the plasma will not be heated efficiently.

304
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:48,725
So what mechanics can we have 
to lose fast ions

305
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:51,051
in a actual tokamak plasma?

306
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,328
First of all, we worry about
fast ion losses that can happen

307
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:58,196
because of the 3D nature
of the magnetic fields.

308
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,951
In a practical situation of a tokamak,

309
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,721
the number of coils is of course, finite.

310
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:11,192
So if I go around the torus
being a charged particle,

311
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:14,718
I don’t feel a complete 
uniform magnetic field,

312
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,707
I will feel inhomogeneities,
in the intensity of the field.

313
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:21,612
Just below the coil 
it will be more intense,

314
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:24,373
in between coils it will be weaker.

315
00:18:25,257 --> 00:18:29,115
And as a charged particle
feels a inhomogeneity magnetic field,

316
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:31,083
it can be subject to trapping.

317
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,535
And if particles are subject to trapping,
they will not go around the torus,

318
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:40,762
they will not feel the field
of the tokamak

319
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:45,045
that we have set up so carefully 
to compensate the various drifts,

320
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:48,295
and therefore get out 
of the confinement region

321
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,167
being trapped in between coils
and then drifting out

322
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,899
providing direct losses.

323
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:57,662
These are the so-called <i>ripple losses</i>
because they are caused once more

324
00:18:57,662 --> 00:19:02,535
by the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field
due to the number of coils that’s finite,

325
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:07,436
which can be simply be called
the ripple of the field,

326
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:11,128
felt by the fast particles in their
motion around the torus.

327
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,382
This is something that can be
calculated fairly accurately.

328
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:18,623
An example or remedy 
for a particular scenario ITER

329
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,184
is illustrated here.

330
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:25,753
One can actually insert ferritic materials
so high µ material

331
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:30,142
to smooth out these variations
and reduce losses significantly.

332
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:33,482
This kind of solution
is already foreseen for ITER,

333
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:35,782
even considered 
for the steps after ITER

334
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:39,092
but there is still a few open issues
that one needs to address.

335
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:42,016
One of them is the effect 
of the blanket modules

336
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:45,083
which contain ferromagnetic material,
therefore possible perturbations

337
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,975
to the field structure.

338
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:49,915
Blanket module are 
of course necessary for tritium breeding.

339
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:53,251
Fast ion losses can also happen
because of low frequency

340
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:55,623
magnetohydrodynamics modes.

341
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:57,381
There are many modes that are possible.

342
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:59,535
We illustrate a couple of examples.

343
00:19:59,535 --> 00:20:02,282
In general, different kinds of resonances
can be associated

344
00:20:02,282 --> 00:20:04,775
with the complex particle orbits

345
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:07,677
and lead to different possible
interactions.

346
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:13,615
This image that we have seen 
in previous parts of the course,

347
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:17,278
illustrates the complexity
of the orbits in a tokamak,

348
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:19,853
for ions, for example.

349
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:23,346
Of course you have the
fast gyromotion around a field lines

350
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:26,459
which is associated 
with the cyclotron frequency,

351
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,678
and that’s one resonance.

352
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:31,486
But now we consider 
much smaller frequencies,

353
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:33,278
much slower time scales.

354
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:38,654
Now we have seen already 
that the motion of the ions

355
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,175
around the tokamak
is actually characterized

356
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:43,331
by what we call <i>banana orbits</i>

357
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:46,573
which are orbits that are produced

358
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:51,393
by the fact that the particles feel 
regions of different strengths

359
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:54,451
in a magnetic field
and therefore are trapped.

360
00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:00,197
And the turning points
of this trapping motion are related

361
00:21:00,197 --> 00:21:02,671
to the in-out asymmetry of the field.

362
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:06,802
If we project these orbits
on a poloidal plane,

363
00:21:06,802 --> 00:21:10,406
they look like bananas
so we refer to them as banana orbits.

364
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:14,466
And if we look at the motion 
of the particles along these orbits,

365
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:18,066
if we see again in the poloidal plane,
the particles will go around.

366
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:25,067
So there will be a frequency associated
with this motion around the banana orbit.

367
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,875
And that’s one of the frequencies
that we can have coinciding

368
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,711
with the frequency of an instability.

369
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:35,533
And of course, when the frequency 
of a motion of a particle coincides

370
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,021
with the frequency of an instability,

371
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:39,549
you can have a very efficient exchange
of energy momentum.

372
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,220
You can have very efficient drive 
of an MHD instability.

373
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:46,652
Another example
is that of the so-called precession

374
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:49,371
or <i>drift precession</i> of the banana orbits.

375
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:53,086
For that let’s illustrate it 
with a plot from the top.

376
00:21:53,086 --> 00:21:55,028
This is a top view of a tokamak

377
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:59,025
we have seen that the particle orbits
can be trapped

378
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:03,901
and therefore not complete
a full toroidal circumference.

379
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:07,708
But in fact there is
some asymmetry between the -

380
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:12,944
if you like the trajectory forward
and the return of the trajectory,

381
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:17,858
so that this orbit will slowly drift

382
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:20,138
in one particular toroidal direction.

383
00:22:20,726 --> 00:22:26,327
It is as if the banana orbit 
would go in fact, around the torus,

384
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:28,183
seen from the top.

385
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:33,128
And the frequency associated with
that is a so-called <i>precession frequency</i>.

386
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:38,151
That is slower than the frequency
associated with the motion of the particle

387
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:42,506
along the banana orbit itself which
is referred to as the <i>bounce frequency.</i>

388
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:49,030
So we have, just using these two examples,
two possible frequencies

389
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,564
for possible resonances 
with plasma instabilities.

390
00:22:51,564 --> 00:22:56,497
The precession frequency 
of the particle drift around the torus

391
00:22:56,497 --> 00:23:00,415
and the bounce frequency of the particle
around the banana orbit.

392
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:03,776
Both of these frequencies
are much, much smaller

393
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:06,826
than the cyclotron frequency and,
therefore, can lead to resonances

394
00:23:06,826 --> 00:23:11,534
with low frequency global modes
of the MHD kind.

395
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:16,681
And I’d like to take two examples
for two of these modes.

396
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,529
The first one is the so-called
<i>fishbone instability</i>.

397
00:23:20,103 --> 00:23:24,058
It’s a name that was given historically
because the signal

398
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:26,850
associated with the perturbation 
that was observed in a plasma,

399
00:23:26,924 --> 00:23:31,246
would have a character of bursts going up.

400
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:35,652
For example in the perturbed
magnetic field in a plasma.

401
00:23:35,652 --> 00:23:39,732
This is measured typically
by a coil mounted on the vessel,

402
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:41,800
so facing the edge of the plasma.

403
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,974
It would go up and down
with typical occillations

404
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:49,575
that would remind you
of the fishbone shape.

405
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:54,347
And that’s why in this plot 
we have a plot on top of an actual fish.

406
00:23:54,895 --> 00:23:59,410
This instability is now 
being understood theoretically

407
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:05,206
as a resulting from the resonant 
de-stabilization of a kink mode

408
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:07,209
inside the plasma.

409
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:13,881
Resonanr de-stabilization that occurs
because the mode frequency coincides

410
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:16,414
with the precession frequency
for the fast ions.

411
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:21,236
And the precession frequency is what 
we have described just two minutes ago.

412
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,951
The point is that this kind of modes
is driven by the fast ions

413
00:24:25,951 --> 00:24:28,852
but in turn can reach amplitudes
that cause ejection

414
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,870
of the fast ions themselves.

415
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,508
Now once you eject the fast ions,

416
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:37,421
this was a source of instability itself,

417
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:40,498
the mode will die again
because the source is gone,

418
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,510
and there will be a sequence
of bursts that will occur.

419
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,763
Each burst will lead to ejection
of fast ions and therefore reduction

420
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:50,336
in the core performance
of the fusion reactor.

421
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:53,766
The second example is even 
more ubiquitous,

422
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,905
it is the so-called <i>sawtooth</i> instability.

423
00:24:56,147 --> 00:25:00,627
This is an instability
that leads to a series of sudden collapses

424
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:02,475
of energy and particles in the core,

425
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:05,798
represented by this shape.

426
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,179
And that’s why we refer to it
as a sawtooth.

427
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:11,981
In this case, I represented
the temperature as a function of time.

428
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:16,778
When the collapse occurs, 
in fact there is a local breaking

429
00:25:16,778 --> 00:25:20,221
of the magnetic structure, just like what
happens in the geomagnetic tail.

430
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:23,675
in a phenomenon you have seen 
in other lectures of this course,

431
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:25,308
called <i>magnetic reconnection</i>.

432
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:31,427
This is linked to an MHD 
instability of the kink type,

433
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,675
which we have also illustrated to you
in previous lectures.

434
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:37,736
But the frequency is even smaller
than the precession frequency

435
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:38,602
for the fast ions,

436
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:41,784
so this is not really 
a resonant and driven instability

437
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:44,632
in the sense of a wave particle resonance
with the fast ions,

438
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,491
nevertheless, the fast ions 
are affected by the instability

439
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:53,138
because they are ejected together
with the parts of the core plasma.

440
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:57,123
This phenomenon, in fact, 
is being illustrated as we speak

441
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:00,891
on the little movie on the right

442
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:05,260
which shows the X-ray 
emissivity evolution in the TCV tokamak

443
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,210
over a sawtooth cycle.

444
00:26:07,836 --> 00:26:12,676
This sudden collapses
not only are they a problem,

445
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:17,992
because they kick out the fast ions 
and the core of the plasma

446
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:20,253
or they re-distribute
the central region of the plasma,

447
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:25,336
but also they can trigger
secondary instabilities.

448
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:30,798
Because the fast ions influence
the period of the sawteeth,

449
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:34,264
which in turn determines
the strength of the collapse,

450
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:37,093
the fast ions can be used to control
these modes and therefore,

451
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:39,101
to control the secondary instabilities.

452
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:42,419
And this is really a very 
active line of research.

453
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:47,726
Another possible channel for losing
fast ions is the plasma turbulence.

454
00:26:47,726 --> 00:26:49,761
In fact one can argue
in a plasma turbulence

455
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:51,924
can cause transport 
of fast ions similarly,

456
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:53,818
to what it does to thermal particles.

457
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:59,010
So this turbulent structures 
would kick fast ions out as they do

458
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,630
with the thermal ions
and thermal electrons.

459
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:04,950
However, we have a good 
piece of news here,

460
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,564
because the fast ions are characterized
by relatively large orbits.

461
00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:13,471
These large orbits are expected
to average out the effect of turbulence.

462
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:17,969
And this plot we illustrate
that phenomenon.

463
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,220
So if you have a thermal ion
which has a very small orbit,

464
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,881
it will be influenced 
by the electric field of the turbulence

465
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:27,384
in one particular direction.

466
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:29,391
It will receive a kick
in one particular direction

467
00:27:29,391 --> 00:27:33,275
and it will be therefore affected
in its confinement and its transport.

468
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:37,423
As I increase the size
of the orbit of the ion

469
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:40,312
by increasing typically its energy,

470
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:45,470
I increase the number of turbulent eddies
or turbulent structures,

471
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,497
that the fast ion interacts
with over one orbit

472
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:51,744
and therefore, receiving kicks 
in different directions along one orbit.

473
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:54,936
These kicks will therefore be averaged out

474
00:27:55,046 --> 00:27:57,627
and the net effect 
will be reduced to zero.

475
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,849
The key paremeter in this orbit
averaging effect is the ratio

476
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:06,050
between the fast ion energy
and the background plasma temperature.

477
00:28:06,132 --> 00:28:10,342
In a sense this ratio is a proxy
for the ratio

478
00:28:10,342 --> 00:28:13,735
between the size of the ion’s orbits

479
00:28:14,313 --> 00:28:17,448
and the size 
of the turbulent structures.

480
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:22,000
The second parameter that of course
influences this interaction,

481
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,865
is how long do fast ions
remain fast in a plasma,

482
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:28,768
that is the slowing down time.

483
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:33,629
Now I said before that in this case
we would rather find good piece of news,

484
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:38,620
because if we do the estimates for ITER
and future reactors,

485
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:44,246
we find out that the value
of this ratio of Efast/T

486
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:45,799
should be large enough

487
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,460
that the turbulence
effects on the NBI ions

488
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,022
and even more importantly, 
on the α's, should be negligible.

489
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,626
I now turn to the last mechanism
of fast ion losses I'd like to discuss,

490
00:28:57,626 --> 00:29:03,097
that is due to the interaction
with Alfvén waves.

491
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:09,226
So as we said, the α-particles
are born at 3.5 MeV.

492
00:29:09,322 --> 00:29:10,972
They would slow down collisionally,

493
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:13,627
first on electrons 
then eventually on ions.

494
00:29:13,737 --> 00:29:16,949
And during that slowing down
which lasts a microscopic time,

495
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:18,686
of the order of a second,

496
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:21,633
they can encounter
a wave-particle resonance.

497
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:27,165
So they can drive efficiently
an instability in the form

498
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,662
for example of an Alfven wave,
- as we will see in a moment,

499
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,701
which in turn - if it grows
to large amplitudes,

500
00:29:35,132 --> 00:29:36,843
could give rise to losses.

501
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:42,156
The losses of the fast ions,
in this case of the α's,

502
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:46,370
would of course prevent
an efficient transfer of that energy

503
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,353
to the background plasma.

504
00:29:49,348 --> 00:29:53,517
We have studied Alfvén waves
in previous lectures.

505
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:58,425
I'd just like to remind ourselves
that they come from the following

506
00:29:58,425 --> 00:29:59,992
very simple mechanism.

507
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:02,309
The B-field and the plasma
are frozen together

508
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,351
in the frame of ideal MHD.

509
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:09,040
So we can see the field lines
as strings subject to tension

510
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,981
and subject to the interaction
with the plasma inertia.

511
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:14,288
The combination of tension
and the plasma inertia

512
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,473
gives the propagation of Alfvén waves.

513
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:18,768
Let me just sketch that in a simple way.

514
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:23,252
Say we bend the field lines, 
-these are supposed to be field lines,

515
00:30:23,252 --> 00:30:26,012
because there is a perturbation
[δB_wave] of the magnetic field,

516
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:30,223
due to a perturbation of the velocity
of the plasma [δv_wave].

517
00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:33,245
So the unperturbed magnetic field
is in this direction

518
00:30:33,426 --> 00:30:36,111
and we locally have a perturbation
of this kind.

519
00:30:37,758 --> 00:30:42,782
This combination of tension
and inertia in MHD,

520
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:49,618
is such that we have a wave 
that will propagate

521
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:52,529
in the direction parallel
to the magnetic field,

522
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:55,154
with a phase velocity 
that will be the Alfvén speed

523
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:59,268
that will be related to the intensity
of the field divided by

524
00:30:59,268 --> 00:31:01,979
the square root 
of the plasma mass density

525
00:31:02,044 --> 00:31:04,926
which is a measure for the inertia 
that is involved in

526
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:07,746
the mechanism 
for the propagation of the wave.

527
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:11,774
So you see the slowing down α's,

528
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:14,968
or for that matter fast ions 
from NBI or even ICRH,

529
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,826
can actually resonate 
with Alfvén waves

530
00:31:16,826 --> 00:31:21,609
and therefore, drive them unstable
giving energy to them.

531
00:31:22,572 --> 00:31:25,852
Why is this resonance almost inevitable?

532
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:32,003
The reason for that is that if I draw
the distribution function for the α's,

533
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:36,425
as a function of time 
and as a function of their velocity,

534
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,185
normalized to the birth velocity.

535
00:31:39,303 --> 00:31:43,830
The birth velocity corresponds
to the 3.5 MeV of energy.

536
00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:49,873
Say this is 1, .2, .4, .6, .8.

537
00:31:50,053 --> 00:31:52,271
We have something
that is a function of time,

538
00:31:52,322 --> 00:31:58,032
so initially the α-particles 
will be generated at the birth velocity

539
00:31:58,032 --> 00:31:59,758
corresponding to their birth energy.

540
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:03,682
And then they will 
progressively slow down.

541
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:10,308
So if this was t₀,
this is now t₁, t₂, t₃, t₄,

542
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:13,251
and t₅.

543
00:32:14,054 --> 00:32:15,675
During this slowing down,

544
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:20,494
the Alfvén velocity will be encountered

545
00:32:20,494 --> 00:32:24,505
because the Alfvén velocity 
or Alfvén speed

546
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:29,925
is typically just below
the birth velocity.

547
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,084
So there’s no way
we can avoid that resonance.

548
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:37,774
And that’s for typical parameters 
corresponding to a few teslas device,

549
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:43,016
10 to 15 KeV of temperature
and 10²⁰/m³ of density.

550
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:48,661
The other point is that there will be a
potential for a very effective interaction

551
00:32:48,661 --> 00:32:53,309
between the slowing down α's
and the Afvén wave

552
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:58,641
corresponding to this range
of velocity values.

553
00:32:59,132 --> 00:33:04,597
Because the thermal speed
for the bulk ions

554
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:06,737
is much, much smaller.

555
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:12,769
For example, for deuterium and tritium,

556
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,696
there will be something 
around this region.

557
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:21,618
Tritium’s a little lower
and deuterium a little higher.

558
00:33:22,118 --> 00:33:24,213
So there’s a long way
for the α's to slow down

559
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:29,179
before they reach the thermal
speed of deuterons and tritons,

560
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,800
and during that long way, 
they have also long time

561
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,457
to interact with the Alfvén waves
with which they will become resonant.

562
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:40,458
So when is the wave driven unstable?

563
00:33:40,588 --> 00:33:45,016
Well we have a free energy source
which is the gradient in the pressure

564
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:48,855
of the α-particles 
and if that is sufficiently high,

565
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,357
there will be a drive,

566
00:33:50,357 --> 00:33:55,346
and of course if this drive
will be exceeding

567
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:57,398
the background plasma damping.

568
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:01,478
It will be provided by 
a number of mechanisms in the plasma.

569
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:05,032
Now we have seen
what Alfvén waves look like in general

570
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:06,920
and what their physical mechanisms is,

571
00:34:06,982 --> 00:34:09,567
without going to too many complications,

572
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:13,762
we noticed that in a tokamak,
the geometry of the field

573
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:17,492
is such that the dispersion is modified
and in fact, is much more complex.

574
00:34:17,492 --> 00:34:20,482
But the point is that the dispersion
of Alfvén waves in a tokamak

575
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:23,420
still allows for very weakly damped
global modes

576
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,067
we refer to as <i>Alfvén Eigenmodes</i>.

577
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:32,769
In fact, it is one of the most striking 
successes of MHD theory,

578
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:34,551
to predict the existence 
of these modes

579
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,673
and to even predict
some of the main features.

580
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:41,691
Features that have been observed 
experimentally and quite accurately.

581
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:44,221
An example is shown here:

582
00:34:44,984 --> 00:34:48,168
this is a structure that’s calculated 
for an Alfvén Eigenmode

583
00:34:50,616 --> 00:34:55,292
in which we have inserted
in some portions,

584
00:34:56,013 --> 00:35:01,612
data corresponding to measurements
of the same Alfvén Eigenmode.

585
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,094
In this case data taken
using electron cyclotron emission imaging.

586
00:35:06,902 --> 00:35:09,823
You can hardly notice the difference
between the data

587
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,986
and the theory prediction.

588
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:14,892
So the modes are there.

589
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:18,908
The modes follow,
at least in their main feature,

590
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,387
the theory predictions.

591
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:25,386
Do they also cause losses
as we fear they would?

592
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,309
The answer is:
in many circumstances, they do.

593
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,205
Losses and redistribution
due to Alfvén waves

594
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:34,080
have been seen in many experiments.

595
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:37,312
In this plot compiled by a Rich Hawryluk

596
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:42,824
from data from TFTR, 
we see that the fraction of losses here

597
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:46,874
is plotted as a function
of the input power.

598
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,063
On the other side of the plot

599
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:52,399
the other axis corresponds
to the mode amplitude.

600
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:56,928
Of course the larger, the more amplitude,
the larger the fractional losses.

601
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:02,235
We see that for both NBI driven 
Alfvén Eigenmodes

602
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:07,685
or ICRF driven Alfvén Eigenmodes,
we can have significant levels of losses.

603
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:10,177
In DT experiments,

604
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:13,031
very weakly Alfvén Eigenmodes
were observed

605
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,554
and so no significant losses 
were observed but

606
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:17,536
that doesn’t mean 
we should not worry about them

607
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,947
in the future, because 
it was really corresponding

608
00:36:20,947 --> 00:36:25,447
to a very small input power in the drive,
in that case in the α drive,

609
00:36:25,506 --> 00:36:30,463
and therefore, to a very small mode
amplitude range for these modes.

610
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:36,657
In fact we have to worry
about loss and redistribution

611
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:39,757
because in ITER and in the future reactor
we can only withstand

612
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:41,579
a few percent of α losses.

613
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,154
There is therefore
an ongoing research to investigate

614
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:49,109
the linear stability of the modes, 
when are they present at all,

615
00:36:49,149 --> 00:36:52,803
-which results from the balance 
between the drive to the fast particles,

616
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:55,498
and the damping
from the background plasma,

617
00:36:55,498 --> 00:37:00,049
and to also see how the modes
evolve non-linearly and what is the link

618
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:03,503
between the wave property 
and the redistribution

619
00:37:03,503 --> 00:37:05,701
and the losses that the waves cause.

620
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:10,882
Just to give you one example
of this kind of investigations,

621
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:16,248
this is what we studied on the JET tokamak
in terms of the linear stability.

622
00:37:16,248 --> 00:37:19,231
The idea here is that
the linear stability mode is investigated

623
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:22,779
using antennas, these are 
the four antennas

624
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:25,528
installed inside the JET vessel
that launch

625
00:37:25,528 --> 00:37:29,441
low amplitude stable modes
in the plasma.

626
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:35,409
The frequency of the antenna
is swept and the eigenmode appears

627
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:38,962
as a resonance in the plasma
response to that antenna signal.

628
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:43,180
And this is a driven mode
so its frequency of course

629
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,783
corresponds to the peak
of this resonant response.

630
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:51,097
In simple terms, 
the width of the resonant response

631
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:53,076
is actually the damping rate of the mode.

632
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:58,072
So one can drive these modes
and even track them in real time.

633
00:37:58,072 --> 00:38:00,498
So drive them one after the other
as the plasma evolves

634
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:04,662
and extract their width in real time.

635
00:38:04,662 --> 00:38:09,454
The measurement that is 
of the damping rate for the mode

636
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,850
that would be present 
in the burning plasma.

637
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:15,703
Finally, I would like to say a few words
about the stability of the burn

638
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:17,752
and its possible control.

639
00:38:18,488 --> 00:38:21,846
We want to achieve 
a burning plasma regime

640
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:26,068
that sustains without 
- any major macro-instabilities,

641
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,857
- any significant fast ion losses, 
- any disruptions,

642
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:32,130
and 
- any build-up of the helium ashes.

643
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:40,394
In principle, a thermal runaway
can occur at high fusion gain.

644
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:45,570
This is represented in this plot 
where the input power is represented

645
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,184
as a function of density and temperature,

646
00:38:49,514 --> 00:38:52,687
to achieve a certain level
of fusion power

647
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:56,613
and we can see that the input power
could go to zero

648
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:58,494
in particular regions of this plot,

649
00:38:58,494 --> 00:39:02,222
which means that we would have
a runaway towards ignition,

650
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:04,170
which we don’t necessarily want.

651
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,027
We will lose control of the plasma burn.

652
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:09,828
As we will see in an exercise, however,

653
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,632
we have a confinement degradation
with power.

654
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,251
Which means that the burn, 
in fact, should be globally stable.

655
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,409
To control the burn, 
we have a number of possible actuators,

656
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:24,568
although, as we said, the plasma 
is really a self-organized system

657
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:28,219
when we have the burning plant regime.

658
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:32,131
We can nevertheless try to act 
on the heating power,

659
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,931
on fueling of the core, on the DT mix,

660
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:40,831
on impurities that we have in the plasma,

661
00:39:40,831 --> 00:39:45,571
and we can, in fact, even manipulate
the fast ion phase space distribution

662
00:39:45,571 --> 00:39:47,318
to optimize our burn.

663
00:39:47,724 --> 00:39:50,782
So in summary we have seen together
the burning plasmas are characterized

664
00:39:50,782 --> 00:39:54,442
by the interplay of plasma dynamics
and external systems.

665
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,975
The core of the plasma
is a complex self-organized system

666
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:02,012
on which we can have
a small amount of control.

667
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,552
In today’s experiment 
we can achieve some progress

668
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:08,461
on seperate building blocks
for the burning regime.

669
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:11,332
But the coupling of all of these elements
makes extrapolations

670
00:40:11,332 --> 00:40:14,542
from the weakly self-heated plasma
we have today very difficult

671
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,726
and may lead to new phenomena.

672
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:20,763
And that’s why we need to build
an experiment that runs a plasma

673
00:40:20,763 --> 00:40:21,973
in a burning regime.

674
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:23,970
This is what we will discuss
in the next lecture.

675
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,390
And that is ITER.
