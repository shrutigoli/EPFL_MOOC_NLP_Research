00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:09,216
Welcome back to the course 
on plasma physics and applications.

2
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:12,213
In the last module,
we have learned the fundamentals

3
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:14,184
of magnetic reconnection.

4
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:17,042
Through this process, a large fraction
of magnetic energy

5
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:20,263
goes into particle acceleration
and plasma heating.

6
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:25,275
Magnetic reconnection is probably
one of the most important mechanisms

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,515
that heats the solar corona
at a temperature of the order

8
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:30,731
of one million degrees Kelvin.

9
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,884
Magnetic reconnection also plays
a fundamental role

10
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:39,133
during coronal mass ejections
which release a huge amount of energy

11
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:41,203
and plasma from the Sun.

12
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:44,760
In this module, which is the last module
in Plasma Astrophysics,

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,076
I will describe how from a hot plasma
atmosphere, the solar wind can blow.

14
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:54,330
We will use a simple MHD description
to derive estimates

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,726
of the solar wind speed and we will see
how the solar wind can shape

16
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,212
the magnetosphere around the earth.

17
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:08,270
The first hints of the solar wind
came in the early 19th century

18
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,102
when Birkeland suggested
that a continuous particle emission

19
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:15,162
was coming from sunspots.

20
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:18,933
This was to explain
the observed correlation

21
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:21,749
between auroras and sunspots.

22
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:26,631
About 30 years later, Chapman
and Ferraro suggested

23
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:32,090
that particles were emitted from the Sun
only during solar flares

24
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,805
and otherwise the space
between the Sun and the earth was empty.

25
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:43,883
The first real evidence of the solar wind
came from comet tails.

26
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,473
In 1951, Bierman observed
that the cometary tails

27
00:01:49,473 --> 00:01:54,722
point directly away from the Sun
regardless of the comet's velocity.

28
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:59,508
It conjectured that
this must be due to ionized gas

29
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:01,689
pushed away by the solar wind.

30
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:08,022
An example is given by this picture here
that shows the comet <i>Hale-Bopp</i>,

31
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:11,742
viewed from Los Alamos
in New Mexico, U.S.A.

32
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:16,994
As you can see,
the comet has two distinct tails.

33
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:23,339
The white tail is a dust tail driven
by light pressure

34
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:25,424
and it points away from the sun.

35
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:31,739
The blue tail instead is an ion tail
which is driven by the solar wind.

36
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,929
It is not radial with respect to the Sun,

37
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:41,739
as the comet has about one tenth
of the speed of the solar wind.

38
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:45,896
The first measurement of the solar wind
came from the <i>Mariner 2</i> mission

39
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:50,636
that was launched
on the 27th of August, 1962.

40
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:57,364
The Mariner 2 provided three months
of continuous solar wind data

41
00:02:57,364 --> 00:03:00,065
while traveling towards Venus.

42
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:08,002
It measured solar wind speed
between 300 and 700 km/s.

43
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:15,157
This was the first experimental proof
of the existence of the solar wind.

44
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:22,392
More recent data has been provided
by the joint ESA-NASA mission

45
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:27,349
<i>Ulysses</i>, that was launched
on the 6th of October, 1990.

46
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:33,290
As shown in this picture,
Ulysses was launched towards Jupiter,

47
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,779
where using the slingshot effect
provided by gravity,

48
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:41,529
it entered a polar orbit around the Sun.

49
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,493
Ulysses performed
three sets of polar passes.

50
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:52,949
The radial plots shown here show
the solar wind speed combined data

51
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:58,260
from all three of Ulysses's
polar orbits of the Sun,

52
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,428
each of which takes approximately
six years to complete.

53
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:09,651
Ulysses was equipped with an instrument
called <i>SWOOPS</i>, that stands for:

54
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:13,599
Solar Wind Observations
Over the Poles of the Sun.

55
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:20,365
This instrument was designed to provide 
measurements of the solar wind speeds.

56
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:29,108
The first orbit occurred
during a period of solar minimum

57
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:32,667
as indicated by the sunspot number.

58
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:39,486
Ulysses measured a slow wind
over the Equator,

59
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:46,091
of the order of 200 km/s,

60
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:53,989
and fast wind over the poles of the Sun,

61
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:58,496
of the order of 700 km/s.

62
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:06,850
The second orbit of Ulysses corresponded
to a period of maximum activity

63
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:13,382
as shown by the sunspot number here,
between 1998 and 2004.

64
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:18,422
During the second pass,
fast and slow winds were measured

65
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:23,072
at all latitudes consistent
with a solar maximum activity.

66
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,936
Ulysses then completed
more than 3/4 of the third orbit,

67
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:34,174
as you can see here,
occurring around the solar minimum cycle.

68
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,301
During this last cycle,

69
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:41,576
Ulysses also gathered information

70
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:46,952
indicating that the solar wind
was about 25% less powerful

71
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:49,782
than it was in the previous
solar minimum cycle.

72
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:54,325
So far, we have reviewed
experimental data of the solar wind.

73
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,627
We will now derive a simple model
in which the pressure imbalance

74
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:03,165
between the Sun and the interstellar
medium drives the wind.

75
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:07,838
Historically, this was the first theory
that was developed by Parker

76
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,562
in the early 50s,

77
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:12,138
which allows to derive
many important results.

78
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:16,279
However, the fluid description
does not take into account

79
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,124
kinetic effects which turn out
to be important

80
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:22,381
to describe the solar wind,
and therefore,

81
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,019
more refined theories would be required.

82
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:27,428
Now, let's derive the fluid model.

83
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:31,228
Let's make the assumption
of a spherical symmetry

84
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:34,708
and let's use a spherical
system of reference

85
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:39,490
where we indicate the position
of the solar wind

86
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,124
with respect to the center of the Sun

87
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:45,898
by the distance
that we indicate with r.

88
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,760
Let's make the assumption
that the solar wind

89
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,360
has a velocity v(r) which 
is purely radial,

90
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:58,191
and which is a function of the distance r.

91
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:03,780
The plasma in this region
is characterized by a pressure P,

92
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,129
temperature T, and the density ρ.

93
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:13,191
Let's use the mass conservation equation
and the equation of motion.

94
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,369
which we write in the following way:

95
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:26,583
Where FG is the gravitational force
due to the mass of the Sun.

96
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,592
Let's make the further hypothesis
that the acceleration

97
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:33,301
due to the Lorentz Force
can be neglected

98
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:36,797
and therefore drop the J × B term.

99
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,313
As we said at the beginning,
we are using a spherical system

100
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:43,911
of coordinates and we have also
assumed spherical symmetry,

101
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:49,388
such that every parameter
is only a function

102
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:51,535
of the radial distance from the Sun.

103
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:54,407
For example, the velocity
of the solar wind.

104
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,975
Let's make a further hypothesis,
and let's look for a stationary solution

105
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:03,726
by imposing that the time derivatives
are equal to zero [∂/∂t = 0].

106
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,652
We can then write
the mass conservation equation,

107
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:10,886
and the equation of motion
in the following way:

108
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:22,574
Where G is the gravitational constant
and Msun is the total mass of the Sun.

109
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:28,684
Let's now look for a hydrostatic solution 
by making the hypothesis

110
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:32,151
that the wind has zero velocity.

111
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,436
By dropping the radial velocity
in the previous equation,

112
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:39,423
we can rewrite the equation of motion.

113
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:50,246
We can then assume that we can treat
the plasma in the solar wind

114
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:54,117
as an ideal gas and therefore using
the ideal gas law

115
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,603
for protons plus electrons.

116
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:03,697
In this formula, KB
is the Boltzmann Constant

117
00:09:03,697 --> 00:09:07,577
and μ is the mass of the proton
divided by two [μ = mp/2]

118
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:10,426
which is the average mass per particle.

119
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:15,720
Using the ideal gas law, we can therefore
write the equation of motion

120
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,373
in the following way:...

121
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:22,389
Let's now make
a further simplifying hypothesis,

122
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:27,315
and let's assume that the plasma
is isothermal everywhere.

123
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:32,118
If we now define a radius R₀,

124
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:36,188
where we know that the plasma
is at pressure P₀,

125
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:42,341
we can integrate this equation
between R₀ and r.

126
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,263
Where the temperature T
can be taken out of the integral

127
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:53,086
since we have assumed that it doesn't
depend on the radial position r.

128
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:00,617
This formula provides
the value of the pressure

129
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:05,250
at a certain distance r
from the Sun,

130
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:10,354
provided that we know
the starting pressure P₀

131
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:13,052
and the starting radius R₀.

132
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:19,962
Let's see what happens
if we consider the pressure at infinity.

133
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:26,386
This term will go to zero,
resulting in a final pressure at infinity

134
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:29,871
which is a non-physical result.

135
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:44,573
We can therefore conclude that looking
for a hydrostatic solution has led us

136
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:48,658
to a non-physical result. 
Therefore the hypothesis

137
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:53,402
that the solar wind speed
is equal to zero doesn't work.

138
00:10:54,816 --> 00:11:00,140
Let's now go back to the original equation
of motion and let's look

139
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:05,001
for a hydrodynamic solution
by dropping the hypothesis that

140
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:08,021
the solar wind velocity is equal to zero,

141
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:12,190
and therefore allowing a finite velocity.
[v(r) ≠ 0]

142
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,606
We can write down the equation of motion
and make as before,

143
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:20,140
the assumption of an isothermal plasma.

144
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:24,528
We can write down
the ideal gas law as before,

145
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:27,303
and use the conservation of mass.

146
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:33,520
We have to remember
that for an isothermal gas,

147
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,246
we can define the sound speed [vs]
as the derivative of the pressure

148
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:39,222
with respect to the density.
[vs² = dP/dρ = KB T/ μ]

149
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,563
Using these expressions
and plugging them back

150
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:45,198
into the equation of motion,
we obtain:

151
00:11:48,503 --> 00:11:54,103
We note that this factor
has the units of meters,

152
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:57,558
and therefore we can define
a critical radius rC

153
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:59,608
equal to the gravitational constant

154
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:02,894
times the mass of the Sun
divided by two

155
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:07,194
times the sound speed square.
[rC = (G Msun)/ (2 vs²)]

156
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:14,669
Therefore we can cast
the equation of motion as...

157
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:22,250
... where we have introduced
the critical radius rC.

158
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,270
Let's now see which are the consequences
of this equation.

159
00:12:29,442 --> 00:12:33,830
For small radii,
one minus the critical radius

160
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,025
divided by the radius 
is smaller than zero

161
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:40,619
and at the same time, if we suppose
that the starting velocity

162
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:46,180
of the solar wind is small
compared to the sound speed,

163
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,714
we can also write that ...

164
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:53,776
Therefore, this term
and this term

165
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:57,175
in these equations are both negative,

166
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:07,057
which results in a dv/dr
which is positive.

167
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:13,344
This means that the plasma
that starts at a certain velocity

168
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:17,291
accelerates, and therefore a wind blows.

169
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:24,178
Now, let's try to identify
families of solutions of this equation.

170
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,775
In the r-v space as drawn here.

171
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:37,783
On a velocity .vs. radial position plot,
let's identify the critical radius

172
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,799
rC

173
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:49,113
and the sound velocity vs.

174
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:54,960
If the solar wind starts
at a certain velocity,

175
00:13:56,673 --> 00:13:57,813
v₀

176
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:02,236
and reaches the sound speed
at a radius

177
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:04,891
which is smaller than the critical radius,

178
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:11,049
dv/dr will go to infinity
and this is not a physical solution,

179
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:17,350
which is outside the scope
of this simple fluid treatment,

180
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,913
which would result in a trajectory
schematically drawn here.

181
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:35,699
The second family of solutions
is represented by a wind

182
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:39,536
that starts at initial velocity v₀,

183
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:45,091
and accelerates up to
a certain maximum velocity

184
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:48,146
at the critical radius rC.

185
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,566
Now, if this maximum velocity
is still smaller than the sound speed

186
00:14:55,906 --> 00:15:00,698
at that position, the derivative
of the velocity with respect to the radius

187
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:06,127
is equal to zero, which means
that starting from the critical radius,

188
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:10,607
the solar wind will start to decelerate.

189
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:17,420
This solution represents a family
of solutions that we call <i>subsonic breeze</i>.

190
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:24,308
The third family of solution represents
the <i>supersonic solar winds</i>.

191
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,615
If, starting from a certain velocity,

192
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:31,042
initial velocity,

193
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:35,978
the solar wind accelerates
in such a way that

194
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:41,018
at the critical radius rC,
the velocity of the wind

195
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:44,051
corresponds to the sound speed,

196
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:49,364
we obtain that the derivative
of the velocity with respect

197
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:54,356
to the radius will always be positive
and this will result in a wind

198
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:59,301
that accelerates continuously,
giving rise to a supersonic wind

199
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:02,407
which is represented
by a family of solutions

200
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:05,043
of which one example is shown here.

201
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,404
Let's now try to estimate some typical
values for the solar wind.

202
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,368
For example, let us estimate
the critical radius.

203
00:16:18,663 --> 00:16:23,499
In order to do that, we need to know
the sound speed vs

204
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:30,349
which is defined as:, ... where KB
is the Boltzmann constant

205
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:36,132
which has this value
in Joules per Kelvin.

206
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:41,903
μ is the average weight
of individual particles

207
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:44,536
which we express in kilograms

208
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,079
and where we have used 0.6
instead of 0.5

209
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,692
to take into account the fact
that the plasma has a small fraction

210
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:58,873
of helium as we have seen
in previous modules.

211
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:11,511
We can assume a temperature
of 1.5 x 10⁶ K

212
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:15,860
which is a typical temperature
for the solar corona

213
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:18,515
where the solar wind originates.

214
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:21,971
Now we can plug these numbers
into the formula

215
00:17:22,364 --> 00:17:25,907
and estimate the value of the sound speed.

216
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:30,202
This results in a sound speed
of approximately

217
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:33,576
1.4 x 10⁵ m/s.

218
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:38,863
We can now compute the value
of the critical radius rC

219
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:42,840
by plugging these numbers
into this formula

220
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,575
where we have to remember
that the total mass of the Sun

221
00:17:46,575 --> 00:17:50,426
is approximately 2. x 10³⁰ kg,

222
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:53,685
times the value
of the gravitational constant

223
00:17:53,685 --> 00:18:00,692
which is approximately 
6.7 x 10⁻¹¹ m³ s⁻¹ kg⁻¹,

224
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,207
we obtain that the critical radius, rC

225
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:08,477
is approximately 3.4 x 10⁹ m,

226
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:15,519
which corresponds to approximately
4.5 times the radius of the Sun.

227
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:21,127
This is the critical radius at which
the solar wind becomes supersonic.

228
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,736
Now using these values,
let's see how we can estimate

229
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:34,594
the wind velocity close to where
the solar wind originates

230
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:36,807
and very far away from the Sun.

231
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:42,299
Using the equation of motion
and the isothermal hypothesis,

232
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,861
we can integrate along flow lines

233
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:53,264
and obtain that the square

234
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:58,329
of the velocity divided by two
plus the sound speed square

235
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:03,230
times the logarithm of the density
plus the gravitational energy

236
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,942
is a constant of the motion.

237
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:11,497
These equation is nothing else than 
a version of <i>Bernoulli's Theorem</i>,

238
00:19:11,882 --> 00:19:14,360
that you may use in very different fields.

239
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:19,354
Let's now use the conservation of mass
in spherical geometry

240
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:24,006
that states that the product 
of the density times the velocity

241
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:27,204
times the square of the radius
is constant.

242
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:32,956
The suffix 0 here indicates
the starting values.

243
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:43,319
If we now use the conservation of mass
and we plug it into this equation

244
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,877
and we integrate between
the starting point and radius r,

245
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:50,382
we obtain the following:

246
00:19:57,368 --> 00:20:03,813
Where ΦG0 is the gravitational
energy at the starting point

247
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:08,824
and ΦG is the gravitational energy
at the position r.

248
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:12,679
Dividing by the sound speed, we have: ...

249
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,195
Let's now define the following quantity a

250
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:26,586
and note that a is dimensionless.

251
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:33,414
Now using this definition
and after some algebra, we obtain: ...

252
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:43,773
Now this equation allows us to determine
the initial speed of the solar wind

253
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:46,462
provided that we know

254
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:50,197
the velocity v of the solar wind

255
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:52,067
at a certain distance r.

256
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,025
For the supersonic wind,

257
00:20:58,562 --> 00:21:01,071
we have seen that
the supersonic wind

258
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:05,746
becomes supersonic 
at the critical radius rC

259
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:10,760
and if we use the definition
of a, we can obtain: ...

260
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,083
If we now plug these values

261
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,927
into this formula, we obtain: ...

262
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:25,689
Which determines the initial velocity
of the solar wind

263
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:29,391
as a function of the sound speed.

264
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:35,393
We have seen that the critical radius
rC is approximately

265
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:38,227
4.5 times the solar radius.

266
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:47,976
This results in a parameter a
which is of the order of 10.

267
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,253
If we now look for a solution
where a is of the order of 10

268
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:56,742
in this formula, this in turn implies

269
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:59,862
that the initial solar wind velocity

270
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:03,007
divided by the sound speed
is much smaller than 1.

271
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:07,976
Therefore, we can obtain
the final result

272
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:14,252
which provides the value
of the starting solar wind velocity.

273
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:20,461
If we now plug this result
into the original Bernoulli's theorem,

274
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:25,512
we obtain the value of the velocity
far away from the Sun.

275
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,800
I will not go into the details
of the algebra

276
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,097
but I will recall the main formulas here.

277
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,805
Now, using these results,

278
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:40,591
let's plug in some numbers
and let's compute

279
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:44,020
the Sun mass loss rate [M' = dM/dt]
due to the solar wind.

280
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:47,729
First of all, let's compute
the starting velocity

281
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:50,234
for the supersonic wind.

282
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:58,814
We find out that the starting
supersonic solar wind velocity

283
00:22:58,814 --> 00:23:04,616
is approximately 1 hundredth
of the sound speed

284
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,844
in the solar corona.

285
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:11,046
We can then compute the mass loss rate
in the following way: ...

286
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:25,707
Where ρ₀ is the plasma density
in the solar corona,

287
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:29,934
which we approximate as 
10¹⁴ times

288
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:31,914
the mass of the proton.

289
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:36,591
By plugging in these numbers,
we obtain that

290
00:23:36,591 --> 00:23:41,603
approximately 1.5 million tons
of plasma are emitted

291
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:43,572
in the solar wind per second,

292
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:49,941
which is almost negligible with respect
to the total mass of the Sun.

293
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:54,854
We can also estimate the solar wind speed
at the position of the earth,

294
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:59,655
recalling that one astronomical unit
is approximately

295
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:02,652
214 times the radius of the Sun,

296
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:07,629
which in our units
will be 50 times the critical radius.

297
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,412
If we plug the numbers
into the previous formula,

298
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:13,838
we obtain: ...

299
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:19,951
Which results in a solar wind speed
at the distance of the earth

300
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:24,390
of approximately 560 km/s,

301
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,930
which is a number
which compares pretty well

302
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,648
with the experimental measurement.

303
00:24:29,254 --> 00:24:33,191
Now, moving at about 500 km/s,

304
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:38,381
the solar wind needs
about 4 or 5 days to reach Earth,

305
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:43,817
and many more months
to reach the outermost planets.

306
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:47,001
As the solar wind leaves the corona,

307
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,859
due to the large magnetic
Reynolds number,

308
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:53,329
It picks up the local magnetic field,

309
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:59,116
which is the field associated
with sunspots and Sun's magnetic poles,

310
00:24:59,116 --> 00:25:02,291
and drags it into the space.

311
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:06,791
The dragging of the magnetic field
by the plasma is a result

312
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:10,871
of the frozen flux theorem
that you have seen in module 3G.

313
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:16,055
The dragged magnetic field forms
the interplanetary magnetic field [IMF]

314
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:19,567
The interplanetary magnetic field
is quite weak.

315
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,498
At the earth's orbit it's about

316
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:26,825
1 over 10,000 times the field
at the Earth's surface.

317
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:33,090
However, it exerts an extraordinary
influence on the Earth's magnetosphere.

318
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:44,208
The magnetic field of the Earth
provides an effective obstacle

319
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,953
to the solar wind plasma.

320
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:49,037
When it reaches the Earth's orbit,

321
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:52,882
the solar wind is quite rarified

322
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:57,275
between 3 and 8
ions per cubic centimeter.

323
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:06,247
The Earth's magnetic field
keeps the ions,

324
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:09,781
keeps the plasma out of the Earth

325
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:13,016
by carving its own cavity
in the solar wind.

326
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:17,910
This region is called the magnetosphere
although it is not spherical.

327
00:26:18,532 --> 00:26:21,469
When it reaches the Earth's
magnetic field, the solar wind,

328
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:24,920
as we have seen,
is usually supersonic

329
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,082
and the magnetic field of the Earth

330
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:32,677
creates a magnetic obstacle
which creates a shock front

331
00:26:32,677 --> 00:26:35,436
where the plasma becomes subsonic.

332
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:39,176
This region is called <i>bow shock region</i>.

333
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:45,497
The bow shock region is approximately 
17 kilometers thick,

334
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:48,282
and it is located at a distance

335
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:52,849
of approximately
90,000 kilometers from earth.

336
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,316
Most of the solar wind plasma is heated
and slows down at the bow shock

337
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:03,918
and detours around the earth.

338
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:10,494
Some plasma of the solar wind penetrates
inside the magnetic field of the earth

339
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:13,019
and forms the so called <i>magnetosheath</i>.

340
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:22,453
The magnetosheath exerts a pressure
on the Earth's magnetic field.

341
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:27,731
The region where the pressure
of the magnetic field

342
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,790
equals the pressure
of the magnetosheath,

343
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,764
this is called <i>the magnetopause</i>.

344
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,658
By dragging the magnetic field lines
of the Earth's magnetic field with it,

345
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:43,959
the solar wind deforms
the magnetic field lines

346
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:47,203
and creates a neutral sheath

347
00:27:47,203 --> 00:27:50,672
where the magnetic field lines
are opposite directed.

348
00:27:53,816 --> 00:27:55,664
As we have seen in previous modules

349
00:27:56,238 --> 00:28:01,790
where opposite directed magnetic field
lines come together,

350
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,795
magnetic reconnection can take place
if the magnetic field lines

351
00:28:06,795 --> 00:28:09,482
are pushed together strongly enough.

352
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:17,986
One of the most important
perturbations to the solar wind

353
00:28:17,986 --> 00:28:22,548
are coronal mass ejections
or in short, CME's.

354
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:29,139
During a coronal mass ejection,
the Sun can eject 10¹²

355
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:34,817
up to 10¹³ kg
of plasma moving at speeds

356
00:28:34,817 --> 00:28:38,811
of approximately 1,000 km/s.

357
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:43,727
These are strong perturbations
to the solar wind which can have

358
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:46,526
profound consequences on earth.

359
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:51,725
By pushing together
the magnetic field lines

360
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:55,964
at the neutral sheath, 
reconnection can occur

361
00:28:55,964 --> 00:28:59,376
and plasmas and electrons
can be accelerated

362
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:01,754
and reach down earth,

363
00:29:01,754 --> 00:29:06,215
creating one of the most
spectacular events on earth,

364
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:08,601
which is the <i>aurora borealis</i>.

365
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:13,322
This was the last module in
Applications of Plasmas in Astrophysics.

366
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,591
You have learned that distant
astrophysical objects, like the Sun,

367
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:20,434
can have a profound influence
on our environment.

368
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:25,059
An example is how the solar wind shapes
the magnetosphere around the earth.

369
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:28,517
Throughout the five modules,
I have pointed out the importance

370
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,916
of three major players
in the dynamics of the universe:

371
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:35,168
nuclear fusions, plasmas,
and magnetic fields.

372
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:38,061
The complex interaction
of all of these elements

373
00:29:38,061 --> 00:29:40,556
through dynamo and magnetic reconnection,

374
00:29:40,556 --> 00:29:42,516
shapes our world.

375
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:44,998
Plasma physics is
of fundamental importance

376
00:29:44,998 --> 00:29:48,524
to advance the understanding
of the universe we live in.
