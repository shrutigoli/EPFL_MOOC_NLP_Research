00:00:07,065 --> 00:00:10,159
Welcome back to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,841
In the last module, 
we have learned that at the core

3
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:16,257
of the generation 
of magnetic fields in the Sun

4
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:17,766
is a dynamo process

5
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:22,096
which converts energy of the plasma flow
into energy of the magnetic field.

6
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,755
Magnetic flux ropes 
with large magnetic fields,

7
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:29,435
form and emerge from the interior 
through the photosphere.

8
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:31,395
In the course of this lecture,

9
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:35,179
I will first describe 
how magnetic buoyancy can result

10
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,374
in the emergence of the flux rope,

11
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:42,442
and I will then detail how magnetic fields
of different flux ropes can interact.

12
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:46,803
You will discover that magnetic
field lines can break, reconnect,

13
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:49,139
change the topology of the fields

14
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:52,190
by converting a large fraction 
of the magnetic energy

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,603
into energy of the plasma flow.

16
00:00:54,603 --> 00:00:57,406
This process is called <i>magnetic reconnection,</i>

17
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:01,598
and is at the core 
of the most spectacular event in the Sun,

18
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:03,457
the <i>Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)</i>

19
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:06,913
To describe it in a quantitative way,

20
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:09,620
we will derive the <i>Sweet-Parker model</i>

21
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,343
which is based on the equation 
of the resistive MHD

22
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:15,524
that you have learned in previous modules.

23
00:01:17,386 --> 00:01:20,381
We have seen that modelling 
of the solar dynamo

24
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:23,727
requires the emergence of bundles 
of magnetic field

25
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:26,292
called <i>flux tubes</i> or <i>flux ropes</i>,

26
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:29,476
from the interior of the Sun
to the surface.

27
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:34,883
The existence of flux ropes 
has been theorized since the early '70s,

28
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:38,082
but have these flux tubes
been observed in reality?

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,123
The answer is <i>yes</i>.

30
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:47,309
This movie was taken on July 18, 2012
from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly

31
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:50,972
and showed the Sun activity
in the extreme ultraviolet.

32
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:55,267
This movie showed for the first time
the formation of a flux rope.

33
00:01:55,962 --> 00:02:00,022
On that day, a burst of light 
called a <i>flare</i>

34
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:03,901
was caught from the Sun
by the <i>Solar Dynamics Observatory</i>.

35
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:10,669
These flares are very often associated
with the eruption of solar material

36
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,217
known as Coronal Mass Ejection or CME.

37
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:16,450
But this one was not.

38
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:21,630
Instead, the magnetic field lines
in this area of the Sun's corona

39
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,779
started to twist and kink,

40
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:29,174
and the plasma started emitting
very strongly, in extreme ultraviolet.

41
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,233
The formation of the flux ropes
and their twisting and kinking

42
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:37,717
are clearly visible in red color
in this movie.

43
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:40,944
Eight hours later, on July 19,

44
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:43,944
the same region of the Sun flared again.

45
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:47,474
This time the flux rope connection 
to the Sun was cut

46
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:50,507
and magnetic field escaped into space,

47
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:53,655
dragging billions of tons 
of solar materials

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,925
and this was a classic CME.

49
00:02:56,029 --> 00:03:00,044
To allow this process, 
magnetic reconnection must be at play.

50
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:03,225
Before dealing with magnetic reconnection,

51
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,782
let's see how a flux rope can emerge
from the interior.

52
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,509
What can make the flux tube emerge?

53
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,627
The answer is magnetic buoyancy

54
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:19,207
which is similar in physics 
to an emerging submarine.

55
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,124
Consider a flux tube which is immersed
in the solar plasma

56
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:25,944
underneath the surface,

57
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:29,643
and it is perpendicularly oriented
to the solar gravity.

58
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:33,559
Plasma in the flux tube has a pressure P

59
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:38,974
and the plasma outside the flux tube
has a pressure Pext.

60
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,676
This flux tube has a magnetic field B

61
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:45,513
which is much larger 
than the magnetic field [Bext]

62
00:03:45,513 --> 00:03:48,440
characterizing the outside environment.

63
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:55,256
Let's now consider 
a cylindrical coordinate system centered

64
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:57,701
in the center of the flux tube

65
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:03,298
and let's write down the MHD equilibrium
in the radial direction.

66
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:09,142
In this equation, 
the sum of the plasma pressure

67
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:11,978
plus the magnetic energy inside the tube,

68
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:14,903
must balance the external pressure

69
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:19,911
plus the magnetic energy outside the tube.

70
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:22,533
However, this last one can be neglected

71
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:27,050
since the magnetic field 
outside the flux tube is much smaller

72
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,161
than the magnetic field inside the tube.

73
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:32,994
Let's now make 
the isothermal approximation

74
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:37,687
and let's assume that the temperature
inside and outside the flux tube

75
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:39,358
is not too different.

76
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:45,978
If we now assume that the flux tube
is characterized by a plasma density ρ

77
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:49,239
and the plasma outside the flux tube

78
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:53,053
is characterized by a plasma density 
ρext,

79
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:56,050
and we use the equation of state
for ideal gas,

80
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,000
we can write the following.

81
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:03,031
From this equation, we obtain that, ...
which tells us that the flux tube

82
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:06,752
is less dense than the surrounding plasma.

83
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:10,782
Therefore the flux tube
will experience a buoyancy force

84
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:14,749
which can be expressed as the difference
between the two densities

85
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:17,156
times the volume of the flux tube

86
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:19,849
times the gravitational acceleration.

87
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,596
Just as for a submarine floating,

88
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:27,276
the flux tube would be the force
subject to a buoyancy force,

89
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:30,460
which will tend to push 
the flux tube upwards

90
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,348
towards the surface of the Sun.

91
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,580
Once flux ropes have emerged
from the interior through the surface,

92
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:40,794
how will they interact?

93
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:43,812
And how their magnetic fields will evolve?

94
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:48,284
The image on the left shows
a series of magnetic loops

95
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:50,043
from the previous movie,

96
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:52,733
the image on the right has been processed

97
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:56,523
to highlight the edges of each flux loop

98
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,871
and make the structure more clear.

99
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:01,866
Now, for the sake of the discussion,

100
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:05,077
let's suppose that the magnetic fields
are oriented like this

101
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:06,576
in these flux ropes.

102
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:10,820
We can observe that the complex 
3D magnetic field can develop

103
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,623
in which opposite directed
magnetic fields

104
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,236
are brought together by plasma flows.

105
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:22,028
For example, let's suppose
that in this flux rope

106
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:25,352
the magnetic field is oriented
in the following way

107
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,851
and the plasma flow with a velocity v
is squeezing the flux rope.

108
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,451
In a second time,

109
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:39,304
we can observe that the complex 
3D magnetic field can develop

110
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:42,029
in which opposite directed
magnetic fields

111
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,234
are brought together by the plasma flow,

112
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:47,300
and they start to interact 
in a small region.

113
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:51,423
In the following we will see 
that magnetic reconnection

114
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:54,753
is the basis of the interaction

115
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:56,967
of oppositely directed field lines.

116
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:02,594
To describe the interactions
of magnetic fields,

117
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:06,494
let's go back to the resistive
MHD equations

118
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:08,678
that you have seen in previous modules.

119
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:14,824
The key parameter in this equation
is the <i>magnetic Reynolds number</i>

120
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:20,139
which in most astrophysical systems
is much larger than 1.

121
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,588
Let's suppose that we start
from a situation

122
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:27,147
where we have an opposite directed
magnetic field lines

123
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,048
as shown in this picture,

124
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:33,129
which are embedded in a plasma
with the magnetic Reynolds number

125
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,738
much larger than 1.

126
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:39,638
Now, we push the magnetic field lines,
one against the other

127
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:43,975
by using a plasma flow
with a velocity v.

128
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:48,621
Which are the consequences 
of a large magnetic Reynolds number?

129
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:53,394
The advection dominates 
the plasma dynamics.

130
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:58,860
Therefore, the magnetic field lines
are frozen in the plasma

131
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,547
and the ideal MHD holds.

132
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:06,209
This means that the magnetic 
diffusivity term

133
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,740
can be neglected.

134
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:12,969
Another important consequence
of a magnetic Reynolds number, very large

135
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:18,492
is that the magnetic flux is frozen
to the plasma motion

136
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:22,793
and therefore, the magnetic field lines
cannot break or reconnect.

137
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:28,349
This means that no changes 
in the magnetic topology are allowed.

138
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,180
If we keep pushing 
the magnetic field lines

139
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,665
with a velocity v

140
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:36,571
then we get closer and closer

141
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:40,870
and the magnetic flux 
will be compressed between them.

142
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:45,726
This in turn will increase 
the magnetic field gradient

143
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:50,471
which are characterized 
by the special distance d

144
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:53,806
and as a consequence,
the magnetic Reynolds number

145
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:56,076
will be decreased in a small layer

146
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:59,650
across the opposite directed 
magnetic field lines.

147
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,492
Therefore, very thin regions can form

148
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:09,450
where the gradients 
of the magnetic fields are very large.

149
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,133
In this thin region, a current develops
in the perpendicular plane,

150
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,225
and the ideal MHD does not hold anymore.

151
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:25,971
In this very thin region 
where the ideal MHD is violated,

152
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:28,535
magnetic reconnection can happen.

153
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:32,607
A magnetic field line which is pushed
by the plasma flow

154
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:36,467
against a magnetic field line
which is opposite directed,

155
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,895
will break and reconnect, thus forming
a new magnetic field line.

156
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,417
Which are the consequences 
of magnetic reconnection?

157
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:51,670
As you can see, the global topology
of the magnetic field now has changed

158
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,637
and this affects the path of particles
and heat conduction.

159
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,897
As we will see in the following slides,

160
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:02,978
the magnetic energy is converted 
into heat, kinetic energy

161
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,890
and fast particles energy.

162
00:10:05,097 --> 00:10:06,679
During magnetic reconnection,

163
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,601
large electric currents 
and fields are generated

164
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:11,093
at the reconnection sites,

165
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:14,445
as well as shocks, waves 
and filamentation.

166
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,818
Let's now describe 
the magnetic reconnection dynamics

167
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:23,468
using a simple model, 
the <i>Sweet-Parker model,</i>

168
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:27,859
that was originally proposed 
by Sweet in 1958

169
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:30,419
and by Parker in 1957.

170
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:33,403
This was the first quantitative model

171
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:36,961
of magnetic reconnection to be developed.

172
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:44,235
The geometry of the Sweet-Parker model
is represented here.

173
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:50,908
Opposite directed field lines
with magnetic field intensity B₀

174
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:56,374
are brought together by a plasma flow
with a velocity v₀

175
00:10:56,988 --> 00:11:02,255
They form a current sheet
of length 2L and thickness 2d

176
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:03,486
shown here in red.

177
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,756
Reconnection happens 
in the the current sheet

178
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:09,754
and the new magnetic field lines

179
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:14,697
are now flowing out of the current sheet
with the velocity vout

180
00:11:14,803 --> 00:11:17,977
and a magnetic field intensity, Bout

181
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,926
To derive the model,
we made the following hypotheses:

182
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:23,677
Outside the current sheet,

183
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:27,231
the magnetic Reynolds number
is much larger than 1.

184
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:31,420
Inside the current sheet,
the plasma has a resistivity

185
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,774
indicated by eta (η).

186
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,402
The system is in steady state,

187
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,670
meaning that time derivatives 
can be neglected.

188
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:42,937
The plasma is incompressible

189
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:47,961
and we assume 
a two-dimensional geometry

190
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:51,478
with d/dy = 0.

191
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,631
To derive the Sweet-Parker model,

192
00:11:56,631 --> 00:12:00,002
we will use the <i>Continuity Equation,</i>
the <i>Ohm's Law</i>

193
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:01,664
and the <i>Equation of Motion.</i>

194
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:04,258
Let's start with the Continuity Equation.

195
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:08,018
Divergence of ρv = 0 [∇⋅(ρv) = 0 ]

196
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:10,888
where ρ is the mass density of the plasma.

197
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:13,072
From this equation,

198
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:15,524
using the coordinate system
we have chosen,

199
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:20,757
it's easy to write ..., where Δy

200
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:25,658
is the thickness of the layer
in the y direction which drops out.

201
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:30,777
We can therefore obtain
an equation that links

202
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:35,859
the outflow velocity vout
to the inflow velocity v₀

203
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:38,980
via the thickness and the length
of the current sheet.

204
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:43,887
Let's now write the Ohm's Law
and consider the y component.

205
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:47,388
At the edge of the current sheet,

206
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:51,053
the y component of the current density
is equal to zero.

207
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:54,629
Therefore, using Ohm's Law
we obtain that

208
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:59,306
in the center of the current sheet
the flow stagnates

209
00:12:59,306 --> 00:13:04,113
and therefore, vz=0.

210
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:09,851
We can therefore write that Ey = η Jy

211
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:12,946
where η is the resistivity of the plasma,
[and Jy the current density]

212
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:16,020
Now writing the <i>Ampere's Law</i>
in the current sheet,

213
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,043
we can easily obtain
B₀/d = μ₀ Jy .

214
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:23,535
Now if we put together this equation
and this equation,

215
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:27,359
we obtain that Ey = η/μ₀ B₀

216
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:31,576
Using these two equations
we can eliminate Ey

217
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:35,170
and obtain v₀ = η / (d μ₀)

218
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,292
If we now go back 
to the expression we found

219
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:39,298
using the continuity equation

220
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:44,167
and we use the expression
for v₀ that we have just found,

221
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:46,049
we can easily obtain an expression

222
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:51,356
that links the outflow velocity 
to the inflow velocity

223
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:54,304
via the resistivity and the length
of the current sheet.

224
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,449
Now, if we know vout,
we now know the inflow velocity v₀

225
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:02,362
and the shape of the current sheet

226
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:05,760
characterized by thickness 
divided by its length.

227
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,854
The question is, how do we determine
the outflow velocity?

228
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,829
We will use the <i>Equation of Motion.</i>

229
00:14:19,268 --> 00:14:22,282
Let's write down
the MHD equation of motion

230
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:24,438
for a steady state plasma.

231
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:29,258
Let's now consider the current sheet

232
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:33,561
with an xyz reference system centered
in its center.

233
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,688
Let's make the further hypothesis
that the gradient of the pressure

234
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:39,087
can be neglected,

235
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,802
and let's first compute the Lorentz force

236
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:47,357
that acts along the current sheet
in the x direction as follows:

237
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:54,692
The Lorentz force accelerates 
the plasma from rest

238
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:58,741
to the outflow velocity vout
over a distance L

239
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,362
the lenght of the current sheet.

240
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:06,558
So we can write:
ρ (v • ∇) vx = ρ vout / L

241
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:09,480
Using the previous espression,
we can obtain

242
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:14,398
Bout B₀ / (d μ₀ )= ρ vout²/2

243
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:17,704
Now using the conservation
of the magnetic flux

244
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:20,292
we can obtain this simple expression
B₀/L = Bout/d

245
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:25,718
which allows to compute 
the outflow plasma velocity

246
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:29,515
and by recalling the definition
of the Alfvén speed

247
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:34,405
we obtain this important result
that the plasma is accelerated

248
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:37,355
at the Alfvén speed 
by reconnection process.

249
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:44,088
If we now define the <i>Lundquist number</i>
which is an dimensionless number

250
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,985
and we recall the formulas
that we have derived so far,

251
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,507
we have fully characterized 
the current sheet

252
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:52,425
in the Sweet-Parker model.

253
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:57,051
In particular, we obtained 
that the inflow velocity

254
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:59,449
is equal to the Alfvén speed

255
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,521
divided by the square root
of the Lundquist number.

256
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:08,575
And the current sheet geometry
defined the ratio d/L

257
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:13,391
scales like 1 over the square root
of the Lundquist number.

258
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,578
Since in astrophysical systems

259
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:20,072
the Lundquist number 
is usually much larger than 1,

260
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:23,600
this formula tells us 
that in the Sweet-Parker model

261
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,211
the current sheet is very thin.

262
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:32,340
And this formula tells us that the plasma
is flowing into the current sheet

263
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,432
with the velocity which is much smaller
than the Alfvén speed.

264
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:42,418
Let's now do some energy
considerations.

265
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,211
In the Sweet-Parker model,
the sheet is thin and elongated.

266
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:52,981
The plasma outflows
from the current sheet at Alfvén velocity.

267
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:58,179
We can also compute the magnetic field
at the exit of the current sheet

268
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:00,972
using the flux conservation.

269
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:05,255
And we obtain that it is much smaller
than the magnetic field,

270
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:07,285
than the entrance of the magnetic field,

271
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,297
since it scales like 1 
over the square root

272
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:11,940
of the Lundquist number.

273
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,390
Let's now recall the flux
of the electromagnetic energy

274
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,088
is given by the <i>Poynting flux</i>.

275
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:24,579
And let's compute the Poynting flux
at the edge of the current sheet.

276
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,426
We have obtained this expression
by recalling that E = v₀ B₀.

277
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:34,505
We can now use this expression
to compute the ratio

278
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:39,483
of the kinetic energy flux
by the magnetic energy flux.

279
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:49,128
Recalling that the inflow plasma velocity

280
00:17:49,128 --> 00:17:52,383
is much smaller than the Alfvén velocity

281
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,812
we can easily conclude
that most of the inflow energy

282
00:17:57,812 --> 00:17:59,842
is of magnetic nature.

283
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:04,248
What about the outflow
in magnetic energy?

284
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:06,722
This can be easily estimated,

285
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:11,224
and by recalling that Bout
is much smaller than B₀,

286
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:14,505
and small d is much smaller than L,

287
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:17,708
we obtain the result that
the outflowing magnetic energy

288
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,162
can be neglected.

289
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:25,661
Let's now compute the ratio
of the outflowing kinetic energy flux

290
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:28,587
to the inflowing magnetic energy flux.

291
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:34,768
We obtain the important result
that during magnetic reconnection

292
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,828
in the simple Sweet-Parker model,

293
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:39,297
half of the incoming magnetic energy

294
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:42,886
is converted into plasma kinetic energy.

295
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,749
I will not demonstrate it,

296
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:50,973
but the other half is converted
into heat by Joule dissipation.

297
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:54,189
Therefore, the reconnection layers

298
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:58,458
act as a source of hot and fast plasma.

299
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:03,822
How fast is this process?

300
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:08,892
The plasma enters the current sheet
at the velocity v₀.

301
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:10,410
This is also the rate

302
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,074
at which the magnetic flux enters
the current sheet.

303
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:17,514
In this region, the plasma slips 
from the magnetic fields

304
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:21,703
and flow out at the Alfvén speed 
along the current sheet.

305
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:25,233
No more plasma can enter
and carry magnetic flux

306
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,413
until the previous one has left.

307
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:31,513
An important parameter to define

308
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:35,093
how fast the reconnection is happening

309
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:37,464
is the so-called <i>Reconnection rate</i>.

310
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:42,494
This is defined as the ratio
of the incoming flow velocity

311
00:19:42,494 --> 00:19:44,298
to the outcoming flow velocity.

312
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:50,598
And in the Sweet-Parker model
it is equal to v₀ / vAlfvén.

313
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:52,832
This shows that in the Sweet-Parker model

314
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:56,676
the reconnection rate scales like
the inverse of the square root

315
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:58,489
of the Lundquist number.

316
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,621
Since the Lundquist number 
is much larger than 1

317
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:04,002
for many astrophysical systems,

318
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,750
The Sweet-Parker rate leads
to reconnection times

319
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,137
that are many orders of magnitude
larger than those that are observed.

320
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:16,323
If we want to accelerate 
the reconnection rate,

321
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:21,030
and you increase v₀ externally
from the outside

322
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,542
for a fixed Lundquist number,

323
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:26,044
the reconnection rate remains constant

324
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:30,418
and therefore, the Alfvén velocity
must increase to maintain the same ratio.

325
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:34,552
This is obtained by increasing
the Alfvén velocity

326
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:37,927
by increasing the incoming magnetic field.

327
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:42,898
Therefore, pushing the reconnection harder
from the outside,

328
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:47,352
does not increase the reconnection rate
in the Sweet-Parker model

329
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:50,283
but only compresses the magnetic field.

330
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,955
Let's now apply the Sweet-Parker model

331
00:20:55,955 --> 00:21:00,384
to two examples 
of magnetic reconnection in nature.

332
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:04,352
The first example 
is a <i>Coronal Mass Ejection.</i>

333
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:08,024
A picture of a CME is shown here,

334
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:10,598
where a beautiful prominence eruption

335
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:15,542
produced a CME on April 16, 2012.

336
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:21,026
Typical timescales for CME's 
are of the order of a hundred seconds.

337
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:27,056
Magnetic reconnection 
is believed to be responsible for CME's.

338
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:32,020
Let's try to estimate 
the reconnection time

339
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,820
from the Sweet-Parker model

340
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,106
using the following formula.

341
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:38,432
If we plot typical numbers

342
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,431
for a coronal mass ejection 
into this formula,

343
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:47,112
we end up with a prediction
of a approximately 10⁷s

344
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:50,855
which is much larger than
typical timescales

345
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:52,995
which are usually observed.

346
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:56,233
Therefore, the Sweet-Parker 
reconnection model

347
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,424
produces a dynamics which is far too slow

348
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:03,124
to describe coronal mass ejections.

349
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:07,698
As a second example 
of magnetic reconnection,

350
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:11,651
let's consider the 
<i>Sawtooth Instablity</i> in tokamaks,

351
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:17,056
in which plasma energy and particles
are periodically expelled

352
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:20,035
from the center of the plasma
towards the edge.

353
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:25,696
This picture shows an example
of sawtooth in a TCV discharge

354
00:22:25,696 --> 00:22:29,634
[observed] using the central 
soft x-ray emission

355
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:32,813
which is roughly proportional 
to the square

356
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:35,890
of the electron density
and the electron temperature

357
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,525
as a function of time.

358
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:43,019
The central soft x-ray emissivity
drops dramatically

359
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:48,159
over a very fast timescale 
during the so-called <i>sawtooth crash</i>.

360
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,600
The poloidal cross-section profile
of the soft x-ray

361
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,317
before and after the sawtooth crash

362
00:22:55,317 --> 00:23:01,640
clearly displays the redistribution
of energy associated with sawteeth.

363
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,008
Sawtooth crashes happen
on the TCV tokamak

364
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:09,276
on timescales of the order of 10 
to 50 microseconds.

365
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:14,650
This is the time during which 
magnetic reconnection occurs.

366
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:19,218
If we estimate the Sweet-Parker
reconnection time

367
00:23:19,236 --> 00:23:23,382
using typical values for TCV plasmas,

368
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:28,889
we obtain reconnection time
of the order between 1 and 10 millisecond

369
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:34,053
which is too large if compared
with experimental values.

370
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:39,631
In the two cases of magnetic reconnection
that we have seen,

371
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:42,987
the Sweet-Parker rate is too slow.

372
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:47,824
How can we go beyond Sweet-Parker?

373
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:52,385
If we want to decrease
the reconnection time [τSP],

374
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:56,826
we can, for example act
on the sheet thickness [L]

375
00:23:56,906 --> 00:23:59,973
by modifying the sheet geometry.

376
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:04,691
One example is the <i>Petschek model</i>
for magnetic reconnection.

377
00:24:06,752 --> 00:24:10,647
Or, we could, for example increase
the resistivity

378
00:24:13,689 --> 00:24:16,525
by introducing turbulence

379
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:21,050
which may give rise 
to anomalous resistivity.

380
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,147
Or, we could introduce new physics
into our model

381
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:29,923
by going for example beyond 
single fluid MHD

382
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:33,223
Or, by introducing 
three dimensional physics.

383
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:39,487
All these ways are the subjects
of intensive studies

384
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,948
in the scientific community.

385
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:46,802
However, a number of open question remains
for magnetic reconnection.

386
00:24:46,802 --> 00:24:51,644
Among the most important 
open questions are:

387
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:55,760
"What are the causes
of the fast reconnection rate?"

388
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:58,105
"How does reconnection start?

389
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:02,435
And when it starts, 
how are particles accelerated and heated?"

390
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:06,340
"What is the interplay between 
the small scale physics

391
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,777
that happens in the current sheet
and the global dynamics of the plasma?"

392
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:15,258
And probably 
one of the most difficult questions is

393
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:19,101
"How can we model three-dimensional
magnetic reconnection?"

394
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:22,333
To advance our understanding
in the future,

395
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:26,467
we will need more observational data,
numerical simulations

396
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:28,428
and laboratory experiments.

397
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,393
As an example of numerical simulation,

398
00:25:33,393 --> 00:25:36,485
I show you here a movie, 
which is obtained

399
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:39,406
from one of the most advanced 
numerical simulations

400
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:41,009
of magnetic reconnection

401
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:43,190
from a fully kinetic model.

402
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:48,413
The simulation employed 
two trillion particles with 8 billion cells

403
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,645
and was performed 
on the blue water machine

404
00:25:50,645 --> 00:25:52,725
at the University of Illinois.

405
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:56,098
The movie shows the volume rendering
of the current density

406
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,935
during the magnetic reconnection.

407
00:25:57,935 --> 00:26:03,066
The complexity of this process,
well-beyond the simple Sweet-Parker model

408
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:07,253
is revealed by the development
of a fully three-dimensional turbulence

409
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:09,325
in the current sheet.

410
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:14,435
Numerical simulations are important
to shed light on reconnection physics.

411
00:26:15,022 --> 00:26:18,641
They must be compared 
against experimental data.

412
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:23,081
These are difficult,
if not impossible to obtain

413
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:27,389
from distance observations
using telescopes and satellites.

414
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:33,059
An important role can be therefore played
by laboratory experiments

415
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:38,076
which provide easy diagnostic access
and control experimental conditions.

416
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:42,546
A number of magnetic reconnection
laboratory experiments

417
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:44,513
has been developed in the past

418
00:26:44,513 --> 00:26:48,542
and is presently under development
with different geometries

419
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:52,365
from two-dimensional
to fully three-dimensional

420
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:55,284
and also covering different plasma regimes

421
00:26:55,284 --> 00:27:01,047
from Sweet-Parker to two-fluid MHD
and kinetic reconnection.

422
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:04,212
These will provide an important test bed

423
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:06,845
for reconnection theories and simulations.

424
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:12,296
In this module, we have explored
the dynamics of solar flux tubes.

425
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:15,147
They are advected by the plasma flow

426
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:18,081
and their opposite magnetic fields 
reconnect,

427
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:19,935
change the plasma topology,

428
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:22,844
and dissipate the large amount
of magnetic energy

429
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:26,545
that goes into particle acceleration
plasma heating.

430
00:27:27,165 --> 00:27:29,845
Although the basics 
of magnetic reconnection

431
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:33,671
can be caught by the simple 
two-dimensional Sweet-Parker model,

432
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:37,384
the predictions of the reconnection time
are not in agreement

433
00:27:37,384 --> 00:27:39,004
with experimental data

434
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,269
which show much faster dynamics,

435
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:46,139
for example, in coronal mass ejections
or sawteeth in tokamaks.

436
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:50,342
In the future, advancing our understanding
of magnetic reconnection

437
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:52,899
will require the use 
of observational data,

438
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:56,573
sophisticated numerical simulation
and experiments

439
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:59,869
in well controlled and diagnosed
laboratory devices.

440
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:04,205
In the next module, we will explore
how the plasma dynamics in the Sun

441
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:08,864
can shape the surrounding environment
by generating the solar wind.
