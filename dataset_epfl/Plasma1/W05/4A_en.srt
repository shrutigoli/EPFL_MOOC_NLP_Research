1
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:06,599
Welcome.

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,551
Welcome back to the course 
on Plasma Physics and Applications

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,603
to Fusion Energy, Astrophysics, 
and Industry.

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,876
In this first module on 
plasma astrophysics,

5
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:21,105
we will deal with the most powerful source
of energy in our solar system: the Sun.

6
00:00:21,723 --> 00:00:26,043
Today we will answer some 
fundamental questions about our Sun.

7
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:27,778
What powers the Sun?

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,283
How does it shine?

9
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:32,662
We will address these questions 
in a simplified way by using

10
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:36,286
the fundamental tools of plasma physics 
that you have learned so far.

11
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:40,842
Let me introduce first 
a few properties of the Sun.

12
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:45,852
The solar distance from Earth is called 
the astronomical unit.

13
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:50,593
It is approximately 1.5 on average 
10¹¹ meters.

14
00:00:51,614 --> 00:00:53,756
The astronomical unit

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,997
is a basic unit in the solar system 
and even beyond.

16
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,923
The mass of the sun, which is 
approximately 2 x 10³⁰ kilograms,

17
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:06,457
is a typical value for a normal star,
and a normal star

18
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:11,864
is an object that shines steadily 
for a fair long time by burning hydrogen.

19
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:14,103
The Sun's radius,

20
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:18,830
which is approximately 7 x 10⁸ meters

21
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,835
is the radius of the visible disc
which, we notice is almost perfectly round.

22
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:29,273
The diameter of the Sun is a little bit 
more than half a degree

23
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:30,935
as we see it from Earth.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,467
Note that the shape of the Sun 
is extremely sharply defined

25
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:38,501
because almost all the light 
we receive on earth

26
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:43,938
originates in a thin layer, which is a few 
hundred kilometers thick, the photosphere.

27
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:48,910
In fact, if we move from 
the center of the sun, going outwards,

28
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,069
the matter changes rapidly 
from being almost completely opaque

29
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:56,566
to almost completely transparent 
in the photosphere.

30
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,433
The sun emits electromagnetic radiation

31
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:09,264
and its luminosity is approximately 
3.84 x 10²⁶ watts.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,628
Using the famous E=mc² relation,

33
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:20,509
this yields a mass loss of about 
4 x 10⁹ kilograms per second,

34
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:25,125
which results in a negligible perturbation
to the total mass of the sun.

35
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:30,327
And finally the elemental 
abundances of the Sun

36
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:32,866
are typical for cosmic sources.

37
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,855
The Sun is made approximately, in mass,

38
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:42,211
by 73.4% of hydrogen, 25% of helium,

39
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:47,706
and then 1.6% of everything else,
mostly metals.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,770
The Sun is a main sequence star.

41
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,012
That is a star that has been shining 
steadily for a fair amount of time.

42
00:02:56,678 --> 00:03:00,117
The largest mass observed 
for a main sequence star

43
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:04,966
is of the order of approximately 
100 times the mass of our Sun

44
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:10,565
while the lower limit is slightly below 
0.1 times the mass of our Sun.

45
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:14,647
An interesting property of 
main sequence stars is that

46
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:17,168
they follow well-defined empirical laws.

47
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,921
One such law is shown in this plot here

48
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:25,612
where the star luminosity is shown 
as a function of the star mass.

49
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:31,516
This is a logarithmic plot 
and we are using normalized units

50
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:36,074
where the mass of the star
is normalized to the mass of our Sun

51
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:40,962
and the luminosity normalized 
to its luminosity.

52
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:45,515
In fact, this red dot here 
in the middle of the plot

53
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:48,620
indicates the position of our Sun.

54
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:53,901
If we now try to interpolate 
this data with a straight line,

55
00:03:56,508 --> 00:04:00,558
we observe an interesting property 
of a main sequence's star.

56
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,354
The luminosity of the star

57
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,940
is related to the mass of the star 
through a scaling law,

58
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:14,876
where the exponent <i>α</i> varies 
between three and four.

59
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:22,278
This is telling us that
the luminosity of the star increases

60
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:24,867
much faster than the mass of the star.

61
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:28,527
Let's see an important consequence 
of this scaling law.

62
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,371
Let's consider a star of 10 solar masses.

63
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:37,773
This means that this star has 
10 times the fuel available

64
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:42,334
since the fuel is proportional 
to the mass of the star.

65
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:46,252
However, by using the scaling law,

66
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,892
and assuming an exponent <i>α</i> equal to three,

67
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:53,754
we obtain that 
the luminosity of this star

68
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:57,635
will be one thousand times 
the luminosity of our Sun.

69
00:04:58,092 --> 00:05:02,264
This means that this star will 
burn its fuel one thousand times

70
00:05:02,264 --> 00:05:05,034
much faster than our Sun, and therefore,

71
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:07,690
it will live one thousand times shorter.

72
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:11,372
In the following, we will derive 
this fundamental property

73
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:13,320
from basic principles.

74
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,944
We know from everyday experience 
that a cloud of gas

75
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:19,956
tends to fill all available space.

76
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:23,166
On cosmic scale, this is not true

77
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:28,072
because of the gravitation that tends
to contract the gas under its own weight,

78
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:31,376
heating it up eventually to a temperature

79
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:34,983
which is high enough
to ignite nuclear fusion.

80
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,695
An equilibrium is reached when 
the gravitational force

81
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:42,403
which acts to contract the star,
and the gas pressure force

82
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:45,946
which acts to expand the star
are balanced.

83
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,838
This is the so-called 
<i>hydrostatic equilibrium</i>

84
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:53,090
and in a nutshell the Sun is 
a gravitationally self-confined

85
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,872
nuclear fusion reactor.

86
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:59,859
What we're going to do next is derive 
the hydrostatic equilibrium equation

87
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,165
and compute the center 
temperature of the Sun.

88
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:08,376
Now, to start deriving the equation 
for the hydrostatic equilibrium

89
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,763
let's make a first hypothesis.

90
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:14,650
That is the Sun is a perfectly 
spherical object.

91
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,964
The radius of this sphere

92
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:23,960
is the Sun's radius,
which is 7 x 10⁸ meters.

93
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:29,588
Let's then consider a spherical shell,

94
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:34,739
which is located at a distance r
from the center of the sun

95
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,676
and this shell has a

96
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:41,694
radial thickness dr.

97
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,188
Let's then indicate with a ρ

98
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:54,319
the local density of the matter
inside the shell

99
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:57,937
and with Mr

100
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:04,317
the total mass inside the spherical shell.

101
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:09,567
We can write down the force balance

102
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,920
in the following way where

103
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:19,755
the first term describes 
the acceleration forces,

104
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:25,972
the second term describes 
the gravitational forces

105
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:32,167
and G is the gravitational constant 
in SI units

106
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:36,920
and the third term describes 
the pressure forces.

107
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:43,030
P is the pressure inside the Sun.

108
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:48,239
Let's now make a second hypothesis

109
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:52,874
by assuming that the acceleration 
can be neglected

110
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:59,532
since the Sun has been in equilibrium 
for a very long time

111
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,847
and therefore we assume 
an hydrostatic equilibrium

112
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:06,103
by dropping the first term 
in this equation.

113
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:10,855
In doing this we're balancing 
the pressure forces that tend

114
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:13,976
to expand the matter inside the Sun

115
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:20,091
with the gravitational forces that tend 
to contract the mass of the sun

116
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:21,993
under its own weight.

117
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:27,735
Let us now multiply by 4 π R³

118
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:34,172
and integrate by parts between 
the center of the Sun and R₀,

119
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,928
which is the radius of the Sun.

120
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:41,392
Let's now consider only
the left-hand side of this equation

121
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:45,815
and let's integrate by parts.

122
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:50,503
We can easily observe that 
the first term goes to zero,

123
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,227
since the pressure at R₀

124
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,032
is assumed equal to zero.

125
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:03,330
Therefore we're left with 
the following expression,

126
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,851
which we can write in the following way

127
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,634
where we have defined an average pressure

128
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:18,050
where V is now the 
total volume of the Sun.

129
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:25,257
Now if we go back to the 
hydrostatic equilibrium equation

130
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:28,246
and we plug what we just found 
into this equation,

131
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:30,708
we end up with the following,

132
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:36,284
where the right-hand side 
member represents

133
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,401
the gravitational energy of the Sun.

134
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:46,463
Now in order to compute
the average pressure, <P>,

135
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:49,034
let's make a further hypothesis.

136
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:53,808
We assume that the volume in the Sun 
is filled with a plasma,

137
00:09:53,808 --> 00:09:58,334
which is made out of N protons 
and N electrons

138
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,218
at the temperature T,

139
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:05,805
and we will then use the equation of 
state of an ideal gas.

140
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:10,941
We can thus write the average pressure 
in the following way

141
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:15,832
where KB is the Boltzmann constant.

142
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:19,539
Let's make the following approximation

143
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:24,061
that the mass density is a constant,
and we can therefore

144
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,992
write in the following form

145
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,233
where N is the total number of 
protons inside the Sun

146
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:32,926
and V is the total volume of the Sun

147
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:37,530
and mp is the mass of a proton, 
which has the following value

148
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,463
in SI units.

149
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:44,764
Then let's compute the total mass 
inside the shell,

150
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:48,283
the spherical shell, at the distance r
in the following way.

151
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:57,463
Now let's go back to the original 
hydrostatic equilibrium equation

152
00:10:57,752 --> 00:11:00,547
and let's plug what we just found in.

153
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:22,080
Using this equation,
we can now find an expression

154
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,301
for the average temperature
T of the Sun.

155
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:32,355
We can also compute
the total average number of particles

156
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:37,139
by dividing the mass of the Sun
by the mass of the proton

157
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,955
and we end up with this 
amount of particles.

158
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:45,942
If we now plug the number 
-in SI units- we just found

159
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,416
into the equation for the temperature,

160
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:53,072
we end up with
an average temperature of the Sun

161
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:57,201
of approximately
2.3 million degrees Kelvin.

162
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:04,203
This is, of course, 
an average temperature.

163
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:12,150
In reality, more complex calculations 
which allow the temperature to vary

164
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,301
according to a profile 
in the radial direction,

165
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,220
end up with a much larger temperature,

166
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,247
which is of the order of 
1.6 x 10⁷ degrees Kelvin.

167
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,808
At the core temperature of more than 
10 million degrees Kelvin,

168
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:34,323
fusion reactions become possible.

169
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,040
The main fusion reaction 
in the core of the sun

170
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,565
is the pp 1 chain which is represented 
here in this schematic diagram.

171
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,526
The nuclear reaction proceeds 
in several steps

172
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:53,044
and the net result is the conversion 
of four protons

173
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:58,671
into a helium nucleus, which is made of 
two neutrons and two protons.

174
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:03,419
The reaction also produces
neutrinos which escape

175
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,368
carrying away part of the energy
and two positrons.

176
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:15,050
The net result of the pp 1 chain is 
the release of a total energy [ΔE]

177
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,573
of approximately 26.22 
mega electron volts [MeV] .

178
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:25,802
How long can the Sun radiate 
its luminosity

179
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:28,279
by using this source of energy?

180
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,969
We know that approximately 
10% of the solar mass

181
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,691
is available for hydrogen fusion.

182
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:43,524
This provides an energy reservoir of 
ΔE times the total number of protons

183
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:44,981
divided by 10.

184
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,106
We can now estimate

185
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:50,122
the lifetime of the Sun

186
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,673
by dividing this energy reservoir

187
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:57,953
by the Sun's luminosity.

188
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:03,888
We end up with approximately 
10 billion years

189
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:09,181
telling us that the present Sun 
is roughly half way through

190
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,174
its hydrogen burning phase.

191
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:15,639
Let me briefly summarize 
what we have done so far.

192
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:19,357
We have approximated the sun 
as a spherical plasma,

193
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:23,167
which is made of electrons and protons, 
which are in hydrostatic equilibrium.

194
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:28,494
This simple assumption has allowed us 
to estimate the Sun's center temperature

195
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,891
from its mass and its radius.

196
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:36,541
This temperature is high enough to sustain
thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen.

197
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:40,331
Now in the following, let's now try 
to understand the origin

198
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:42,377
of the solar luminosity.

199
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:49,936
A hot body in local thermal equilibrium 
at a temperature T

200
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:57,281
contains photons which possess an 
energy density expressed by this formula.

201
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,230
The energy density of the photons

202
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,214
depends on the fourth power of 
the local temperature.

203
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:12,168
This constant σS is the so called 
Stefan–Boltzmann constant

204
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,405
which has this value in SI units.

205
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:26,250
Knowing the total volume of our body, 
we can compute the total radiative energy

206
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,976
which can be therefore expressed 
in the following way:

207
00:15:31,342 --> 00:15:34,761
knowing the total radiative 
energy of the Sun,

208
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:39,732
we can compute the luminosity simply 
by dividing the total radiative energy

209
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:42,652
by the mean time t_photon [tph],

210
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:46,056
that the photon will take to reach 
the surface of the Sun.

211
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:53,672
Let's now make a simple exercise 
and suppose that the photons

212
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:55,692
are free to escape.

213
00:15:56,632 --> 00:16:01,835
In this case, a photon that is generated 
in the center of the Sun

214
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:08,058
will reach the surface in a time 
that can be simply estimated

215
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:09,622
in the following way.

216
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:14,736
Let's now plug in the real number 
to estimate the time.

217
00:16:15,693 --> 00:16:17,713
By making this simple assumption, a photon

218
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:20,233
that is generated
in the center of the Sun

219
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:25,423
will take only approximately
500 seconds to reach the surface.

220
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:30,479
Let us now use the previous formula 
to compute the Sun's luminosity

221
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,125
with these numbers.

222
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:39,206
Let's first compute the total 
radiative energy of the Sun.

223
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:45,763
Now by plugging the real numbers 
into this formula

224
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:51,434
we end up with approximately 
10⁵⁶ Joules of radiative energy,

225
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:53,826
which is contained in the Sun.

226
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:03,483
Now if we go back to the formula 
to compute the luminosity

227
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:06,659
and we divide just the number 
that we have found

228
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,104
by the mean time a photon would take

229
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:13,994
to escape from the center
to the surface of the Sun,

230
00:17:13,994 --> 00:17:17,597
we end up with a value
of the solar luminosity

231
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:21,937
which is much larger than 
the real luminosity of the Sun.

232
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:24,758
Where is the problem?

233
00:17:25,473 --> 00:17:30,307
We have assumed that a photon that is 
generated in the center of the Sun

234
00:17:30,307 --> 00:17:36,468
will free fly to the surface.
However, the medium, the plasma

235
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:40,799
which the Sun is made of 
is not transparent.

236
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,612
It is opaque.

237
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:46,201
Therefore the answer is in 
the opacity of the medium.

238
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:53,608
When a beam of photon traverses
a layer of thickness, ds,

239
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:58,497
it will undergo a number of phenomena.

240
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:03,580
It can be, for example, 
absorbed by the medium

241
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:08,929
or it could be scattered by the medium.

242
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:13,991
The end result of this 
ensemble of processes

243
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:19,485
is that the original intensity 
of the photon beam

244
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:23,702
will be decreased by a certain fraction

245
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:26,790
depending on the opacity of the medium.

246
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:32,547
This fraction can be expressed as 
a function of the original intensity

247
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:36,685
of the photon beam of the local density 
<i>ρ</i> of the medium

248
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,532
and the opacity, K, of the medium.

249
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:47,015
Which, in SI units, is measured
in square meters per kilogram.

250
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:51,489
This means that over a distance, ds,

251
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:57,121
sufficiently small for K ρ

252
00:18:57,121 --> 00:19:05,271
to remain constant, the number of photons 
is decreased by this factor here.

253
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,076
Which are the sources of 
opacity in the Sun?

254
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:14,285
Strictly speaking, the opacity 
is a function of the frequency

255
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:18,592
of the electromagnetic radiation, 
and also depends on

256
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,930
a multitude of atomic processes.

257
00:19:21,581 --> 00:19:25,826
In the Sun, among the different 
interactions leading to opacity,

258
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:29,851
the most important are 
the inverse Bremsstrahlung

259
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:32,038
or free-free absorption,

260
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:35,702
the bound-free absorption 
or photo-ionization,

261
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:39,521
the bound-bound absorption 
or photo-excitation.

262
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:45,666
However, for temperatures larger 
than 10 million degrees

263
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,283
the dominant process is 
Thomson scattering,

264
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,924
the scattering that photons undergo 
over free electrons in the plasma.

265
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,563
The Thomson scattering cross section

266
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:02,090
is linked to the classical radius 
of the electron

267
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,091
and it is extremely small,
as can be seen in this formula.

268
00:20:07,911 --> 00:20:10,631
Using the Thomson scattering 
cross section,

269
00:20:10,631 --> 00:20:14,599
we can compute the 
mean free path of photons

270
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:20,514
to undergo Thomson scattering 
on free electrons in the Sun's interior.

271
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:27,115
The mean free path will depend inversely 
upon the local density of the plasma

272
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:31,033
and the Thomson scattering cross section.

273
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,091
Now if we plug the numbers

274
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:39,571
into this formula, we realize that 
the mean free path for Thomson scattering

275
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,652
is extremely small,
of the order of a centimeter.

276
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:49,298
This is much smaller than the Sun's radius

277
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:54,771
and in this limit, the photons undergo

278
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:58,214
many scatterings
before exiting the surface.

279
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:02,802
We can represent this process 
as a diffusion process.

280
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:09,431
The spreading of an ensemble of photons 
that undergo a diffusion process

281
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:13,199
can be represented in the following way,

282
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:17,038
where D is a diffusion coefficient.

283
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:19,694
The diffusion coefficient can be computed

284
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:23,625
as the ratio of the mean free path

285
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:28,324
between two collisions,
divided by the effective time

286
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:30,159
between these two collisions.
[τ_(between collisions)]

287
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:35,927
If we use this formula, we can compute 
an average time that it will take

288
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,779
for an ensemble of photons
to diffuse up to the surface of the Sun

289
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,195
in the following way.

290
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:51,040
The striking result is that it will take 
approximately 100 million years

291
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,031
for a photon to escape from the center 
to the surface of the sun

292
00:21:56,031 --> 00:22:00,236
and this reduces dramatically 
the luminosity of the sun.

293
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,874
Now going back to the luminosity, 
we can estimate it using the formulas

294
00:22:06,874 --> 00:22:09,670
and the numbers that 
we have just computed.

295
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:13,332
If we do that, and we plug
the numbers into this formula,

296
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,357
we end up with a value 
which is very close

297
00:22:17,357 --> 00:22:20,630
to the actual luminosity of the sun.

298
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:23,607
The second important result we can obtain

299
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:29,358
is by recalling the effective 
average temperature of the sun

300
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:32,549
that we have estimated from 
the hydrostatic equilibrium.

301
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:36,362
Using the expression for 
the mean free path

302
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:40,892
for Thomson scattering, we can thus 
find a relation between

303
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,996
the luminosity and the mass of the star.

304
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:48,632
In doing this, we realize that 
the luminosity scales like

305
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:50,867
the third power of the mass.

306
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:55,203
This is an extremely important result 
since from basic principles

307
00:22:55,203 --> 00:22:59,864
we have now recovered a scaling low, 
which is observed in nature

308
00:22:59,864 --> 00:23:03,037
from experimental data 
for main sequence's stars.

309
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:08,174
In this module, we have derived 
estimates of solar properties

310
00:23:08,174 --> 00:23:09,946
from basic principles.

311
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,845
We have made dramatic approximations 
to shed light on basic physics.

312
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:19,099
We have made the assumption that 
the Sun is an homogeneous ball

313
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:22,729
of protons and electrons,
which are in hydrostatic equilibrium.

314
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:27,789
We have also assumed 
an ideal equation of state,

315
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,208
which is that of ideal gases.

316
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,952
We have also made the assumption 
that the energy is transported

317
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:35,971
solely by radiation.

318
00:23:35,971 --> 00:23:37,800
This has allowed us to compute

319
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,621
some of the most fundamental
properties of the Sun

320
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:43,898
and in general of main sequence's stars.

321
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,513
However, the assumptions that we have made

322
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:49,104
are not entirely satisfied.

323
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:52,354
For example, the Sun contains 
other elements than hydrogen,

324
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,874
and also it shows some internal structures

325
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:58,326
and small deviation from 
the ideal gases law.

326
00:23:58,962 --> 00:24:01,916
Furthermore, the Sun has other
important elements

327
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,163
that contribute to its dynamics.

328
00:24:04,163 --> 00:24:07,568
One of these elements is 
the presence of magnetic fields,

329
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:10,350
which we will deal with 
in the following modules.
