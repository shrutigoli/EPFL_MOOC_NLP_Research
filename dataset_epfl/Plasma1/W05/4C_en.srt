00:00:06,314 --> 00:00:09,801
Welcome back to the course
on Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:14,103
In the last module we have reviewed
observational data

3
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:17,150
collected with telescopes
over two centuries,

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,150
and recently with satellites,
that demonstrate an amazing dynamics

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,337
of the magnetic fields in the Sun.

6
00:00:23,337 --> 00:00:25,683
We have discussed properties
of the sunspots

7
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:28,011
where the magnetic fields
are extremely intense

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,577
and the global structure
of the solar magnetic field,

9
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:33,445
which reverses every 11 years.

10
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:37,094
In the course of this lecture
I will describe how

11
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:39,516
a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo

12
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:42,811
which converts energy of the plasma flow
into magnetic energy

13
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,783
is at the origin of these fields.

14
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:48,434
I will use the plasma physics tools
that you have learned so far

15
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:50,873
and I will focus
on the main physics issues

16
00:00:50,873 --> 00:00:53,265
by skipping the complicated details.

17
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:59,377
The generation of magnetic fields
in astrophysics is an old question.

18
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:04,563
In 1919 Larmor asked,
in a brief communication,

19
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:06,158
the following question:

20
00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:10,552
"How could a rotating body
such as the Sun become a magnet?"

21
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:15,063
The answer to this question
could be a dynamo process

22
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:18,336
in which the magnetic field is generated

23
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,966
by the inductive action
of a conducting fluid.

24
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:25,625
In essence, the mechanical
energy of the flow

25
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,867
can be converted into magnetic energy

26
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:31,884
by stretching and twisting
the magnetic field lines.

27
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:36,169
Before going into the details
of plasma physics,

28
00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:40,034
let's consider a simple mechanical dynamo

29
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:44,407
as the one that is shown here,
called <i>homopolar disk dynamo</i>.

30
00:01:45,183 --> 00:01:50,487
Let's consider a copper disk
that rotates at an angular velocity ω.

31
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:53,676
The rotation is externally driven,

32
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:57,934
for example, by a motor, by applying
a torque to the axis of the disk.

33
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,037
A wire which is twisted
about the axis as it is shown here

34
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:08,464
makes a sliding contact
with the disk at points A and B.

35
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:15,882
This wire can carry a current
that we indicate with I,

36
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:18,292
which is a function of time, t.

37
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:23,465
The magnetic field
associated with this current

38
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:29,336
has a flux Φ = M I

39
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:33,935
where M is the mutual inductance
between the wire and the disk.

40
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:38,697
The rotation of the disk
in the presence of this magnetic flux

41
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:41,776
generates a radial 
electromotive force [emf]

42
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:45,317
which is equal to the angular velocity [ω]

43
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:49,259
times the magnetic flux Φ
divided by 2π.

44
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:52,416
This is due to the fact
that a radius of the disk

45
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:57,652
cuts the magnetic flux Φ
once every 2π/ω seconds.

46
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:02,415
The rotation of the copper disk
therefore results

47
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:06,601
in a potential difference between
the axis and the edge of the disk.

48
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:12,011
We can therefore write the equation
for the circuit in the following way:

49
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:22,412
Where L is the self inductance
and R is the resistance of the circuit.

50
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:28,594
We can find a solution
for this equation as follows:

51
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,433
If we look at the solution, we note

52
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:57,924
that if ω > 2π R/M

53
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:01,312
the current will grow exponentially.

54
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:07,162
This provides flux amplification,
and therefore, dynamo action.

55
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,811
We also note that if we now spin the disk
in the opposite direction

56
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:15,840
such that ω now is negative,

57
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:21,455
no dynamo is possible, since
an initial current will be damped.

58
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:26,773
In this simple mechanical dynamo example,

59
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:30,051
the success of the dynamo depends

60
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:34,114
on the built-in axial asymmetry
of the system

61
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:38,647
which in this case is provided
by the contorted shape

62
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:41,224
that the wire that carries the electrons,

63
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:44,641
-in this case, this would be
the equivalent of the plasma flow,-

64
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:48,029
is wound around the axis of our system.

65
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:53,070
This is kind of a troubling observation
for astrophysical objects,

66
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,171
since in general they possess
a very good symmetry.

67
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:02,762
Somehow this suggests that in such bodies,
a dynamo process must be linked

68
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:06,366
to some asymmetries
of their internal motion.

69
00:05:06,698 --> 00:05:10,585
This is very far from obvious,
how this is going to happen.

70
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:15,584
There is absolutely no guarantee
that in a spherical rotating object,

71
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,513
such as, for example, the Sun,

72
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:22,169
the fluid, the plasma motion,
can drive a suitably contorted flow

73
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:24,158
to provide a dynamo effect.

74
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:28,262
These observations that we have just made

75
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:33,477
were put on solid ground
by a few theorems on the dynamo action.

76
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:38,505
The results of some of these theorems
are recalled here

77
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,181
without going into the demonstrations.

78
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:48,094
For example,
in Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z)

79
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:54,006
no field independent of the coordinate z
that vanishes at infinity

80
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:56,550
can be maintained by a dynamo action.

81
00:05:56,938 --> 00:06:01,139
This is telling us that it is
impossible to generate

82
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,421
a two-dimensional dynamo field.

83
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:09,622
A consequence of this theorem
is that in a toroidal system,

84
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:14,045
a purely toroidal flow
cannot maintain a dynamo.

85
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,610
Probably the most important
of all dynamo theorems

86
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,394
is the <i>Cowling Anti-Dynamo Theorem</i>,

87
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:28,038
that states that an axisymmetric
magnetic field vanishing at infinity

88
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,457
cannot be maintained by a dynamo action.

89
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:37,334
A consequence is that dynamos with
a high degree of symmetry do not work.

90
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,778
In particular, we cannot achieve
a stationary axisymmetric dynamo,

91
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,918
a stationary centrally symmetric dynamo,

92
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,095
or dynamos whose velocity field
is restricted to a plane.

93
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:56,728
The result is that a successful dynamo
has to be complicated,

94
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,738
and so will be its analysis.

95
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:07,522
Now let's come back to the Sun and let's
try to answer the following question:

96
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:10,127
How does plasma flow in the Sun?

97
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:14,103
Is the plasma flow sufficiently contorted

98
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:17,534
such that a dynamo action can take place?

99
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,256
Let's start from the observations
of the rotation of the solar surface.

100
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,722
We know that the Sun rotates,

101
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:32,059
and the equator of the Sun
rotates in approximately 25 days.

102
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:37,485
If we move to larger latitude,
towards the north pole of the Sun,

103
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:42,714
we can observe that the surface of the Sun
does not rotate as a solid body.

104
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:45,099
It spins differentially.

105
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:49,650
The Sun rotates faster at the equator
than at its poles.

106
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:55,584
While the equator needs approximately
25 days for a full revolution,

107
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:59,504
the regions near the poles
will need about 31 days.

108
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:03,468
This observation
shouldn't come as a surprise,

109
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:06,454
since the Sun is not
a solid body like Earth,

110
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:09,291
but is instead a huge sphere of plasma

111
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,491
and different parts of it
can rotate at different speeds.

112
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:19,698
Now, what about
the rotation inside the Sun?

113
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:23,566
We cannot directly look
through the surface of the Sun

114
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:27,931
since the plasma is opaque,
except for a thin layer,

115
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,396
which is the photosphere.

116
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:33,912
For this reason, the rotation
in the interior has remained a mystery

117
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:37,751
until the recent development
of helioseismography.

118
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:43,068
These consist in measuring the properties
of acoustic waves which propagate,

119
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:45,216
are reflected and refracted,

120
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:48,027
due to the variation of the material
where they propagate.

121
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:52,170
The analysis of the mode structures,
and the frequency of the waves

122
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,573
allows us to determine how the rotation
varies within the depth of the Sun.

123
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:01,614
The most recent observations
from helioseismic data

124
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:06,087
are shown in this figure, which displays
the toroidal rotation frequency

125
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,808
as a function of the radius
for different latitudes.

126
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:13,735
Zero degrees corresponds
to the Sun's equator.

127
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:17,735
We observe that in the inner
part of the Sun

128
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:22,401
for R approximately
smaller than 0.7 R₀

129
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:25,083
the Sun rotates as a rigid body

130
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,841
at a speed between the polar
and the equatorial surface speeds.

131
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:37,527
The transition to a constant rotation rate
happens in a very narrow region

132
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:41,694
of a thickness 4% of the Sun's radius

133
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,848
which is called the <i>tachocline</i>.

134
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:51,261
In this region, the toroidal plasma flow
is extremely sheared

135
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:54,758
since the changes happen
in a very narrow region

136
00:09:54,758 --> 00:09:58,414
and this differential rotation
can have important consequences

137
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:02,260
for the magnetic field generation
as we will see later.

138
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:08,888
Recently helioseismography
has revealed the presence of flows

139
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:13,086
along the meridian lines
from the equator towards the pole

140
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:18,475
at the Sun's surface, and from the poles
towards the equator below the surface.

141
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:23,678
This is the so-called
<i>meridional circulation</i>.

142
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:31,295
Near the surface, the flow
from the Equator to the North Pole

143
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,003
is of the order of 20 meters per second.

144
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,086
Slightly deeper in the Sun,

145
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:41,184
the return flow from the North Pole
toward the Equator

146
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:46,199
is much slower, with a speed of the order
of one to two meters per second.

147
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:50,946
It is interesting to note
that this low flow return

148
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:54,484
would carry material
from mid latitudes to the Equator

149
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:56,423
in about 11 years,

150
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:59,809
which is an important number
in solar cycle.

151
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:05,545
So far we have seen
that the plasma in the Sun

152
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:10,226
is characterized by the presence
of magnetic fields and plasma flows.

153
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:11,911
How can we describe it?

154
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:16,468
The key equation to describe the dynamics
of magnetic fields in a plasma

155
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,377
is the induction equation
of the magnetohydrodynamics,

156
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:21,873
which is shown here.

157
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,941
In this equation, B represents
the magnetic field,

158
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,836
v is the plasma flow,

159
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:35,384
and σ is the plasma conductivity.

160
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:41,995
This term, usually represented
with the letter λ ,

161
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:46,100
is the magnetic diffusivity,
and in SI units

162
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,016
it is measured in m²/s .

163
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:55,254
If we know the plasma flow
and we know the velocity v,

164
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:58,472
this equation provides
the evolution of the magnetic field

165
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:00,699
under some initial conditions.

166
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:06,159
We can identify two contributions
to the variation of the magnetic field.

167
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:11,508
The first term describes
a diffusion process

168
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:14,370
which is produced
by the conductivity of the plasma.

169
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:17,296
The second term
is a convection term

170
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,659
and is produced
by the bulk plasma motion

171
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:21,385
with the velocity v.

172
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:24,671
Let's assume that B

173
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:29,822
varies over a spatial scale
L and a temporal scale τ.

174
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:34,858
Let's now consider the MHD
induction equation

175
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,139
only with the diffusion term.

176
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:40,600
We can do the following estimate
and come up with

177
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,181
the resistive diffusion time
which we can write in the following way.

178
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:49,231
Since we have ignored the advection term,

179
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:53,138
this resisted diffusion time
will provide the timescale

180
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,599
over which the magnetic field changes

181
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,667
if diffusion dominates.

182
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:02,380
Let's now consider only the advection term

183
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,923
and ignore diffusion.

184
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:09,964
We can use the induction equation
and estimate the advection time this way.

185
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:14,425
The advection time that we have estimated

186
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:19,386
provides the timescale over which
the magnetic field would change

187
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,814
if advection dominates the process.

188
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,114
How can we decide whether diffusion or
advection dominates the plasma dynamics?

189
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:35,600
We can take the ratio of the two times

190
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,628
and use the expression
that we have just computed

191
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:40,795
and we come up with the following:

192
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:48,956
This formula defines
the <i>Magnetic Reynolds Number</i>

193
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:54,350
which is a dimensionless number,
usually indicated with Rm.

194
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,641
If the Magnetic Reynolds Number
is much larger than one,

195
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,187
advection dominates.

196
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:09,699
In the opposite limit, if the Magnetic
Reynolds Number is much smaller than one,

197
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,907
then diffusion dominates.

198
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:17,662
As we will see in the following,
in astrophysical plasmas typically,

199
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:20,771
the Magnetic Reynolds Number
is much larger than one,

200
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:25,627
while in laboratory experiment
it is usually small,

201
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:28,768
typically of the order of 10 or 15.

202
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:36,581
Let's now evaluate the Magnetic
Reynolds Number for solar plasmas.

203
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:43,253
In order to do that, we need to recall
the value of the vacuum permeability

204
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:45,073
in SI units [4π x 10⁻⁷ Henry/m].

205
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:53,899
To do that, we also need to recall
the expression of the plasma conductivity

206
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:58,320
that you have derived in a previous module
which is written this way,

207
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,240
and which involves the estimate of the
electron-ion collision frequency [<νei>].

208
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:11,023
We can now recall
that the plasma conductivity

209
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:13,667
is the inverse of the plasma resistivity,

210
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:16,143
and for the plasma resistivity we can use

211
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:20,602
a very useful formula
in SI units, as follows:

212
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:26,607
This formula involves
the Coulomb logarithm [log Λ],

213
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:30,520
with a value usually between 15 and 25.

214
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,397
The effective <i>Z</i> of the plasma,
that we assume equal to one

215
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:38,041
by taking a hydrogen plasma
and the electron temperature,

216
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,810
which in this formula
is expressed in electron volts [eV].

217
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,848
Let's now estimate the plasma resistivity

218
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:48,980
using the temperature
that we have computed previously,

219
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,951
which is of the order of
1.5 x 10⁷ Kelvin.

220
00:15:54,539 --> 00:16:00,980
We recall that 1 eV is equivalent
approximately to 11,000 Kelvin,

221
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,376
and we can take a temperature
of the order of 1 keV.

222
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,907
Let's plug these numbers into the formula

223
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:17,343
We end up with a resistivity
of the order of 6. x 10⁻⁸ Ωm.

224
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:24,144
We can observe that a hydrogen plasma
at the temperature of approximately 1 keV

225
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:30,160
has about the same order of magnitude
of the resistivity as copper.

226
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:33,674
Now, in order to compute
the Magnetic Reynolds Number,

227
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:38,321
we have to assume a typical scale length
and a typical velocity.

228
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:43,974
For the typical scale length,
we can assume the radius of the Sun,

229
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:46,683
7. x 10⁸ m,

230
00:16:46,683 --> 00:16:50,348
and for a typical velocity
we use 1 km per second,

231
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:53,638
which is the typical speed
of the plasma flow

232
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,489
at the surface of the Sun.

233
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:59,036
If you now plug these numbers

234
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:02,087
into the formula
for the Magnetic Reynolds Number,

235
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:07,739
we end up with a value of 10¹²,
which is much larger than 1,

236
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:13,164
telling us that in the Sun, the advection
dominates the plasma dynamics.

237
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:18,460
There is a note of caution, however.

238
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,319
We have used as an estimate for <i>L</i>
the radius of the Sun.

239
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,111
Instead, L should be the scale
over which the magnetic field varies.

240
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:36,445
The result is that the Magnetic Reynolds
Number is certainly overestimated.

241
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:43,558
More precise estimates end up
with values between 10⁶ and 10¹⁰,

242
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:45,819
which are numbers much larger than 1,

243
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:50,933
telling us that diffusion can be neglected
in the dynamics of solar plasmas

244
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:55,499
over such large spatial scales,
where advection dominates.

245
00:17:56,719 --> 00:18:01,868
Let's now explore some consequences
of this large magnetic Reynolds number.

246
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:07,823
Let's suppose that the magnetic field
existed at the time when the Sun was born

247
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:10,536
and let's evaluate how long it would take

248
00:18:10,536 --> 00:18:13,349
for this field to decay
by magnetic diffusion.

249
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:19,176
We can compute the resistive
diffusion time in the following way

250
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:25,768
and we come up with a number
which is approximately 3. x 10¹¹ years.

251
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:30,155
This is an extremely long period of time,

252
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:35,517
much longer than the 11-years period
that we observe for the solar cycle.

253
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,166
This is suggesting
that a different mechanism,

254
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:45,915
other than simple resistive diffusion
is needed to generate the solar cycle.

255
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:49,710
One possibility is, of course,
that the magnetic field

256
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,475
is amplified by the plasma fluid motion,

257
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:55,306
such that the mechanical
energy of the flow

258
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:57,820
is transformed into magnetic energy.

259
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,692
In other words, we need a dynamo process.

260
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:03,420
Now we'll see how this could be possible.

261
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:07,623
For a large Magnetic Reynolds Numbers,

262
00:19:07,623 --> 00:19:09,905
we have just seen
that diffusion can be neglected

263
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:15,685
and this results in an important property
for the dynamic of the plasma.

264
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:20,325
You have seen in module 3
that under this condition,

265
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,944
the <i>frozen flux theorem</i> holds.

266
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:28,804
This implies that the magnetic flux
through any closed contour in the plasma,

267
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:32,922
each element of which moves
with the local plasma velocity,

268
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,579
is a conserved quantity.

269
00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:37,935
This, in turn, implies

270
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:41,045
that the magnetic field lines
must move with the plasma.

271
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:45,401
In other words, the field lines
are frozen in the plasma.

272
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:50,213
Let's now consider a flux tube

273
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:54,598
which is defined as
a topologically cylindrical volume

274
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:57,790
whose sides are defined
by the magnetic field lines.

275
00:19:58,372 --> 00:20:04,309
Let's suppose that this flux tube
is embedded into a plasma

276
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:07,128
which has a huge magnetic Reynolds number.

277
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:12,234
Let's suppose that now the plasma moves

278
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:16,506
with a sheared velocity field
perpendicular to the flux tube.

279
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:19,263
As a result of this motion,

280
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:22,782
since the magnetic field lines
are frozen into the plasma,

281
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:25,683
the magnetic flux tube will be deformed.

282
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:28,974
Let's suppose that the flux tube

283
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:33,172
is characterized by a plasma
with particle density ρ.

284
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:39,055
During its motion, the flux through
the surface dS must be conserved,

285
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:43,472
since the magnetic field
is frozen into the plasma

286
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:45,731
and the frozen flux theory holds.

287
00:20:45,731 --> 00:20:46,996
At the same time,

288
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,639
the total number of particles
is also conserved during the motion

289
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:53,472
and the total number of particles
can be expressed in this way.

290
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:56,834
Putting together these two formulae
we obtain that the magnetic field

291
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:00,688
is proportional
to the length of the flux tube.

292
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:05,438
The important result of this formula
is that the magnetic field

293
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:09,565
can be amplified by stretching
a flux tube or a field line

294
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:12,603
when the magnetic Reynolds number
is much larger than one.

295
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:19,852
With these ingredients, let's now
come back to the Sun

296
00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:24,356
and let's see how the first step
of a solar dynamo may work.

297
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,964
In this figure, the inner sphere

298
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:29,929
identifies the position
of the tachocline region

299
00:21:30,113 --> 00:21:34,205
where the solar toroidal rotation
has a strong velocity shear.

300
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:40,584
The Sun rotates in this direction,
and the North is indicated by this arrow.

301
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,518
Let's start with a poloidal magnetic field

302
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:47,587
which is oriented in the meridian plane
as shown here.

303
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,072
This field could be, for example,
a primordial magnetic field

304
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:52,722
when the Sun was born.

305
00:21:52,722 --> 00:21:55,559
This is the initial state of our Sun.

306
00:21:56,236 --> 00:22:00,179
Let's see what happens
after one toroidal rotation.

307
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:03,342
Two ingredients are important here:

308
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:08,041
the first ingredient is a huge
magnetic Reynolds number

309
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:12,444
and the second ingredient
is a sheared toroidal rotation

310
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:16,455
with the equator of the Sun
spinning faster than the poles of the Sun.

311
00:22:17,522 --> 00:22:20,754
Due to the huge magnetic Reynolds number,

312
00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:25,246
the magnetic field lines
are frozen in the plasma motion.

313
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:30,635
Therefore, since the plasma motion
has a sheared toroidal rotation

314
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:34,623
the magnetic field line
will be deformed in the following way

315
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:38,720
being stretched more at the Equator
than at the Poles.

316
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:45,268
After two rotations, this stretching effect
at the Equator will be amplified

317
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:48,320
and the magnetic field line
will look like this.

318
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:55,039
The process will go on,
and after three rotations,

319
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,932
the magnetic field line
may look like this one.

320
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:06,700
After many rotations, the magnetic
field lines will look like this one

321
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:12,308
where the original poloidal magnetic field
is now transformed

322
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:17,931
in a magnetic field line which is almost
completely toroidal near the equator.

323
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:26,262
The first result of this process
is that a toroidal magnetic field

324
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:29,217
is generated from a poloidal one.

325
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,806
The second important result

326
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:40,455
is obtained by observing
that the original magnetic field line

327
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:44,208
has been stretched
by the sheared flow in the plasma.

328
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:48,627
As a consequence,
the magnetic field is amplified

329
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,147
due to the frozen flux theorem.

330
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:58,857
This effect of toroidal magnetic field
generation from a poloidal magnetic field

331
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:04,118
and the subsequent intensification
of the toroidal magnetic field

332
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:07,699
is usually referred to
as the <i>Omega Effect</i> [Ω-effect],

333
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:12,990
and this is a well established process
in the solar dynamo physics.

334
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:18,421
Now to complete the cycle,
we need a mechanism that allows us

335
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:22,972
to convert a toroidal magnetic field
into a poloidal one.

336
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:25,809
This mechanism is less clear,

337
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:31,141
and one possible solution
is the so-called <i>Alpha Effect</i> [α-effect].

338
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:39,931
The main idea of the α-effect
was originated by Parker in 1955.

339
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:45,421
The main idea is that a turbulent flow
which has particular features

340
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:49,385
can twist a toroidal field line
into a poloidal one.

341
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,440
For example, if you have

342
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,641
a convection of plasma
in a rotating frame,

343
00:24:54,811 --> 00:24:57,090
this can generate turbulence

344
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,445
which is characterized by
a non-zero fluid helicity.

345
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:07,456
The turbulent flow can look
like corkscrew vortices

346
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:13,225
with an unequal number of right-handed
vortices and left-handed vortices.

347
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,915
Let's now consider a magnetic field line
that is immersed in a plasma

348
00:25:18,915 --> 00:25:22,675
that exhibits
such a complex cyclonic flow.

349
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:28,891
These vortices can simply lift
the magnetic field line up,

350
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:30,995
and twist it.

351
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,871
In the contact point where now

352
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:39,226
two oppositely directed
magnetic field lines touch,

353
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:41,718
magnetic reconnection can happen.

354
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:46,852
We will talk in detail about magnetic
reconnection in the next module,

355
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:50,529
but for now just keep in mind
that reconnection allows

356
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:54,147
magnetic field lines to break
and change their topology.

357
00:25:55,864 --> 00:26:00,574
The magnetic field loop can eventually
detach from the original field line.

358
00:26:04,288 --> 00:26:09,038
Let's now consider an equatorial
magnetic field line

359
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:11,949
which is almost completely toroidal.

360
00:26:12,552 --> 00:26:16,323
If many of these detached loops
are produced,

361
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:21,581
by averaging over many
cyclonic events, turbulent events,

362
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:25,981
these can lead to the production
of a large-scale poloidal field.

363
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,221
This can be observed in this figure

364
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,724
where the combination
of many turbulent events

365
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:39,261
results in an equivalent generation
of a macroscopic toroidal current

366
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:43,638
which in turn would produce
a large-scale poloidal magnetic field.

367
00:26:44,822 --> 00:26:50,706
This mechanism has been formalized
in the mean-field electrodynamics.

368
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:59,209
An alternative and similar mechanism
to transform a toroidal magnetic field

369
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:04,703
back into a poloidal magnetic field
is the <i>Babcock-Leighton mechanism</i>.

370
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:08,735
It was originally developed in the 1960's

371
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:12,060
but for a long time it was obscured
by the success

372
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:17,842
of the mean-field electrodynamics
and the α-effect.

373
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:24,135
However, recently,
over the cycle 21st and 22nd,

374
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:29,011
the magnetograph provided evidence
that the polar field reversal

375
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:33,458
is triggered by the decay
of the magnetic field in the sunspots.

376
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:37,184
The first time, it was noted

377
00:27:37,184 --> 00:27:42,515
that the end result of the first stage
of the dynamo mechanism,

378
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:47,488
could result in magnetic field lines,
the so-called <i>Ω-loops</i>

379
00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:53,205
which are toroidally oriented,
which are extremely intense,

380
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,182
of the order of 10⁵ Gauss.

381
00:27:56,915 --> 00:28:01,508
If the toroidal magnetic field
in this field line is too strong,

382
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:05,636
it is likely that turbulence
cannot twist the magnetic field

383
00:28:05,636 --> 00:28:08,554
and this would reduce the dynamo effect.

384
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:10,590
This has produced, in recent years,

385
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,083
a revival of the Babcock-Leighton
mechanism.

386
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:20,293
To illustrate
the Babcock-Leighton mechanism,

387
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:25,051
let's consider the initial state
where only magnetic field lines,

388
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:27,997
which are poloidal,
are observed on the Sun

389
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,788
and they enter into the Sun
from the North Pole

390
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:35,078
and they exit from the Sun
in the South Pole.

391
00:28:35,787 --> 00:28:39,762
The Equator of the Sun
is indicated here by the red line.

392
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:43,962
As a result of the Ω-effect,

393
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:50,417
we end up during the first stage
of the dynamo process with Ω-loops

394
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:55,022
which are magnetic field lines
that are purely toroidal,

395
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:58,167
and they are oriented as shown here.

396
00:28:58,575 --> 00:29:02,012
In the Northern Hemisphere
the magnetic field

397
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:06,294
is directed in the direction
of the rotation of the Sun.

398
00:29:07,097 --> 00:29:09,322
In the Southern Hemisphere,

399
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,986
the magnetic field points
in the opposite direction.

400
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:17,839
As a result of the stretching
of the magnetic field lines,

401
00:29:18,332 --> 00:29:21,740
intense magnetic fields can be generated.

402
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,785
This gives rise to a buoyancy force

403
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:28,118
that we will describe in more detail
in the next module.

404
00:29:29,812 --> 00:29:33,526
In the region where the magnetic field
is particularly intense,

405
00:29:33,526 --> 00:29:37,790
the buoyancy force tends to lift
the magnetic flux tube

406
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:40,159
through the Sun's surface.

407
00:29:41,485 --> 00:29:44,443
By being lifted by the buoyancy force,

408
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:49,595
the magnetic flux tube
now can exit the surface of the Sun

409
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:51,530
forming two sunspots.

410
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:55,806
We also note that the polarity
of magnetic fields

411
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:58,936
in these two sunspots is inverted.

412
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,707
This inverted polarity in the sunspots
is consistent with Hale's Law,

413
00:30:03,707 --> 00:30:06,358
that we have seen in the previous module.

414
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:17,678
Under the effect of the upward motion
of the flux tube and the Coriolis force,

415
00:30:17,678 --> 00:30:22,115
the sunspot that is following

416
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:25,697
will experience a drift toward the Pole.

417
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:34,052
This upward drift produces a tilt between
the leading and the following sunspot

418
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:36,747
which is consistent with Joy's Law.

419
00:30:38,098 --> 00:30:42,196
The last step of this complex
dynamo mechanism

420
00:30:42,196 --> 00:30:45,727
involves the transport
of a decaying magnetic field

421
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:49,568
towards the <poles
by the meridional circulation.

422
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:54,942
Here the magnetic field in the sunspot
will eventually reverse the polarity

423
00:30:54,942 --> 00:30:57,484
of the pre-existing magnetic field.

424
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,263
Is this the end of the story?

425
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:04,429
Did we fully understand
the dynamo in the Sun?

426
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:07,184
The answer is, of course: no!

427
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:12,438
We have made a drastic simplification
of the MHD system of equations

428
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:18,974
by specifying <i>a priori</i> the form
of the flow field u

429
00:31:18,974 --> 00:31:22,429
and deriving the corresponding
magnetic field B.

430
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:27,153
We have tried to solve
the so-called <i>kinematic dynamo</i>.

431
00:31:27,882 --> 00:31:32,116
Although extremely simplified,
the kinematic dynamo problem

432
00:31:32,116 --> 00:31:34,845
has brought incredible results.

433
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:39,009
This is due to the fact
that thanks to helioseismology,

434
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:43,466
we know with good accuracy
the two large-scale flow components,

435
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:48,179
which are the differential rotation
inside the interior of the Sun

436
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:53,088
and meridional circulation
at the surface of the Sun.

437
00:31:54,694 --> 00:31:59,258
The real problem to be solved
is much tougher than the kinematic dynamo.

438
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:05,977
Together with the induction equation
we should use the equation of motion,

439
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:09,591
conservation of mass,
conservation of energy,

440
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:12,475
some equation of state,
and of course,

441
00:32:12,475 --> 00:32:18,671
all these should be coupled to initial
and specific boundary conditions.

442
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:24,711
This problem is obviously too difficult
to be solved analytically

443
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:28,937
and numerical simulations are needed
for the full dynamo problem.

444
00:32:30,268 --> 00:32:32,847
In this movie, what you're seeing

445
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:36,056
is the longitudinal component
of the magnetic field--

446
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:40,236
red corresponds to positive polarity
and blue to negative polarity--

447
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:43,408
in a global convecting dynamo simulation.

448
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,384
After cropping the sphere,

449
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:49,164
the time evolution shows
the two main dynamo ingredients,

450
00:32:49,164 --> 00:32:51,351
the Ω- and the α- effects.

451
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:58,159
The Ω-effect is linked to the shearing
of the large-scale differential rotation

452
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,926
and the α- effect is linked
to the twisting convective motion

453
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:05,932
that regenerates the poloidal
component of the field,

454
00:33:05,932 --> 00:33:07,918
hence closing the dynamo loop.

455
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:14,291
In the early 1900's, the famous scientist
Sir Larmor asked the question:

456
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:18,064
"How could a rotating body
such as the Sun become a magnet?"

457
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,199
Today we know that the answer
requires a dynamo process

458
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:26,200
that converts energy of the plasma flow
into magnetic energy.

459
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:30,850
In this module we have reviewed
the basis of kinematic dynamo

460
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,533
and showed that two ingredients
are key in this process:

461
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:37,765
the large magnetic Reynolds
number in the Sun,

462
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:41,848
which results in field lines
that are frozen to the plasma motion

463
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:45,903
and the presence of a complex
velocity field with differential rotation.

464
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:51,867
The Ω-effect allows the conversion
of a poloidal field into a toroidal one,

465
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:54,088
which is subsequently amplified.

466
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:59,079
Some sort of α-effect can then
convert it back into a poloidal field,

467
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:04,197
thus resulting in a cycle
that mimics the observed solar cycle.

468
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:09,670
While the dynamo plays a fundamental role
in the dynamics of the Sun,

469
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,985
the opposite process,
magnetic reconnection,

470
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:16,624
is also at play, creating
the most spectacular events in the Sun

471
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:18,725
such as the solar flares.

472
00:34:19,021 --> 00:34:21,529
This will be the subject
of the next module

473
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:25,737
in which I will describe
how magnetic flux tubes interact

474
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:27,554
and by reconnecting, they can transform

475
00:34:27,554 --> 00:34:31,279
energy of the magnetic field
into plasma kinetic energy.
