00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:10,271
Welcome back to the course on
Plasma Physics and Applications.

2
00:00:10,671 --> 00:00:14,570
The Sun is characterized
by the presence of magnetic fields.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,004
The origins of these magnetic fields
is a long-standing problem

4
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:23,169
not only for our Sun, but for other
astronomical bodies as well.

5
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:25,512
Today we believe 
that the magnetic fields

6
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:28,830
are generated by 
a hydrodynamic dynamo process

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,938
which converts energy of the plasma flow
into magnetic energy.

8
00:00:32,938 --> 00:00:36,391
In the course of this lecture
I will detail the dynamics

9
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:38,604
of the magnetic fields in the Sun.

10
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:42,106
In particular, I will discuss
the properties of the sunspots,

11
00:00:42,106 --> 00:00:45,483
the 11-years solar cycle,
and the overall structure

12
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:47,346
of the Sun's magnetic fields.

13
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:49,994
This phenomenology
is particularly important

14
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:54,575
in solar physics since it can be
directly extracted from observations

15
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:57,585
and also because it provides 
experimental data

16
00:00:57,585 --> 00:01:00,148
the dynamo theory 
and the numerical simulation

17
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:03,470
must reproduce 
in order to be successful.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,279
The most striking manifestation
of the solar activity are sunspots.

19
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,637
They are dark patches on the sun

20
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:16,100
where intense magnetic fields 
emerge from the interior

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,506
through the surface.

22
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:24,734
The earliest recording of sunspots
are from China over 2,000 years ago.

23
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:28,720
The first European observation 
was made by Galileo Galilei

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,684
with his famous telescope in 1610.

25
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:35,632
In this figure you can see
a huge group of sunspots

26
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:38,467
as observed by the SOHO satellite.

27
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:44,548
On March 30, 2001, the area spanned
by this sunspot group

28
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:48,101
was larger than 13 times
the entire surface of the earth.

29
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:51,451
This group was the source
of numerous flares

30
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:53,461
and coronal mass ejections

31
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:58,027
including the largest flare 
recorded in 25 years.

32
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:02,047
The first observations 
of the solar cycle

33
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:05,541
were made by the astronomer, 
Samuel Schwabe.

34
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:08,686
He made an impressive 
number of drawings,

35
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:15,159
approximately 10,000,
of sunspots from 1825 to 1867.

36
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,461
Using these drawings, 
he observed that the number of sunspots

37
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:23,881
exhibits a period 
of approximately 10 years.

38
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:29,541
It was in 1848 that the modern,
daily observation of the sun started,

39
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:34,069
with Rudolph Wolf at 
the Bern observatory in Switzerland

40
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,777
and later in ZÃ¼rich.

41
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:41,396
Wolf noticed that it is much easier 
to identify sunspot groups

42
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:44,566
than each individual sunspot on the Sun.

43
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:48,378
He then defined a relative 
sunspot number,

44
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:54,078
R = k (10g + n).

45
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:59,772
Here k is a correction factor 
that takes into account

46
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:03,977
that sunspots can be observed
by different observers.

47
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:08,487
g is the number 
of identified spot groups.

48
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:16,017
and n identifies the number
of individual sunspots.

49
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:22,455
Wolf was the primary observer
between 1848 and 1893

50
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:26,980
and had a personal
correction factor of k = 1.

51
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:34,052
He also extended the data back to 1749
using primary, indirect observer.

52
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,777
The Swiss Federal Observatory
continued the monitoring

53
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:41,423
of the sunspot number through 1980,

54
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:45,980
and then the Royal Observatory of Belgium
took over as the primary observer

55
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,198
and the International Sunspot number 
was defined by averaging all the numbers

56
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,649
provided by many observers.

57
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,964
Today, International Sunspot 
numbers are provided

58
00:03:57,964 --> 00:04:01,776
by the Solar Influences 
Data Analysis Center (SIDC).

59
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:08,670
The International Sunspot number
is the key indicator for solar activity.

60
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,875
It provides very long-time series
with many data available,

61
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,117
to trace back solar activity.

62
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:18,467
This plot illustrates
the International Sunspot number

63
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,914
during the different solar cycles.

64
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:24,920
Sunspot numbers are usually given
as daily numbers,

65
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,066
monthly averages, yearly averages
and smoothed numbers

66
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,901
to get rid of the noise 
present in the data

67
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:35,079
that you can also
observe in this figure.

68
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,415
Solar maxima and minima
are identified in terms

69
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:40,656
of these smoothed numbers.

70
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:44,557
We can observe from this figure
that the sunspot number

71
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:47,873
varies in amplitude, time, shape,
and also length.

72
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:55,457
Each solar cycle is defined
as the period between two minima

73
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:58,156
of the International Sunspot number.

74
00:04:58,156 --> 00:05:01,567
For example, if we consider 
these two minima

75
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,825
in October, 1964 and March, 1976,

76
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:11,836
these two minima identify
the solar cycle number 20.

77
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:16,192
In this solar cycle,
the maximum of activity

78
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:20,133
was reached in November, 1968.

79
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:25,564
The period of the sunspot cycle
is defined as the time elapsed

80
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:28,407
between these two minima of activity.

81
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:34,514
For example, for the solar cycle 20,
it was 136 months

82
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:40,632
which corresponds 
approximately to 11 years.

83
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:43,706
If we consider all the solar cycles

84
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:47,415
and we take the average
of the solar period,

85
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:54,499
we obtain approximately 131.7 months,
almost exactly 11 years.

86
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:57,999
This is the so called 11-years solar cycle

87
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:01,229
which is telling us 
that the sun goes through phases

88
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:04,516
of maximum and minimum activity
with an average period

89
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:07,016
of approximately 11 years.

90
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:13,019
Let's now have a closer look
at an individual sunspots.

91
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:20,042
This is an example of an enormous sunspot
which is labeled AR1944

92
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:26,565
which slipped into the view over the Sun
late on January 1, 2014.

93
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:32,209
You can see on this picture
the projected approximate size of the earth

94
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:36,174
which gives you an idea
of the size of this sunspot.

95
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,852
You can also observe
that the sunspot

96
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:41,384
has two distinct regions.

97
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:43,233
One darker region,

98
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:47,327
this dark region is called <i>umbra</i>,

99
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,519
and one brighter region
surrounding the umbra

100
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,439
which is called <i>penumbra</i>.

101
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:02,043
If we look at the umbra,
we can define an area for this region.

102
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:09,450
Conventionally, the area of the sunspot
is given in terms of percentage

103
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,972
that the sunspot occupies
of the hemisphere of the Sun.

104
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:19,472
If we assume that this line identifies
the position of the equator of the Sun,

105
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:28,934
we can also identify 
the position of the sunspot

106
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:32,797
in terms of the latitude.

107
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:40,074
Actually the area and the position 
on the surface of the sun

108
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:43,295
of every single sunspot,
or group of sunspots,

109
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:46,626
has been recorded since 1847.

110
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:53,252
The Sun rotates with a 27-days period.

111
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:56,496
And the sunspot
and groups of sunspots,

112
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:58,676
move together with the Sun.

113
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:06,708
The sunspot rotation is shown
in this movie that was recorded

114
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:10,737
by the SOHO satellite in 2001.

115
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:14,132
During the rotation, 
the sunspots exhibit the dynamics

116
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,936
and they change their position
on the sun surface,

117
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:19,117
their shape and their size.

118
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,968
The position of the sunspots
in terms of their latitude

119
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:30,499
has been recorded 
and a clear trend emerged.

120
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:33,844
This plot shows the distribution 
of the sunspot area

121
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:38,614
as a function of the latitude 
of the sun during each cycle.

122
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:43,169
The yellow color indicates 
large sunspots

123
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,282
that have an area 
which is larger than 1%

124
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:49,703
of the hemisphere where
the sunspot is located.

125
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:55,634
Dark colors identify 
sunspots that are smaller.

126
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:59,774
The bottom plot shows the sunspot area

127
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:03,923
and allows us to identify
each individual solar cycle

128
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:06,241
by looking at the minima.

129
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:11,694
In this figure, the central line
identifies the equator of the Sun.

130
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,809
If we look for example
at the solar cycle number 19,

131
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:21,103
we can see that at
the beginning of the cycle

132
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:26,437
the sunspots appear in two bands
on either side of the Sun's equator

133
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:30,793
for latitudes that are slightly larger
than 25-30 degrees.

134
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:35,344
As the cycle progresses
the range of latitudes increases

135
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:39,358
and the central latitude 
drifts towards smaller values.

136
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:44,418
However, you should note 
that the corridor near the equator

137
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,138
is always free from sunspots.

138
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:51,907
This behavior is referred
to as <i>SpÃ¶rer's law of zones</i>

139
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:56,149
and it was famously illustrated
by Maunder in 1904,

140
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,310
in his Butterfly Diagram.

141
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,293
Let's now come to the first observation
of magnetic fields in the Sun.

142
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:11,029
They were first observed by Hale in 1908.

143
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:15,079
He used spectral observation
on a number of spectral liness

144
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:16,850
emitted from sunspots,

145
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,018
and he noted that in some lines it was
possible to detect Zeeman's splitting

146
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:24,739
that could only be due to the presence 
of strong magnetic fields.

147
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:29,140
Typical magnetic fields 
that he measured on large sunspots

148
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,478
were of the order of 0.3 Tesla.

149
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:37,595
About 10 years later,
he made observations

150
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:41,770
that resulted in what is now called 
the <i>Hale's polarity law</i>.

151
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,538
Hale's polarity law 
is illustrated in this picture

152
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:53,726
which shows a magnetogram
from the cycle 22 on August 2, 1989.

153
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:57,342
The blue color identifies 
magnetic field lines

154
00:10:57,342 --> 00:11:01,182
that are pointing away from the Sun.

155
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:03,361
The yellow color identifies 
magnetic fields

156
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,021
that are entering into the Sun.

157
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:08,920
The Sun rotates in this direction,

158
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,165
and if we consider 
the Northern hemisphere,

159
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:16,682
we can clearly identify 
binary groups of sunspots.

160
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:20,728
For example, in this particular 
binary group,

161
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:23,732
we can see in blue a preceding sunspot,

162
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:26,521
and in yellow a following sunspot.

163
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:30,404
They are defined as preceding or following

164
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:35,379
with respect to the rotation 
of the sun indicated here.

165
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:41,019
The Hale's polarity law
for this particular cycle

166
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,961
tells us that in the Northern hemisphere

167
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:46,888
the magnetic field in 
the preceding sunspot

168
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:49,277
is pointing away from the Sun

169
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:53,455
while it's pointing towards the Sun
in the following sunspot.

170
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:03,841
We can now look 
at the Southern hemisphere

171
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:07,787
and identify the corresponding 
binary group of sunspots

172
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:09,694
shown here in red.

173
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:13,683
The polarity of the magnetic field

174
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:17,192
is now reversed with respect
to the Northern hemisphere

175
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:21,395
in the sense, that the magnetic field
in the preceding sunspot

176
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:23,495
points towards the Sun

177
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:26,322
while the following sunspot
has a magnetic field

178
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:28,737
that points away from the Sun.

179
00:12:32,487 --> 00:12:36,591
This illustrates Hale's polarity law

180
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:40,491
that was formulated in 1919.

181
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:46,585
If we now look at the following cycle,
the cycle number 23,

182
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:52,788
we see here a magnetogram
that was registered on June 26, 2000,

183
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:56,029
the polarity of the sunspot 
is now reversed

184
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:59,479
with respect to the previous cycle.

185
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:04,584
In the sense that in
the Northern hemisphere

186
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:09,662
now the preceding sunspot
has a magnetic field that points inward

187
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:13,817
while in the Southern hemisphere,
the preceding sunspot

188
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:16,823
has a magnetic field that points outward.

189
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:20,423
In the same year, Joy,
made the following observation

190
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:23,187
that the preceding spot in a binary group

191
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:26,504
is closer to the solar equator
in both hemispheres.

192
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:31,180
This can be observed 
by looking at the following

193
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,507
binary group of sunspots
where we can observe

194
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:38,728
that the distance of
the leading sunspots in yellow,

195
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:42,555
is slightly smaller than the distance
of the following sunspot.

196
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:47,268
So for example in this sketch here,

197
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:51,359
if we look at the preceding sunspot
in the Northern hemisphere,

198
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:55,627
and the corresponding preceding sunspot
in the Southern hemisphere,

199
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:59,665
their magnetic fields are pointing
in opposite directions.

200
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:04,680
Similarly, following sunspots
have opposite polarities

201
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,665
in the two hemispheres.

202
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:11,802
Joy's law states, 
that the preceding sunspot

203
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:17,452
in a bipolar group is closer 
to the solar equator in both hemispheres.

204
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:23,058
This is shown here, where the distance 
of the preceding sunspot from the equator,

205
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:25,463
is indicated by dp,

206
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:31,253
and it is smaller than the distance
of the following sunspot indicated by df.

207
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,538
The same is true for both hemispheres.

208
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:41,939
If we now look at the solar cycle

209
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:45,749
before the one that we
have just considered,

210
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:49,579
we notice that the polarity seen
by bipolar groups of sunspots

211
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:52,139
reverses between the two solar cycles.

212
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:56,279
This observation taken together
with the Maunder Butterfly Diagram

213
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:02,492
means that higher latitude bipolar groups
emerging as the new cycle begins

214
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:06,906
have opposite ordering of polarities
to the last bipolar group

215
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,685
of the previous cycle.

216
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:13,169
These laws are and have remained
important observational building blocks

217
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:16,370
of theories of the solar cycles.

218
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:24,257
In 1955, the magnetogram 
was invented by Babcock.

219
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:28,953
It became thus possible
to measure magnetic fields much weaker

220
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:31,283
than those that were observed previously

221
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:34,601
in solar sunspots 
near the poles of the Sun.

222
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:39,188
Typical polar fields
are of the order of 10 Gauss.

223
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:46,047
These polar fields are much smaller
than those observed in sunspots

224
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:50,298
that are of the order of 0.1-0.3 Tesla.

225
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:55,908
At the time of minimum activity,
which is shown in this picture here,

226
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:59,690
the magnetic field of the sun
is close to a dipole

227
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,878
with magnetic field lines
that for example,

228
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,098
exit the North Pole 
and enter the South Pole

229
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,547
for a specific solar cycle.

230
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:11,230
Near the equator 
the field lines are closed

231
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,580
and connect approximately 
one hemisphere to the other.

232
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,027
During the evolution of a solar cycle,
the magnetic field changes dynamically.

233
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:24,695
During maximum activity, 
at the solar maximum

234
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:27,258
which is shown in this picture here,

235
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:30,353
the magnetic field is multipolar

236
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:35,267
with intense magnetic fields
that connect neighboring sunspots.

237
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,956
Going through the following period
of minimum activity

238
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,540
the magnetic field
is again close to a dipole

239
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,806
but now with a reverse polarity,

240
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:46,967
with magnetic fields that now 
exit the South Pole

241
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,984
and enter the North Pole.

242
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:52,236
Over this period, 
the overall configuration

243
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:55,877
of the Sun's magnetic field
has reversed its polarity.

244
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:02,413
The magnetic field reversal in the sun
is shown by this movie

245
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:05,549
that shows the evolution 
of the Sun's magnetic field

246
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:08,470
from 1997 to 2013.

247
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,035
The magnetic field in this animation

248
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:13,984
is reconstructed using a model 
that takes as inputs

249
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:17,174
the solar magnetogram 
as the source surface

250
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:19,331
of the magnetic field at each time.

251
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:22,650
The model then builds the field structure
from the photosphere

252
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,278
out to approximately two solar radii.

253
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:30,789
The white magnetic field lines
are magnetic field lines that are closed.

254
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:35,245
They move up and then return
to the solar surface.

255
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:40,089
The green and violet lines
represent field lines that are open.

256
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:43,481
Green lines represent
positive magnetic polarity,

257
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:46,481
and violet lines represent 
negative polarity.

258
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:49,081
These field lines do not connect 
back to the sun

259
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:52,017
but with more distant
magnetic fields in space.

260
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:55,801
You should note that the polarity 
of the magnetic field

261
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:58,600
is reversed from the beginning 
of a solar period

262
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,222
to the end of the same solar period.

263
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:04,533
In this module we have learned

264
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:07,583
that the Sun is an extremely 
dynamic object.

265
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:11,275
On its surface, sunspots 
with intense magnetic fields

266
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:14,972
form and die with a period
of approximately 11 years

267
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:17,802
and following precise empirical laws.

268
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:22,283
Over an entire solar cycle
the magnetic field reverses its polarity.

269
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:25,679
These experimental observations
are particularly important

270
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,719
since they provide hints
at possible mechanisms

271
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:31,176
behind the generation
of magnetic fields.

272
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:35,758
Any proposed mechanism should be able 
to reproduce these observations.

273
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:40,553
In the next module we will describe
how the hydrodynamic dynamo process

274
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,205
can be at the origin 
of solar magnetic fields.
