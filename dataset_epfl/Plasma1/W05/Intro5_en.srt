00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,774
In this module on Plasma Astrophysics

2
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:05,277
we will discover how fusion energy
powers our Sun,

3
00:00:05,663 --> 00:00:09,705
a nuclear reactor that confines plasma
by its own gravitational pull.

4
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:13,923
We will dive into the intricate structure
of the solar magnetic field

5
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:17,091
and discover that at its origin
is a diamond process

6
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:20,261
that converts energy of the plasma flow
into magnetic energy.

7
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:24,876
Magnetic fields are concentrated
in three dimensional flux ropes

8
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:27,394
that interact via magnetic reconnection,

9
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,339
converting a large fraction
of the magnetic field energy

10
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:32,631
into plasma heating
and particle acceleration.

11
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:36,354
This, in fact, is at the core
of the most powerful events on the Sun,

12
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,832
the <i>corona mass ejections</i>,

13
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:41,521
which generate
spectacular auroras on Earth.

14
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:46,524
Solar wind blows from the hot
plasma atmosphere around the Sun,

15
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:51,080
which, although distant from us,
shapes the magnetosphere around the Earth.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,769
All of these fascinating themes
will be discussed

17
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:58,749
using the basics of plasma physics
that you have learned in previous modules.

18
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:01,201
A lecture will be given by Dr. Ivo Furno,

19
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:04,369
head of the Basic Plasma Physics
and Applications Group at CRPP.
