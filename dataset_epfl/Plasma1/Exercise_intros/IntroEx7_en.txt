Welcome to the exercises for the seventh week of the course on plasma physics and applications.
In the first exercise of this week, we ask you to calculate and compare the energy released in chemical reactions, in fission reactions, and in fusion reactions.
This practical example illustrates nicely the energy densities related to the different processes.
In the second exercise, you will apply important concepts such as energy confinement time and fusion gain in a practical example.
Finally, in the last exercise of this week, we will look at parameters related to a hypothetical inertial fusion power plant.
I wish you good luck.
