00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:03,055
Welcome to the exercises
for week nine of the course on

2
00:00:03,055 --> 00:00:05,109
Plasma Physics and Applications.

3
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:07,117
In the first exercise of this week,

4
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:10,454
we will estimate the OMA heating 
power expected in ITER

5
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:14,299
and demonstrate the need
for additional external heating schemes.

6
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:17,641
We will then specifically look
at electron cycles of heating

7
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:19,571
in the second exercise.

8
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:23,283
You will familiarize yourself
with the CMA diagram,

9
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:27,558
a very useful tool to evaluate
the accessibility of various methods

10
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:30,318
of electron cycles and wave heating.

11
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:34,051
Finally, in the last exercise,
you will derive the conditions

12
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,520
for so called runaway electrons.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,179
Runaway electrons occur
if the collisional drag on the electron

14
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:43,191
is weaker than 
the accelerating electric field

15
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:46,368
and can result in very
high-energy beams of electrons

16
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:49,386
which are a concern 
for a fusion reactor.

17
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:50,766
I wish you good luck.
