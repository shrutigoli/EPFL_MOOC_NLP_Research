00:00:00,482 --> 00:00:02,742
Welcome to the exercises
for the fourth week

2
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:05,460
of the course on
Plasma Physics and Applications.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,040
During this week's lectures
you have seen examples

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,942
of static ideal MHD equilibria.

5
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:14,281
You saw that the simplest case
is the force free equilibrium

6
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:18,911
where the plasma Beta is so low
that the pressure term can be neglected

7
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:21,087
in the force balanced equation.

8
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,968
An example of such force free equilibria

9
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:26,708
are these impressive magnetic flux tubes

10
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,097
which can be observed
on the surface of the Sun.

11
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:33,192
In the first exercise you will derive
an interesting relation

12
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:36,456
between magnetic field
and current in this equilibria.

13
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,132
You have also derived the waves

14
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:42,661
which can occur
in a uniform ideal MHD plasma,

15
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:44,885
namely the sheer alpha-n wave,

16
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,248
the fast compressional alpha-n wave,

17
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:49,142
and the slow magnetosonic wave.

18
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:53,281
Two velocities appear in the dispersion
relations of these waves,

19
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:55,442
the alpha-n velocity and the sound speed.

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,902
In the second exercise this week
we ask you to calculate these quantities

21
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:01,845
for a fusion plasma.

22
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:05,333
Finally, in the last exercise of this week

23
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:09,280
we will develop a more intuitive
understanding of the shear alpha-n wave.

24
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:14,537
You will see that in shear alpha-n waves
the magnetic field lines vibrate

25
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:16,970
just like the strings of a guitar.

26
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,237
In an ungraded bonus part,
you will furthermore show

27
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:24,372
that the plasma perfectly follows
these oscillations of the field lines

28
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:27,347
as if the particles
were stuck to the field lines.

29
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:28,927
I wish you good luck.
