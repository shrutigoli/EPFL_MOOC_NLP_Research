Welcome to the exercises for the sixth week of the course on plasma physics and applications.
You have seen that in industrial plasma processing we are dealing with low-temperature, non-equilibrium plasmas where electrons are hotter than the ions and the neutral gas.
Without proof, mathematical expressions were used in the lecture which stated that electrons are very inefficient in transferring kinetic energy to the ions to heat them but that they can transfer almost all of their energy to excite the atoms or break chemical bonds.
These facts are really key to why high-temperature plasma chemistry is possible on low-temperature substrates and deriving them is the subject of the first exercise of this week.
The second exercise deals with Paschen's law for plasma breakdown.
You will apply this law to determine for a simple geometry at what neutral gas pressure a plasma can be generated most easily.
Finally, the last exercise of this week focuses on the sheath that forms at the transition between plasma and wall.
I wish you good luck.
