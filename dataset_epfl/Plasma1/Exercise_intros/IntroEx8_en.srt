00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:02,469
Welcome to the exercises for week eight

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,658
of the course on
Plasma Physics and Applications.

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:07,686
In the first exercise of this week
we will look

4
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:11,254
at some engineering parameters
of a specific tokamak:

5
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:13,634
the TCV device here at EPFL.

6
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:18,576
In particular you'll estimate the currents
flowing in the magnetic field coils

7
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:20,735
and the forces acting on them,

8
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:24,008
and develop an understanding
of the TCV support structures

9
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:26,736
designed to control these forces.

10
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:29,576
In the second exercise,
we will look at the issue

11
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,930
of the control of a burning plasma,

12
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,294
which, with the tools you have acquired,

13
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:35,879
you will be able to assess.

14
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:37,674
I wish you good luck.
