00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:02,600
Welcome to the exercises 
for the sixth week

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,901
of the course on plasma physics
and applications.

3
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:08,187
You have seen that
in industrial plasma processing

4
00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:11,957
we are dealing with low-temperature,
non-equilibrium plasmas

5
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:15,431
where electrons are hotter
than the ions and the neutral gas.

6
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:19,371
Without proof, mathematical expressions
were used in the lecture

7
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:22,122
which stated that electrons
are very inefficient

8
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,622
in transferring kinetic energy
to the ions to heat them

9
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:28,602
but that they can transfer
almost all of their energy

10
00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:31,410
to excite the atoms
or break chemical bonds.

11
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:35,809
These facts are really key
to why high-temperature plasma chemistry

12
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:40,113
is possible on low-temperature substrates
and deriving them is the subject

13
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:42,011
of the first exercise of this week.

14
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,799
The second exercise deals
with Paschen's law for plasma breakdown.

15
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:50,665
You will apply this law to determine
for a simple geometry

16
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:54,986
at what neutral gas pressure a plasma
can be generated most easily.

17
00:00:55,874 --> 00:01:00,663
Finally, the last exercise of this week
focuses on the sheath that forms

18
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:03,085
at the transition 
between plasma and wall.

19
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:04,973
I wish you good luck.
