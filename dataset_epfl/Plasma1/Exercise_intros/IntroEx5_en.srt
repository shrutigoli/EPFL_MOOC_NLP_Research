00:00:00,241 --> 00:00:02,437
Welcome to the exercises
for the fifth week

2
00:00:02,437 --> 00:00:04,820
of the course on plasma physics
and applications.

3
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:09,617
You have seen that the sun is a huge,
gravitationally confined fusion reactor.

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:13,235
In the first exercise of this week,
we ask you to compute

5
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:17,027
some quantities that illustrate
how powerful the sun actually is.

6
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:22,308
In the second exercise, you will describe
the process of a magnetic flux tube

7
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:26,158
that rises through the surface
of the sun due to magnetic buoyancy.

8
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:30,388
We then consider a situation
where this flux tube collides

9
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:33,091
with another flux tube
of opposite magnetic field.

10
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:37,557
Your task will be to analyze
the resulting reconnection process

11
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:41,833
using the Sweet-Parker Model
and discuss the validity of this approach.

12
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:43,413
I wish you good luck.
