00:00:00,347 --> 00:00:02,413
Welcome to the exercises
for the third week

2
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:04,686
of the course on plasma physics
and applications.

3
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:07,465
During this week's lectures,
you have learned

4
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:10,999
about the waves which can exist
in a cold uniform plasma

5
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:12,681
with a constant magnetic field.

6
00:00:13,153 --> 00:00:16,435
In the first exercise this week,
you will include the effect

7
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:19,389
of collisions in case
of an unmagnetized plasma

8
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:22,934
and determine how this changes
the dynamics of the plasma waves.

9
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:28,267
You now also have all the prerequisites
to derive an interesting phenomenon

10
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:29,742
called Faraday rotation.

11
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:35,522
It occurs if an electromagnetic wave
propagates through a magnetized plasma

12
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:38,814
and this will be the topic
of the second exercise of this week.

13
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:40,754
I wish you good luck.
