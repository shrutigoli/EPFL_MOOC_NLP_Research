1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
In the first exercise of this week
we will look

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,240
at some engineering parameters
of a specific tokamak:

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,620
the TCV device here at EPFL.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,560
In particular you'll estimate the currents
flowing in the magnetic field coils

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,720
and the forces acting on them,

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,990
and develop an understanding
of the TCV support structures

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,720
designed to control these forces.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,560
In the second exercise,
we will look at the issue

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,920
of the control of a burning plasma,

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,280
which, with the tools you have acquired,

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,860
you will be able to assess.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,660
I wish you good luck.
