00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,629
Hello, my name is Christian Theiler

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:05,682
and I'm a EUROfusion 
postdoctoral fellow at EPFL.

3
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:08,993
I would like to welcome you
to the exercises for the first week

4
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:11,889
of this course on plasma physics
and applications.

5
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:14,578
These weekly exercises 
are essential for you

6
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:16,502
to obtain the course certificate,

7
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:19,494
and to consolidate 
your advancement in the course.

8
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:23,783
For an overview of your progress
please look at the progress tab.

9
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:26,741
As you have seen,
plasma temperature and density

10
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:29,485
range over many orders of magnitude.

11
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:31,672
In the first exercise of this week,

12
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:36,074
we will review some examples 
of plasmas in nature and in laboratory.

13
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:39,553
You will calculate some 
of their most important parameters

14
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:42,131
and acquire a feeling 
of the main quantities

15
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:45,949
that play a role in plasma dynamics,
their order of magnitude,

16
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:47,897
and of how different plasmas can be.

17
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:52,267
You have probably already looked
at the introduction to MATLAB videos

18
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,699
and used the option 
to download MATLAB for free

19
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:56,367
on your PC or Mac.

20
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:01,028
This course gives you the possibility 
to acquire the basics of MATLAB,

21
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,470
a very useful tool in general.

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,760
For this first exercise we provide you 
with an empty MATLAB code box.

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,897
You can use it to evaluate
simple MATLAB expressions,

24
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:13,859
and to make calculations
in this first exercise.

25
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:16,732
In the second exercise of this week,

26
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:19,159
you will determine how
the temperature and the volume

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,402
of a magnetized plasma vary,

28
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:25,044
when the strength of the embedded 
magnetic field changes.

29
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,069
You will need to use 
the E x B drift

30
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:29,679
and the conservation 
of the magnetic moment.

31
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:32,217
This exercise involves several steps.

32
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,625
If you are stuck somewhere, 
don't give up.

33
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:37,478
If you can't find the result
for one of the steps,

34
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:39,626
you can still attack 
the subsequent ones

35
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:42,099
by using the solution we provide.

36
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,634
I wish you good luck.
