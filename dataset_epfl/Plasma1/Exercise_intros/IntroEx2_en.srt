00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,615
Welcome to the exercises
for the second week

2
00:00:02,615 --> 00:00:05,321
of the course on 
plasma physics and applications.

3
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:08,113
In this week's exercises
we will look in more detail

4
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:11,457
at the connected description
of the two-stream instability

5
00:00:11,457 --> 00:00:13,945
that is the instability that develops

6
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:16,852
when two counterstreaming
beams interact.

7
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:20,540
You will first study the linear 
stability criteria of this problem

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,759
and use [unclear] to plot
the dispersion relation.

9
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:26,403
You will then run a particle-in-cell code

10
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:29,984
to calculate the nonlinear 
evolution of this instability

11
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:34,471
and you will compare the results
with the linear stability calculation.

12
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,766
As part of a bonus exercise,

13
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:40,051
you will then have access
to the entire particle-in-cell code

14
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:43,863
with the goal of calculating 
the time evolution of the momentum

15
00:00:43,863 --> 00:00:46,111
and of the total energy of the system.

16
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:49,636
If you are really stuck somewhere,
after the final submission,

17
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:51,366
you can look at the solution.

18
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:55,280
This should then allow you to continue
with the rest of the exercise.

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,641
I wish you good luck.
