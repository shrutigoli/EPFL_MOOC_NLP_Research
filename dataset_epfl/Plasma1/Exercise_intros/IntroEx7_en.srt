00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:02,326
Welcome to the exercises
for the seventh week

2
00:00:02,326 --> 00:00:04,817
of the course on plasma physics
and applications.

3
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:08,721
In the first exercise of this week,
we ask you to calculate and compare

4
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:11,277
the energy released in chemical reactions,

5
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,060
in fission reactions,
and in fusion reactions.

6
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:17,964
This practical example illustrates nicely
the energy densities

7
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:19,984
related to the different processes.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,187
In the second exercise, 
you will apply important concepts

9
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:28,292
such as energy confinement time
and fusion gain in a practical example.

10
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:32,754
Finally, in the last exercise
of this week, we will look at parameters

11
00:00:32,754 --> 00:00:36,305
related to a hypothetical inertial 
fusion power plant.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,174
I wish you good luck.
