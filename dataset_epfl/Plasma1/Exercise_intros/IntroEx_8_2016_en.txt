In the first exercise of this week we will look at some engineering parameters of a specific tokamak: the TCV device here at EPFL.
In particular you'll estimate the currents flowing in the magnetic field coils and the forces acting on them, and develop an understanding of the TCV support structures designed to control these forces.
In the second exercise, we will look at the issue of the control of a burning plasma, which, with the tools you have acquired, you will be able to assess.
I wish you good luck.
