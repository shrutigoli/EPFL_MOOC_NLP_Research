In the first exercise of this week, we will estimate the OMA heating power expected in ITER and demonstrate the need for additional external heating schemes.
We will then specifically look at electron cycles of heating in the second exercise.
You will familiarize yourself with the CMA diagram, a very useful tool to evaluate the accessibility of various methods of electron cycles and wave heating.
Finally, in the last exercise, you will derive the conditions for so called runaway electrons.
Runaway electrons occur if the collisional drag on the electron is weaker than the accelerating electric field and can result in very high-energy beams of electrons which are a concern for a fusion reactor.
I wish you good luck.
