1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
In the first exercise of this week,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,350
we will estimate the OMA heating
power expected in ITER

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,190
and demonstrate the need
for additional external heating schemes.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,540
We will then specifically look
at electron cycles of heating

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,470
in the second exercise.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,180
You will familiarize yourself
with the CMA diagram,

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,450
a very useful tool to evaluate
the accessibility of various methods

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,210
of electron cycles and wave heating.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,950
Finally, in the last exercise,
you will derive the conditions

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,420
for so called runaway electrons.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,070
Runaway electrons occur
if the collisional drag on the electron

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,090
is weaker than
the accelerating electric field

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,260
and can result in very
high-energy beams of electrons

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,280
which are a concern
for a fusion reactor.

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,660
I wish you good luck.
