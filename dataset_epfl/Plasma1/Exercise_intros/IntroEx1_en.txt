Hello, my name is Christian Theiler and I'm a EUROfusion postdoctoral fellow at EPFL.
I would like to welcome you to the exercises for the first week of this course on plasma physics and applications.
These weekly exercises are essential for you to obtain the course certificate, and to consolidate your advancement in the course.
For an overview of your progress please look at the progress tab.
As you have seen, plasma temperature and density range over many orders of magnitude.
In the first exercise of this week, we will review some examples of plasmas in nature and in laboratory.
You will calculate some of their most important parameters and acquire a feeling of the main quantities that play a role in plasma dynamics, their order of magnitude, and of how different plasmas can be.
You have probably already looked at the introduction to MATLAB videos and used the option to download MATLAB for free on your PC or Mac.
This course gives you the possibility to acquire the basics of MATLAB, a very useful tool in general.
For this first exercise we provide you with an empty MATLAB code box.
You can use it to evaluate simple MATLAB expressions, and to make calculations in this first exercise.
In the second exercise of this week, you will determine how the temperature and the volume of a magnetized plasma vary, when the strength of the embedded magnetic field changes.
You will need to use the E x B drift and the conservation of the magnetic moment.
This exercise involves several steps.
If you are stuck somewhere, don't give up.
If you can't find the result for one of the steps, you can still attack the subsequent ones by using the solution we provide.
I wish you good luck.
