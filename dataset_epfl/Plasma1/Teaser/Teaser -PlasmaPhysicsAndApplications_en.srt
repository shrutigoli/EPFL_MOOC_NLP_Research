1
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:14,205
My name is Ambrogio Fasoli
and I would like to introduce to you

2
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:17,187
our new course on plasma physics
and applications.

3
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:20,583
I'm a professor of physics at
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology

4
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:24,308
and I have the privilege of directing
the Center for Research of Plasma Physics

5
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:27,556
from where all instructors
and assistants for this course come.

6
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:30,566
This course will provide you
with the basic knowledge of plasmas

7
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:34,242
and lead you through the application
to fusion energy, space and astrophysics.

8
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,714
Most of the universe we know about
is made of plasma,

9
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:39,090
a state in which nuclei and electrons
are set free.

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,415
and in which electromagnetic forces
are dominant.

11
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:42,767
We are surrounded by plasma,

12
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:45,583
starting from the ionosphere
a hundred kilometers above us,

13
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,223
which is connected to the sun
via the plasma of the solar wind.

14
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:51,157
The [inaudible]
is a plasma

15
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:53,588
and so are the largest objects
that emit x-rays.

16
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:55,746
Our life is energized by plasmas.

17
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:58,377
All stars, in fact, including our sun
are made of plasma

18
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:01,136
and operate on the principle
of nuclear fusion.

19
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:02,811
Without plasmas and fusion,

20
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:06,195
the Universe as we know it today
would not exist.

21
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:09,864
On Earth, natural plasmas
are much less frequent but still present.

22
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:12,461
For example, they appear
in lightning and auroras.

23
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:14,907
In addition, many plasmas are man-made.

24
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:18,270
Most technology objects in a room
are produced using plasmas.

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,889
The market of plasma-aided manufacturing
is gigantic,

26
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:23,498
on the order of
a hundred billion dollars per year.

27
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:26,674
And plasmas are at the core of fusion,
a possible solution

28
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:30,486
to one of the most formidable challenges
faced by mankind today,

29
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:32,135
that of finding a source of energy

30
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:34,541
that is safe, abundant, available to all,

31
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,224
and compatible
with sustainable development.

32
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:40,621
Different parts of the course
will be discussed by different specialists

33
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:42,941
who will combine
formal aspects of plasma physics

34
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:45,807
with cutting-edge illustrations
of research topics.

35
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:46,884
In the first part,

36
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:49,948
we will introduce the plasma state
and the models to describe it,

37
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:51,798
from single particles to fluid.

38
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:53,272
In the second part,

39
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:56,382
we will illustrate examples
of plasma in space and astrophysics

40
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,737
and discuss plasma applications
in industry and medicine.

41
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:02,465
The third part will be dedicated
to fusion energy.

42
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:04,773
We will go from
the design of a fusion reactor

43
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:07,094
to plasma confined
in configurations of fusion.

44
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,749
And finally, to confining, heating
and extracting energy

45
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:12,146
from a burning plasma.

46
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:14,873
This course is aimed at a level
of Bachelor's third year in Science,

47
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:17,431
in particular, Physics, 
but also Engineering,

48
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:21,056
with only basic pre-requisites,
such as General Physics,

49
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:25,086
in particular, Electricity of Magnetism
and Calculus.

50
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:27,230
So, my colleagues and I 
really look forward

51
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,010
to seeing many of you in this course

52
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,780
and discuss together
plasmas and their applications.
