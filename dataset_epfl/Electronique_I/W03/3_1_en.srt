00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,359
Today we're looking at a circuit
called a non-inverting circuit.

2
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,472
It's a circuit which will produce
a gain.

3
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:15,902
So it's a circuit which will use
the operational amplifier

4
00:00:15,902 --> 00:00:18,382
in the so-called linear area.

5
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:20,282
There will be a positive gain

6
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:23,302
and there will definitely be some
advantages and disadvantages

7
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:25,392
compared to the circuit we
saw before,

8
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,342
which was an inverting circuit.

9
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:29,762
Here's the non-inverting circuit.

10
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:34,052
So the plan that you see here
shows an operational amplifier

11
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:38,272
which is connected with two
resistors, <i>R2</i> and <i>R1</i>,

12
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,902
which create feedback.

13
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:43,702
It goes without saying
that the amplifier will be used

14
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:45,282
in the linear area,

15
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:49,602
so we'll immediately consider
the voltage <i>ΔV0,</i>

16
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:53,262
as the gain is infinite, as
being equal to 0.

17
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:57,162
This means that the voltage <i>V1</i>
will be returned directly

18
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:58,482
to node <i>A</i>.

19
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:02,891
So when we look at the voltage
<i>V1</i> from this node <i>A</i>,

20
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:05,781
you'll get a positive in this direction.

21
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:09,781
Because the voltage in <i>V1</i>
will be here.

22
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:13,781
And if you look at the voltage
which appears from there to there,

23
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:18,081
well this voltage will be proportional
to the difference between <i>V1-V2</i>.

24
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:23,241
So it's a voltage which is equal
to <i>V1 - V2</i>.

25
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:27,628
Now if we want to write down
what happens with the current <i>I</i>,

26
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,768
we'll see that the current <i>I</i>,
which is the same one that

27
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:33,260
will pass through the two
resistors <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i>

28
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:36,288
given that the current which passes
through the amp is equal to 0.

29
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:39,168
This current, remember,
has always been equal to 0.

30
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:41,248
The amp doesn't absorb current.

31
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:44,078
So, you're going to see the
current <i>I</i> on one side,

32
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:50,058
produced by the relationship
of <i>-V1/R1</i>.

33
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:54,849
The negative sign comes from the
fact that the current is positive in

34
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,319
this direction and the voltage
<i>V1</i> is positive in that direction.

35
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,695
Remember that this potential
and this potential are the same.

36
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:03,285
So when you look at the
same current <i>I</i>

37
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:06,165
in the other connection,
in the <i>R2</i> resistor,

38
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:10,170
well you'll see that it's
<i>V1-V2</i>

39
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,900
divided by the <i>R2</i> resistor.

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,790
We're going to take these two
connections, balance the currents,

41
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,170
since it's the same current
on both sides,

42
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,680
and we'll see what the relationship
is between <i>V2</i> and <i>V1</i>.

43
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:25,818
And here's the plan of our amp

44
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:30,208
and the relationship that we'll
get when we balance <i>I</i> to <i>I</i>.

45
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,900
We'll find that the ratio of the output
voltage <i>V2/V1</i> is <i>R1+R2</i> over <i>R1</i>,

46
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,310
which is strictly always greater
than 1.

47
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,850
A positive gain is always greater
than 1.

48
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,680
We can also write it like this:

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,000
The gain <i>Av</i> which equals
<i>V2</i> divided by <i>V1</i>

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,481
which equals 1+<i>R2/R1</i>.

51
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,270
So we always see that
this gain <i>R2/R1</i>,

52
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,000
that we add 1 to,

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,950
so it's always greater than
1 and positive,

54
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,950
and it's the gain of a
non-inverting amplifier.

55
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,950
Now, there's an extremely
important feature

56
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,950
that I would really like to highlight
compared to an inverting circuit.

57
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:22,131
The current that the source <i>V1</i>
will have is current <i>I</i>, equal to 0.

58
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:26,144
So if you connect a source here

59
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:28,384
which produces a current <i>I1</i>,

60
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,984
this current equals 0.

61
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:32,884
No power will be taken
from your source.

62
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:35,144
And that is extremely important.

63
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:37,174
I'd really like to emphasise that.

64
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:41,174
When we use a
non-inverting amplifier,

65
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:45,344
the source that we connect
at the input is positive.

66
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:47,964
So it's a source that
doesn't produce current,

67
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:51,344
so no power is required
from this source.

68
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:55,344
And that leads us to use
this type of amplifiers

69
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:59,344
to create infinite input impedances.

70
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:01,224
And we can summarise it here.

71
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:05,994
So here, we see that the input
impedance <i>R(in)</i> is infinite

72
00:04:05,994 --> 00:04:08,424
which gives this circuit one
of the features that we'll

73
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:12,424
hugely exploit later to create
circuits which don't

74
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:15,854
charge the source of voltage at all.

75
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:19,394
You can easily imagine
connecting a source here,

76
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:22,674
and this source will have
a very, very high resistance.

77
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:26,974
And that source could simply

78
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:31,674
have a voltage <i>V1</i>
which equals this voltage here,

79
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:34,954
given that this current equals 0.

80
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:41,264
So independently of the input
resistance value of your source,

81
00:04:44,447 --> 00:04:47,557
the voltage drop at this resistor
is always equal to 0

82
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:50,667
because there's no current
taken by the amplifier.

83
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,617
Remember that when the
amplifier shows

84
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:56,097
its output impedance <i>R(out)</i>
is equal to 0,

85
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:59,017
this simply means that the current

86
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:02,797
that we get at the amp's
output can be infinite.

87
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:04,107
In reality, that doesn't happen

88
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,567
because the current that
we have in this node

89
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:10,207
or at the amp's output is
limited by the amp's manufacturer

90
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:13,127
who will impose a maximum
current that will always be

91
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:14,637
indicated by the manufacturer.

92
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:17,865
Now I invite you to connect

93
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:20,855
a fairly classic operational
amplifier.

94
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,275
These amps which have extreme

95
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:28,525
gains such as the 741
operational amplifier.

96
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,031
When you connect an
amplifier like this,

97
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:36,361
and I suggest that you create a
gain of, for example, 4.3,

98
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:39,861
you have a choice to make
about the resistance.

99
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:43,941
If you take a resistance of 33kΩ,
a resistance of 10kΩ,

100
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:48,041
that gives you an <i>R2/R1</i>
ratio equal to 3.3,

101
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,051
which we'll add this 1 to.

102
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,221
Remember that the gain
is <i>1+R2/R1</i>,

103
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:56,631
so you'll get a gain equal to 4.3.

104
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,470
When you connect this
amplifier in a lab,

105
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,580
I suggest that you put this
yellow signal at the input,

106
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,870
which is a voltage <i>V1</i>.

107
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,890
This voltage <i>V1</i> will...

108
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,890
The example that I'm using here,
I'm setting an amplitude of 1V.

109
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,890
That means that it'll have a
dynamic of plus or minus 1V,

110
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:18,381
therefore a dynamic of 2V.

111
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:21,701
And when you multiply that by 4.3,

112
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:25,091
you can see that the
voltage in blue, here,

113
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:28,661
corresponds exactly to the
glimmer of voltage in yellow,

114
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:30,321
multiplied by 4.3.

115
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:34,581
So the peak value in volts
will be multiplied by 4.3

116
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:36,981
and gives us 4.3V.

117
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,061
And that's what we see
at the output.

118
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:41,231
Why do we use a triangular
voltage?

119
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:44,411
Because linearity is almost
visible to the naked eye.

120
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:47,211
We have a positive slope,
a negative slope.

121
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:49,121
We only have to compare
the slope and we'll see

122
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:51,851
that thanks to the amplifier gain

123
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:56,511
this slope is completely linear
between -4.3 and 4.3

124
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,690
and vice versa, whether
it's positive or negative.

125
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,570
I'd like to reflect a little

126
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,750
on the current that will be
given out by the amp.

127
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,630
Remember,

128
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,210
when we look at an
amp connected like this,

129
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,830
you're watching the voltage
<i>V2</i>.

130
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,520
The current <i>I2</i> will of course
come from the amplifier.

131
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,500
It's a current which will be
positive and negative.

132
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,600
When the slope is positive

133
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,530
and the voltage <i>V2</i> is
positive or negative,

134
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,060
well you'll see that the
current will follow it.

135
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,240
There will be a slope which
follows the voltage.

136
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,240
There'll be a current value
which will be positive and negative.

137
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,760
So the current which will pass here...

138
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,030
Remember one of the
characteristics of the amplifier.

139
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,780
When the amp is in a linear area,

140
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,290
that means the amp is not
at all saturated.

141
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,490
As we can see here.

142
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,420
For it to be saturated, its voltage
must reach 15V,

143
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,420
which is the supply voltage
if you've supplied 15V.

144
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:58,522
The voltage <i>V1</i> is the voltage
that we'll see in this node.

145
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:00,522
So the voltage <i>V1</i> is this one.

146
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,920
When you look at the current,
this current <i>I1</i>,

147
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,070
which is due to the voltage <i>V1</i>,
which is the input voltage,

148
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,070
you can simply write that
the current <i>I1</i>

149
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,760
equals <i>V1/R1</i>.

150
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,760
And that's it, you have the
exact value of <i>I1</i> and the

151
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,560
current <i>I1</i> which will
absolutely follow the voltage <i>V1</i>

152
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,220
and which means you'll have 10kΩ

153
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,310
and you're looking for a current
which will go up to 100μA,

154
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,260
knowing that we have 4.3.

155
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,230
So you'll find that the current will
go up to 100μA with positive value,

156
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,700
and up to -100μA negative value.

157
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,720
And this is what you'll see
the whole time.

158
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
With the output voltage being 4.3,
the input voltage is 1V,

159
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,090
so we can simply divide the
1V, divided by the 10kΩ

160
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,090
and at any point,
with the peak value being 1V,

161
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:02,240
we find then that 100μA
and -1V makes -100μA.

162
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:04,433
So what happens with
this circuit

163
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:07,393
when the amplifier becomes
saturated?

164
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,010
Will it keep the same
characteristics?

165
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,290
Definitely not.

166
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,330
I'll emphasise and repeat.

167
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,330
The amplifier, due to its
infinite gain, when it is

168
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,280
in the linear area,

169
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,910
it takes any value of
the <i>V2</i> voltage.

170
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,910
It divides it by the infinite
gain and the difference between

171
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,550
the positive and negative terminal
should be <i>V2</i> divided by infinity,

172
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,030
therefore equal to 0.

173
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,030
So when the amp is not saturated,
this characteristic is true.

174
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,950
And at that moment,
this voltage is equal to this one.

175
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,120
And the current is the current
provided by the amplifier

176
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,680
when the current is positive.

177
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,300
And it's a current which is
absorbed by the amplifier

178
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,890
and which will go towards the
voltage <i>-Vcc</i> when the current

179
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,740
is negative, because remember
that it's a supply voltage

180
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,120
which provides this energy
to our amplifier.

181
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Let's see if we push this
amplifier towards saturation.

182
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,510
I suggest you put a voltage
<i>V1</i> at the input

183
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,100
which pushes the amplifier
to reach this saturation voltage,

184
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,610
and we'll see the following thing:

185
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:16,015
here's what happens with
our amplifier

186
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,475
when you push your amplifier
towards saturation.

187
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:23,545
So we had a peak voltage
value of 5V.

188
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:26,765
You multiply that by 4.3.

189
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:29,975
So you'll have a voltage
which exceeds 15V.

190
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:32,987
Your amplifier can't go beyond

191
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:34,907
the supply voltage.

192
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:37,337
It will saturate at +15 and -15.

193
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,777
What happens with this circuit?

194
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:43,777
The amplifier can't in any case,
at that moment,

195
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,377
remain in the linear area.

196
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:51,187
The voltage difference  <i>ΔV0</i>
can no longer be equal to 0

197
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:55,427
because your amplifier
can't remain linear.

198
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:58,457
We applied a linear voltage
at the input

199
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,007
and we see a voltage which
is no longer linear.

200
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,127
When the voltage is a
straight line

201
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:06,797
the amp remains in the
linear area from here to here.

202
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:11,127
It arrives here and there,
the amp is becoming saturated,

203
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:13,237
here also the amp is
becoming saturated.

204
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:17,567
So at that moment,
when the amp is saturated,

205
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:21,567
<i>ΔV0</i> will of course
be different to 0.

206
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:26,509
So the current <i>I2</i>
which crosses the two resistors

207
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:29,729
can no longer be proportional
to <i>V1</i> at all.

208
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:35,619
So there, the current <i>I1</i> here
was <i>V1/R1</i> when the amp

209
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:39,163
wasn't saturated, so when it's here
in this area, the linear area,

210
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:40,953
there it's in the saturated area.

211
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:43,233
And when we're in the
saturated areas, this current,

212
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:47,233
or rather this voltage <i>V2</i>,
in the saturated area,

213
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,933
will be equal to <i>Vsat</i>.

214
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,033
So it depends on the
saturation voltage.

215
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:53,893
Here, as it happens,
it's 15V.

216
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:59,273
So it's the 15V divided
by the resistances

217
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:04,503
of 10kΩ + 33kΩ

218
00:12:04,503 --> 00:12:10,043
which will give you 350μA
as a saturation current.

219
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:13,303
So it's very important
to realise

220
00:12:13,303 --> 00:12:16,803
that the value of these resistances
when the amp is saturated

221
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,143
will lead us to have the
maximum current produced

222
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:22,313
by the amp, and it's the max
current and the same current

223
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:27,093
of course which passes through
resistors <i>I2</i> and <i>I1</i>.

224
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:31,093
And remember, when the amp
was in the linear area,

225
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:35,313
the current is especially
proportional to <i>V1/R1</i>

226
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:39,475
and still supplied by the
operational amplifier.

227
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:42,527
Which you will have seen
on the oscilloscope

228
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:46,827
if the input voltage was a
sinusoidal voltage in yellow,

229
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:50,827
and an output voltage in blue
which is also a sinusoidal voltage,

230
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:56,077
you'll still observe a gain of 4.3.

231
00:12:56,077 --> 00:13:00,797
There, I measured the effective
values of the input voltage.

232
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:04,797
Here is the input voltage <i>V1</i>

233
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:07,787
and here, the input voltage <i>V2</i>.

234
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:14,397
And you'll see that the effective
value from one to the other

235
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:18,067
if you do the equation,
you'll get an amplification

236
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,927
gain around 4.3.

237
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:23,357
Remember that these
measurements were done in the lab,

238
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:26,777
which means that error is
introduced, it goes without saying,

239
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:31,157
by the tolerance of resistors and the
precision of measuring equipment

240
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:35,157
but in this case, the equipment
is very, very precise.

241
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:37,507
Look at this phase:

242
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:41,507
it's a positive phase.

243
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:44,822
It's equal to 0.

244
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:48,822
When we look at it, the two
voltages are completely in phase,

245
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:52,822
which explains the behaviour
of this amp

246
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:55,922
which is a non-inverting amp,

247
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:59,272
so it doesn't invert,
it doesn't dephase the signals

248
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:03,272
and it keeps the output voltage
in phase with the input voltage,

249
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:06,892
on the contrary to an inverting
circuit in which

250
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:10,422
we have observed a 180° dephasing

251
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:12,532
with a sinusoidal voltage.
