1
00:00:03,955 --> 00:00:07,555
Now we are going to look at
this type of circuit

2
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:10,595
that we call the 
voltage follower amplifier.

3
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:13,925
So it's a circuit which will simply
copy the voltage from there to there.

4
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:16,405
I will take the circuit
that we had studied before.

5
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:19,035
So I remind you that the circuit
that we studied,

6
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:23,115
is a circuit where we took
negative feedback resistance, 

7
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:31,533
<i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i>.

8
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:37,772
And we have a high impedance input.

9
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:42,352
And we observe the voltage here at the output

10
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:44,940
in comparison with the <i>V1</i> input voltage.

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,110
What happens when you completely remove
the <i>R2</i> resistance?

12
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:53,285
So if you take the <i>R2</i> resistance
and you don't put it.

13
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:57,259
So this resistance there,
it's no longer there,

14
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,269
we remove it.

15
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:02,055
And, what's going to happen
with your circuit,

16
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:06,055
is that this <i>R1</i> resistance
doesn't even a remaining direction. 

17
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:09,868
Because this <i>R1</i> resistance,
that you can see here,

18
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,868
is a resistance which will simply
drive a current here.

19
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:15,718
But there's no current.

20
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:19,608
The current here, <i>I</i>, is equal to 0.

21
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:22,608
So you keep it 
or you replace it with a short circuit,

22
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:24,718
it has the exact same consequence. 

23
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:28,989
In this case, we replaced the 
<i>R1</i> resistance with a short circuit. 

24
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,529
We could have kept it,
it wouldn't have changed 

25
00:01:31,529 --> 00:01:33,779
the behaviour of this circuit at all. 

26
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:39,562
This circuit, when you analyse 
and write the output  

27
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:41,522
relation compared with the input, 

28
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:44,532
you'll write <i>V2</i> is equal to 1 

29
00:01:44,532 --> 00:01:49,732
plus the <i>R1</i> resistance
divided by the one I've just removed 

30
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:51,835
which is called the <i>R2</i> resistance. 

31
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:54,345
And I've just put that equal to infinity. 

32
00:01:54,345 --> 00:02:00,045
I removed it so I completely withdrew the 
<i>R2</i> resistance, so it's equal to 1. 

33
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:04,221
I've just made an amplifier 
which has a gain equal to 1,

34
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:07,851
because this becomes nil

35
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:11,351
and we've just removed the <i>R1</i>
resistance that was useless,

36
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:13,291
and we have a circuit. 

37
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,501
We only have to take the negative 
input and link it with the output

38
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:20,361
because this voltage there
is always copied here,

39
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:24,311
given that the difference in voltage
between these two positive and negative terminals

40
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,401
is equal to 0. 

41
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,011
So <i>V1</i> is equal to 1. 

42
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:31,011
That, and you can see <i>V1</i> here. 

43
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:33,481
<i>V1</i> equal to <i>V2</i>. 

44
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:38,428
There is a fundamental difference 
between the fact that this <i>V1</i> voltage 

45
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:40,498
is at the output. 

46
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:46,948
There, you take the current from the source 
which determines <i>V1</i> is equal to 0. 

47
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:51,208
There, the current which goes out 
the amplifier, in theory,

48
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,988
is an infinite current. 

49
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:56,498
So there, you take the current 
you want 

50
00:02:56,498 --> 00:02:57,798
in a charge. 

51
00:02:57,798 --> 00:03:00,968
There, you don't take anything from 
the source you are connecting. 

52
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:04,388
If we hadn't put an amplifier at all,

53
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:06,238
which, of course, is charged, 

54
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:09,538
and that this supply voltage 
gives the necessary energy

55
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:10,738
to supply the current,

56
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:13,628
because the current comes from
the voltage supplies 

57
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,248
which are added to the amplifier 
that we no longer illustrate. 

58
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:20,248
So you end up with a
drawing like this. 

59
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:26,653
And there it is, your input impedance 
has become infinite 

60
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:31,053
whilst your output impedance 
has become nil,

61
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:35,765
all whilst maintaining the same
input voltage 

62
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:37,415
copied to the output voltage. 

63
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:40,205
And in English, it's called <i>buffer</i>.

64
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:44,815
A <i>buffer</i> means that we've 
successfully put a buffer 

65
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,795
between the input and output.

66
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:49,815
And this buffer, which is located
between the input and output,

67
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:54,075
completely disconnects the resistance
you will have connected here 

68
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,725
that has exactly the same 
<i>V2</i> voltage source,

69
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:59,775
without being directly connected.  

70
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,690
We will have many
use for it,

71
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,180
such as the application that we will see there. 

72
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:11,996
If you have sources which have 
very high resistances. 

73
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,438
So this resistance there is 100kΩ

74
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,818
and you will have wanted to 
take this <i>Vs</i> voltage 

75
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:24,418
and connect it to a charge 
with a distinctly lower value

76
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:27,796
to the source's internal resistance. 

77
00:04:27,815 --> 00:04:31,390
There, I take the example of 
around 100 ohms. 

78
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,970
That means the voltage you will 
have seen here

79
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,480
will have a resistive divider 

80
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,300
whose the resistance of the terminals
of which the voltage is equal to 100kΩ,

81
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,540
whereas the other is equal to 100kΩ. 

82
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,672
So it's as if I had divided 
my source voltage 

83
00:04:47,672 --> 00:04:49,442
by one thousand. 

84
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:53,442
So I totally reduced the voltage 
that was available in the source 

85
00:04:53,442 --> 00:04:55,062
when I saw it on the charge. 

86
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,192
Typically, if you consider that 
it's a micro,

87
00:04:58,192 --> 00:04:59,272
and you have a micro,

88
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:02,132
the micro doesn't have 
an output resistance 

89
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:03,932
which will be a weak resistance. 

90
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,922
They're very, very high resistances. 

91
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:09,522
So you can't connect your micro
to any charge 

92
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:13,002
and this charge will absorb
all the power supplied in the micro. 

93
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:15,042
If you put a <i>buffer</i> between them both,

94
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,862
so you put 
a voltage follower amplifier,

95
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:21,862
the <i>Vs</i> voltage here is exactly
the one we can see there. 

96
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:23,942
It's not that one
which had been divided my one thousand. 

97
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:26,952
All whilst copying <i>Vs</i> and placing it here. 

98
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,122
So the <i>Vs</i> voltage 
was copied from there to there,

99
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,482
without affecting the current. 

100
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:36,482
We have taken a nil power
from the charge. 

101
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:37,882
The current is nil,

102
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:41,882
so the power
which was supplied here was equal to 0. 

103
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:46,433
The power from the source,
we took a nil power. 

104
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:51,523
The power that was injected 
in the charge, by definition,

105
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:53,783
in theory, but it's never true,

106
00:05:53,783 --> 00:05:55,293
it's an infinite power

107
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:58,858
because the current which can be provided
by the amplifier is equal to infinite. 

108
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,148
There is another application 
that we can do

109
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:02,498
with this type of circuit. 

110
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:04,238
In certain types of applications,

111
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,068
we need to connect 
resistances 

112
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:09,308
that we call characteristic
resistances 

113
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:11,528
which have certain types of values. 

114
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:15,218
Suppose that your source
must have, at all costs,

115
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:18,488
a resistance of 1kΩ, for example.

116
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:22,488
You only have to take a 
passive resistance of 1kΩ

117
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:24,828
and connect it to this circuit's output.

118
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:27,698
Your source has...

119
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:30,454
Of course, it has that as
internal impedance. 

120
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:33,334
But it always has 
a constant resistance equal to 1kΩ.

121
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:37,194
And on the other hand, you can connect
any value of resistance,

122
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,544
including a short circuit. 

123
00:06:38,544 --> 00:06:41,154
So that, that can be 
an extremely weak resistance 

124
00:06:41,154 --> 00:06:43,794
but your source sees the one
you've connected here. 

125
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:46,004
Any resistance
you put there,

126
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:51,544
that will be the resistance that will be seen
by the source with its internal resistance. 

127
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:58,728
After having seen the inverting circuit,
the non-inverting circuit,

128
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:01,178
we are going to talk about
general cases. 

129
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:05,478
A general case, it's that we will use
the amplifier's two inputs

130
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:06,678
in this form.

131
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:09,518
You have the op amplifier
with the positive and negative input.

132
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:13,178
We added a <i>R2</i> and a <i>R1</i> resistance.

133
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:16,868
I remind you,
we started with a inverting circuit

134
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:19,508
when we connected the mass here.

135
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:22,452
And we called that the inverting circuit.

136
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:27,467
Then, we took this

137
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,857
and put that to the mass

138
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:32,867
and we entered with a <i>V2</i> source here

139
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:36,867
and we called this
the non-inverting circuit.

140
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:40,346
In this example,
we will consider

141
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:44,026
that we have <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i> voltage
and we will use them both.

142
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,233
What is going to happen
with the <i>Vout </i> voltage? 

143
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,088
It's a linear circuit.

144
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:54,038
If the output voltage isn't saturated,

145
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:57,008
of course I can apply
the superposition principle. 

146
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:59,488
We must be aware
that the superposition principle

147
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:03,008
will help us to find again
our two schemas from before.

148
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:04,958
So first I'll start by reading,

149
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,088
there is a <i>Vout</i> voltage,

150
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:10,718
which has two parts,

151
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:17,368
a contribution of the <i>V1</i> 
and <i>V2</i> voltage.

152
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:20,741
I cancel <i>V1</i> once 
and I cancel <i>V2</i> once.

153
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:23,701
I add the two and I say
I superimpose at the output

154
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:26,211
given that I'm
in the linear world.

155
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:29,841
So first I'll take the first case.

156
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,151
So first I'll take the first case

157
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:36,701
where I look at the <i>V'1</i> voltage
when <i>V1</i> is equal to 0.

158
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:40,489
I will have a drawing
which is like this.

159
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,296
I cancelled the <i>V1</i> voltage.

160
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:45,676
So I put that to the mass.

161
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,693
And I observe this drawing.

162
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,693
And I only have to copy
what we had studied at the beginning

163
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:54,293
in the circuit
called non-inverting circuit.

164
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:58,613
So the <i>V'out</i> output voltage
is equal to the <i>V2</i> voltage

165
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,133
multiplied by a positive gain
which is equal to 1

166
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,343
plus the relation of <i>R2</i> on <i>R1</i>.

167
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:05,985
I'll go back to the general case

168
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:10,515
and this time, I'm interested
in the <i>V"out</i> situation

169
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:12,025
when <i>V2</i> is equal to 0.

170
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:15,355
So I short circuit this to the mass.

171
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:21,237
And I recognise the inverting circuit there.

172
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:24,286
And this inverting circuit,
will tell me that the contribution 

173
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:30,076
of the <i>V1</i> voltage will be seen at 
the output with a reverse component.

174
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:34,848
So it's <i>-V1</i> which always multiplies
the relation of the <i>R2</i> resistance

175
00:09:34,848 --> 00:09:35,928
divided by <i>R1</i>.

176
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:39,538
And now, I only have to take account 
of the addition of these two cases

177
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,398
given that I can superimpose the two

178
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,508
and I will find this.

179
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:50,521
This is what I find in an example
where I use an amplifier

180
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:55,401
with two sources of voltage <i>V1</i> 
and a second source of voltage <i>V2</i>.

181
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:59,661
The output is proportional
to these two components.

182
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:03,661
<i>V2</i> multiplied by a gain
of a non-inverting amplifier

183
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:07,171
and <i>V1</i> multiplied by a gain
of a inverting amplifier.

184
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:12,235
So once <i>1+R2/R1</i> 
and another time <i> R2/R1,</i>

185
00:10:12,235 --> 00:10:14,175
with a minus sign.

186
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:19,345
However, the <i>V1</i> source
will have an input resistance 

187
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:21,655
<i>Rin1</i> equal to <i>R1</i>.

188
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:25,115
On the other hand, <i>Rin2</i> is infinite.

189
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:28,235
So the current which enters here
is an infinite current

190
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:31,350
and the <i>Rout</i> resistance, of course,
is supported

191
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,950
by the operational amplifier,

192
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,310
which will give me <i>Rout</i> is equal to 0.

193
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,310
We have just seen the
non-inverting circuit

194
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,390
and we have seen applications

195
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,580
and we first distinguished 
that it's a circuit

196
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,560
which has a positive gain,

197
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,850
which has a gain which is always
higher than 1

198
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,850
and which can be done with an amplifier
which is called a follower amplifier,

199
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,920
that is used to separate
a source and a charge.

200
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,320
The source doesn't debit current,
the charge absorbs the current

201
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,810
from your operational amplifier.

202
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,080
And we finished with a general case

203
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,530
where we demonstrated that an amplifier
can at the same time combine

204
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,330
an inverting or non-inverting amplifier.

205
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,760
We call this the general case.

206
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,280
We will look at this again
in one of the applications,

207
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,760
applications of the operational 
amplifier later

208
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,590
and which will allow us to make

209
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,370
what we call 
the differential amplifier.
