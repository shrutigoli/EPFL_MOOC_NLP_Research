1
00:00:04,216 --> 00:00:08,796
You've learnt that with circuits
based on the operational amplifier,

2
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:12,556
we can make
linear circuits

3
00:00:12,556 --> 00:00:15,596
which will link the input and output
by functions.

4
00:00:15,596 --> 00:00:18,756
We succeeded in making a summer

5
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:21,236
with the inverting amplifier.

6
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:23,496
Now, we will learn
how to make a summer

7
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:26,966
with a non-inverting amplifier.

8
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:29,806
We will add up two voltages,
<i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>

9
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:33,806
and we will see
that we can just add two resistances

10
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:36,386
on the positive terminal
and that we will find

11
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:42,116
a relation where the summing function,
contrary to the inverting amplifier,

12
00:00:42,116 --> 00:00:46,506
will not dephase the voltage
between the two input voltages

13
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,336
and the output voltage.

14
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:52,474
Here is the drawing of a summer
with a positive gain.

15
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:55,124
So we can see what is happening here.

16
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:58,224
There, you have your amplifier
as we studied it.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,994
So you have a <i>V(out)</i> voltage

18
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:05,007
which will be equal to the <i>Vx</i> voltage

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:15,400
multiplied by <i>(1 + R1/R2)</i>.

20
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:20,494
So it's a positive gain
superior to <i>R1</i> on <i>R2</i>

21
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:22,144
because there is a 1,

22
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:23,784
and which multiplies the <i>Vx</i> voltage.

23
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:28,234
In this case, <i>Vx</i> ends up with
this circuit that we added.

24
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,514
So we have taken two voltage sources.

25
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:33,795
A <i>V1</i> voltage source,
a <i>V2</i> voltage source.

26
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:37,795
And we added a resistive divider,
or rather two resistances

27
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:39,725
connected like that.

28
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,536
And we connected a <i>V1</i>
voltage source here,

29
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:46,476
a <i>V2</i> voltage source here,

30
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:50,476
and we are interested in the
<i>Vx</i> voltage that appears there.

31
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,110
And the <i>Vx</i> voltage,
we learnt that the superposition

32
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,210
principle allows us

33
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,720
to express <i>Vx</i> when
the <i>V2 voltage = 0</i>.

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,640
So we cancel one of these two sources.

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,170
So I put that to the mass

36
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,130
and that will give me a resistive divider

37
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,450
which performs with
two similar resistances, <i>R</i> and <i>R</i>.

38
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,870
So this will give me a <i>Vx</i> voltage
when <i>V2 = 0</i>, which

39
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:27,250
is nothing more than the <i>V1</i> voltage
multiplied by <i>R</i> divided by <i>R + R</i>,

40
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,990
so it's 1/2.

41
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:35,249
Similarly, the <i>V'x</i> and <i>V"x</i> voltage

42
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:38,269
when <i>V1 = 0</i>,

43
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:44,648
it will give me a voltage equal to <i>V2</i>

44
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,688
multiplied by 1/2.

45
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:50,688
So the <i>Vx</i> voltage,
is proportional

46
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,616
to <i>V1 + V2</i>

47
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:59,556
multiplied by 1/2.

48
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:03,336
I only have to use this

49
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:07,336
and replace <i>Vx</i> by its value
compared with <i>V(out)</i>

50
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:10,086
and observe what we will get.

51
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:13,095
So I'll take the same relations.

52
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:16,285
That it's the amplifier compared with <i>Vx</i>.

53
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,352
That it's the <i>Vx</i> voltage
expressed in relation to <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>.

54
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:26,082
And when I replace <i>Vx</i>
by its value here,

55
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,782
we get that,

56
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:30,222
which is an expression of a summer.

57
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:33,312
The two voltages are 
added at the output,

58
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:37,312
it is <i>V1 + V2</i> multiplied
by the gain of the amplifier

59
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:40,062
and multiplied by a factor of 1/2.

60
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:44,062
So again it's a gain
with the sum of two voltages

61
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:48,492
which enables us to mix
or add the two voltages

62
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:51,842
carried out by two independent sources.

63
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:57,237
I am going to look at another application
of amplifiers.

64
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:02,107
It's quite funny to see
that a resistance can,

65
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:06,687
when it becomes active, so carried out
with an active circuit with an OP amplifier,

66
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:09,377
can be carried out in the form of
a negative resistance.

67
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:12,097
I will just remind you what
a resistance means.

68
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,497
I think that everyone
knows it very well.

69
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:15,797
That is a resistance.

70
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,507
When you take a voltage,

71
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:22,187
and you connect a <i>V1</i>
voltage to the terminals of a resistance,

72
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:23,847
you will have a current.

73
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,597
It goes without saying that this current,
is a <i>I1</i> current.

74
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:29,377
And this current is positive
in this direction.

75
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:33,487
A negative resistance, it's a 
resistance which will not perform

76
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:35,947
in a dissipative form because there,

77
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:39,747
the voltage and the current
have the same vectorial direction,

78
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:46,087
it's the opposite direction so it's as if
when you apply a <i>V1</i> voltage,

79
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:51,857
you will have a current which
will rather go in this direction.

80
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:57,495
So if you will provide a <i>I1</i>
current in your source.

81
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:58,985
Every time <i>V1</i> increases,

82
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:02,095
you will absorb more current
so it's a generator.

83
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:06,565
That will give you power
which comes off in that direction,

84
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:10,565
instead of having an absorbed power
in your resistance.

85
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:14,085
And that's done
with a circuit like this one.

86
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:17,097
Here is the amplifier and its behaviour

87
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:22,297
when it's connected
to a gain which is equal,

88
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:25,295
which can be expressed as <i>V(out)</i>
is equal

89
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:30,845
to <i>1 + R/RL</i>.

90
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:37,445
And it goes without saying that this
<i>V(out)</i> with a gain equal to that,

91
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:40,855
which multiplies the <i>V(in)</i> voltage,

92
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:42,895
is always higher than <i>V(in)</i>.

93
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:45,645
This voltage is always higher than this one

94
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,635
because you have <i>V(out)</i> equal to <i>V(in)</i>
multiplied by something

95
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:50,405
which is higher than 1,

96
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:52,965
so this voltage
is always higher than this one.

97
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:56,035
So the voltage is positive
in that direction.

98
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:03,565
When you increase the <i>V(in)</i> voltage,

99
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:08,165
you will increase the <i>V(out)</i>
voltage at the same time.

100
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:13,624
And the difference between these two voltages
will always go in the direction

101
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,744
that the output current will go
in this direction.

102
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:22,955
That's the current that will
be the lE current <i>-I(in)</i> in reality.

103
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:28,233
If the current is actually considered
<i>I(in)</i> positive in this direction,

104
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:33,063
each time you look at the current,
that you increase <i>V(in)</i>,

105
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:35,253
you will notice that
there is a <i>I(in)</i> current

106
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:37,043
which would rather
go out in that direction.

107
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:42,823
So in reality, this <i>I(in)</i> current
is positive in this direction

108
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:46,193
and that will happen
with this kind of circuit.

109
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:51,254
And you can now express
the relation between <i>V(in)</i> and <i>I(in)</i>

110
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:54,164
and replace that in the expression
of <i>V(out)</i>,

111
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,544
and we will find that
the input resistance,

112
00:06:57,544 --> 00:06:59,564
this <i>R(in)</i> resistance,

113
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:04,594
which is expressed as the relation
between the <i>V(in)</i> voltage and <i>I(in),</i>,

114
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:06,554
and you will see that when <i>V(in)</i> increases,

115
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:09,204
or rather for a <i>V(in)</i> positive voltage,

116
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:12,074
you will see a positive current
in this direction.

117
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:17,149
Here is the drawing and the calculation
of what we have just seen.

118
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,439
So simply, by taking the 
same relation which

119
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,479
describes <i>V(out)</i> in relation to 
<i>V(in)</i>, with the gain of the amplifier,

120
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,549
and by expressing <i>I(in)</i>
as the difference

121
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,899
between the <i>V(in)-V(out)</i> voltage
divided by <i>R</i>

122
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,469
because really, the voltage
that you see there,

123
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:40,989
is a voltage

124
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:46,789
that is <i>V(in) - V(out)</i>

125
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:50,369
and will become a current

126
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:58,397
<i>I(in) = V(in) - V(out)</i>

127
00:07:58,397 --> 00:08:00,587
divided by this <i>R</i> resistance

128
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:02,047
that we added here.

129
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,858
And as <i>R</i> and <i>R</i> are the same,

130
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:06,988
I invite you to calculate

131
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:10,988
and check that by replacing <i>V(out)</i>
by its value here,

132
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:15,588
you will end up with a <i>R(in)</i> resistance
which is equal to <i>-RL</i>.

133
00:08:15,588 --> 00:08:19,868
So in this type of circuit,
by connecting a <i>RL</i> resistance,

134
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:22,028
you are making it negative.

135
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:26,028
Any resistance connected
between this node here and that node there,

136
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:29,608
makes it look like it's
minus its value.

137
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:32,618
So it's <i>V(in)</i> which 
will be equal to <i>-RL</i>

138
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:35,828
and the current will be absorbed
by the source

139
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:37,438
which is located on this side here,

140
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:41,438
it will depend on the value of <i>RL</i>
but with a minus sign.
