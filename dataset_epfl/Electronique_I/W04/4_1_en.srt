1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,789
We've looked at the amplifier

2
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:08,369
for which gain has absolutely
no dependence on the frequency.

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:11,919
We've seen that in using resistances
such as negative feedback,

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,969
an op-amp's gain is a linear relation

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,409
between the input and the output,

6
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:18,819
and that there is absolutely
no dependence

7
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:22,359
between the frequency and what is happening
with the voltage

8
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,869
between the input and the output.

9
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:27,065
Today we're going to look at
another theme,

10
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:30,435
which will be: what happens if the
components which

11
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:35,345
we use to apply negative feedback on the
amplifier, for example, have

12
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:36,825
capacitors?

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,310
So, we have a capacitor and we know for sure
that the capacitor has an impedance

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,560
and that this impedance
depends on the frequency.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,430
So, we're going to have a look at
what's happening

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,060
and we can see that this leads us
to discover that

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,940
it's just the function of a filter,

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,210
how we can use the operational
amplifier

19
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,200
to filter the frequency and work on
the Bode diagram

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,410
that we use to describe the relationship
between input and output

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,410
and to plot the poles and the zeros
on the Bode diagram

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,660
in accordance with our components.

23
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:16,244
Here we have what's called an
integrated circuit.

24
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:20,742
You should recall that it's an
inverting amplifier.

25
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:26,152
You've seen that the inverting amplifier has
a negative input

26
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,142
connected to the volume

27
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:33,892
and that we've got an element of negative
feedback that in an inverting amplifier

28
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:38,492
has an independent frequency gain, here,
we've put a resistance.

29
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:41,462
Here, we replace the resistance with
a capacitor

30
00:01:41,462 --> 00:01:43,912
and we keep the resistance that was here.

31
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:46,582
So, we're going to have a look at
what's happening.

32
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:51,262
I remind you that the power input <i>I</i>,

33
00:01:51,262 --> 00:01:55,262
will always be proportional to the voltage,

34
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,447
<i>V1</i>,

35
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,973
divided by the resistance value of the
terminals from which

36
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:05,903
I see the current <i>V1</i>,

37
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:09,811
I see the same current <i>I</i> passing
into the capacitor.

38
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,931
Here, it's going to change.

39
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,761
This current <i>I</i> will be equal

40
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:19,831
to <i>C.du/dt</i>.

41
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:23,831
In the temporal domain, a capacitor
links the power

42
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:28,711
to the voltage of its terminals via a derivative
effect from the voltage.

43
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:32,511
In this case, this voltage <i>du</i>, is
the voltage <i>V2</i>.

44
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:35,071
Remember that the voltage <i>V2</i>,
is this one here,

45
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,261
exactly what we saw before,

46
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:40,091
so, this tension <i>V2</i>.

47
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:42,871
So, I just have to write that this current <i>i</i>

48
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:47,521
is equal to <i>C.dV2/dt</i>.

49
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:50,621
And, this current <i>i</i> is indeed
the same current <i>I</i>

50
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:53,941
that we see here, that links <i>V1</i> to <i>R</i>.

51
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,461
By analysing what we see in this plan

52
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:00,441
and some of the relationships that are
written on it there,

53
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:03,301
we're going to come to the following conclusion:

54
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:08,875
We're going to discover that the voltage <i>V1/R</i>

55
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,300
equals <i>-CdV2/dt</i>.

56
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,365
By looking at the value of <i>V2</i>
in accordance with <i>V1</i>,

57
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,585
forcibly, we're going to find an integral
relationship.

58
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:28,948
Which means that our voltage <i>V2</i> sees
or depicts in real time

59
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:34,268
the intirety of the voltage <i>V1dt</i>
multiplied by <i>1/RC</i>

60
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:37,978
and therefore, there is always
this negative sign due to the fact

61
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:40,298
that the voltage <i>V2</i> is positive in this
direction

62
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:44,298
and the current <i>I</i> is positive in
this direction here.

63
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:48,091
The output impedance stays the same as
an inversing amplifier,

64
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:50,151
knowing that <i>R(in)</i> equals <i>R</i>.

65
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:52,451
The output impedance remains equal to 0

66
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:55,571
because it is governed by your operational
amplifier.

67
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:59,062
I'd really like to look at the same example

68
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:02,012
but this time look at what happens in a
sinusoidal regime.

69
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:05,202
In a sinusoidal regime, we can replace
the capacitor

70
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:07,792
with its complex impedance.

71
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:11,792
So, rather than write the temporal relationship
of the capacitor

72
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:14,632
that links current to the derived voltage,

73
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:19,112
we're going to replace it by an
impedance <i>ZC</i>,

74
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:24,512
and this impedance <i>ZC = 1/jωC</i>.

75
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:27,112
It's the same for the resistance <i>R</i>.

76
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:31,562
This resistance <i>R</i>, I replace with its
complex impedance

77
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:35,562
<i>ZR</i> which is a real number and which is equal to the
value of the resistance <i>R</i>.

78
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,659
We've analysed the inverter application

79
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:43,969
and we saw that when we want to link the
complex voltage output,

80
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:47,499
because we had only a sinusoidal regime for
a sinusoidal voltage,

81
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:50,629
to the voltage input <i>V1</i>,

82
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:54,629
we wrote, we discovered that it's a relationship
between this impedance

83
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:55,959
divided by this impedance.

84
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:59,959
So, I'm going to write down clearly
that it's the impedance <i>ZC</i>

85
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,959
divided by the impedance <i>ZR</i>.

86
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:11,177
Which equals <i>1/jωRC</i>.

87
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,754
So I discover that the relationship
between the sinusoidal voltage

88
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:18,654
that I see at the output because of the
sinusoidal voltage

89
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:20,574
that I see at the input,

90
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:24,354
it's a transfer function that I
will name <i>H</i>,

91
00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:25,904
I'm in the complex world,

92
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:31,514
that equals <i>1/jωRC</i>,

93
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,634
that I generally write

94
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:37,814
as though it was <i>1/jω</i> over <i> ω0</i>,

95
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:43,474
paying particular attention that <i>ω0 = 1/RC</i>.

96
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:49,584
Here's a recap of what we've just seen and
the calculations that we've just made.

97
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:54,424
We've got a transfer function <i>H(jω)</i>

98
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:58,424
that equals <i>-1/jωRC</i>.

99
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:01,139
When we studied the Bode diagram

100
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,979
in such a way,

101
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:04,679
if you remember correctly,

102
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,469
the Bode diagram functions

103
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:11,009
with pure imaginary. With the imaginary that
is found within the denominator,

104
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:16,949
it's a slope that equals -20dB/decade

105
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:21,969
and this corresponds to the integrating effect
for a sinusoidal voltage.

106
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:26,462
So, if you would like to see a sinusoidal voltage
that is integrated,

107
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:31,902
you need to go right here, where the slope
equals -20dB/decade.

108
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:33,652
Why am I pushing this point?

109
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:36,752
Because later on, you'll see that this
type of integrator

110
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:39,262
is always used with a resistance

111
00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:43,262
that we're going to put in parallel
with the capacitor <i>C</i>.

112
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:47,318
To achieve a certain gain
that we call a gain

113
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:52,768
that will express a plateau in the
asymptotic diagram here

114
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:56,198
and this will mean that when I've got
this type of functioning

115
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:59,178
the blue curve has a constant value.

116
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:03,178
After I find this slope of -20dB/decade,

117
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:06,608
and yes, you need to go past this pole,

118
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:10,718
in any case, put yourself ten times over the
value of the pole

119
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:12,128
from the transfer function,

120
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:16,128
somewhere here to see the integration value

121
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:18,428
of a sinusoidal voltage placed
at the input

122
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:20,678
and see the integration at the output.

123
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:24,072
To recap what I've just said.

124
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:26,628
I take my integrator.

125
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:30,637
I see my capacitor in a negative feedback
loop between the input and the output

126
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:31,917
and on the negative terminal

127
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,327
and I see my resistance <i>R1</i>,

128
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,467
which is the input
resistance on this application.

129
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:40,257
I've added the resistance <i>R2</i> in parallel with
the capacitor here.

130
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:43,986
I'll write down the transfer function of this.

131
00:07:43,986 --> 00:07:47,496
Always, when dealing
with this type of application,

132
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:51,496
we take the impedance
that is in negative feedback

133
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:54,846
and we express it in the complex domain.

134
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,941
We do the same with the impedance here

135
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,652
and we express it with its complex impedance.

136
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:05,652
So, I'm going to call this complex impedance <i>Z2.</i>.

137
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,902
I'm going to call this impedance complex <i>Z1.</i>

138
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,710
and I'm going to write <i>Z2</i> and <i>Z1</i>.

139
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,340
So here, the complex impedance <i>Z2</i>,

140
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,560
is an impedance placed in parallel

141
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,550
with <i>R2</i> parallel with a capacitor.

142
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:30,487
So I'm going to write <i>1/Z2</i>,
to make things easier,

143
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:35,167
which is simply <i>1/R2</i>

144
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:38,167
<i>+ jωC</i>.

145
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:41,147
I've simplified it.

146
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:53,517
Once inverted, I'll find that it's <i>R2/1 + jωC</i>.

147
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:57,174
Here's the impedance <i>Z2</i> that we've achieved.

148
00:08:57,174 --> 00:09:00,224
The impedance <i>Z1</i>, is really easy:
I get it directly,

149
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:03,534
it's a real number and equals the resistance <i>R1</i>.

150
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:05,923
Now all we need to do is make the connection

151
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:09,543
between this impedance and this impedance
and I add a minus sign in front

152
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:12,213
in order to find the transfer function  <i>H</i>

153
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:16,213
which equals <i>-Z2</i>

154
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:19,404
divided by <i>Z1</i>.

155
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,957
So I take <i>Z2</i> and <i>Z1</i>
and I can say

156
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:25,397
equals <i>-R2</i> divided by <i>R1</i>

157
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:28,957
that multiplies 1 over

158
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:34,207
<i>1 + jωRC</i>.

159
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:39,727
And there, I've forgotten a resistance <i>R2</i>
that I bring down again

160
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:43,727
before the capacitor <i>R2</i>

161
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:46,077
that multiplies <i>jωC</i>,
that I'd forgotten before.

162
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:51,465
To summarise what we've just seen and the

163
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,875
calculations that we've just made,

164
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:57,335
written properly with the impedance <i>Z2</i>,
the impedance <i>Z1</i>,

165
00:09:57,335 --> 00:10:00,705
the transfer function <i>-Z2/Z1</i>

166
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:06,245
we fall on this figure which is a
clear and net gain

167
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:07,625
<i>R2/R1</i>.

168
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,875
So we see the component,

169
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,475
or rather the value that is like
an inverter,

170
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:15,035
an inverter amplifier,

171
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:17,815
that's the relationship between
<i>R2</i> divided by <i>R1</i>

172
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:21,679
that multiplies the transfert function

173
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,399
1 over <i>1 + jω</i> over <i>ω0</i>

174
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,139
and we replcae <i>ω0</i> with <i>1/R2C</i>

175
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,639
and we call it the transfer function pole.

176
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:36,369
I'm going to take this transfer function

177
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:40,919
and trace the transfer function
onto the Bode diagram

178
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,219
that's here.

179
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:45,502
I take the transfer function.

180
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,418
I can divide it into two.

181
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:53,917
I take the green part,

182
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:57,702
<i>R2/R1</i>.

183
00:10:58,065 --> 00:11:01,815
Which is the component without the <i>ω</i>,

184
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:04,185
therefore there is no frequency effect on it.

185
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:08,095
Remembering that <i>ω = 2 x π x f</i>,

186
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:10,395
therefore it's directly proportional,

187
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:12,965
the pulsation is proportional to the frequency.

188
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,795
So, you've got <i>R2/R1</i>

189
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:20,835
and you can say that you've 20log of <i>R2/R1</i>

190
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:25,865
reported in a Bode diagram to consider the
number of decibels.

191
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,818
I take the function

192
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:33,488
<i>1/jω/ω0</i> again

193
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:36,268
that will give me on a asymptotic diagram

194
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:40,268
something in blue.

195
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:45,601
And I've got the transfer function pole that
can be found at <i>ω0</i>.

196
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:49,601
Knowing the value <i>R2</i>
and the value <i>C</i>,

197
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:52,061
I'm going to take that up to a point

198
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:54,911
and I'm going to create the
asymptotic Bode diagram.

199
00:11:54,911 --> 00:12:01,531
You'll find the Bode diagram on this part
here, in blue,

200
00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:03,406
asymptotic diagram,

201
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,856
and you find the independent gain frequency

202
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:08,366
that's in the green part, which is here.

203
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:12,301
And I carry out the addition of this curve
with this curve here,

204
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:16,601
and I see that the red curve that corresponds
to the sum of the two

205
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:19,821
and the Bode diagram that we will have measured,

206
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:23,821
goes to three decibels in relation to this point,

207
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:26,761
so, there is -3dB
between the asymptotic diagram

208
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:28,981
and the diagram that we have measured

209
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,831
and that's what we're going to do in the laboratory

210
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:37,951
to take into account the points brought down
and the points that we will have traced

211
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:40,539
with the asymptotic Bode diagram.

212
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:44,126
We call that a "Low-pass filter".

213
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,260
It's easy to understand what that means.

214
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,605
We recognise a pulsation <i>ω0</i>

215
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:54,445
that equals <i>2 x π x f0,</i>

216
00:12:54,445 --> 00:12:57,240
so, <i>f0</i> is a frequency,

217
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,900
multiplied by <i>2π</i>, that gives
us this value

218
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,590
and that we see is directly proportional
to the values <i>1/R2C</i>.

219
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,590
So, you just need to choose a resistance
<i>R2</i> and <i>C</i>

220
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,180
and get directly the <i>2 π x f0</i>.

221
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,960
In practice, what do we do?

222
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,330
We want to limit the frequency range

223
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,170
on the asymptotic diagram to a signal

224
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,380
with a value of <i>f0</i>,
and that will give us <i>w0</i>,

225
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,107
we know that it will follow this
type of attenuation

226
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,077
so it will be multiplied by the gain.

227
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:36,087
And from here, it will follow the blue curve,

228
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:39,347
so we see that the output amplitude,

229
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:45,407
remember that it’s the relation module of
the voltage output

230
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,007
over the voltage input,

231
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:52,577
and therefore the module is the output
amplitude divided by the input amplitude

232
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:57,777
which will be multiplied by a gain proportional
to the resistance <i>R2/R1</i>

233
00:13:57,777 --> 00:14:01,377
and when you start to go over,
on the asymptotic diagram,

234
00:14:01,377 --> 00:14:02,717
the value <i>ω0</i>,

235
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,557
you see, you'll lose 20dB to every ten.

236
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:08,627
So, for each multiplication of pulsation by 10

237
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:11,427
you'll lose 20dB.

238
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:15,047
You can see it by this relationship and this
curve demonstrates it.

239
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:19,427
And we call this a "filtre passe-bass"

240
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:23,427
because the bass frequencies are multiplied
by a gain

241
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:28,047
and the high frequencies are obtained
according to this curve that we see here.
