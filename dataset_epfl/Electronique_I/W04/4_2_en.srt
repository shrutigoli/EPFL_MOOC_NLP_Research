1
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:07,565
I'm now going to ask you into
the laboratory

2
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:09,575
where you can take an ideal op-amp,

3
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:12,325
and to plug it in and power it up,

4
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:15,205
and to choose the values that I
have suggested here,

5
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:18,505
a resistance of 330kΩ,

6
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:21,335
a resistance of 3.3 here

7
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:25,335
and a capacitor of 47nF.

8
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:29,802
If I told you that we would make
an integrator with this here,

9
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:34,712
why have we added a resistance of 330kΩ in
parallel with the capacitor?

10
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:38,907
If that resistance wasn't there,

11
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:41,067
what would happen to the amp?

12
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:45,798
The amp would have,
I'll write over this side,

13
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,139
it would have a negative feedback capacitor

14
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:54,921
and a resistance,

15
00:00:55,966 --> 00:01:02,826
and a voltage input value <i>V1</i>
in relation to the volume.

16
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:07,497
And we're interested in the volume output, <i>V2</i>.

17
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:10,552
Remember that a capacitor

18
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:14,612
will always behave in accordance with
the voltage at the terminals

19
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:15,882
with the derivative,

20
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:21,532
the current that's going through it, <i>C</i> times <i>du/dt</i>,
gives us the current <i>I</i>.

21
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:27,568
What would happen if somewhere
in this voltage <i>V1</i>

22
00:01:27,568 --> 00:01:29,368
there was a continuous component?

23
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:33,468
So, there isn't a sinusoidal power source,

24
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:37,468
but there is a default source that is present,

25
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:39,918
that adds a small continuous component.

26
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:42,238
Remember that the continuous component,

27
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:44,978
the capacitor reacts as in an open circuit

28
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:46,458
to this continuous component,

29
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,548
as if the capacitor doesn't exist.

30
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:53,026
So, if the capacitor doesn't exist,

31
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:57,014
and you'll see, your amplifier looks
something like this.

32
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,540
And you have a voltage source <i>V1</i> in relation
to the volume.

33
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:10,019
And you have the voltage <i>V2</i> here.

34
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:12,231
So there's no current passing through here.

35
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,541
<i>I</i> equals 0.

36
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,311
The continuous current...

37
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:17,037
Anyhow, for the capacitor,

38
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,327
the capacitor behaves as in an
open circuit.

39
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:21,087
The current doesn't enter the amp.

40
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:23,857
So, we've got a simple
comparator schema,

41
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:27,327
so the voltage <i>V1</i> compares
to a 0 potential.

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,510
So it only needs a tiny continuous
component here

43
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,840
so that the voltage <i>V2</i> saturates
either to <i>Vsat+</i>,

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,420
or to <i>Vsat-</i>.

45
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,320
So we'd find ourselves with an amplifier
that would saturate on one side or the other,

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,140
if we hadn't put in this resistance.

47
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:51,411
The fact that we have put in a resistance

48
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:55,921
in parallel that equals 330kΩ,

49
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:59,921
so we put in a resistance here,

50
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:04,841
this resistance here will take into
account the continuous component.

51
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,806
So the continuous component will pass,

52
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:13,896
the continuous current,
I'll write down <i>IDC</i>,

53
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:17,896
it will pass through here

54
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:21,613
and, it won't pass into the capacitor,

55
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:24,233
because the capacitor behaves as in
an open circuit.

56
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:26,433
So you'll have an amplifier

57
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:28,313
that for a continuous current,

58
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:30,103
will give you a constant gain

59
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:33,033
that will be 330kΩ divided by 3.3.

60
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:37,823
And it's what we are going to try
to demonstrate through a practical

61
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:41,823
experiment that we will carry out later on.

62
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:44,843
We need to remember another thing,

63
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:48,843
if you intend to use this amplifier as
an integrator,

64
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:52,843
it goes without saying that you should
use a sinusoidal voltage.

65
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:55,923
The sinusoidal voltage should be
ten times higher

66
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:59,923
than the transfer function pole

67
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:02,753
in order for your amplifier to behave
like an integrator.

68
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:05,133
Otherwise, the resistance will always
come into effect

69
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:09,133
that we would have put in place
to counteract the fact that there

70
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:11,213
was a DC current.

71
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:14,553
There is another thing that you should
be aware of,

72
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:17,103
that we'll look at in more detail later on
in another chapter,

73
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:21,683
and that's the fact that the amplifier,
despite being connected to the volume,

74
00:04:21,683 --> 00:04:26,843
has an imperfection that we call the
voltage <i>offset</i>.

75
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,848
The voltage <i>offset</i> is a default
of the amplifier.

76
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:33,098
We haven't spoken about it yet, we'll
cover it later on.

77
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:36,368
So, even if the voltage here doesn't have
a continuous component,

78
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:42,758
the fact that there is a small <i>offset</i>
of some milli-volts added by the amplifier,

79
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:46,048
is enough to provoke the phenomenon

80
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:48,748
that I've just explained,

81
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:51,198
and will push my amplifier into
saturation.

82
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,130
Exactly as if we had made an

83
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,880

integrated amplifier,

84
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,330
we're going to make an amplifier,
an amplifier application,

85
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,360
that will make the derivative.

86
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:06,241
I think that here, there's no need to
keep repeating the same thing,

87
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:09,141
that's to talk about the voltage <i>V1</i>,
and the voltage <i>V2</i>,

88
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:13,561
I think that it's now clear that the same
current goes through them both.

89
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:17,294
We have inverted the resistance and
the capacitor

90
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:22,484
with an integrated application
and we have installed it differently,

91
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:24,214
i.e. the opposite way round,

92
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:26,884
to make a differentiating application.

93
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:29,224
So if you note that the current is the same,

94
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:33,224
and you write the temporal laws in relation
to the capacitor and the resistance,

95
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:36,459
you will arrive directly at this relationship

96
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,099
that tells you that the same current,

97
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:42,189
flowing through the resistance and
the capacitor

98
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:43,869
gives you the relationship,

99
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:47,869
that when you express the voltage <i> V2</i> in
function of the voltage,

100
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:50,469
rather than the value of the
voltage derivative <i> V1</i>

101
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:53,009
because it's the capacitor
that is going to come into effect

102
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,569
you will land directly on an expression
that tells you

103
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,909
that the voltage output is proportional

104
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,909
to the input voltage derivative multiplied
by the constant <i>RC</i>

105
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,119
with a minus sign in front.

106
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:11,511
This same application, if you connect a
sinusoidal voltage to the input

107
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,622
the same as an integrator,

108
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:18,782
we're going to replace the capacitor by
its impedance <i>ZC</i>,

109
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:22,143
that equals <i>1/jωC</i>,

110
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:25,813
and the resistance <i>R</i> by <i>ZR</i>,

111
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:28,923
which is equal to the value of the
resistance <i>R</i>,

112
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:32,613
and we're going to make the relationship
between this impedance here

113
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:34,633
divided by this impedance here

114
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:38,633
and put that with a minus sign in front,

115
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:43,603
and we're going to find the following expression.

116
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:49,688
The transfer function value <i>H(jω)</i>

117
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:51,948
equals <i>-Z2/Z1</i>,

118
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:55,948
with <i>Z2</i> is a resistance and
<i>Z1</i> is a capacitor,

119
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,208
will give you a transfer function
equal to

120
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,648
<i>-jωRC</i>.

121
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:03,733
When we apply that to a Bode diagram module,

122
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:07,073
it's a slope of 20dB/décade

123
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:11,073
that passes the point that equals <i>1/RC</i>.

124
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:15,275
So, this same application, when used
in practice,

125
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:18,055
we always tend to put...

126
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:21,125
so, remembering that the application
with the resistance

127
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:25,125
that comes with negative feedback <i>R</i>,

128
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,465
and we have a capacitor at the input

129
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:33,325
and this application, to avoid having
a continuous component

130
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,115
that arrives directly on the negative terminal,

131
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:39,295
we put a resistance in series with the capacitor.

132
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:43,655
Remember that in an integrated application,

133
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:45,745
we find the capacitor here,

134
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:48,645
and we had put a resistance in parallel

135
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:52,855
so that the continuous current passes
through the resistance

136
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:54,475
rather than through the capacitor.

137
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:57,331
And here, at very high frequency,

138
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:59,861
when the capacitor behaves like a short circuit,

139
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:01,381
when <i>ω</i> reaches infinity,

140
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:05,381
so that we are somewhere along way on
the pulsation axis.

141
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:12,114
So, we still would like to limit the
amplifier's gain

142
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:14,454
so that the output voltage doesn't saturate.

143
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,424
So we're going to put a resistance in series
with the capacitor

144
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:21,664
so that the capacitor, when it's the equivalent
of a short circuit,

145
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:23,804
because <i>ω</i> reaches infinity,

146
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:27,124
so <i>Z</i> reaches 0 for the capacitor,

147
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:29,434
it's the equivalent of a short-circuit,

148
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:32,404
and we'll have a gain that is the relationship
of <i>R</i>

149
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:34,274
divided by <i>R1</i>.

150
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,580
We began with a general introduction
as to what

151
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,440
is an operational amplifier.

152
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,720
We used the amplifier as if it was
a circuit

153
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,700
or a negative feedback application

154
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,320
where the resistances made the
negative feedback loop

155
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,840
of the amplifier,

156
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,160
which demonstrated that the gain
is independent of the frequency.

157
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,210
So we can create a gain with this
type of amplifier

158
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,880
and we made two applications.

159
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,450
The so-called inverting application

160
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,450
from which we
extracted different characteristics,

161
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,070
such as virtual volume.

162
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,550
We did this with a summing application.

163
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,960
We followed on
with the non-inverting application

164
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,990
and the non-inverting application is
an application

165
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,410
that has an input that corresponds to infinity,

166
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,730
an input impedance equals to infinity,

167
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,990
a positive gain.

168
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,540
We followed on with some applications

169
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,540
notably we made an application that allowed
us to make

170
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,970
a negative impedance.

171
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,810
We also did the voltage buffer.

172
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:41,190
To finish off, we studied the integrator
function and the derivative function

173
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,450
to demonstrate that the op-amp
applications

174
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,230
can be about components that are frequency
dependant

175
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,980
and that it allows us
to modify the amplifier's gain

176
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,290
in function to the voltage input
frequency.
