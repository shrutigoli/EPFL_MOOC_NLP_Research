1
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:07,052
I'm going to take the example 
of this amplifier

2
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:09,192
with the two resistances
such as we have said here,

3
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:11,482
and we're going to see
what will happen at the output.

4
00:00:11,482 --> 00:00:15,602
So first I'll start
by analysing the condition of the amp

5
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:17,672
when I impose
a voltage at the input.

6
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:22,692
And I'll take an example
where I'll put V(in) equals to 1V.

7
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:27,973
And to simplify the process
and to take a practical example,

8
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:31,973
I'm going to try and say that <i>R</i> and <i>R</i>,

9
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:35,973
therefore I don't have<i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i>,
I have two resistances that are the same,

10
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:40,533
so I'm going to end up with this 
which will be equal to 1/2.

11
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:45,131
So I'm going to end up with V(out)
multiplied by<i>R</i> divided twice <i>R</i>,

12
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:47,421
then I'll find myself here

13
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:51,761
with something 
which is equal to V(out) divided by 2.

14
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:55,081
When this amplifier
will act with a diagram,

15
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,601
so we've taken an ideal amplifier.

16
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:01,601
We plugged in a voltage DC
at the constant input equalling to 1V.

17
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:03,682
We put two resistances.

18
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:06,512
So the amplifier will end up 
in a state at the output,

19
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:07,562
what state?

20
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:10,879
When you take
and plug in the amplifier,

21
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,629
it will end up
in a state of saturation,

22
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:15,059
this is always the case.

23
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:17,899
We will see why later
when we analyse the amplifier

24
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:19,429
with its imperfections

25
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:21,959
and you will see, it always
starts in a state

26
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,649
where V(out) will be
at a saturation voltage.

27
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:26,629
We can't predict which one it is.

28
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:30,279
It can either be <i>VCC+</i> or <i>VCC-</i>.

29
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:34,629
I'm going to take the example where I've
a positive supply

30
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,225
equal to +15V,

31
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:42,225
and a negative supply equal to -15V.

32
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:50,111
And I'll suppose that the saturation voltage
of the positive amplifier,

33
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:54,123
is the state of 15V that I will find
again with my amplifier.

34
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:57,279
So this amplifier will first start 
as soon as I plug it in,

35
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:59,489
it gives me 15V at the output.

36
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,419
And a resistive divider.

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,890
This resistive divider will take 
a proportion of this voltage.

38
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,780
Therefore it'll bring this voltage,
it'll multiply it by half.

39
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,350
It will divide them by 2.

40
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,680
Therefore I'll end up
with a voltage here equal to 7,5V here.

41
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:22,049
This 7,5V is connected
to the negative terminal of my amplifier.

42
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,019
When the positive terminal is equal to 1,

43
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,449
what will happen at this moment?

44
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,469
Let's imagine that time stopped,

45
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:33,469
that this amplifier, once it's 
performing this comparison,

46
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:36,879
it left the saturation,
it lowered the voltage,

47
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,199
and it will carry out a comparison.

48
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,199
It will find itself 
with a voltage on the positive terminal

49
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,549
which is equal to 1V

50
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,519
and a voltage on the negative terminal
which is equal to 7,5V.

51
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,849
So it goes without saying that this 7,5V
on the negative terminal

52
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,279
is superior to this 1V.

53
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:57,039
What will the amplifier do?

54
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:03,529
The amplifier will saturate and push
the saturation voltage

55
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:07,529
towards the negative saturation voltage.

56
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:09,789
So I'll find myself
with this voltage

57
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,789
which will tend towards <i>Vsat-</i>.

58
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:15,529
And this is what will happen.

59
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,769
So its output will look for the -15V.

60
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,849
It will look for the 
negative saturation voltage.

61
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,979
And will it be able to do it?

62
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,914
Well, we will see this.

63
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,214
This is what will happen.

64
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:30,074
I'll take the same scenario again.

65
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:37,953
The only relation
that links the input to the output

66
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:41,723
and which describes that when the amplifier
was at its positive saturation.

67
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:44,433
Remember that we were
saying at the very beginning,

68
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,133
it ended up at this voltage here.

69
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,253
At the input, we had the 1V.

70
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:54,583
At the output, here, we had 7,5V.

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,370
And the 7,5Vs are supposed
to push my amplifier from here,

72
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,890
and it will saturate 
towards the negative voltage.

73
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,040
But what is it going to do?

74
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,900
It will travel along this curve.

75
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,320
So it will, from this voltage here,
it will go down to this curve here

76
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,860
and will go and look for 
the saturation voltage.

77
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,650
Until where?
It will arrive at a point.

78
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,740
If this point here corresponds
to an output voltage,

79
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,840
and this output voltage,

80
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,510
it will go through a voltage equal to 2V.

81
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,821
And when it reaches 
this voltage equal to 2V,

82
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,631
and if you look at
what is written on this diagram here,

83
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:36,001
this diagram describes
an absolutely linear relation

84
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:39,261
in which the amplifier could not
move anymore. Why?

85
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:42,641
Because everything is verified
as mathematical law.

86
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:48,421
The mathematical laws are going to say
that its gain <i>A</i> is equal to infinite.

87
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:53,407
If this gain <i>A</i> is equal to infinite
and the outcome 2V,

88
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:57,407
2V divided by infinite will say 
that <i>ΔV</i> is equal to 0.

89
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:00,099
If <i>ΔV</i> is equal to 0,

90
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,759
then this voltage here is equal 
to this voltage here.

91
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,369
Let's check if it's true.

92
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:05,479
Well yes, of course.

93
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,409
We took an example <i>R</i> and <i>R</i>,

94
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,509
so it divides the output voltage by 2

95
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,809
and at the moment where it's leaving
the saturation voltage

96
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:16,299
while looking for its negative
voltage saturation,

97
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:20,159
so for it, it looked for 
the instability towards the <i>Vsat-</i>,

98
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,449
it found itself at a point,
it couldn't go out of the impasse.

99
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,749
We have a relation
between the input and the output

100
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:29,749
which perfectly verifies 
that relation which says,

101
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:32,249
for the amplifier itself,

102
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:37,689
that voltage is equal to this one,
that is 1V here and 1V there.

103
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:41,499
This voltage there links it
to an output voltage,

104
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:42,749
which is equal to 2V.

105
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:46,349
This voltage here is linked up to this one
by the resistive divider

106
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:49,939
which brings me back to V(out)
multiplied by 1/2 is equal to 1V,

107
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,939
so it will stay stuck in this point here
and it is in its linear zone.

108
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:57,362
So an amplifier is found,

109
00:05:57,362 --> 00:06:00,362
even if in the beginning 
it came from here or from there,

110
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:03,732
it's going to end up stuck
in the linear zone

111
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:08,762
because the relation of circuit
when we added the resistive divider

112
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:11,582
links the output voltage
to the input voltage

113
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:15,582
by an absolutely linear law
that which is written here.

114
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:19,781
So this voltage will tell us
that the output voltage V(out),

115
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,636
it is absolutely equal to V(in)

116
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:29,846
which is multiplied by <i>(1+R/R)</i>

117
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:33,846
which is this relation that you see here.

118
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:38,968
Your amplifier is found therefore
by the resistive divider

119
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:43,998
equal to <i>y</i> is equal <i>A</i> times <i>x</i>.

120
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:47,998
So it's a linear relation
and it'll stay in the linear zone.

121
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:51,328
Let's analyse again what'll happen
in a linear zone.

122
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,540
In this zone that is shown
which is linear from here to here,

123
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,080
it's a zone where all the points
that belong here

124
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,460
all correspond
to a state <i>V+</i> is equal to <i>V-</i>.

125
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,538
Therefore so long as the amplifier
links up its output voltage to its

126
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:15,528
voltage <i>V+</i> and <i>V-</i> which corresponds
to a point that is found here,

127
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:21,242
these types of relations will always
stay in relation between...

128
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,680
connecting the voltage V(in) to V(out)

129
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,280
and we can say for any
value of V(in):

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,440
as long as the amplifier is neither
on the positive saturation,

131
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,440
nor the negative saturation,
it is in a counter-reaction,

132
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,140
this means we take a proportion
of the output voltage,

133
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,580
we bring it back to the input after having
multiplied by a certain constant,

134
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,700
and it has an equality which determines
that when its gain here inside,

135
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,270
and it's completely the case,

136
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,440
its gain is equal to infinite,
its gain absolutely equals to infinite,

137
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,400
it'll guarantee us that <i>ΔV</i> equals to 0

138
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,940
so any point of this curve here 
confirms this relation

139
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,940
and your amplifier will stay here inside

140
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,990
and we call that an operational
amplifier in negative reaction.

152
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:10,114
And so, we've just seen
so far

153
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,184
that an amplifier can be used
in an open loop.

154
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:15,734
We have given a demonstration
of how an amplifier

155
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:20,504
when we add a resistive divisor,
it could be used in a closed loop.

156
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:23,934
And we'll start
to make several circuits

157
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:27,844
which use the amplifier just 
to cover the functions

158
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:33,214
which allow to integrate or perform
electronic functionalities,

159
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:36,674
whether it's in an open loop 
in positive reaction

160
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:38,394
or in a closed loop.

161
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:42,394
I'll start by showing you
the qualities of electronic applications

162
00:08:42,394 --> 00:08:46,394
that are related to what we call
an amplifier in open loop.

163
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,530
So an amplifier in an open loop
could be used 

164
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,150
as a comparator, we've seen it already.

165
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,150
It would allow us to shape
digital signals.

166
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,762
It would allow us to make
path detections by zero.

167
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:04,812
We also looked at it as 
a presentation of an amplifier

168
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:08,812
simply by plugging in a signal
on the positive or negative input

169
00:09:08,812 --> 00:09:10,222
and making the comparison.

170
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:12,572
It allows to make 
a level detection

171
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:18,032
and many, many other applications
which have an analog input 

172
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:20,207
and whose output is digital.

173
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:21,757
Now the positive reaction,

174
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:24,347
is something 
we'll see later,

175
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:26,987
is how we use 
the amplifier 

176
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:31,277
to make a flip-flop 
or an oscillator 

177
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:37,447
or many other functions where the output
and input are absolutely non-linear

178
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:39,837
but of which the relation 
between the input and the output

179
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:43,237
would allow to operate 
the capacity of the amplifier 

180
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:46,507
to stay with a voltage <i>Vsat+</i> or <i>Vsat-</i>.

181
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:50,507
The applications of the amplifier 
now in a closed loop.

182
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:55,807
These applications are absolutely 
of an impressive quantity 

183
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:58,077
because they would allow us to make 

184
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:00,547
all the linear functions 
in the electronics area.

185
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:03,345
Let's see as an introduction 
what we could do 

186
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:05,845
with an amplifier 
when we use the output 

187
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:08,865
brought back on the negative terminal 
by a division 

188
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:11,395
through resistances 
or impedances.

189
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:14,505
That would allow us to see 
applications such as 

190
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:18,505
everything that is linked to the
making of an amplifier, an audio amplifier,

191
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:23,035
this is a signal which comes from a micro 
that gets amplified by an amplifier 

192
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:24,615
and sent back to the output. 

193
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:27,595
The gain can be positive or negative.

194
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:30,165
We can make 
current-voltage converters,

195
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:32,885
therefore receiving a signal 
which is a current at the input 

196
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:35,115
and converting it in voltage at the output. 

197
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:38,725
We can make many functions 
linked to the frequency,

198
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,555
so making filters.

199
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:43,235
And we'll finish after 
with non-linear circuits,

200
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:47,655
such as rectifiers without threshold 
or limiters amplifiers. 

201
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:51,655
And there you go with this we just finished 
an introduction

202
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:53,855
for the operational amplifier 

203
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:57,855
and we've seen that by putting the operational
amplifier in a closed loop,

204
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:01,855
therefore adding two resistances 
which bring a portion 

205
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:04,115
of the output voltage 
on the negative terminal,

206
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:07,105
we obtain with this an amplifier 
which has a gain,

207
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:09,965
it's a positive gain 
and always superior to 1.
