1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,920
The first lesson about
operational amplifiers

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,400
consists in describing
the circuit itself.

3
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,700
Then, we'll talk about
the negative reaction

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,640
followed much later on by 
what is called the positive reaction.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,480
We will start with 
a short introduction

6
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:22,990
and we'll go over
all of the symbols,

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,120
look at voltage and 
the flow of electric current,

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,316
and how to power
an operational amplifier (op-amp).

9
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:31,300
And straight after this, we'll go on
to examine this type of amplifier

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,372
in a range of circuitries.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,300
These circuitries will exemplify
what we call

12
00:00:37,508 --> 00:00:40,734
a frequency-independent amplifier,

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,560
which means that
once this op-amp

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,660
has been connected
to an electronic circuit,

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,440
the input and output are
independent from frequency variations.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,500
This is an example of  linear function.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,220
This will bring us to consider
the topic of filters.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,820
Inside the filters,
we've got an op-amp

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,340
which will be connected 

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,880
and which would allow us
to vary the amplifier gain

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,530
in line with frequency variations.

22
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:08,933
Here's an example
of an op-amp

23
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:11,432
or rather what we find
 inside the amp.

24
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:13,479
You can see there are
a lot of transistors.

25
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,160
All of these transistors will
perform a different function

26
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,360
to allow this op-amp 
to display the characteristics  

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,880
which we'll examine
as we go through this chapter.

28
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:24,412
So, as you can see,
this is a very complex process.

29
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,180
These transistors, which
 inside here are of MOS type

30
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:29,326
display quite a few functionalities

31
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,290
This type of circuit 
would be integrated to a chip

32
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:35,080
or to a silicon base .

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,320
In the end, we do not show
anything about what's inside.

34
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:46,408
We'll have to limit our observation to
the input of this op-amp which is here,

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,160
a second input, to be found is there,

36
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:53,202
two supply voltages which
bring power to the circuit,

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,520
and an output.

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,680
So, in the end, there will be
 five tracks to the circuit

39
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,460
and this circuit will be later
represented by a triangle

40
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:08,778
with two inputs, one output
in addition to two voltage supplies.

41
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,190
What we will mainly look at
is this symbol.

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,190
Once all of the transistors
are marked in this triangle,

43
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:23,275
this triangle comes to
represent the op-amp

44
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,360
which  has one positive imput,

45
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,840
one negative input,

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,080
and an ouput.

47
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:33,226
In addition to one positive 
and one negative voltage supply,

48
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:34,767
and this is very, very important.

49
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,830
These two voltage supplies are going to
bring power to the electrical circuit

50
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:43,953
with a positive current
going one way,

51
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:51,563
and a negative current
going the other,

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,180
and all of this will work
in relation to a reference point

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,500
between input and output,

54
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,920
called the ground.

55
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,020
Here we have:

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,350
a positive voltage supply,
a negative voltage supply,

57
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:09,696
and a common point between the input
and the output which we call the ground,

58
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,298
and this type of  diagram outlines

59
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:15,067
everything included in the integrated circuit

60
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:18,479
what is required to power it up
and to give it a reference point.

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,370
However, once we've begun
to use this op-amp

62
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:24,269
we'll stop drawing 
the +Vcc and the -Vcc signs.

63
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,707
What remains is the mass potential
which is essential.

64
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,860
Today, we're simply going
to look at this slide,

65
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:37,506
and as soon as we've moved on
to the circuits based on the op-amp,

66
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:40,365
you'll see that the +Vcc and the -Vcc
will disappear.

67
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,520
The perfect op-amp has certain characteristics
which allow it to

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,390
on one hand, amplify to a gain A = ∞;

69
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,700
and on the other hand, there is
an input resistance which is also infinite.

70
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:05,140
This means that when you look at the current
that will be absorbed by the op-amp,

71
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,280
it will be summarised as a I=0 current.

72
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,000
We've said that 
there are two inputs.

73
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,960
In either of these inputs,

74
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,000
no current feeds 
into the amp.

75
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,540
Therefore, this amp merely receives
two voltage supplies, V(+) and V(-),

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,620
and both these voltage supplies 
will be infinitely multiplied

77
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,200
and sent back 
towards the output.

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,860
Now, when we look at the output,

79
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:29,132
the output resistance of this 
op-amp is equal to zero.

80
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,560
This means that the resistance
which should have been there,

81
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,410
in series with this source of controlled
voltage supply that you see at the output,

82
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:39,800
this resistance 
that should be here,

83
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,886
just does not exist.

84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,120
So, we've got absolutely 
no series resistance

85
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,460
with a controlled voltage source

86
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,560
that picks up a difference in the voltage
V(+) - V(-) which is called ΔV

87
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,840
and which will be multiplied by a A= V gain.

88
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:02,530
These three characteristics 
show a typical op-amp with:

89
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,420
an infinite gain,
an infinite input resistance,

90
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,734
and an output resistance
that equals zero,

91
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,700
This will the type of op-amp

92
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,140
that we'll be using 
throughout this introduction

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
before starting to look at 

94
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,960
what we refer to as
the imperfections the op-amp,

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,020
when we will see that there are
certain characteristics

96
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:26,141
which aren't as ideal as 
those we see on an ideal op-amp.

97
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,080
Let's look a bit closer at 
how this amp works.

98
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,770
Unluckily, or rather luckily,

99
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,140
the voltage output is saturated
Unluckily, or rather luckily,

100
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,000
the voltage output is saturated

101
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,160
The voltage ouput V(out) 
can't in anyway

102
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,840
exceed the positive voltage supply

103
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
and the negative voltage supply.

104
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,070
This means that V(out) is limited by 
what we call Vsat(+) and Vsat(-)

105
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,840
which are nothing more
than voltage saturation values,

106
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,220
which in the first case,

107
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,380
have been equalised
by the voltage supply.

108
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,940
It goes without saying that 
we find op-amps on the market

109
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,320
that have a positive and 
negative voltage saturation

110
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,190
that are not at the same levels 
as the voltage supply.

111
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,780
Here is the characteristic which
connects the input voltage V(+) - V(-)

112
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,960
to the voltage output V(out).

113
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,260
We can distinguish two zones.

114
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,400
One positive saturation zone, 
and a negative one,

115
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,505
we call it saturation, we've just had 
a look at it just now,

116
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,620
and a very interesting feature
of this op-amp

117
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,280
which will constitute the topic of
how to use this op-amp in linear circuits,

118
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,120
which is referred to 
as the linear amplification zone.

119
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:47,300
If you look now at how
an op-amp reacts to a signal.

120
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,580
We just said that there are
two voltage saturations,

121
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,580
Vsat(+) and Vsat(-),

122
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,520
and here, it's about non-linearity

123
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,800
because we can't go
any further than that.

124
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,310
We lose the linearity.

125
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,497
and, between these two voltage saturations,
we have a straight line.

126
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,580
And this straight line here,
we call it the linear zone,

127
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,660
and it's this linear zone

128
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:11,171
that creates the amplification function
of this op-amp.

129
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,928
Let's see how 
all this interacts  into a circuit.

130
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,260
Let’s just summarise 
what we've just said.

131
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,620
We've just said that 
the voltage an op-amp

132
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,860
cannot go over 
the two voltage supplies,

133
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,260
that we represent by +Vcc et -Vcc.

134
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,437
We've also said that 
the linear zone is a zone where

135
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,530
the voltage output is linked 
to the difference
between V(+) - V(-)

136
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,080
that we call ΔV and which is 
multiplied by a gain.

137
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,800
We've also said that 
the gain is infinite.

138
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,540
We've said that this part here, 
is the part that interests us the  most

139
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,154
when we want to create linear circuits.

140
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:54,214
It is inside this linear zone

141
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:58,700
that the op-amp should create,
within a given circuit,

142
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,920
a connection between V(out)
and a input voltage V(in)

143
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,180
which we're going to  look at next.

144
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,240
If we don't have this linear zone,

145
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,300
the op-amp is basically non-linear,

146
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,300
il will be torn between two voltage levels 
that will cause it to block.

147
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,790
So, these are power supply tracks.

148
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,290
So within the linear zone that we've just seen,

149
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:27,200
we can formulate it 
like this in English:

150
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,540
if the op-amp output is 
neither Vsat(+) nor Vsat(-)

151
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:40,560
and the output voltage 
is strictly below Vsat(+)

152
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,060
and strictly more than Vsat(-),

153
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,920
then yes, we can say that our op-amp 
is fixed in this relation here,

154
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,520
it is in the linear zone.

155
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,420
And here we can draw 
an interesting conclusion,

156
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:55,676
that when the op-amp, 
which has infinite gain,

157
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,440
because this A here is equal to infinity,

158
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,940
when this gain is equal to infinity,

159
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,880
independently from the output voltage

160
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,420
knowing that the voltage can't ever 
go over Vsat(+) et Vsat(-),

161
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,320
Of course, the difference 
in voltage is zero.

162
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,620
So, if this difference equals zero,

163
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,180
the potential in this node here is equal 
to the potential in that node there.

164
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,770
And it's this characteristic 
that will allow us to

165
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:22,814
achieve a wide variety of 
functions in electronics,

166
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:27,148
and we're going to use the op-amp
in a purely linear function,

167
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,150
and a direct relation y = x will
connect V(out) to V(in).

168
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,080
We're going to see 
how this will be confirmed

169
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,530
within the context of a
negative feedback circuit,

170
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:41,974
caused by a negative reaction.

171
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,230
Let's see 
if I can use my op-amp

172
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,280
within the positive or 
negative saturation zones,

173
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,800
therefore in a non-linear function.

174
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,100
For any input value V(+) - V(-),

175
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:59,600
independent of this value,
we have a unique output value,

176
00:09:59,600 --> 00:09:59,633
which can be either 
here  or there,
independent of this value,
we have a unique output value,

177
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,180
which can be either 
here  or there,

178
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,070
it's a detector signal from the op-amp 
that is called the comparator.

179
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,280
So, if V(+) - V(-) is positive,

180
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,190
in other words, if V(+) > V(-),

181
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,900
or, if V(+) < V(-),

182
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,440
we'll find ourselves 
with a saturated output,

183
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,360
either a positive saturation,
or a negative saturation,

184
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,700
which will lead us to use the op-amp
in a non-linear function.

185
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,300
Here's an example that 
demonstrates this characteristic.

186
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,490
Take a completely variable signal, 
that varies over time,

187
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:41,235
and watch how the op-amp
reacts at the ouput

188
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,760
to detect whether 
the signal is positive,

189
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:50,220
so all of this part here 
will allow us to

190
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:57,300
source a voltage at the output 
that is always equal to Vsat(+).

191
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,500
And all of this part here

192
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,420
will lead us to find a voltage 
that is always negative.

193
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,520
So with a binary voltage,

194
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,950
if it's Vsat(+), we can say that 
the voltage is positive,

195
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:14,960
and if it's Vsat(-), we can say that
the voltage is negative.

196
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:20,330
So, with this, we have a 
detection signal at the input

197
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:24,975
which will tell us if V+ > V-
or if V+ < V-.

198
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,300
Of course, there are 
many ways of applying this.

199
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,940
We can see here that we're analysing 
the op-amp in open-loop

200
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,880
with the op-amp applications,

201
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,860
or when we use the op-amp
in positive reaction.

202
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,220
And this brings us on to look at 
some of these applications:

203
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,480
There's a technique called 
Pulse-width modulation,

204
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,390
that uses an op-amp open-loop.

205
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,100
Here's the diagram 
of an op-amp loop

206
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:52,667
where we are interested 
in the voltage output.

207
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,520
When we compare the 
continuous input voltage, U(0),

208
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,980
that is connected to the 
negative charge in purple,

209
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:11,280
and on the positive charge, voltage U(1)
 I'm going to connect a triangular voltage.

210
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,780
We're going to look at 
 what happens at the output,

211
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,160
and here, in blue, we've got 
 the output voltage V(out).

212
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,360
What I would ask you to do, 
is to go and connect this in a laboratory

213
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:31,460
I've prepared this for you, so just here,
you will notice,

214
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,780
or carry out an experiment, just to see what happens.

00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,040
or carry out an experiment, just to see what happens.

216
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,480
What I would ask you to do, is to go and connect
this in a laboratory

217
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,500
that when we compare a continuous 
 voltage with a triangular voltage
What I would ask you to do, is to go and connect
this in a laboratory

218
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,560
that when we compare a continuous 
 voltage with a triangular voltage

219
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,300
and look at the pulse-width at 
 the output of an op-amp

220
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:50,129
which will become
 increasingly wide or narrow

221
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,540
depending on the 
comparison value

222
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,760
to apply a well-known 
modulation technique

223
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:01,110
that's called the PWM, or 
 "Pulse-width modulation".

224
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,730
And so, we have here 
 now in purple, the DC voltage,

225
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:10,725
which is compared to the 
 triangular voltage, that is in yellow,

226
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,500
and you'll notice that 
at the output we find

227
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,050
the voltage in blue, 
 that corresponds to V(out).

228
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,600
So, we can clearly see

229
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,240
that if the triangular voltage is 
 greater than the DC,

230
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,700
the output is Vsat(+) ou à Vsat(-).

231
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,000
We are moving the input voltage,

232
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,680
and we see the pulse-width
 V(out) reacting

233
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,480
exactly in comparison 
 to the triangular voltage

234
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,840
and the DC voltage 
that is at the input.

235
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,900
Therefore, the pulse-width 
becomes increasingly narrow,

236
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,890
And, when we lower the DC voltage, 
 you'll notice straight away

237
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,320
that the pulse-width 
modulates in comparison,

238
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,560
and this can be easily observed 
on the screen of an oscilloscope.
