1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,040
Let's resume the
study of an inverting amplifier,

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,640
by looking at the outcome
we got last time

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,140
by making an operational amplifier
in and using it as an inverting amplifier.

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,070
I will look at a circuit
using what is called an inverting amplifier.

5
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:25,030
The term "inverting" derives from the fact
that the voltage output,

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,630
which we can see here
has an opposite sign

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,350
to the voltage input,
which we can see there.

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,540
So the <i>V2</i> voltage will be
in <i>sin</i> in opposition to the<i>V1.</i> one.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,850
So let's look at what this means
and how it works.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,090
I will remind you that, from now on,

11
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:43,510
we've understood that when
there is negative feedback,

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,260
that's when we can bring back voltage

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,750
or power from the output
towards a node

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,550
and towards an amplifier's
negative terminal,

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,610
which creates negative feedback.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,360
This negative feedback
enables us

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,150
to find a linear relation
because,

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,270
if the output voltage
is lower

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,860
than the saturation voltage,
be it positive or negative,

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,040
that means that the power

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,500
is stuck in the so-called
linear section of the amplifier,

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,330
Therefore, there is a linear relation
between <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,760
and you will find out that this linear relation
will pass through a resistance ratio

24
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,450
which are resistance <i>R2</i> and <i>R1.</i>

25
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,580
Just to remind you, once again,

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,500
if the amplifier has an output
voltage which isn't saturated,

27
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,370
we can say that the tension
between the negative

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,610
and the positive terminals equals 0.

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,620
So we have an amplifier

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,070
which shows exactly the same voltage
from there to there. Very interesting.

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,440
Look at what happens
in this kind of electrical circuit.

32
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,430
I had linked the negative terminal
to a fixed potential

33
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,030
which controls the input and output,

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,720
and the voltage
is that of the mass.

35
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,650
So it's as if, when I copied
this potential there, I applied it here.

36
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,500
A copy of this potential towards
that potential

37
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,640
means that I imposed
a potential on the <i>A</i> node,

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,480
Both the voltage I can see in that node,
and the potential in this one

39
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,630
equal 0.

40
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,690
This is an identical copy of the mass.

41
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,510
But this doesn't create a short circuit 
at the mass. Very interesting, why?

42
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,670
Let's imagine there's a current
passing through here.

43
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:36,320
This <i>I1</i> current will arrive here,
in this node there.

44
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,640
The amplifier will take no current,

45
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,860
Remember impedance is infinite,
therefore the <i>I0</i> current equals 0.

46
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,750
So all of the <i>I1</i> current

47
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:56,110
will go to trough the branch which is there
and <i>I2</i> will be equal to <i>I1</i>.

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,270
So we have the mass potential,
but we have successfully

49
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,870
avoided the current passing
through  the mass.

50
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,090
The current will not pass through the mass,
that voltage is equal to this voltage,

51
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,460
but there is no short-circuit
inside the amplifier, on the contrary,

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,770
which is linked to the fact that the
amplifier's gain is infinite

53
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,360
and that this voltage there divided by infinity
and brought back to the input, will equal 0.

54
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,830
So what we imposed here is copied
on that node there.

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,500
So the current follows on its path there,
and passes through the amplifier.

56
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,910
So if it's a <i>I1</i> current which enters,
<i>I</i> path is the same,

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,410
it arrives towards the amplifier, continues 
here, it carries on its path

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,840
it leaves towards <i>- VCC</i> if the current is positive
or towards <i>+ VCC</i> if the current is negative.

59
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,150
Now, let's resume the analysis
of this circuit.

60
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,890
So we said that the <i>VA</i> voltage
equals 0 volts.

61
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:09,640
The <i>V1</i> voltage that I can see in this node here
and that node there is exactly the same,

62
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,290
The same voltage appears here.

63
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,820
Here, it is against the real mass and there,
against the virtual mass,

64
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:21,970
because there is no physical short circuit
between those two nodes there.

65
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,430
The current which I observed will
continue its path and will come through here.

66
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,290
Let's analyse <i>V2.</i>

67
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:33,712
From here to there<i>V2</i>  the
 current flows from the positive to

68
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,320
 the negative terminal,
so knowing that this potential here

69
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,170
is the same as what I can see there,
and knowing that this potential is copied there,

70
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,590
I conclude that the <i>V2 </i> voltage is exactly
the same as what I can see in that direction there.

71
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,800
This is the <i>V2</i> voltage.

72
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:58,590
What you can see around this circuit
shows you the relationship between <i>V1 I1</i>, <i>V2 I2</i>

73
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,510
namely that <i>I1</i> is equal to <i>V2.</i>

74
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:06,940
Now, let's write up write what happens
when I write  <i>I1 = V1/R1 = ...</i>

75
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,110
Note that the <i>V2</i> voltage
 is positive in this direction so (...)

76
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,610
in accordance with  Kirchhof's laws

77
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,960
I have to put a minus sign
on the current relation

78
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,340
(that's <i>- V2</i> divided by the resistance <i>R2.</i>)

79
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,310
By matching these two currents,
we see a relation between <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>

80
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,410
which are respectively proportionate to
<i>R1</i> and <i>R2,</i>

81
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:51,030
so we can write <i>V2 = V1 times R2
divided by R1</i> with a minus sign

82
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,640
which derives from the fact that
the two voltages flow in opposite directions.

83
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,860
Here is a summary of
what we have just observed.

84
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:11,720
We've seen a step by step application of
what has just been discussed,

85
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,000
which has brought us to the link
between  the <i>V2</i> and <i>R2</i> voltage.

86
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,700
and this has enabled us
to look at a type of circuit

87
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,080
which is called the inverted operational
amplifier circuit,

88
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,240
It has two resistances,
which gives  us a relation

89
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,310
with a phase inversion using a minus sign.

90
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,670
The current that enters this <i>V1</i> amplifier
corresponds to the value of resistance

91
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,270
that we have chosen.

92
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,840
If we reflect on
what this means,

93
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,110
If you connect a source here,

94
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,790
this source there will have to provide
the <i>I1</i> current,

95
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,610
and this <i>I1</i> current is totally
proportionate to the value of <i>V1,</i>

96
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,870
which is the value of your source,
and which will have the <i>R1</i> resistance

97
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,070
as its charge resistance.

98
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,100
And we call this an internal resistance.

99
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,470
It's the resistance that we see
when we look at  the amplifier

100
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:22,530
from this node and it is called <i>R in</i>
which is equal to <i>V1/I1,</i>

101
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,740
so in this instance
to the <i>R1</i> resistance.

102
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,190
So the source you are going to connect
there will have to be debited

103
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,390
in a resistance which has the resistance
value that you have chosen.

104
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,590
This brings us back to
the next point:

105
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,120
you can see there is a <i>R2</i> on <i>R1,</i>
so the amplifier's gain,

106
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,350
the relation between output and input voltage
is <i>R2</i> sur <i>R1.</i> It's a given value.

107
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,040
And this given value is completely
independent of the absolute value

108
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,380
of <i>R2</i> and of <i>R1.</i>

109
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,430
If you want an outcome equal to ten,

110
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,640
you only have to choose a resistance
of 10 KΩ on a resistance of 1 KΩ,

111
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,840
but you can also use 100 KΩ
divided by 10 KΩ.

112
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,160
You can continue like that,
as all this equals to ten.

113
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,960
And yet, if you look at the <i>I1</i> current

114
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,770
that you will consume
and which will be provided by the source,

115
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,130
this current there isn't observing
the gain,

116
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,830
it's observing your input resistance.

117
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,000
What happens if you connect
a source here

118
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,770
which can't provide the necessary current
for the <i>R1</i> resistance,

119
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,930
you run the risk of not being able
to provide enough power

120
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,460
to the <i>R1</i> to allow for the signal
to be converted into output voltage.

121
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,260
Don't forget that the whole of the current
which leaves from this side

122
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,490
is the current that your amplifier
is capable of giving,

123
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,970
so the resistance relation seems
to incur a gain,

124
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,950
therefore a multiplication
between the output voltage

125
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,610
and the input voltage and that
the input resistance which is linked

126
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,640
to the absolute value of the <i>R1</i> resistance

127
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,820
risks being a restrictive factor
and leads us to reflect

128
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,930
prior to choosing the resistance relation

129
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,590
in order to determine what current
we will produce

130
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,220
in the input resistance.
