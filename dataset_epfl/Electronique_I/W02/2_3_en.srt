1
00:00:05,554 --> 00:00:07,894
Here is the diagram
that I would like to show you,

2
00:00:07,894 --> 00:00:10,584
which is what we call a voltage summer.

3
00:00:10,584 --> 00:00:15,774
You'll see here that we have
an inverting amplifier

4
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:17,974
and we have created a virtual ground.

5
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:21,474
This virtual ground is essential to
the use of this amp

6
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:23,294
when it is in a linear area.

7
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:25,634
So the potential here,
is the same as it is here.

8
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:30,624
And if I put a resistor here,
or a potential of 0V,

9
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:34,064
I will still find myself
with a potential of 0V.

10
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:36,271
When we look what happens here,

11
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:40,271
I can write
all these resistors

12
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:43,051
that you're seeing,
from a <i>V1</i> voltage source,

13
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:45,671
a <i>V'1</i> voltage source,
a <i>V"1</i> voltage source

14
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:50,271
or we could easily write that the
current <i>I1</i> is

15
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:56,561
simply equal to the voltage <i>V1</i>
divided by the resistor <i>R1</i>,

16
00:00:56,763 --> 00:01:02,043
the same for the current <i>I'1</i>
which is equal to <i>V'1</i>

17
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:05,533
divided by the resistor <i>R'1</i>.

18
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:12,403
It's the same for the current <i>I"1</i>
which is equal to <i>V"1</i>

19
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:15,583
divided by the resistor <i>R"1</i>.

20
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,283
But what's really interesting here

21
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:21,673
is that the potential
is completely independent,

22
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:24,133
it's controlled from this side.

23
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:29,908
This area here imposes the duplication
from the negative feedback of the level,

24
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:33,358
or rather the potential of 0V
towards this node here.

25
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:34,948
It's absolutely not the voltages

26
00:01:34,948 --> 00:01:37,008
because the voltages
that appear here,

27
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:43,468
you will see <i>V1</i> here,
you've got the voltage <i>V'1</i> there

28
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:48,668
and the voltage <i>V"1</i> here.

29
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:52,328
And this will stay at 0V the entire time.

30
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:54,218
So now let's look at Kirchhoff's Law.

31
00:01:54,218 --> 00:01:58,928
Kirchhoff's Law tells us that current <i>I</i>
is the sum of this, plus this, plus that.

32
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:03,088
Very good. This same currrent
doesn't even enter the amp.

33
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:05,028
It goes through it, it will become <i>I2</i>.

34
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:09,028
So <i>I2</i> is always equal

35
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,108
to the sum of the currents

36
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:16,678
<i>I1 + I'1 + I"1</i>.

37
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:21,548
So it's a law that adds up
all the currents that pass through

38
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:24,288
while the potential retains the same value.

39
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:26,878
And when we start looking
at what will happen

40
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:28,188
with the voltage  <i>V2</i>,

41
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:32,548
let's remind ourselves that <i>V2</i> is this one,
this is <i>V2</i>,

42
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:37,404
so <i>V2</i> is equal to <i>-I2 x R2 </i>.

43
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:40,284
So all these currents
are multiplied

44
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:41,794
by the <i>R2</i> resistor.

45
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,794
They transform into a voltage
equal to the output of <i>V2</i>,

46
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:48,754
and that gives us something
like this.

47
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,875
Here is the diagram
once we examine it

48
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,095
with the links that have
just been explained.

49
00:02:56,095 --> 00:03:00,655
You'll see that the voltage <i>V2</i>
is equal to:

50
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:06,035
<i>V1/R1 + V'1/R'1 + V"1/R"1</i>,

51
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:08,137
with + sign adding it all up,

52
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:10,317
and which is multiplied by the <i>R2</i> resistor.

53
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:14,707
In other terms, you have <i>V1</i>
which is multiplied by a gain

54
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:20,167
equal to <i>-R2/R1 </i>, the same for <i>V'1</i>, and for <i>V"1</i>.

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
This type of circuit
allows us to carry out

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,950
what is called a mixing of voltages.

57
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,270
We can add voltage sources

58
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,470
that won't influence each other

59
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,800
because we have a potential here
that is absolutely constant,

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
independent from
this part of the circuit

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
because your amplifier
gives out negative feedback,

62
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,140
while this voltage here
allows the potential of 0V

63
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,670
to be copied to this node here
thanks to the virtual area.

64
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,420
So this potential is managed
by the negative feedback

65
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,259
and these different voltage sources

66
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:02,319
are absolutely independent
from each other.

67
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,479
In other words,

68
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,739
you can connect
three voltage sources.

69
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,129
We could say that
we have one voltage source <i>V1</i>,

70
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:14,279
and a voltage source <i>V'1</i>,
which are by nature completely independent.

71
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:17,629
You can connect an audio source
at this side here,

72
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,589
another audio source from the other side,

73
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,909
so we could have
some classical music here,

74
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,329
here we could have some pop music,

75
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:28,329
and you could add a singer here,

76
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:31,979
and you would only have to put
variable resistors here

77
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,739
and you will have just made
what we call a mixing table,

78
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:39,549
because you would be
mixing three voltage sources,

79
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:44,729
where the voltage output is the
weighted sum of these three sources.

80
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,959
You can then write down the gains,

81
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,239
raise the volume of the classical music
by putting <i>R2</i> higher up than <i><R1</i>,

82
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,549
lower the sound of the pop music

83
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:56,859
and wipe out the sound or the voice
of anyone talking

84
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,819
who comes near the source.

85
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,819
So this, this is the origin
of what we call an adder,

86
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,619
and this adder takes over sources
which are entirely independent

87
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,329
and sends them to the output.

88
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:13,397
I would like to draw your attention
to the fact

89
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,007
that this diagram here
does not correspond

90
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:17,607
with that diagram there.

91
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:20,587
In this diagram, the voltage
that you see in the node

92
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,047
to which we add the current
is always the same,

93
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,437
0V copied from here.

94
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:29,323
The voltage that you see here,

95
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:32,083
is a voltage that's the same as <i>V2</i>,

96
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,253
and the voltage <i>V2</i> depends, of course,
on <i>I</i>.

97
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:43,297
The voltage <i>V2</i> is this voltage
here, as you can see,

98
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:47,637
but it's always between
the output of <i>V2</i> and the virtual area.

99
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:50,837
And the current that comes from here
passes through <i>I2</i>

100
00:05:50,837 --> 00:05:53,787
and subsumes the voltage <i>V2</i> with its own value.

101
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,787
However here, this voltage
is in constant flux,

102
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:01,787
including the effect on this resistor
and the current <i>I1</i>.

103
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:04,557
So when this voltage increases,

104
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:08,557
you will see that the voltage <i>V1 - V2</i>
will influence the current <i>I1</i>,

105
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:10,337
which is not the case here.

106
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:13,327
The voltage <i>V1</i> is completely
independent on the variation

107
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,467
of the voltage <i>V2</i>

108
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:17,527
because it is between <i>V1</i>
and the mass,

109
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:20,217
so between this node here and this node here.

110
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:23,687
And this has nothing to do with
what is happening with the current <i>I2</i>

111
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:27,687
which is the sum of these
two other sources.

112
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:33,751
Here, the voltage <i>V2</i> depends on this
current exactly, this current, this current

113
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:38,481
and the level of voltage here influences
the value of <i>I1</i>.

114
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:44,041
It will also influence
the value <i>I'1</i> and the value of <i>I"1</i>.

115
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:47,709
I now invite you
to go to the laboratory

116
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:52,349
and look at an example
of a summing amplifier,

117
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:54,389
and with this summing amplifier,

118
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,909
we will try two inputs.

119
00:06:57,221 --> 00:06:59,731
Here is what you should connect.

120
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:02,481
Take an operational amplifier.

121
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:05,277
Create two voltage sources,

122
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:09,497
one source of sinusoidal voltage,
with a frequency of 1kΩ,

123
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:12,787
and a peak value equal to 2V.

124
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:18,454
In a second input,
connect a DC voltage source

125
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,864
with a value equal to 10V

126
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:23,754
and use the diagram
with the resistance ratio

127
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:25,844
that I have suggested you put here.

128
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:30,818
I advise you take the
sinusoidal input,

129
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,338
and establish a gain.

130
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:36,338
You have the ratio that
appears on this input here,

131
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:40,338
this is the resistance ratio of
<i>R2</i> over <i>R11</i>

132
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:43,738
which is equal to 22kΩ over 10kΩ

133
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:47,078
so this corresponds to 2.2.

134
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:50,838
With this 2.2, a much weaker signal

135
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:54,438
with respect to the sinusoidal voltage <i>Ve1</i>

136
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:56,088
and the DC voltage,

137
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:59,048
I suggest that you perform
a damping effect,

138
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:04,178
so put 22kΩ divided by 6.8
which leads us to 0.32

139
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:07,008
and, of course, with this being negative,

140
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:10,128
let's observe what
appears at the output.

141
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:14,728
So we are in fact expecting
a summation link

142
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,678
with the minus signs.

143
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:20,678
<i>Ve1</i> will be multiplied by the gain of 2.2.

144
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:24,678
<i>Ve2</i>  will be multiplied
by the damping of 0.32.

145
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:27,907
Let's see what happens
when we analyse this

146
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,307
before connecting it to an oscilloscope.

147
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:33,107
Here is our circuit.

148
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:39,436
We have the voltage generated
with a peak value of 2V.

149
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:44,667
You can see plus 2V, minus 2V,
with a mean value of 0V.

150
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:49,547
And here is the DC voltage,
which we have connected here,

151
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:52,487
and the AC voltage which was connected here,

152
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:55,257
as we look at the output
the sum of the two

153
00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:57,557
balanced by the resistance ratio,

154
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:00,807
and what we will see
is that this sinusoidal voltage

155
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:06,277
which has become, of course, 10V
multiplied by 0.32

156
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:09,307
and altered with a minus sign,

157
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:13,827
will give us a value of -3.2,
that you see here

158
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:19,317
will then become the average DC value
at the output of <i>V2</i>.

159
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:23,317
And so, our sinusoidal voltage
multiplied by a gain

160
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:26,497
equal to 2.2, which we can see here,

161
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:31,617
will amplify
with a 2.2 gain,

162
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:35,617
and will invert the voltage,
so we have a phase shift of 180°

163
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:37,921
between the input voltage
and the output voltage

164
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:41,921
which is very visible
at the output of this summer.

165
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:46,095
I now suggest to you
that you take the same circuit

166
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:49,965
and connect different types
of voltage sources

167
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,875
other than sinusoidal voltage.

168
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,995
And as you can see, this type of
summer is capable of measuring

169
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:59,373
or taking any type
of input voltage,

170
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:01,993
incorporating them in
and sending them to the output.

171
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:06,052
For example,
here we have a sinusoidal voltage

172
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:09,062
which we would like to add
to a square wave.

173
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:12,782
It's enough to put it
at the input of this summer

174
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:15,632
and at the output, we have this blue line

175
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:19,242
which in fact corresponds
to the sum of a sinusoidal voltage

176
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:22,172
and a square voltage.

177
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,350
We suggest you do this and observe
the results with an oscilloscope.

178
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:29,746
Here is a similar thing,
we can, of course, do this

179
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:33,246
with a sawtooth wave
with a sinusoidal voltage.

180
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:36,096
You have the
sawtooth wave

181
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:38,106
that we add to the sinusoidal voltage.

182
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:41,906
I'll leave that there
so we can see the voltage in blue,

183
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:45,396
which corresponds to the sum of both of them
once they've been through the summer.

184
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:47,456
It's enough to observe this on the oscilloscope

185
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:49,586
and to do this exercise
in your laboratory

186
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,846
to look at
what's going on.

187
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:57,218
And so, we've just finished
looking at one use

188
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:58,848
of an inverting amplifier,

189
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:02,008
and we've just found out
that this inverting amplifier

190
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,978
is capable of taking
an input signal,

191
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:06,718
a voltage in this case,

192
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:10,718
of multiplying it by a gain
and performing an amplification

193
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:13,898
or a damping of this signal,
sent to the output

194
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:17,898
and inverted due to a minus sign
according to the gain

195
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:19,238
that we have reached.

196
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:23,018
And with that we finish
today's chapter.
