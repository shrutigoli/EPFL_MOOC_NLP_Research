1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,380
Now I'd like to invite you
to do an experiment.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,250
We'll do this experiment together.

3
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:11,868
You're going to take an
operational amplifier,

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,880
you'll supply it with two
supply voltages.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,680
You'll take a supply
voltage around

6
00:00:17,687 --> 00:00:19,568
15V, for example,

7
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:21,951
positive,

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,620
and a supply voltage
around -15V,

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,940
negative.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,680
You'll choose an R₂
resistance, equal to 68 kΩ

11
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,310
and an R₁ resistance of 10 kΩ.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,125
Set it up like this.

13
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:37,440
We'll analyse what will happen

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,020
between the blue ouput voltage

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,100
and the yellow input voltage

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,620
when the ratio between
the two voltages

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,450
is equal to -6.8

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,694
which is the same as
68 kΩ divided by 10 kΩ.

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,340
Let's see what happens when
you connect a triangular

20
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:58,635
signal to the input.

21
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:02,391
Here, I chose to connect
a triangular voltage

22
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:04,533
with a range equal to 1V.

23
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:07,235
And I'm looking at the output.

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,750
See how the output voltage
is linear,

25
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:12,950
compared to the input voltage,

26
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,457
with a slope which is the
opposite of the input.

27
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:16,334
It's normal,

28
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,260
because we have a negative

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,520
sign and that negative voltage,

30
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,160
for a triangular signal, means

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,630
that when the slope is positive,

32
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,940
the slope that we see at the
output will be negative.

33
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:31,861
Let's see what happens
with the two currents.

34
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:35,218
We have an R₁ and R₂ resistance.

35
00:01:35,218 --> 00:01:39,944
The I₁ current that we've just seen
is the same as the V₁ voltage

36
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:42,348
that we see here.

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,880
So this current is equal to
V₁ divided by the R₁ resistance.

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,095
It's the same for the R₂
resistance as the V₂ voltage

39
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:51,710
is the voltage that we see here.

40
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,208
Therefore the V₂ voltage,

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,820
or the relationship with the
I₂ current,

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,540
is equal to -V₂ divided
by the R₂ resistance.

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,540
See the positive direction of the
current and the opposite direction

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,520
of the voltage, which leads us to
talk about these minus signs.

45
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:13,804
When we look at the two currents,
and we balance them as we've seen,

46
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:17,243
your oscilloscope will show you
something like that.

47
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:21,251
We're going to try to
saturate our amplifier.

48
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:25,524
Straight away, I'll change
the level of input voltage

49
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:29,528
and do it so that I push
my amplifier to saturation point

50
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:32,127
to a saturation voltage which is...

51
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:34,769
which are the voltages that
we've supplied the amp with.

52
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,895
And watch what will happen:

53
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:41,745
when your amplifier is saturated,

54
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,345
so I've applied a voltage
equal to 5V

55
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:46,425
at peak value.

56
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:49,518
Remember that we've supplied
+ or -15V

57
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:51,675
so there was 15V on that side

58
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:55,901
and -15V on this side.

59
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:02,713
So, our amplifier can't
go beyond the conductor rails.

60
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:08,589
Its saturation voltages are
Vsat+ = 15V and Vsat- = 15V

61
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:12,206
so it will come up against
these supply voltages

62
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:15,494
and our amp will be saturated
all the way through.

63
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,812
The amp is therefore no longer
linear.

64
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:19,566
We applied a linear voltage,

65
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,473
we expect the output
to be linear,

66
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:26,129
but seeing as the amplifier
can't exceed these supply

67
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,121
voltages, it saturates.

68
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:31,033
Can I still say that the I₁
connection is equal to I₂?

69
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,196
Absolutely not.

70
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:36,126
When the amplifier goes outside
of its linear area

71
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:37,607
it becomes saturated.

72
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,676
It's impossible for me to talk
about an amplifier

73
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:43,342
which behaves in accordance
with a linear law.

74
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:45,853
I can still say that I₁ = I₂,

75
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:49,284
that goes without saying because
the current here is still equal to 0.

76
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:54,388
However, this current will
continue on its way,

77
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:56,518
but that current, or that voltage,

78
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:58,072
is no longer copied from here to there,

79
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,894
because the amp no longer finds
itself in the linear area

80
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:03,246
where V+ = V-

81
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:09,803
so I can't say that
V₁ ∕ R₁ = -V₂ ∕ R₂

82
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:12,581
given that this potential
is no longer equal to 0.

83
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,351
So the amplifier is in the
saturation area here.

84
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:19,775
There, when the amp is in
the linear area,

85
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:24,944
again it leads to being
in a loop of negative reactions,

86
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:26,600
it stayed in its linear area

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:34,012
therefore the connection V(out)
or V₂ in terms of V₁ = -R₂ ∕ R₁

88
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,492
is applied there, according to that.

89
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,413
But when I reach saturation point,

90
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:42,260
I find myself from there to here
with a saturated amplifier.

91
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,398
Do this experiment in the lab

92
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:46,032
and see what happens.

93
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:47,442
You can, of course,

94
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:50,068
connect other types of signals,

95
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:52,778
and I advise you to connect
a sinusoidal voltage.

96
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:55,028
We'll see what will happen if,

97
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,126
in your laboratory,

98
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:59,382
you replace the triangular
signal with a sinusoidal one

99
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,843
which we'll see at the output.

100
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:04,908
Here is what we'll observe
at the output of an amp

101
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:08,434
that a sinusoidal voltage has
been connected to at the input,

102
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,346
which you can see in yellow,

103
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:13,136
and the sinusoidal voltage
which appears at the output,

104
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:16,274
with a complete 180°
phase difference.

105
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:21,698
The notion of the - sign
with a sinusoidal voltage

106
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:24,252
means a phase inversion.

107
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:27,652
Therefore the output voltage
has undergone a phase inversion.

108
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:29,692
There's a phase difference of 180°

109
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:32,584
between the sinusoidal voltage
which was inputted

110
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:34,648
and that which would be

111
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,916
amplified, of course, we can see
that the amp multiplied it by

112
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,324
6.8 which was the amp gain.

113
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:44,056
You only have to look at the two
displays of these two voltages,

114
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:45,780
they are RMS values

115
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,318
of the input voltage,

116
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,698
the input voltage which is here,

117
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,636
and the output voltage there.

118
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,996
If you make the connection
between these two voltages,

119
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:57,520
you're led to find the
amplification gain

120
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,606
which is around 6.8 kΩ.

121
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:01,528
Of course, you must consider

122
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,942
that this experiment was done
with resistances which

123
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:05,561
have a certain tolerance.

124
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:10,586
Therefore the difference is explained
by the tolerance of our components.

125
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:13,816
Here's the last plan we studied.

126
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:17,876
It's an amplifier which includes
a feedback resistance,

127
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:19,664
an input resistance,

128
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:21,146
with an output voltage

129
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:23,896
which is always the opposite
of the input voltage.

130
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,945
I'd like to quickly remind you

131
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:28,791
that the relationship between
the voltage V₂ ∕ V₁

132
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:33,941
is equal to -R₂ over R₁.

133
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:36,672
And I'd now like to

134
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:40,692
show the possibility offered
by the amplifier when the

135
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,934
potential of this node A

136
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,776
is equal to the potential which
is connected to the positive terminal.

137
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:53,476
In other words, the voltage Vᴀ = 0.

138
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:56,360
This is a highly interesting feature.

139
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,776
Because upon analysing what
we see here,

140
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:00,214
I'm just going to remind you

141
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:03,166
that Kirchhoff's law says that
when you take a node

142
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:05,406
and you direct a current towards
that node

143
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:08,786
if that current, we'll call it I₁,

144
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:11,741
well the currents that exit
this node are

145
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:15,328
exactly the sum of this

146
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,838
I₁ current.

147
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:24,561
You have a current I₁ = I₂ + I₃.

148
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:27,307
This law is always true.

149
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:29,646
The current which arrives here,

150
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:31,200
it'll pass again through there,

151
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,394
because no current
passes the Io node so that

152
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:36,576
current is equal to this + this.

153
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:38,400
Very simple, easy.

154
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,556
But in that plan,

155
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:43,144
if we look at what happens

156
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:44,004
in the potential

157
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:46,188
of the A node,

158
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:48,246
we see that the difference in

159
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,484
potential, thanks to the amp

160
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:52,824
feedback, that is the fact
that an amp,

161
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:54,810
when it starts to feedback,

162
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,980
it will try to find a linear connection

163
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,600
between this voltage and that,

164
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,900
the one that you see there.

165
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,316
The voltage difference is
always equal to 0.

166
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:07,412
I remind you that the gain
of this A amp is infinite.

167
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,210
Therefore, for a finite
output voltage,

168
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,850
the amp isn't saturated,

169
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,641
this V₂ voltage divided by A

170
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:16,568
always brings about a voltage
difference equal to 0.

171
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:21,108
So the voltage in the A node
is equal to the voltage we have here.

172
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:24,015
As it happens, in this example,

173
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:25,918
we show that we have grounded
the connection.

174
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:29,570
So if this potential equals 0V,

175
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,156
then this potential also equals 0V.

176
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:34,318
It's an extraordinary feature.

177
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,794
Watch what happens.

178
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:37,786
You'll have a current which moves.

179
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:39,638
This current goes via this path here.

180
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:42,592
The potential in that node is equal
to here,

181
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:44,288
therefore equal to 0V.

182
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:48,194
So there's no variation of
this voltage, independently of

183
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:53,072
what happens with the V₁
voltage which will appear here,

184
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:56,236
that's the V₁ voltage,

185
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,194
and the V₂ voltage will appear here,

186
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:01,161
that's the V₂ voltage.

187
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,438
We're going to use this.

188
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,418
If you can connect something
to that node,

189
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:08,866
any kind of external source

190
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:11,746
which will add current,

191
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,374
it won't affect the voltage.

192
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:16,088
We call that the virtual ground.

193
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:19,070
We created a grounded short circuit

194
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,682
with a voltage difference of 0

195
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:24,588
without applying that on the current.

196
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:27,814
The current won't pass through
the ground.

197
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:30,984
So it won't run in this 0 potential.

198
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,774
It continues via another way,

199
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,372
through the R₂ resistance,

200
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:40,498
all whilst imposing the potential of
the ground still at node A.

201
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:45,934
So there's absolutely no effect
of current that passes through this

202
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,180
potential because the amp will
manage the potential

203
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,670
and the current continues to
apply the Kirchhoff laws

204
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:52,016
that we've seen here.

205
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:55,534
And this, this virtual ground,

206
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:57,680
created by an amplifier

207
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,544
will be used minutely
in circuits.

208
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:05,066
And we'll see a first example
of this.

209
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:08,598
Here's the plan of
my inverting amplifier

210
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:11,088
where I've just added
a source of current

211
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,488
to this node A

212
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,622
which corresponds to the
virtual ground.

213
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:17,522
So, you remember that the
potential at node A

214
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:19,800
Vᴀ is really equal to 0.

215
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,803
When you're looking at a source
of current connected to a potential

216
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:25,414
Vᴀ = 0,

217
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:29,362
it's that any resistance is
connected in parallel,

218
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,870
I'm going to draw my source of
current,

219
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,868
this current source finds itself
with a parallel resistance

220
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:42,730
and this parallel resistance is
one of the flaws of a current source.

221
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,620
We don't like this resistance,
but it exists,

222
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,980
and you've just imposed a voltage

223
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,379
equal to 0,

224
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,700
so this resistance can't in any case
let a current pass in.

225
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,210
You have a voltage equal to 0
at the terminals of this resistance

226
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,700
therefore the current crossing
it is going to be

227
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,656
I = 0

228
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:11,624
So all the current put out
by our source of current,

229
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:15,794
which in this example
is this current I,

230
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:17,832
is what we see here,

231
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:20,026
it will definitely pass through
this node,

232
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:23,546
it's as if we created a short
circuit on a current source.

233
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:25,648
And the short circuit current

234
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:30,008
helps us greatly to eliminate
this imperfection and

235
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:31,538
the existence of a resistance

236
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:35,488
which won't take the current
from the main source at all.

237
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:39,716
If we apply Kirchhoff's law
on what we've just seen,

238
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:43,696
I can say that the sum of the
current that passes here,

239
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:45,342
the I₁ current,

240
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:50,854
will be equal to the I₂ current

241
00:11:52,684 --> 00:11:53,624
+ the current I.

242
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:57,144
I invite you to think about
this exercise.

243
00:11:57,454 --> 00:11:58,664
This exercise shows you

244
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:01,054
that whatever source you
add here,

245
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,524
you create an effect

246
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:05,534
by analysing the relationships
we've seen,

247
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:08,116
that the V₁ voltage, here,

248
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:13,182
this V₁ voltage is equal to
I₁ multiplied by R₁,

249
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:16,196
and the V₂ voltage, in the other
direction,

250
00:12:19,256 --> 00:12:23,966
V₂ is equal to -I₂ times the
R₂ resistance.

251
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:27,818
I'd like to remind you that the
direction of the V₂ voltage is positive

252
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:31,752
in this direction given that the
potential is copied here

253
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,318
and the current is in the opposite
direction,

254
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:38,278
which leads me to add this negative
sign before the connection.

255
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,916
And the current I which was
imposed by this source

256
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,276
that we decided to connect
to a source of current

257
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:45,166
which gives out a current
in this direction.

258
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:47,638
You'll see clearly that the
current which enters

259
00:12:47,638 --> 00:12:50,018
is equal to the sum of the
two currents that exit.

260
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:54,918
And you'll write it copying
the relationship I₁ = V₁ ∕ R₁

261
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:56,318
here the same for I₂.

262
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,662
And you'll find this
connection which is there.

263
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:03,496
That allows me to show that
the current given out by my source

264
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:07,816
only adds a certain current in I₂

265
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:12,186
which doesn't influence what comes
from I₁ because it adds to I₁

266
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:15,046
all whilst knowing that
the voltage remains zero.

267
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,424
Here's the same plan,

268
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:19,351
the same conclusion,

269
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:23,149
which takes us back to the V₂
voltage in relation to the V₁ voltage

270
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,113
multiplied by a resistance
relationship of R₂ ∕ R₁,

271
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:28,756
and what we discovered with
our amplifier,

272
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,462
the fact of having added this
current,

273
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,746
I have added an extra current

274
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:40,446
which will multiply the R₂ resistance
and change into a voltage

275
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,998
which is added to the one which

276
00:13:43,998 --> 00:13:47,628
appeared when we saw the voltage
V₁ multiplied by R₁ ∕ R₂.

277
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:48,882
It's shown here.

278
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:53,334
I'd like to remind you that when
a source of current like this,

279
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:56,356
when you want to convert it into
a source of voltage

280
00:13:56,616 --> 00:14:00,174
it becomes a source of voltage
in series with the resistance,

281
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:02,546
whilst obeying the Kirchhoff law.

282
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,642
So we've made Thévenin's theorem,

283
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:09,472
and Thévenin's theorem says that
these two representations are the same.

284
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:13,650
The condition is replacing the current
source by an equivalent voltage source

285
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,858
equal to I x R
with a resistance R in series.

286
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,548
And remember that the voltage Vᴀ,

287
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:20,328
from there to there,

288
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:21,382
is still the same.

289
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,186
I simply made a replacement

290
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:24,918
according to Thévenin's theorem

291
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:27,554
of a current source with a
resistance in parallel

292
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:31,310
with a voltage source with
a resistance in series.

293
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:34,576
And here's the equivalent
plan that we got

294
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,010
and I'm going to be able to

295
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,094
write that and draw it

296
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,714
taking the current source

297
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:43,312
and its resistance

298
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:46,332
and replacing it with a voltage
source and its resistance.

299
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:52,394
This exercise shows you,
if you calculate it and do it,

300
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:59,616
that this plan allows us to
transform an effect of the current

301
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:01,666
when we replace it with a voltage

302
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,102
into an effect of addition.

303
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:06,562
I'm going to look at the V₂ voltage

304
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:09,290
now in order of an added
source of voltage

305
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,094
and you'll see that
<i>V₂ = -V₁ x R₂ ∕ R₁</i>

306
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:18,168
+ the equivalent of this source
<i>V x R₂ ∕ R₁.</i>

307
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,489
With this we discover

308
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:27,219
a very important circuit that
we'll analyse straight away

309
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,326
and that we call a summing circuit.

310
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,959
We see that there is a summing
effect between the V₁ and V voltages

311
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,508
with an absolute value

312
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:40,502
according to the conditions of
vectors, currents and voltages.

313
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:43,552
And we see that these two
voltages are balanced

314
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:47,680
by a relationship of R₂ ∕ R₁
and R₂ ∕ R.
