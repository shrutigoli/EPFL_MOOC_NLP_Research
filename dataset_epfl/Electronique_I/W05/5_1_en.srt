00:00:04,223 --> 00:00:09,593
Hello, today, we're going to continue to
look at operational amplifiers,

2
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,883
but this time we are going to talk
about comparison,

3
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:14,913
meaning that we're going to take
an op-amp

4
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:17,553
and use it as a comparator.

5
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,979
Why use the term comparator

6
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,409
when talking about an electrical function

7
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:26,409
that has been presented before as an
operational amplifier?

8
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:30,409
In reality, all op-amps are also comparators,

9
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:36,769
but the internal structure of a comparator is
not at all the same,

10
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:40,769
it isn't designed in the same way as an
operational amplifier

11
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:42,229
for a simple reason.

12
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:47,778
Operational amplifiers are designed to be
stable in the linear zone.

13
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:50,698
So, remember when we talked about the
characteristics of

14
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:52,368
the operational amplifier,

15
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:55,798
we said that there is a linear central zone,

16
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:59,798
and all values found here
correspond to the value

17
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:03,798
for which the voltage <i>V+</i>
is equal to the voltage <i>V-</i>.

18
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:07,984
Now we're going to use the same op-amp,

19
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,894
but only in the so-called saturated zones.

20
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:14,985
So, we're going to get out the amp

21
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:20,255
which will be around <i>Vsat+</i> or <i>Vsat-</i>.

22
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,239
The linear zone therefore won't be used

23
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,329
it will be in the transition zone
between <i>Vsat+</i> and <i>Vsat-</i>.

24
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:33,699
And the amplifier has been designed in
such a way that

25
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:37,089
when it produces a negative feedback

26
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:40,359
and stays in the linear zone,

27
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,799
it stays stable.

28
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,799
And here, it needs what we call an
internal compensator,

29
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,499
and that's the main difference of
the comparator.

30
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:50,799
We don't ask it to stay inside here,

31
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,519
there isn't any linearity,

32
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,139
there is a simple comparison between the
positive and negative terminals.

33
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:59,719
If <i>V+</i> is higher than <i>V-</i>,
it will go to <i>Vsat+</i>,

34
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:05,859
and if <i>V+</i> is lower than <i>V-</i>,
it will go to <i>Vsat-</i>.

35
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:11,156
And we will find ourselves with an
output with two values.

36
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:14,376
And here, it's the transition speed that
is the most important.

37
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:18,376
So we don't make any compensation for
the stability

38
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:20,646
because we're not asking it to be stable,

39
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:22,536
instead we're asking it to be unstable,

40
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:25,906
to rapidly switch from one state to another.

41
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:29,778
In this chapter, we're going to look at
two ways of

42
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:32,138
using the comparator:

43
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:36,138
simple use of a comparator,

44
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:39,258
which means that we don't add any resistance

45
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:42,638
which would react between the voltage
output

46
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:44,398
and the voltage input,

47
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:48,398
and we're going to talk about a
threshold or hysteresis comparator,

48
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:54,248
it's two types of connection between the
input and the output

49
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:56,688
that will bring about a positive feedback

50
00:02:56,688 --> 00:03:03,278
from the output to the positive terminal.

51
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:06,844
We're going to approach this study as
we did

52
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:08,544
with the op-amp.

53
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:13,074
We took it, and said it's an op-amp,
so, it's an op-amp.

54
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:16,294
It's an amplifier that we're going to use
exactly like a comparator,

55
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:18,084
and it's going to be a simple comparator,

56
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:22,594
meaning that it's got nothing to do with
anything apart from the symbol that we've seen.

57
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:25,764
For sure, it will have positive and negative
power input

58
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:27,474
as does the op-amp.

59
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:32,634
It will have a <i>Vcc</i> and <i>-Vcc</i>
as normal.

60
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:36,634
The two voltage inputs will supply a current

61
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,114
or reduce the current

62
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:41,204
in relation to the common potential
between the two input terminals

63
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,984
and the output terminal.

64
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:44,532
And here is the feature,

65
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:47,102
that we looked at for the op-amp.

66
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,512
So, I'll go over it again.

67
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,330
Here, we're going to only use it
here and here,

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,310
and never in the linear zone.

69
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,300
We will never keep it in the linear zone.

70
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,040
It will simply pass from here to here.

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,670
So for all values where <i>V+</i>
is greater than <i>V-</i>,

72
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,450
we will find a positive saturation.

73
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,880
And for all values where <i>V+</i>
is less than <i>V-</i>,

74
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,700
we'll find negative saturations.

75
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,280
And when <i>V+</i> is equal to <i>V-</i>,

76
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,220
the amplifier will never stay in that zone

77
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,660
it will switch, and therefore carry on,

78
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,690
it will jump from here to here,

79
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,460
and it's during that transition

80
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,100
that we require it to be as quick as possible.

81
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,570
It's possible to take an op-amp

82
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,120
or a comparator,

83
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,390
and limit the output voltage to levels

84
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,970
that the schema suggests here.

85
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,910
We have used Zener diodes.

86
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:57,160
We've got a voltage <i>VZ</i> when the current
is positive in this direction.

87
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:00,928
So when the current is in this direction,

88
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:04,928
meaning that the voltage <i>Vout</i> is <i>Vsat+</i>.

89
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,849
So we'll have a current that is going
in this direction.

90
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,079
It will conduct the Zener diode

91
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,889
that is in the direction of a conducting
diode,

92
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,249
and therefore, I'll have a buffer voltage
of around the junction voltage

93
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,219
and a Zener voltage,

94
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:22,529
that will bring an output voltage
equal to <i>VZ + Uj</i>.

95
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,829
Now, if we

96
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:28,069
take a negative voltage,

97
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:34,779
meaning <i>Vout</i> is equal to
<i>-Vcc</i> or <i>Vsat-</i>,

98
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:39,072
for sure, we'll find a current that will be
positive in this direction

99
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:43,952
and that will have a voltage <i>VZ</i>,
that we see here,

100
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,150
and we'll find a voltage <i>Uj</i> here,

101
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,640
and we'll also find an output voltage
limited to <i>VZ + Uj</i>

102
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,180
in the other direction, with a minus sign.

103
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,850
It's simple to demonstrate that we can
easily impose

104
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,500
voltage levels at the output

105
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,720
that correspond to what we need

106
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,590
outside of the power voltage.

107
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,610
Remember that the resistance <i>R</i> is there
to limit the current <i>I+</i> and <i>I-</i>,

108
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,710
that will enter or exit the comparator

109
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,710
because there is a maximum current
that can be tolerated by the comparator.

110
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,320
If we exceed this, the output cuts out.

111
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,700
Here, this resistance should be calculated

112
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,700
in order to impose a traversing current
equal to <i>Imax</i>.

113
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,880
So, we're going to look at exactly
what is the current <i>Imax</i>

114
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,670
that we need to obtain.

115
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,700
And the current <i>Imax</i> depends on the
voltage here

116
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,360
and also on the resistance <i>R</i>
that we will have chosen.

117
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:39,691
This schema here, we have already seen,

118
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,821
or rather the graphs that we see here, we have
already seen

119
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,851
with the operational amplifiers.

120
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:48,851
If you take a comparator,

121
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:53,271
and the negative input of your comparator,
you put it to the volume,

122
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:59,111
and the positive input of your comparator,

123
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:04,891
and that the voltage source is the signal
that is here,

124
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,811
that has compared it to the volume,

125
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:11,001
forcibly while passing through zero,

126
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:15,831
so each time your comparator
 passes through zero,

127
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:21,931
it will compare in relation to the
potential here.

128
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:24,011
So if the voltage is positive,

129
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,151
as we can see here,

130
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:27,361
this voltage here is positive

131
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:29,282
so we see that

132
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:35,112
this part of the curve corresponds to the
state <i>Vsat+</i>

133
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:38,652
and we discover that this part of the curve,

134
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:40,432
this part here for example,

135
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:42,542
and this one here for sure,

136
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:48,553
that switches the comparator to
<i>Vsat-</i> et <i>Vsat-</i> here.

137
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:51,303
The same for <i>Vsat+</i>, etc., etc.

138
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,543
We call that a Zero-point detector.

139
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:59,033
We have been able to compare any form
of signals that

140
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:00,883
passes through zero

141
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:03,793
each time the signal passes through,

142
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:07,793
switched the negative voltage to
a positive voltage,

143
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:10,703
we've got a strange signal showing up
at the output

144
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:13,133
that will give us a state 1 and
a state 0,

145
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,663
if we're talking about a logical circuit.

146
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:18,718
I'd like to now give you an example,

147
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:21,568
and guide you towards some practical work,

148
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:25,568
and let you know that you can already
do tri circuits

149
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:28,278
such as a temperature controller.

150
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,468
What's a temperature controller?

151
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,828
It's a type of regulation
that we call all or nothing.

152
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,436
Meaning that I’d like to have
an output voltage

153
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:39,666
or something that gives me a signal,

154
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:43,966
and that signal tells me that the
temperature has risen

155
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,436
up to a threshold value

156
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:49,556
or falls below the threshold value.

157
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:51,404
So, in this example,

158
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,924
I've decided to ask you to make a circuit

159
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:58,674
where we use a resistance called <i>RNTC</i>,

160
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:02,024
or a resistance coefficient
 to negative temperature.

161
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:04,954
It's a resistance that has a non-linier curve.

162
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:08,631
Its resistance depends on the temperature.

163
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:13,314
We talk about a resistance <i>RNTC</i> to
an ambient temperature

164
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:15,804
that the manufacturer gives us.

165
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:20,634
Here, the manufacturer says that this
resistance is 33kΩ

166
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:24,634
when the temperature is 25°.

167
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:29,073
If you take this value

168
00:09:29,073 --> 00:09:33,973
and you put a resistance <i>R1</i>
that is equal to the value <i>RNTC</i>

169
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,783
it signifies that at ambient temperature,

170
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:42,623
you will have a voltage equal to
<i>Vcc/2</i>, <i>R1</i> equals <i>RNTC</i>,

171
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,853
and here, I suggest you take a potentiometer

172
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,713
and connect the potentiometer as if it's
a resistant divisor,

173
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,813
this time that you're controlling manually,

174
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:54,553
and you also divide <i>Vcc</i> by two.

175
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:59,683
This means that you place the cursor in the
 middle of the range of the potentiometer.

176
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,293
So you can put any time of potentiometer

177
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:04,013
between this value and this value.

178
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:06,283
It's simply its limit.

179
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:08,153
The current that passes,

180
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,033
the comparison effect,

181
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:12,173
it's when the cursor is in the middle,

182
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:14,803
independent from the potentiometer’s value,

183
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:18,533
you will find here <i>Vref</i> is equal to <i>Vcc/2</i>.

184
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,043
And if you have an ambient temperature
on this side,

185
00:10:21,043 --> 00:10:23,623
you will find <i>Vin</i> equals <i>Vcc/2</i>.

186
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,393
Plug in the comparator.

187
00:10:25,393 --> 00:10:29,023
The comparator will have <i>Vin</i> equals <i>Vref</i>.

188
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:32,793
Meaning that the voltage
 <i>Vout</i> is in the transition zone,

189
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:34,153
in practice.

190
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:37,076
If you really want to maintain this state

191
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,506
that is extremely difficult,

192
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:41,816
because you only need a very small variation
in temperature here,

193
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:44,776
or a small mechanical variation in order that
straight away <i>Vout</i>

194
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,976
switches to <i>Vsat+</i> and <i>Vsat-</i>.

195
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:49,216
But suppose that <i>Vin</i> equals <i>Vref</i>.

196
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,646
In practice, this voltage, here,

197
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:53,706
is starting to move all over the place.

198
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:56,996
It's jumping up to <i>Vsat+</i>
and falling down to <i>Vsat-</i>.

199
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,803
In the case of the example that I'm
going to give you,

200
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:06,663
I ask you to plug in a luminescent diode, an LED,

201
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:12,273
and I'm going to ask you to regulate this voltage
to the same level as this voltage,

202
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,043
approximately,

203
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:17,833
in order to be at the regulation buffer
at an ambient temperature.

204
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:22,353
Then, we're going to try to
warm up the resistance <i>RNTC</i>

205
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:26,353
by blowing on it, and putting on a finger
at body temperature,

206
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:30,353
and you will see the temperature rise,

207
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,313
and we will get...

208
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,711
When the temperature rises,

209
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,811
we will have a lower resistance.

210
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:41,211
And if the resistance goes down,

211
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:45,211
we'll get <i>Vin</i> that follows
the value of <i>RNTC</i>.

212
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:48,801
If <i>RNTC</i> gets smaller, <i>Vin</i>
will get smaller with it.

213
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:50,311
So, if <i>Vin</i> drops with it,

214
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:54,311
having given <i>Vref</i> we will have regulated
to an ambient temperature equal to <i>Vin</i>,

215
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:58,311
you'll get the <i>V+</i> that will drop
less than the <i>V-</i>,

216
00:11:58,311 --> 00:12:04,541
and straight away the <i>Vout</i> will switch
to saturated negative voltage.

217
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:09,617
And if it's the saturated negative voltage

218
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:14,047
via a comparator supplied with more
or less 15V,

219
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:18,047
probably the output value will be
about the same size

220
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,467
as the power supply,

221
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:22,067
so you'll get <i>Vout</i> equals -15V

222
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:26,307
and there will be a current passing in that
direction from the zero,

223
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:28,267
because here, we've connected it to the volume,

224
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:34,137
to the output of our comparator,
it will go inside there,

225
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:39,597
and pick up the negative voltage

226
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:44,497
in order to pass into the circuit here to <i>-Vcc</i>.

227
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,177
And your diode will light up.

228
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,083
As usual, I'm going to ask you to calculate

229
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,313
the resistance <i>R2</i>

230
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:55,243
As soon as we connect a diode at the output
and that diode becomes a conductor,

231
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:56,863
we'll need to limit the current.

232
00:12:56,863 --> 00:13:00,863
Here, I suggest that you limit the current
to around 20mA.

233
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,863
And I'll tell you some classic effects that

234
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:08,663
light-emitting diodes have on voltage drop

235
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:12,523
that is around 1.7V for a red diode,

236
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:15,633
that I chose because, later on I'm going
to demonstrate

237
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:16,783
that experiment.

238
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:21,164
Here's the relationship that we can write
at the output.

239
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:23,884
Remember that here, <i>Vout</i>,

240
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,840
when the voltage <i>Vin</i> is lower
than <i>Vref</i>,

241
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,700
so when <i>Vin</i> drops below <i>Vref</i>,

242
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,550
we get <i>Vout</i> equal to the voltage <i>VL</i>
or <i>-Vcc</i>,

243
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,910
so <i>L</i> is <i>low</i>.

244
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,070
And at this point, we have a current that
is flowing in this direction.

245
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:52,235
So it's this <i>VL</i> that is equal to -15V,

246
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:56,235
it should be equal to the voltage drop
on this resistance.

247
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,115
So it's <i>Iout</i> times <i>R2</i>

248
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:01,145
plus the voltage drop here,

249
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:03,695
which is the voltage of <i>VLED</i>.

250
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:07,511
That's what I've written here.

251
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:13,199
So, <i>VL</i> equals <i>-Iout R2 - VLED</i>.

252
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,199
You can measure the resistance <i>R2</i>

253
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,369
to guarantee that your current <i>Iout</i>
stays around 20mA

254
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:25,359
to avoid having a large current

255
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:27,139
passing through the diode,

256
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:31,139
that could either damage it if
the comparator manages to supply

257
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,339
a large current,

258
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,339
either cut the output voltage

259
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,439
tolerated by the comparators.

260
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:41,267
The voltage <i>Vin</i> is a resistance divisor,

261
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:44,007
clear, because the current here is equal to zero.

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,030
So maybe we could write <i>RNTC</i>
divided by <i>RNTC + R1</i>

263
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,170
to find out the voltage <i>Vin</i>.

264
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:55,929
And we'll see what happens in the laboratory

265
00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:00,859
if we connect this and equalise ourselves
to an ambient temperature.

266
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:05,119
Afterwards, we'll see what happens when
we heat the diode <i>RNTC</i>

267
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:09,119
when we put our finger over it
and change the temperature,

268
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,679
by increasing the temperature
in this way,

269
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,919
we're lowering the resistance value,

270
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,809
thereby we're reducing the voltage <i>Vin</i>

271
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:18,519
and so the voltage <i>V+</i> becomes less than <i>V-</i>

272
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:23,439
and the output voltage switches to <i>-VL</i>,
and ends up at <i>VL</i> that is -15V,

273
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:26,439
and will induct a current that will
pass in this direction.

274
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:32,151
Here is our CTN resistance and here's the LED
which will light up later on.

275
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:36,286
So what we're going to do now,
is adjust the potentiometer

276
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:38,416
to the voltage <i>Vcc/2</i>,

277
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:42,416
so compare the tension to the
reference value,

278
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,676
that corresponds to the ambient
temperature.

279
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:47,386
We see that the LED is flashing
on and off,

280
00:15:47,386 --> 00:15:51,386
corresponding to the settings and
the ambient temperature.

281
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:53,327
So, from now on,

282
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,567
we are more or less on the switching
threshold.

283
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,407
We'll warm up the CTN.

284
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:00,347
We'll try to get it to measure the body
temperature

285
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,337
by putting our finger over it.

286
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:06,337
So 37° is surely warmer than the
outside temperature,

287
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:08,947
and we'll see the LED light up.

288
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,259
Here, the LED is now showing

289
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:13,519
that there has been a switch in
our comparator.

290
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,889
We'll let the resistor take the external
temperature again

291
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:24,659
and we'll see the LED go out until the
CTN temperature

292
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:28,086
equalises, like earlier on, 
at the room temperature

293
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:30,736
where we're carrying out the experiment.
