1
00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:07,807
Now we're going to take a look
at the inverting threshold comparator.

2
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:12,177
So we've just looked at the non-inverting 
comparator, the Non-inverting Schmitt Trigger

3
00:00:12,177 --> 00:00:13,717
has been studied.

4
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:18,057
So I'm going to quickly go over the
inverting threshold comparator

5
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:20,547
because the principles are the same.

6
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:24,977
I take my comparator and invert
<i>Vref</i> and <i>v1</i>.

7
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:29,257
Remember that in the non-inverting application,

8
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:33,697
<i>v1</i> was connected here,
<i>Vref</i> was connected here.

9
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,923
This time, I connect <i>v1</i>
to the negative terminal

10
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:41,153
and I put in a constant voltage <i>Vref</i>
on this resistance <i>R1</i>

11
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:47,503
and again, I isolate the resistant divisor part,

12
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:49,483
here,

13
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:53,483
and I watch what is happening to the potential <i>vA</i>

14
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:59,073
because by comparing <i>vA</i> to <i>v1</i>,
I will know when <i>v2</i>

15
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:03,073
changes from <i>VL</i> to <i>VH</i>
or from <i>VH</i> to <i>VL</i>.

16
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:06,494
as usual, <i>v2</i>
can only have one of two values.

17
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:11,694
<i>vA</i> in relation to <i>v1</i>,
we'll call <i>VT1</i>

18
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:14,404
and <i>VT2</i>.

19
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:18,871
There are two values for <i>v1</i>
that allow <i>v2</i>

20
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,341
to change from one to the other

21
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:24,281
and these two values
are either <i>VT1</i>, or <i>VT2</i>.

22
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:28,392
So, we'll write down again
 the extracted expression

23
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:31,502
in relation to the resistant
 divisor by superposition.

24
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,545
We'll take both cases.

25
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:39,222
To start with, we put one times
<i>v2</i> equals à<i> VH</i>.

26
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:42,184
We're going to say that <i>v1</i> equals <i>VT1</i>,

27
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:47,234
the first transition value 
for the output voltage.

28
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:54,118
and we're going to replace <i>vA</i> therefore with
<i>VT1</i> and <i>v2</i> by <i>VH</i>

29
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:58,118
and we find a relationship 
that controls the behaviour

30
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,338
of what passes through the 
comparator and that will give us

31
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:07,378
when the value <i>v1</i> for <i>VT1</i>,
that I'll call <i>VT1</i>,

32
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:10,398
will switch the state from <i>VH</i> to <i>VL</i>.

33
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:17,242
And here's the expression written differently,
exactly like we did before.

34
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:21,527
So <i>VT1</i> is equal to <i>V'ref</i>,
with <i>V'ref</i> being simply

35
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:24,737
this term here, that I simplify just so
I don't repeat myself,

36
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,677
with <i>Vref</i> multiplied by the resistance
relationship.

37
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:34,839
And I see here that when <i>v1</i> increases,
if the output is at <i>VH</i>,

38
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:42,460
I will need to go up to <i>VT1</i>
before the output switched to <i>VL</i>.

39
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:49,664
So there is the voltage <i>VT1</i>
that switched from <i>VH</i> to <i>VL</i>

40
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:55,684
once I go over the value r<i>VT1</i>
that I've given to <i>v1</i>.

41
00:02:56,824 --> 00:03:00,414
I'm going to look at when the output is at <i>VL</i>.

42
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:04,346
So, we've just looked at the case where <i>v2</i>
is equal to <i>VH</i>,

43
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:07,426
now we're going to look at the case where
<i>v2</i> is equal to <i>VL</i>.

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,530
I replace <i>v2</i> with <i>VL</i>.

45
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:17,657
I replace <i>vA</i>
by the voltage value <i>VT2</i>

46
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:20,827
that I should have in order for it to switch.

47
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,660
And I write down the relationship in a simple way.

48
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:29,125
It comes out like

49
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,590
that I have simplified like this

50
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,836
and that I describe like this.

51
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,780
And here, we've got the same story.

52
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:43,401
I need to reduce the value of <i>v1</i>,

53
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:48,871
the voltage output is <i>VL</i>,
so negative saturation.

54
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:50,881
I'm now reducing the value of <i>v1</i>.

55
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:52,481
I'm lowering the value.

56
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,871
I arrive at a certain threshold,
a threshold value

57
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:59,331
and voila, the output voltage switches
to <i>VH</i>

58
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:06,241
and I go from <i>VL</i> up until <i>VH</i>
for the voltage switch <i>VT2</i>

59
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,781
in relation to the input voltage <i>v1</i>.

60
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:15,406
And here is the accumulation of both cases

61
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:18,186
and I find myself with this story of hysteresis

62
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:20,266
that we talked about earlier on

63
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:22,606
that has the width <i>ΔVT</i>.

64
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:27,069
So this width from here to here is
always equal to

65
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,052
<i>ΔVT</i>.

66
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:37,947
But we call it an
 inverting threshold comparator.

67
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:45,462
The word "inverting" comes from the
 fact that in increasing the value of <i>v1</i>,

68
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:47,152
I find myself with <i>VH</i>.

69
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,174
The output <i>v2</i> is at <i>VH</i>.

70
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,890
I was increasing it up to <i>VT1</i>
and there, the output switched

71
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,220
to a lower value.

72
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,220
So, the tendency on <i>v1</i> being to increase,

73
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,220
the tendency on <i>v2</i>
is to switch from high to low.

74
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:07,338
And the same when <i>v1</i> decreases,

75
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:11,817
the tendency on <i>v1</i> is to decrease
and the tendency on <i>v2</i>

76
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:14,207
is to afterwards switch to 
the opposite direction,

77
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,497
meaning that <i>VL</i> switches to <i>VH</i>.

78
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:20,497
That's why it's called an 
inverting threshold comparator.

79
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:26,753
And again, the width of our hysteresis

80
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:29,769
depends on the resistance relationship

81
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:34,745
and that the reference voltage allows me to
move this

82
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:38,345
on the dial or rather move it to remain centred

83
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:40,295
in relation to the value <i>Vref</i>.

84
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:44,291
To see this type of phenomenon in the
laboratory,

85
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,291
the experiment is always the same.

86
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:52,375
As we did earlier on, we take our TP

87
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:57,565
with the comparator, 
putting a resistance of 100kΩ

88
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,365
and another of 1kΩ.

89
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:03,365
If you keep to the same experiment as earlier on,

90
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:10,075
you just need to invert <i>Vref</i> and <i>v1</i>
and calculate the two voltage thresholds

91
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:14,490
and you'll get 3.9 for <i>VT1</i>

92
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:16,502
and <i>VT2</i> is equal to 1.5V.

93
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:23,950
And you'll find, the same,
we put here a voltage <i>Vref</i> equal to 3V.

94
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:30,803
And we put a triangular signal
with a peak value of +/-10V.

95
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:36,908
And we saw the comparison in relation
to <i>VT1</i> and <i>VT2</i>.

96
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,190
Here, we need that the voltage <i>v1</i>
becomes greater than <i>VT1</i>

97
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,810
in order for the output voltage to switch
from <i>VH</i> to <i>VL</i>.

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,400
And again, it's the opposite
so we see the effect inverted.

99
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,765
Here, the voltage has increased and the
output has decreased.

100
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:59,595
Here, the voltage has decreased and the
output has increased,

101
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:01,235
has passed to <i>VH</i>.

102
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:07,266
And this same TP, we're going to connect and look
at on an oscilloscope.

103
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:11,504
And here is our inverting comparator that
is now connected.

104
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,140
We've got the triangular signal and we can see the
switching threshold

105
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,030
that will switch the output voltage to <i>Vsat-</i>.

106
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:26,485
And on the other side, when the output
switches to <i>Vsat+</i>

107
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:31,666
we can see very clearly that it's
an inverter

108
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,346
because when the voltage 
goes over a certain value,

109
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:35,596
the output reduces.

110
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:39,806
And now, we're modifying the reference value.

111
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:46,194
So we see that <i>ΔVT</i> is constant,
but we are changing

112
00:07:46,194 --> 00:07:49,724
the impulsion width at the output of
our threshold comparator.

113
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:53,348
I'd like to conclude this lesson with
by comparing

114
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,348
two applications of a non-inverting
 threshold comparator

115
00:07:57,348 --> 00:08:00,798
and the application of an inverting 
threshold comparator.

116
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:04,644
I think we can use the example of the
temperature experiment

117
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:07,644
and say that earlier on, when we made a comparison

118
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:11,504
with the resistance <i>RCTN</i>,

119
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:15,504
we simply demonstrated that there was only one
threshold value.

120
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:20,841
When we create two threshold values,
any comparison,

121
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:25,251
or any interior fluctuation

122
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:29,781
of this window <i>VT1</i> to <i>VT2</i>
is absorbed by the hysteresis.

123
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,343
So, if we had compared to one
reference threshold value,

124
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:37,773
each time that we went over the reference value,

125
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:40,803
the output would have switched.

126
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:45,383
Now we've got this hysteresis

127
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:49,377
which shows that all variation

128
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:52,827
needs to be over <i>VT2</i> or below <i>VT1</i>

129
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:55,117
in order to correspond to an output state.

130
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:59,692
So, if you use a thermostat

131
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:04,738
that contains a hysteresis and you
compare the thresholds

132
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:10,798
that you have set up,
let’s say from 19° to 21°,

133
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:14,238
your thermostat won't turn on the

134
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:17,748
heating controls until the temperature

135
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:22,118
goes over 21°
to stop the heating

136
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:25,068
and it needs to drop below 19° before
the heating will turn back on.

137
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,020
Any fluctuation between the two, is in fact
the memory effect of the hysteresis.

138
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:32,942
So a decision has to be made here.

139
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:38,146
And a decision is to be made here, or maybe here.

140
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:40,243
And that's it.

141
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:46,548
It's the same for the other one

142
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:49,554
where we find a reversed logic.

143
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:52,477
So, I'll take the same curves as earlier on

144
00:09:52,477 --> 00:09:54,627
and we find that there's a reverse logic.

145
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,880
And this logic, put simply, it’s the
tri-logic circuits

146
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,260
that come afterwards and allow us to say

147
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,770
how to treat a signal, to turn something off,

148
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,260
to turn it back on
if we speak about temperature.

149
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:13,440
The state needs to be read <i>-VL</i>,
or rather the value <i>Vsat-</i>, and <i>Vsat+</i>

150
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,260
with the decision circuits necessary for this
type of control box.

151
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:22,881
And so, we've come to the end of the chapter
on comparators.

152
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:25,121
We looked at the simple comparator,

153
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:27,641
the inverting threshold comparator,

154
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:30,201
the non-inverting comparator.

155
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,360
It's a chapter that is 
relatively easy to understand

156
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,240
because all that is needed,

157
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,570
is a conversation between 
analog data at the input

158
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,660
that becomes digital at the output.

159
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:45,693
And with that, I'd like to add one more thing:

160
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:48,813
using the comparator,

161
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:52,103
using the comparator circuit, it's the interface

162
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:55,483
between the analog world and the digital world.

163
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:59,513
And in practice, the comparator has at its input,

164
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:01,583
as does an op-amp,

165
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,003
a positive and a negative terminal.

166
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:07,532
And at the output, there is an output that
could be binary.

167
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,460
So it's a logical circuit.

168
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:13,538
And quite often, it's
 preceded by a simple inverter.

169
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:17,538
If there is no simple inverter,

170
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:21,538
I'm talking about a logical inverter
that's found inside

171
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:25,028
and that plays the role of the output stage
of a comparator.

172
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:29,028
So, the input of a comparator is analog.

173
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:33,302
The output of a comparator
 is fundamentally logic

174
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:37,302
because once we've taken
 the output that is binary,

175
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:40,132
well, we just have to treat it as a binary signal

176
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:45,722
and that leads us on to tri-digital circuits.
