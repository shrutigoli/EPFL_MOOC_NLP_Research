1
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:06,882
Now that we've seen the simple comparator,

2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:11,602
I would like to introduce what we call
a positive reaction.

3
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:18,266
We've talked about the negative reaction,
the negative feedback,

4
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:20,826
and here, we're going to talk
about positive feedback.

5
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:23,743
The comparator is here.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,900
We've added a resistant divisor at the output.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,090
And behaves like that.

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,139
The resistant divisor will take the
voltage <i>Vout</i>,

9
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:39,799
and reduce it by multiplying it by
<i>R2/R1 + R2</i>,

10
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:43,799
and taking it to the positive terminal
and add it to the input.

11
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:48,279
We can come to a simple conclusion here

12
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:51,909
to show how it would behave in this type
of circuit

13
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:57,612
as we did with the same circuit when
it was in negative feedback.

14
00:00:57,612 --> 00:01:00,392
In negative feedback, remember

15
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:01,402
what we did before.

16
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:05,952
We called this a negative reaction when
we had inverted

17
00:01:05,952 --> 00:01:09,682
the plus and the minus.

18
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:14,472
When the minus was here,

19
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:17,221
we did the same operation,

20
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:21,741
we have reduced the voltage output
but we subtracted that

21
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,653
to an op-amp

22
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:28,333
and when we studied that, we said,

23
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:33,143
that it was called a negative reaction because
 the relationship between <i>Vin</i> and <i>Vout</i> was

24
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:37,383
linear and that our amplifier when in
a negative reaction,

25
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:40,593
meaning when the resistant divisor reduces
the voltage,

26
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:42,643
will take it to the negative terminal,

27
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:45,953
it fixes our amplifier in the linear zone,

28
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:48,693
it could also have one of the values
that appear here

29
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,263
and our amplifier won't move,

30
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:54,953
it will stay here because there is a
unique linear reaction

31
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:57,993
between <i>Vin</i> and <i>Vout</i>
that passes through the value

32
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,213
of the resistance,
or the resistances <i>R1</i> et <i>R2</i>.

33
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:05,488
So, whatever the values are here, the amp
doesn't move, it stays here.

34
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:09,087
Now,
if you take the same circuit,

35
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,287
and look at the circuit,
but this time,

36
00:02:11,287 --> 00:02:15,287
we're going to put the reduced voltage
output onto the positive terminal.

37
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:16,744
Let's take an example.

38
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:19,594
We've got a state at the input, <i>Vin</i>.

39
00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:22,684
We're going to use the example
that <i>Vin</i> equals 1.

40
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:28,006
Remember that <i>Vout</i> can only
have one of two values,

41
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:31,596
either saturation positive,
or saturation negative.

42
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:34,102
And at the moment when we plug in our comparator,

43
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:37,122
we don't know if it's here, or here.

44
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:38,562
It could be either.

45
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:46,306
Suppose that we find that
<i>Vout</i> is equal to <i>Vsat+</i>.

46
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,642
Here, if the power supply is 15V,

47
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:54,432
so we have 15V,

48
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:57,622
15V, we'll take the same example as before,

49
00:02:57,622 --> 00:03:01,622
meaning that I've got <i>R</i> and <i>R</i>,
the same value,

50
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:07,042
therefore, if I've the same value,
I'll find myself here

51
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:11,152
with <i>Vout</i> times 1/2

52
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:14,462
so, I'll get 7.5V.

53
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,120
7.5 is much greater than 1V, so the plus
is greater than the minus,

54
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,850
so, nothing will happen,

55
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,260
it will stay here.

56
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:29,116
So, there's nothing that will trigger the
comparator in this situation.

57
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:32,056
The only thing that could trigger it is this.

58
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:35,547
It's that if we find ourselves in this situation,

59
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:40,557
and that <i>Vin</i> equalises 
with a transition voltage,

60
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:46,217
that I'm going to call <i>VT</i>,
that is equal to 7.5.

61
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:50,887
So, we're going to change this voltage from 1 to 7.5

62
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:54,557
meaning that the voltage that you see on the <i>V-</i>

63
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:58,167
compared to 7.5 that was on the <i>V+</i>.

64
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:02,277
If the transition voltage equals, this one here
equals this one here,

65
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:05,417
it's as if we were saying that we've got to here.

66
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:09,417
We've changed the voltage, and we've got a
voltage transition,

67
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,287
and here, my comparator,

68
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:16,937
if by chance 7.5 is an epsilon greater than 7.5,

69
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:21,257
that's it, the negative terminal is greater than
the positive

70
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:25,257
and it will trigger the comparator

71
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:29,257
from 15v that will seek out the -15v,

72
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,362
because here, the voltage at the
negative terminal

73
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:35,332
has gone over the positive value.

74
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:38,102
So, we're talking about the transition voltage

75
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:40,472
that will trigger our comparator.

76
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:44,472
And here, once it has switched over here,
we can add a minus sign here,

77
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:48,394
and we'll keep the same condition until, once more,

78
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:52,284
the transition voltage goes over 7.5

79
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:56,284
because if the voltage here wasn't 7.5,

80
00:04:56,284 --> 00:05:00,034
nothing would happen, we'd be either here, or here.

81
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:07,024
So, you'd still find yourselves with either
<i>Vsat+</i>, or <i>Vsat-</i>.

82
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:10,785
There isn't any other option for the voltage <i>Vout</i>.

83
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,391
We're going to take our comparators again

84
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:16,741
and we're going to add the circuit 
that you see around it.

85
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:19,261
Meaning that, this time,
 we're going to do two things.

86
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:23,741
We've added a resistant divisor <i>R2</i> and <i>R1</i>,

87
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,654
that has got an output voltage <i>V2</i>

88
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:28,964
and an input voltage <i>V1</i>

89
00:05:28,964 --> 00:05:31,784
but we've also added a voltage reference,

90
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:35,784
a DC value that we're going to put at the
negative input.

91
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:38,724
We're going to analyse what happens and you'll see,
this is called

92
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:42,724
non-inverting threshold comparator,

93
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:45,154
or a Schmitt trigger,

94
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:47,334
and we'll look at it in the following way.

95
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:49,554
If you take the voltage <i>V2</i>,

96
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:54,684
so <i>V2</i>, as always,
can only be <i>VH</i> or <i>VL</i>.

97
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:59,034
<i>VH</i> is <i>Vsat+</i>, <i>VL</i> for <i>Vsat-</i>,

98
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:02,412
which are generally around about <i>+Vcc</i>, <i>-Vcc</i>,

99
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:05,132
but these, these are 
values linked to comparators

100
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,192
that we purchase and that we use,

101
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:10,952
there are different values of <i>VH</i> and of <i>VL</i>
found on the market

102
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:13,252
and it depends on the power voltage.

103
00:06:15,397 --> 00:06:23,297
We've understood that the comparator will
 react by comparing <i>V+</i> with <i>V-</i>.

104
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:27,277
So now, I should look at what's
 happening in the node <i>A</i>,

105
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:31,277
and I should compare it to what's happening
in the node <i>Vref</i>.

106
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:33,617
In order to understand what's going on in
the node <i>A</i>,

107
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:37,617
take this part of the circuit,

108
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:44,848
and draw it on the side.

109
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:49,173
So we know <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i>, the node <i>A</i>.

110
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:54,792
I would like to know what happens 
with the voltage <i>vA</i> compared to <i>Vref</i>

111
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:57,222
to see if <i>vA</i> is greater than <i>Vref</i>.

112
00:06:57,222 --> 00:07:00,882
We've just seen that the comparator is going to
go towards <i>Vsat+</i>,

113
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:03,292
and the opposite, it's going towards <i>Vsat-</i>.

114
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:05,702
So, I'd like to write this voltage <i>VA</i>.

115
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:09,956
By analysing this part, 
the superposition principle

116
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:12,996
allows us to read it in the following way.

117
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,326
I'm going to start by...

118
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,659
I'm going to start by cancelling <i>V2</i>.

119
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:28,901
So, I short circuit <i>V2</i> to the volume.

120
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:31,269
and I express <i>VA</i> in function to <i>V1</i>.

121
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:33,118
And it gives me this.

122
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:38,621
So <i>VA = V1 R2/R1 + R2</i>,

123
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:40,701
as long as <i>V2 = 0</i>.

124
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:49,091
I'll do the same over this side here.

125
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:57,158
I put <i>V1 = 0</i>
and I look at <i>VA</i> in function to <i>V2</i>

126
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,968
and I find this second part here,

127
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:05,158
so I find that
<i>VA = V2 R1/R1 + R2</i>.

128
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:13,074
Coming from this postulate,
I get the voltage <i>VA</i>

129e
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:15,194
that depends on <i>V1</i> an on <i>V2</i>.

129
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,474
I know <i>V2</i>.

130
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,292
<i>V2</i> can only be <i>VH</i> and <i>VL</i>.

131
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,000
Now, what's happening to <i>V1</i>?

132
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:26,491
<i>V1</i>, is the input voltage that the user plugs in,

133
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:29,101
it's a voltage that varies over time,

134
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:33,291
and the voltage <i>VA</i> will subject
the variation of <i>V1</i>

135
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,641
depending on if <i>V2</i> is <i>VH</i> or <i>VL</i>.

136
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,231
So, we're going to decide to proceed in the
following way.

137
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,848
We're going to take example 1

138
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:47,458
and consider that we're starting with <i>V2 = VH</i>.

139
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:54,402
So, the output tension is equal to a
voltage of <i>Vsat+, VH</i>.

140
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,952
And we ask ourselves this:

141
00:08:57,952 --> 00:09:03,682
what is the value of <i>V1</i>
that will allow V2

142
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:10,902
to transit the value <i>VH</i>
to the value <i>VL</i>?

143
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,211
So we ask ourselves this question.

144
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:18,761
When varying, it will cause <i>A</i> to vary,
knowing that <i>V2</i> is fixed.

145
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:22,981
Watch, <i>VA</i> depends on <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i>
but <i>V2</i> is fixed,

146
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:28,111
there is only on value <i>V1</i> for which this 
node here is equal to this node here,

147
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:32,111
and straight away <i>V2</i> will witch states,

148
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:35,701
it will pass from one value to
 another, and in doing so,

149
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,031
we want to see what the value is.

150
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:44,041
We were at <i>VH</i> and we want to go towards
a voltage <i>VL</i>.

151
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:51,625
So, we're going to call the voltage <i>V1 = VT1</i>,

152
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,355
the value for which,

153
00:09:55,355 --> 00:10:00,675
when <i>V1 = VT1</i>,
<i>V2</i> will switch from <i>VH</i> to <i>VL</i>.

154
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:06,463
So, I'm going to replace <i>V1</i> with <i>VT1</i>
because I'm asking myself

155
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,733
what is the value of this <i>V1</i>,
that I'm going to call <i>VT1</i>,

156
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:16,243
for which the voltage <i>V2</i>,
which is nothing more than equal to <i>VH</i>,

157
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:20,243
will switch when <i>VA = Vref</i>.

158
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,479
So I will get the switch.

159
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:29,348
And here's the reasoning that I've just done.

160
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,860
I replaced <i>V1</i> with <i>VT1</i>.

161
00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:34,804
I replaced <i>V2</i> with <i>VH</i>.

162
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:39,236
And I watch <i>VA</i>

163
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:46,477
and I'm going to say that when <i>VA = Vref</i>,
it's when this equals this,

164
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:49,637
that I've the right to put this and this

165
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:52,867
because it's at this point,
that the switch will occur

166
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:58,897
and that the famous <i>VH</i> will switch and become
equal to <i>VL</i>.

167
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:02,932
So I should say what is the value of <i>VT1</i>

168
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:06,932
for which <i>VH</i> will switch to <i>VL</i>.

169
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:11,335
And the calculation comes from this analysis.

170
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:14,115
I expressed i>VT1

171
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:18,181
and that gave me this relationship

172
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:23,062
that I replaced by a simple reading,

173
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:29,841
<i>Vref R1 + R2/R2</i> by a value that I call <i>V'ref</i>.

174
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:34,188
So that can give me this simple relationship

175
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:37,488
that has the transition value <i>VT1</i>.

176
00:11:39,177 --> 00:11:44,337
And this transition value <i>VT1</i> for which
I've the transition

177
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,717
that I see here.

178
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:53,067
Meaning that we have the state
<i>V2 = VH</i> here.

179
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:59,935
We get to a value of <i>VT1</i>.

180
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:04,621
Watch, <i>V1</i> goes down,
<i>V2</i> remains equal to <i>VH</i>.

181
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:05,981
Nothing happens.

182
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:08,081
We get to a value of <i>VT1</i>.

183
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:13,221
<i>VT1</i> corresponds to the
potential value <i>VA = Vref</i>.

184
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:16,747
So immediately my comparator switches,

185
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:19,337
and the output goes back to being equal to <i>VL</i>.

186
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:24,307
So it's certain than <i>V2</i> is either this,
or this, nothing else.

187
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:27,257
And we have lots of possible values for <i>V1</i>.

188
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:31,608
And it's only one value that will 
push my resistant divisor

189
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:37,308
to bring the potential to the node <i>A</i>
so that it is equal to the potential at <i>Vref</i>

190
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:41,308
and it's here that the
 comparator changes the output

191
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:43,598
and switches from here to here.

192
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:47,228
We're going to look at the same circuit

193
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:50,628
and this time we're going to look
at when <i>V2 = VL</i>.

194
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:55,688
We're at <i>VL</i>.
We've got <i>V2 = VL</i>

195
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:59,328
and we're going to see what happens when now

196
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:03,968
there is a change from <i>VL</i> to <i>VH</i>.

197
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:08,705
So I'd like to go backwards

198
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,195
using the same relationships,

199
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:15,795
but this time replacing <i>V2</i> with <i>VL</i>,

200
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,795
and I'm going to call <i>V1</i> <i>VT2</i>,

201
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:22,985
because it's a transition to another value.

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,580
And I'm going to replace <i>V2</i> with <i>VL</i>

203
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,440
and I write here and say that when
<i>VA = Vref</i>,

204
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,470
this transition will take place and I
can calculate

205
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,740
the expression as I did earlier on.

206
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:45,939
And here are the results once <i>VT2</i> is expressed

207
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:47,759
in function to our <i>Vref</i>

208
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,559
and the negative voltage saturation of
the comparator.

209
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:56,247
In the same way, I replace the term that
I've got here,

210
00:13:56,247 --> 00:14:01,297
to make it easier to read the formula, by a value
that I call <i>Vref</i>,

211
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:06,767
and I find a second voltage switch <i>VT2</i>

212
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:12,697
in order that my output voltage passed from
<i>VL</i> à <i>VH</i>

213
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:15,877
and that, this time, the transition goes up.

214
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,720
So we increase <i>V1</i>,
there are all the values,

215
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,850
nothing happens to the output of the comparator,

216
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,400
it's going to stay in negative saturation,

217
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:30,590
it will arrive at a calculated value that
corresponds to <i>VT2</i>,

218
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:36,690
and here, the comparator will sense that
the <i>V+</i>, the positive input,

219
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,120
becomes greater than the negative input,

220
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,320
and it can only compare the two,

221
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,320
therefore it switches and will find itself with
a positive voltage saturation

222
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,710
that is <i>VH</i>.

223
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:49,514
I'd like to accumulate the two
 curves from earlier on,

224
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,284
and we get this type of curve.

225
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,284
In both cases,

226
00:14:54,284 --> 00:15:00,454
when the output was <i>VH</i>,
and we have a transition to <i>VL</i>,

227
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:05,524
and we call the voltage <i>V1 = VT1</i>
for which there was this transition,

228
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,320
and we ended up with <i>VL</i>,

229
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,700
and this time we increased <i>V1</i>
and look what happens.

230
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:19,443
We found ourselves at <i>VH</i>
and we started to reduce <i>V1</i>.

231
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,316
<i>V1</i> is going down.

232
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,277
We went via here <i>VT2</i>,
nothing happened.

233
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:26,728
We got <i>VT1</i>.

234
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:30,368
When we reached <i>VT1</i>,
the comparator switched over.

235
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:33,016
It had <i>VL</i>.

236
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:35,997
Now, we can continue to decrease <i>V1</i>,

237
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:39,127
nothing happens, it stays at <i>VL</i>.

238
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,579
If we go in the opposite direction,

239
00:15:42,695 --> 00:15:46,695
and in the opposite direction,
we are now increasing <i>V1</i>,

240
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,035
we are going in the direction here,

241
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,435
and we arrive here

242
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:52,735
<i>V1</i> is <i>VT1</i>, nothing happens.

243
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,994
We need to keep going until we reach here,

244
00:15:56,994 --> 00:16:02,784
around the value <i>VT2</i> and, voila,
the comparator switches to <i>VT2</i>.

245
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:08,992
So, we find ourselves with a schema that has
two possible outcomes,

246
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:14,312
one that switcher to <i>VH</i>,

247
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:17,132
and one that switches to <i>VL</i>,

248
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:19,322
but they aren't found in the same place.

249
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:24,282
The simple comparator has 
a unique threshold value

250
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:26,572
at which it switches each time.

251
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:30,689
This type of comparator has 
two threshold values,

252
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:34,989
and between the two, it depends on
which direction it goes,

253
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,929
if it passes the first value, it will
switch to the second,

254
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,929
if it passes in this direction, it passes
to the first value

255
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:43,559
and switches to the second.

256
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:49,335
We call this shape

257
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:51,075
a hysteresis loop,

258
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:55,075
and we call it a non-inverting
hysteresis threshold comparator

259
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:58,024
And why do we call in "non-inverting"?

260
00:16:58,024 --> 00:17:02,734

The term "non-inverting" comes from the fact
that when <i>V1</i> increases,

261
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:07,354
at a given moment, the output will also increase
from <i>VL</i> à <i>VH</i>

262
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:09,534
following it for a value.

263
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:13,548
The same when <i>V1</i> decreases,
we arrive at a value

264
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:17,228
where the output voltage
 follows in a binary action,

265
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:19,938
where it was at, it will come to <i>VL</i>.

266
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:23,638
So, if you make the width of this hysteresis,

267
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:30,018
this famous <i>ΔVT</i>,
that is the difference between <i>VT1</i> and <i>VT2</i>,

268
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:36,992
you'll find that <i>ΔVT</i> is proportional

269
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:42,342
to the resistance relationship that 
you will have added, <i>R1/R2</i>,

270
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:47,232
that multiplies the difference of the 
voltage saturation of your comparator.

271
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,671
And you'll see now what happens

272
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:53,951
with your voltage reference, if you move this
point here,

273
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:58,831
you'll see that the whole window will follow
in function

274
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:00,781
to the value of <i>Vref</i>.

275
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:05,817
The width of your hysteresis depends therefore
on the resistance relationship

276
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,857
and voltage saturation,

277
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:10,757
however, the reference value that you added,

278
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:15,127
will be centred and will move your window from
one place to another,

279
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,127
so you can compare that in function to this
<i>Vref</i>.

280
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:22,604
We're talking here about a memory effect.

281
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:28,593
We say that your hysteresis comparator retains
the information here.

282
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:34,149
So here, it passed, it didn't switch, it continued
to have a memory effect,

283
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:37,369
and it switched again further on,
the same in this direction,

284
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:38,789
so there is a memory effect.

285
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:41,239
It remembers the state in which it was before.

286
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:44,959
It keeps it for longer before switching to
another state,

287
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,649
it's the same in both directions.

288
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,530
I suggest that you test it for yourselves
in a laboratory.

289
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,110
So, take a comparator,

290
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,430
and plug in a resistance <i>R2 = 100kΩ</i>,

291
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,380
a resistance <i>R1 = 10kΩ</i>,

292
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,260
take note of the relationships that we
calculated earlier on,

293
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,990
to make a numerical calculation in function
to the resistance values

294
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,310
that I gave you,

295
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,310
taking into account the <i>VH</i> and <i>VL</i>
of a comparator on the market.

296
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,310
There are different types of these comparators.

297
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,920
Generally, the voltage 
saturations are symmetrical.

298
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,790
Not always, we sometimes find asymmetry in some

299
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,310
of these values,

300
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,233
but here, I've chosen a comparator

301
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:32,743
that has a voltage saturation of 13V for <i>VH</i>,

302
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:36,743
so <i>Vsat+ = 13</i>
and <i>Vsat- = -13</i>.

303
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,300
And at the same time, I ask you to take
a voltage <i>V1</i>

304
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,210
and plug in a triangular signal

305
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,710
that has a peak value equal to +10V and -10V,

306
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:55,770
and plug it in here and put a
continuous voltage <i>Vref = 3V</i>.

307
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,090
So to compare this node <i>A</i>,
that we talked about earlier on,

308
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,380
to the value that we find here that equals 3V,

309
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,380
so we put 3V here.

310
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:12,388
We're going to arrive for sure at a given state.

311
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:16,387
<i>V1</i> will vary depending on this curve.

312
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:21,536
While <i>V1</i> varies, this is fixed,
<i>VA</i> will follow the variation of <i>V1</i>.

313
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:27,826
At a given moment, <i>VA</i> will equal 3V and
your voltage will switch

314
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,826
in one direction, and then, switch back to the
other direction

315
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:37,066
depending on <i>VT1</i> and <i>VT2</i> that come
from the analytic relationships

316
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:38,976
that we've already calculated.

317
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:40,873
And here's what happens.

318
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:45,393
You will have a voltage <i>VT1</i>,
that's here,

319
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:47,772
that equals 2V.

320
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:55,800
You will have a voltage <i>VT2</i>
that equals 4.6V

321
00:20:56,498 --> 00:21:02,038
and you will have the comparison between
your triangular signal

322
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:08,528
and these two voltage levels that
 appear with the output of your <i>V2</i>.

323
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:14,459
Therefore <i>V2</i>, is either at 13V
when we are over <i>VT2</i>,

324
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:19,139
and we are at -13V
when we are below <i>VT1</i>.

325
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:23,281
And so we have the <i>ΔVT</i> that appears here.

326
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:30,730
This is our <i>ΔVT</i> that is
found between <i>VT2 - VT1</i>,

327
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,620
so the sum of 2.6V between the two

328
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,180
and that will be centred in
 relationship to the 3v,

329
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,440
that we can, by changing the 3V, move up or down,

330
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,100
which is what we'll see during the
 experiment once we have plugged in

331
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,970
this type of circuit to a oscilloscope.

332
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:51,517
So here's our experiment, now to the laboratory,

333
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:55,517
so our comparator, that has to voltage switches:

334
00:21:56,077 --> 00:22:00,927
<i>VT1</i>, that allows the output to pass to <i>Vsat+</i>,

335
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:05,627
<i>VT2</i>, that allows the output to descend to <i>Vsat-</i>.

336
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:10,858
And now, this output state that you see here,

337
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:16,228
whether it be at <i>Vsat+</i> or <i>Vsat-</i>,
is managed by a comparison

338
00:22:16,228 --> 00:22:17,858
with the triangular signal.

339
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:21,338
We are changing the reference voltage

340
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:28,368
and you are learning how 
we move the hysteresis window

341
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:32,018
on the input of this comparator.

342
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:37,237
Here, the width of the window stays the same,

343
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:42,467
however, moving it means 
we can increase or increase

344
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:44,547
the states <i>Vsat+</i> and <i>Vsat-</i>.
