1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,158
Today we are going to look at
the Bode diagram.

2
00:00:08,158 --> 00:00:10,308
So, what is a Bode diagram?

3
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:13,168
Well, a Bode diagram is just
a way of representing

4
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:15,308
what we call a transfer
function.

5
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:17,918
A transfer function
is a relationship

6
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:21,238
between an output
and an input variable

7
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,358
of a two-port network
in electronics

8
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,788
or other fields.

9
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,062
So, when we have
an output variable -

10
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:32,272
for example, an output
or input voltage,

11
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:36,532
so that we have a relationship
between the input and output,

12
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:38,532
and we speak of a Bode
diagram,

13
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:41,182
this in fact refers to a
vibration

14
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:43,252
in sinusoidal form.

15
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:47,683
This will help us greatly in
analysing electronic functions.

16
00:00:47,683 --> 00:00:51,683
I think that it is easier to understand
when we are really talking about

17
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:55,423
electronic functions - then we see
that all these functions

18
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:59,683
are described by the Bode Diagram
module and phase.

19
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:03,165
So, by way of introduction, I am
going to start off

20
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:06,275
by discussing what a diagram
is intended to show,

21
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,545
that is, a mathematical formulation.

22
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:13,872
Next, we will see that there are two ways
of presenting a Bode diagram,

23
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:15,832
module and phase.

24
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:21,822
So, we are going to learn to carry out
the module transfer function

25
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:25,602
and next, we are going to look at
the phase transfer function.

26
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:27,632
And I think that the best
way to understand this

27
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:30,582
is by pushing through and
getting to the chapters in which

28
00:01:30,582 --> 00:01:32,882
we will look at real electronic
functions.

29
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:36,908
Let us therefore begin with what
is called a transfer function.

30
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,730
This is a transfer function.

31
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:41,984
In a transfer function,

32
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:47,074
you can see that there is a
numerator, a denominator,

33
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:51,074
and a value, <i>K</i>,
which is a constant.

34
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:58,025
As for the numerator,
we refer to it

35
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:02,455
with a <i>ω_Z</i>. <i>Z</i> is for
zero transfer function.

36
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,090
As for the denominator,
we have the subscript <i>P</i>

37
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,090
because this is the pole
of the transfer function.

38
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:14,739
You will note that we have
the form

39
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:18,852
<i>j(ω/ω_Z0)</i>

40
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:21,162
and that the same form recurs
with the denominator.

41
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:27,922
Thus we also have <i>1/j(ω/ω_P0)</i>.

42
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:31,945
So the form at the numerator
is also found at the denominator

43
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:34,195
although it is inverted, 1 over.

44
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,135
It is the same case with
<i>1+j(ω/ω_Z1))</i>

45
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:40,435
and <i>1/(1+j(ω/ω_P1))</i>.

46
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:44,231
So, when we create these two
forms,

47
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:49,591
this one, that one, and their inverses,
as well as the constant <i>K</i>,

48
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:53,591
we are going to see later
that this so-called canonical

49
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:58,241
representation is going to
correspond with a block.

50
00:02:58,662 --> 00:03:01,502
In this block, we have placed
electronics.

51
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:04,172
At the output, there is an
output variable.

52
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:07,217
This output variable could
be voltage.

53
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:09,277
So, let us consider the example
where it is voltage.

54
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:13,277
There is a sinusoidal vibration
at the output

55
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,937
due to sinusoidal vibration
at the input.

56
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:22,265
And that which is inside this,
we call the transfer function.

57
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:26,819
And all the canonical forms
that you see represented here,

58
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,489
this one repeated for a second
time, and a third time,

59
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:30,769
and same with the
denominator,

60
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,219
we can create these
using electronics.

61
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:36,215
So, when you continue
the Electronics course,

62
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:41,245
you will see that the function
<i>1/(1+j(ω/ω_))</i>

63
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:45,225
corresponds with a
low-pass filter.

64
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,225
That means that the output voltage,
as compared with the input voltage,

65
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:52,915
has a relationship that gives
us a function

66
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:59,575
in which the low frequency
passes through this filter

67
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:02,495
and will be cut at a point
that we call the pole

68
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:05,615
of the transfer function,
which is linked to this <i>ω_P1</i>

69
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:08,085
and which corresponds with
a well-known value.

70
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,145
The variable is thus <i>ω</i>.

71
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:15,955
As for the unit <i>H(jω)</i>,
we are going to see right after this

72
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,535
that it is the relationship
between one voltage and another,

73
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:19,825
and there is thus no unit.

74
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:23,325
And we are going to talk about decibels
because  we are going to look for the 20 Log

75
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:26,825
of the output voltage divided
by the input voltage.

76
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,541
We are going to use
a graphic representation.

77
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,311
This graphic representation is there
to show us,

78
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:37,041
for a set of sinusoidal voltages,

79
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,551
what happens with the transfer
function module,

80
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:44,221
which will tell us what happens
with the amplitudes

81
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:47,391
of these different voltages
that are going to cross, therefore

82
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:49,381
I am talking
about the sinusoidal voltage

83
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:52,801
which is going to traverse these
two-port networks we have just seen.

84
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:57,898
The phase also describes what
happens with the phase

85
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:01,898
of these sinusoidal voltages
at the output compared to

86
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:03,258
the input, with
the variable<i>ω</i>.

87
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:07,528
Therefore we are going to change
the <i>ω</i>, the voltage pulses,

88
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:11,148
and we are going to see their
amplitude values,

89
00:05:11,148 --> 00:05:13,948
the relationship with the amplitude
values that we call the module

90
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:15,798
of the transfer function,

91
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:20,008
and which we describe as being
a module of <i>H(jω)</i>,

92
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:23,578
for which we use this logarithmic
function,

93
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:29,748
so we are going to look for the 20 Log
base 10 of <i>H(jω)</i>.

94
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,563
Now why would we want to do it
like that?

95
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:37,423
It is simple, because the phase will
describe the signs.

96
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:41,423
So, voltage which is positive at the
input to a two-port network

97
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:42,943
becomes negative.

98
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,973
And, even if the amplitude is
the same,

99
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:47,743
one sees here, that there has been
no change in amplitude,

100
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:51,233
it's Log 20 of something that is
equal to one.

101
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:55,583
So 20 Log of 1 means the
output voltage,

102
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,933
i.e. the amplitude

103
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:02,451
divided by;
if the peak value is the same,

104
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,481
there has been no change.

105
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:06,161
If this is equal to 1,

106
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:10,321
then that will give us the
Log of 1 equal to 0,

107
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:12,531
and then we are back with
0 <i>dB</i> again.

108
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:15,521
It is the same if the output voltage
if 10 times greater

109
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:18,901
than the input voltage; in
that case, we will find 20 <i>dB</i>.

110
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:24,261
Every time we multiply by 10, we
add 20 <i>dB</i> due to this gradient

111
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:28,261
of 20 Log base 10 of the
<i>U1/U2</i> relationship.

112
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:29,684
So you can see it here.

113
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:33,684
Each time we multiply by 0,
we add 20 <i>dB</i>.

114
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:36,588
However, each time
we divide by 10,

115
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:41,008
the output is 10 times less
than the input voltage,

116
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:42,268
and we will find

117
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:46,018
the minus sign appearing,
it is -20 <i>dB</i>, -40 <i>dB</i>.

118
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:48,688
It's the same every time we
divide by 10 -

119
00:06:48,688 --> 00:06:51,678
we see reduction of 20 <i>dB</i>.

120
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,538
When this happens, we talk of
amplification.

121
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,562
Up to here.

122
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:04,149
So, from there to there,
if one excludes this -

123
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:06,459
because there, we have a <i>follower</i>.

124
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,039
If we talk about voltage, we call that
a voltage <i>follower</i>,

125
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,159
which is to say that the output
voltage is equal to the input voltage.

126
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,679
And from there, the output voltage
is amplified

127
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,719
in comparison with the input voltage.

128
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,559
And there, we are going to talk about
an amplifier, and we see it

129
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,849
with a positive value which appears
on that side.

130
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,000
When we have a reduction,
which is to say that the output voltage

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,830
is reduced in comparison with the
input voltage,

132
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,690
we see that it's 0,1 ; 0,001,
a division by a factor of 10.

133
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,790
And we see the value is
negative.

134
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,400
And this must be so, because the logarithm
is going to give us the minus sign.

135
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,390
Thus when one has a minus sign,
this does not describe

136
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,100
what is happening with the voltage,

137
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,460
knowing that the voltage is a
sinusoidal voltage

138
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,850
that is going to fluctuate
between positive and negative.

139
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,360
But when on comes to the
phase diagram,

140
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,180
we can easily distinguish
the phase.

141
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,180
Thus if the voltage is out of phase
by 180 degrees,

142
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,570
and so the positive part has
become negative,

143
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,610
and it is in a phase diagram
that we are going to understand it.

144
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:13,540
And so, this explanation describes
the base of two graphic representations,

145
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,020
one graphic representation that
shows the amplitude,

146
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,020
and one graphic representation
that shows the phase.

147
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:27,291
When we take two two-port networks,

148
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,741
one of which I will call <i>H1(jω)</i>

149
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:36,586
and another which follows,

150
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:41,175
and we place them like that,
one after the other,

151
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:44,475
and so we call it  <i>H2(jω)</i>.

152
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,839
The overall transfer function,

153
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,529
which is to say that if we put
one voltage at the input,

154
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,705
sinusoidal voltage,

155
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:57,425
I put a line below it to show
that it is a complex representation,

156
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:59,555
and we look at what happens
at the output

157
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,335
and I call it <i>U2</i>.

158
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,492
This same voltage is read
by the second,

159
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:07,532
and so I have <i>U2</i> which
appears here

160
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,930
and I am going to output voltage,
<i>U3</i>, which is here.

161
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:18,342
Thus if I describe the module
of the transfer function

162
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:22,922
as being <i>U2/U1</i>,

163
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:25,792
the output voltage
over the input voltage,

164
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:32,382
followed by <i>U2</i>,
which is the same,

165
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:36,529
divided by the voltage.

166
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:41,413
Sorry, there I should write <i>U3</i>
divided by the voltage <i>U2</i>.

167
00:09:41,523 --> 00:09:45,523
And so, we are going to see that
by simplifying  <i>U2</i> and <i>U2</i>,

168
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:48,613
it is in fact the overall transfer function

169
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:52,613
which is <i>U3</i> divided by <i>U1</i>.

170
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:54,721
Therefore this is a transfer function,

171
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:58,041
and we are interested in the output
as a ratio of the input.

172
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:02,041
The intermediate voltage <i>U2</i>
can be simplified and does not appear.

173
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Thus if you take <i>H(jω)</i>
and you say that it's <i>H1(jω)</i>

174
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,170
and you say that it's <i>U2/U1</i>

175
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,170
and the function <i>H2(jω)</i>
which is equal to <i>U3/U2</i>,

176
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,700
well then, their product, which
is what we have just made here,

177
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,070
corresponds with the overall
transfer function

178
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,390
of the connection of one
behind the other

179
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,120
which is going to give us <i>U3</i>
divided by <i>U1</i>.

180
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,740
That is, in fact, what happens.

181
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,600
We take an audio application,

182
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,740
and we imagine that we have a
preamplifier and an amplifier.

183
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,660
The preamplifier can receive -
whether from a microphone, tuner,

184
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,540
or MP3 player - a <i>U1</i> signal,

185
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,540
convert it into a <i>U2</i> voltage,
amplifying the voltage,

186
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,660
enter into a power amplifier and
pass through with increased power

187
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,220
or a voltage at the output <i>U3</i>.

188
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,580
You will see that the overall transfer
function is the product

189
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,080
of one compared to the other.

190
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,900
What interests us is the input
of a microphone

191
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,430
and the output to a speaker
that we are going to put here.

192
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,870
So, we are interested in the product
of the transfer functions <i>H1(jω)</i>

193
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,890
by <i>H2(jω)</i>.

194
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:09,399
All this transforms itself into an
addition.

195
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:14,205
Because when one expresses it
in decibels, the fact of using a logarithm

196
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:17,625
changes multiplication into addition,

197
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,115
and that will give us the sum.

198
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:23,585
If this is the <i>H1(jω)</i> module
of the transfer function,

199
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:29,035
it is sufficient to add the <i>H2(jω)</i>
module to the <i>H1(jω)</i> module.

200
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:34,285
So we succeed in transforming a
multiplication through addition.

201
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:36,725
If we are capable of representing
a diagram

202
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:42,295
in which the module describes
what happens with that block

203
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:46,295
as a function of the variation of a
variable - here, pulsation -

204
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:50,295
and which in other terms is the frequency,
because <i>ω</i> is equal to <i>2πf</i>,

205
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:56,065
so if one has to draw the Bode diagram
of <i>H1(jω)</i>,

206
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:58,675
and the Bode diagram of <i>H2(jω)</i>,

207
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:03,575
we have only to add the two to obtain
the type of circuit

208
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:04,955
this could produce.

209
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:07,449
So, the use of putting
a transfer function

210
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:09,429
into this format,

211
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,159
I have put them in colour
to show the different types

212
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,939
of functions that we are
going to study,

213
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:17,619
and, well, it is this that is
going to change into addition.

214
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:24,112
Let us now take this same function
and watch what will happen

215
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:28,172
when we begin to add these
canonical formats,

216
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:32,502
that is, the constant,
in decibels,

217
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:37,162
is added to everything that is a
canonical function of each block.

218
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:39,452
Because here, I have a series of
multiplications,

219
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:41,742
as if I had taken
electronic blocks

220
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:43,962
and aligned them one
behind the other.

221
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:46,302
And I have a function which
seems to be very complex

222
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:49,162
but if each block corresponds
with an electronic project

223
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:50,552
that we control,

224
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:53,432
then we have only to add the
Bode diagrams

225
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:57,432
that we are going to draw, and learn
to draw for each of these functions.

226
00:12:57,432 --> 00:13:01,432
This, then, appears to be something
that is rather abstract

227
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:05,272
but someone working in electronics
will utilise it regularly

228
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:08,092
because he or she will realise that
with each of these forms,

229
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:10,942
there is a clear and established
function that we perform,

230
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:13,242
and we have acted so that
these canonical forms

231
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:16,472
are transformed into a circuit
which will be presented

232
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:18,432
within the scope of this course.

233
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:22,492
I am now going to go through
each term in turn,

234
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:26,492
I will begin with the constant
module of a transfer function.

235
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:29,132
Suppose that you have a
transfer function,

236
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,022
and you place a signal at the
input.

237
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,892
So you have a two-port network.

238
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:38,804
In this two-port network, you have
a sinusoidal voltage, <i>U1</i>,

239
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:43,964
and  you expect to find a voltage
<i>U2</i> at the output

240
00:13:43,964 --> 00:13:47,364
and you find repeatedly that your
voltage <i>U2</i>

241
00:13:47,364 --> 00:13:50,314
is equal to 10 times <i>U1</i>.

242
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:54,974
So we have a voltage of 1V, and
you will find 10V at the output

243
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:57,624
as this is a sinusoidal
function.

244
00:13:57,624 --> 00:14:02,104
And suppose that you change the frequency
of this voltage <i>U1</i> at the input

245
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:07,394
and you see that <i>U2</i> remains at the
same frequency at the input, of course,

246
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:09,634
because it's the same excitation signal,

247
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:13,274
but despite all the variation in frequency

248
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:16,344
to which you can subject <i>U1</i>,
there is no effect

249
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:17,954
on the relationship between the two.

250
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:21,954
Thus we have an amplifier and whatever
passes through it at the input,

251
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:27,464
it multiplies by factor 10 without
changing the amplitude

252
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:30,224
of the output voltage with
respect to the input voltage.

253
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:34,254
Therefore we will say that where
the constant <i>K</i> is positive,

254
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:36,144
- and I give the following example -

255
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:40,144
we always have 20 Log of 10, and
that will give me 20<i> dB</i>.

256
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:44,887
Now, if we look at what happens if
I have an attenuator,

257
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:49,987
which is to say, if I put a function here
and if for that function,

258
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:53,047
whenever I put a voltage at the input,

259
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:58,827
I find the 0,05 amplitude of this
voltage at the output.

260
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:01,599
Thus I have attenuated it by a
certain degree,

261
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:06,469
and the negative sign will appear
because it is 20 Log of 0,05

262
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:08,699
that will give me -26.

263
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,219
And as you see, I use the
decibel unit

264
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:13,529
because <i>U2/U1</i> has no unit.

265
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,029
Representation in decibels allows us
to describe a non-unit

266
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:21,789
and by using this representation with
the 20 Log,

267
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:25,129
then, we see that multiplication by 10
makes it easier for us to

268
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:28,589
understand that each increase by
a decade,

269
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:32,989
will correspond with an addition of
20 <i>dB</i> to this one on the right.

270
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:35,269
If I now add a second amplifier

271
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,769
that gives me a gain equal to 10

272
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,469
and I add another one behind it
that is the same,

273
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:46,059
then in fact, I will see that I have
40 <i>dB</i>, so I have multiplied by 100.

274
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,605
I am going to take another canonical
function,

275
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:53,605
the one containing a complex number.

276
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:57,605
There, I have a <i>j(ω/ω)_Z0)</i>

277
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:59,965
and I am going to describe it in
decibels.

278
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:05,261
Thus the module of <i>H(jω)</i>,
is 20 Log of the module

279
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:06,751
of a complex number.

280
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:10,751
Therefore the module of a complex
number <i>j(ω/ω_Z0)</i>

281
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:15,371
will give me <i>20 Log(ω/ω_Z0)</i>,

282
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:20,901
so that I can write
<i>20 Log(ω) - 20 Log(ω_Z0)</i>.

283
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:26,781
Practically, <i>ω_Z0</i> will
correspond to a given value,

284
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:28,681
that we know; it is a numerical
value

285
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:31,241
that will depend, in my
electronic circuit,

286
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,031
on the values - perhaps on
a resistance or a capacity,

287
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:36,981
or a residence and an inductance.

288
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:40,451
So there are things that I know,
the values that correspond

289
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:42,781
with the values of the
components.

290
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:44,591
In contrast, the variable is <i>ω</i>.

291
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:47,744
So, given that we are going to draw
the Bode diagram

292
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:50,574
on that axis and
return the Log of <i>ω</i>,

293
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:53,857
as if I was saying that the Log
of <i>ω</i> is <i>X</i>

294
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:55,787
and that is a constant.

295
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:59,123
So that makes <i>20X</i>
plus a constant.

296
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:01,833
If I want to bring that back to
a Bode diagram,

297
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:08,063
there I have drawn the axe containing
<i>Log(ω)</i> and those are decibels,

298
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,090
it is a <i>20X+C</i> line,

299
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:16,800
it is a line with a slope equal to
20<i> dB</i>

300
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,710
that will pass through <i>ω_Z0</i>,

301
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,560
where <i>y</i> is equal to 0,

302
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,560
I will find that <i>x</i> is equal to <i>ω_Z0</i>.

303
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,470
So that is what we refer to as the transfer
function module

304
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,790
of the canonical function which is
equal to <i>j(ω/ω_Z0)</i>

305
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,840
and which corresponds with a
relationship between a voltage,

306
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,470
a voltage and a current,
between two currents,

307
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,790
at the output of a two-port
network.

308
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:51,340
So the nature of the variable
is independent of this function,

309
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,590
and it is simply going to describe
what happens

310
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,140
when we transfer an input variable
to the output variable.

311
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:02,269
I would like to look at the inverse
of what we have just seen.

312
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:09,259
So, instead of taking <i>j(ω/ω_Z0)</i>,
I will take its inverse, <i>1/j(ω)</i>,

313
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:12,259
and given that this is going to happen
to the denominator,

314
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,969
I will call that the pole of the transfer
function

315
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,959
and I will write <i>ω_P0</i>.

316
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:22,103
I am also going to draw the
Bode diagram of this module,

317
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,033
diagram of the Bode module.

318
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,263
And there, you can see that it
is actually very simple -

319
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:30,263
there is no need to spend a lot
of time analysing it.

320
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:32,786
<i>20Log(1)</i> is 0.

321
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:39,374
For <i>-j(ω/ω_P0)</i>, its module is
<i>ω/ω_P0</i>.

322
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:43,479
And 20 Log of this is going to give me
the minus sign behind,

323
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:48,049
so that what we have just seen will
happen again

324
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,829
but with a negative slope.

325
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,080
There, we will end up with
-20 <i>dB</i> per decade.

326
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:56,153
So, that will give me a
transfer function

327
00:18:56,153 --> 00:19:00,823
with a slope equal to -20 <i>dB</i>/decade
which passes through <i>ω_P0</i>

328
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:05,763
when the <i> y</i> axis gives me zero.

329
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,854
Later this will correspond, as we will
see,

330
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:11,614
with an integrator function in the
temporal domain

331
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:14,844
and, thanks to that, there is an electronic
circuit that we are going to learn

332
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:18,154
which is made by an operational
amplifier, for example,

333
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:20,514
and which will allow us to obtain
this function.

334
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:25,864
That function will thus correspond
with a two-port network.

335
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,894
In this two-port network, we are
going to add some electronics.

336
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:30,914
And the electronics, when you
apply

337
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:36,194
an input voltage of <i>U1</i> to it,
will give you <i>U2</i> at the output.

338
00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:38,834
This voltage should be sinusoidal.

339
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:43,554
When you vary the pulsation of
this sinusoidal voltage,

340
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:46,254
you then increase or decrease
the frequency

341
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:50,254
and you will observe <i>U2</i>
and see that this voltage <i>U2</i>

342
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:52,114
will cross this curve.

343
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:57,024
If you increase the frequency,
and thereby also the pulsation,

344
00:19:57,024 --> 00:20:01,734
you will see that the amplitude
of the voltage <i>U2</i> will fall

345
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,744
and fall and fall and fall
following this curve

346
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:08,004
and so it will fall in increments
of 20 <i>dB</i>/decade.

347
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:10,684
Thus each time we go from
10 to 100,

348
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:14,684
we lose factor 10 on the
amplitude of the output voltage.

349
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:18,613
And this diagram describes this
clearly.

350
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:21,393
Therefore later, when one knows
that

351
00:20:21,393 --> 00:20:23,143
we have added a transfer
function to it,

352
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:25,333
and when you will see that
it involves an integrator,

353
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:29,793
and then, you can directly
draw this line without hesitating

354
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:33,343
and you will see that you bring through
what is in the denominator,

355
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:37,483
the value that we talked about, which is
going to correspond with a constant value

356
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:41,343
given by the values of the components
that we are going to use.

357
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,113
So, if we bring that here,
and we make a gradient of -20 dB,

358
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:48,053
we are going to see clearly
the behaviour

359
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:51,543
of our transfer function,
which is inside

360
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:52,814
this block.

361
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:56,404
So we will see that the ratio between the
output and input voltages

362
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:58,984
is perfectly described by this.

363
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:03,863
Let us now take <i>1+j(ω/ω_Z1)</i>.

364
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:07,817
There, contrary to what we saw
before,

365
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:12,837
we have drawn a pure real number,
then drawn a pure imaginary number.

366
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:16,097
Here, I am taking a function
that contains both a real

367
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:17,527
and an imaginary part.

368
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,770
Next I must of course write the
module of this complex number

369
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,540
which is the square root of the
real part of the square

370
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,530
plus the imaginary part of the
square.

371
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:32,834
And now, I must draw the
module in a Bode diagram

372
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,634
where the variable is
<i>ω</i>.

373
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:38,906
The <i>ω_Z1</i> is known
and I must add that.

374
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:41,196
Thus we can draw that
as we draw

375
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:43,076
any analytical function.

376
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:45,846
We begin by looking at
the asymptotes.

377
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,196
Thus we make <i>ω</i>
approach infinity.

378
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:52,311
If <i>ω</i> approaches infinity
we have, in this function,

379
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,181
an imaginary part which
becomes much more dominant

380
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,931
in comparison with the real
part.

381
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,841
Thus we can say that it
is a pure quasi-imaginary number

382
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:02,151
and ignore the real part.

383
00:22:02,427 --> 00:22:05,557
So I will find that, when <i>ω</i>
approaches infinity,

384
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:09,557
the function is similar to that
which we have just drawn,

385
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:12,697
which we called <i>j(ω/ω_Z1)</i>

386
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:16,227
and I ignore the real part,
which happens to be equal to 1.

387
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:18,887
So we have <i>1+j</i> times infinity.

388
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,720
There is a second asymptote, which
is when I make <i>ω</i> approach 0.

389
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,890
And, while <i>ω</i> approaches 0,
I end up with a pure real number

390
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,710
and the pure real number will
be equal to 1,

391
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,520
and the imaginary part is going to
disappear.

392
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:40,837
I am going to look for a particular
point that belongs to this module.

393
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:46,944
I then replace <i>ω</i> by <i>ω_Z1</i>
and I will find <i>√2</i>.

394
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,810
<i>20Log(√2)</i> is nearly equal to 3 dB.

395
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,010
So I have a first asymptote,
a second asymptote

396
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,680
and a particular value which
belongs,

397
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,460
which is equal to +3 <i>dB</i>.

398
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,400
And I am going to draw the
asymptotic diagram

399
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,260
that I have just had here

400
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,030
and afterwards, draw the real
diagram that I am will find

401
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,270
for a function of <i>1+j(ω/ω_Z1)</i>.

402
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,107
We are going to find that.

403
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:21,716
We are going to find that we have
this axis, which will be an asymptote,

404
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:23,375
the <i>x</i> axis.

405
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:31,033
And we have this second axis
which will be the second asymptote.

406
00:23:31,568 --> 00:23:35,098
In fact, it will correspond where
<i>ω</i> approaches infinity

407
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:37,308
and we have seen that we can
ignore the 1.

408
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:42,518
So, that gave us <i>j(ω/ω_1)</i>
and we saw that it's a straight line

409
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:44,648
that passes through <i>ω_Z1</i>

410
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:48,878
and that the real curve
that we will measure

411
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:50,488
at the electronic output,

412
00:23:50,488 --> 00:23:53,268
where the electronic element represents
a transfer function

413
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:54,488
which is this one,

414
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:59,638
and which will correspond to this
straight line, or this red curve,

415
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:03,638
which runs asymptotically
around the...

416
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,909
around a low frequency which runs
asymptotically on the <i>x</i> axis

417
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:11,869
and which will then move
asymptotically towards this straight line

418
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,329
with a gradient of +20 dB/decade.

419
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,559
And, just as we had when <i>ω</i>
was equal to <i>ω_Z1</i>,

420
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,169
we now have <i>1+j</i>, making +3<i> dB</i>.

421
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:25,139
Thus there that point, and this point
corresponds with a particular point.

422
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:28,735
So we have only to sketch this curve,
which is this one.

423
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:30,925
So we see that for this electronic
function

424
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:34,015
that, later, we are going to create
with electronic circuitry,

425
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:39,945
when <i>ω</i> is sufficiently close to 0,
and thus has a DC voltage,

426
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,165
we will find ourselves with a function
which moves directly

427
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:47,765
in an asymptotic direction where,
for <i>ω</i> is equal to 0,

428
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:51,125
the amplitude of the output will
be almost zero.

429
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:54,005
And the more we increase the
pulsation,

430
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:56,465
the more we will see that the
transfer function

431
00:24:56,465 --> 00:24:59,605
is going to give us a variable at
the output which will increase

432
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:05,915
and which will move asymptotically
on the asymptote <i>j(ω/ω_Z1)</i>.

433
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:09,783
I would like to take the inverse of
this and I believe that now

434
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:14,163
those following the development
of the Bode diagram

435
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:19,983
have properly understood that one takes
<i>1+j(ω/ω_Z1)</i> and places 1 above it,

436
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:23,983
and one replaces the <i>ω_Z</i>
with a pole of the transfer function,

437
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:27,983
and for the inverse of that, it is enough
to take what we saw before,

438
00:25:27,983 --> 00:25:31,983
which is to say, this same curve was
symmetrical in that direction,

439
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:37,633
and we now find it towards the
bottom because it's 20 Log 1,

440
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:40,803
which is equal to 0, less than
minus what we have just analysed,

441
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:44,013
i.e. <i>20 Log(1+j(ω/ω_P1))</i>.

442
00:25:44,013 --> 00:25:48,013
So, we have only to add the
minus sign and we find the same thing.

443
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:52,403
We find that the <i>x</i> axis, which
remains an asymptote,

444
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:58,803
but this straight line now has
a gradient equal to -20 <i>dB</i>.

445
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,310
The fact of finding -20 <i>dB</i>
is now going to allow us to draw

446
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:10,330
the curve which passes through -3 <i>dB</i>,
which is when <i>ω</i> is equal to <i>ω_P1</i>,

447
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,040
thus when we have the variable <i>ω</i> here.

448
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,900
We have a transfer function which becomes
<i>1/(1+j)</i>

449
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,970
and the module of this transfer function,

450
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:26,820
is the module of <i>1/1√(1+1)</i>,
and that is going to give us -3 <i>dB</i>.

451
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,650
And here we find the rather well-known
characteristic of what we have a

452
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,860
low-pass filter, which will also
be created,

453
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,860
and which corresponds with a function
where low frequencies pass through,

454
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,280
and are multiplied by 1,

455
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,340
and one finds them,
the output voltage,

456
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,750
it's a low-frequency two-port network,

457
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,910
what is at the input appears at the
output.

458
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,910
The sinusoidal voltage <i>U1</i>
appears as it is, as the output

459
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,470
with its amplitude.

460
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,470
And when we increase the pulsation,
we begin to see a reduction in the

461
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:02,640
output voltage and afterwards, we
continue to reduce it,

462
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,560
and the asymptotic diagram that
you see here,

463
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,780
without the curve that passes
through - the real curve -

464
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,980
we speak very often of an
asymptotic representation,

465
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,150
i.e., we are often satisfied with
doing what I am going to mark in blue,

466
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,390
that's that part there - and, of
course, this straight line,

467
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:27,390
which is already in blue, and we
speak of this asymptote

468
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,810
or asymptotic diagram of the
function <i>1/(1+j(ω/ω_P1))</i>,

469
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,470
which is typically a function of
a low-pass filter

470
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,140
with a pole at <i>ωP1</i>.

471
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:44,062
I am going to deal with a full
example

472
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:48,062
which contains a Bode function

473
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:54,432
or a transfer function <i>H(jω)</i>,
which contains three parts.

474
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,140
I have a part <i>j(ω/ω2)</i>,
which is found at the numerator.

475
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,620
So that is a 0 of the transfer
function.

476
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:10,931
I have <i>1/(1+j(ω/ω1))</i>

477
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:13,931
and I have <i>1/(1+j(ω/ω2))</i>.

478
00:28:13,931 --> 00:28:17,171
And I have given the values for
<i>ω2</i> et <i>ω1</i>,

479
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:23,301
saying that <i>ω2</i> is found at 100 rad/s,
and <i>ω1</i> is found at 1000 rad/s.

480
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:26,981
And I have added the three functions

481
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:28,801
to a single Bode diagram.

482
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:33,675
One function independent of
the other, now in the same colours.

483
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:37,942
So, the function of <i>j(ω/ω2)</i>
is a straight line,

484
00:28:37,942 --> 00:28:40,112
we saw that,

485
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:42,862
with a gradient equal to +20 dB/decade.

486
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:49,262
Each time we multiply by 10, a decade,
we gain 20 <i>dB</i> in amplitude

487
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:52,472
and as we increase the pulsation,
the more we are going to travel

488
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:56,472
to the output of this two-port
network; I have <i>ω/ω2</i>

489
00:28:56,472 --> 00:29:00,472
an amplitude which is proportional
at the input, according to this straight line.

490
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:04,271
After, if you take the three transfer
functions,

491
00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:08,771
it is as if we had taken a first
two-port network

492
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:13,291
followed by a second,
followed by a third,

493
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:17,291
and we put placed one after
the other

494
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:22,161
and we imposed an input
voltage

495
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:25,161
and we watched an output
voltage,

496
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:28,641
which I will call <i>U_out</i>,
which is a sinusoidal voltage,

497
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,951
it is going to be a sinusoidal voltage.

498
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:34,681
I am going to vary the pulsation
of this voltage.

499
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:37,041
I then observe the pulsation at
the output.

500
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:41,461
And I will see all of the Bode
diagram

501
00:29:41,461 --> 00:29:44,081
that is going to influence the
output voltage.

502
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:47,915
Therefore, if you draw the red function
individually,

503
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:49,565
this one here.

504
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:56,615
It is thus  <i>H1(jω)</i>.

505
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:04,621
There, it is <i>H2(jω)</i>.

506
00:30:05,165 --> 00:30:08,845
And there, it is <i>H3(jω)</i>.

507
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:12,845
And this is <i>H1(jω)</i>, <i>H2(jω), H3(jω)</i>.

508
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:20,646
If you take the three functions
and you add them together,

509
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:23,516
we have thus drawn the first
one.

510
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:26,036
We are going to draw the second.

511
00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:30,182
So I only have to take
<i>1/(1+j(ω/ω2))</i>

512
00:30:30,182 --> 00:30:32,252
which corresponds with this
asymptotic diagram.

513
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:35,872
There, I have only drawn the
real diagram; I have managed to keep

514
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:37,602
the asymptotic diagram.

515
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,332
And I have done the same for
the second, which has the same form,

516
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:42,592
<i>1/(1+j(ω/ω1))</i>,

517
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,742
except that I have <i>ω2</i>, <i>ω1</i>.

518
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:50,462
The <i>ω1</i> is at 1000 rad/s,
<i>ω2</i> is at 100 rad/s.

519
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:53,522
And I have only to add these
three curves together.

520
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:59,395
I will thus take +20 dB/decade
which will always be added to 0.

521
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:01,374
I will find it here.

522
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:06,407
Up to <i>ω2</i>, there is only the
curve 1 that dominates.

523
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:11,388
The two others have given me an
asymptotic diagram equal to 0.

524
00:31:11,388 --> 00:31:14,808
So, we see no effect here, and I
draw this gradient.

525
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:19,270
From there, I am going to add that
quantity there to that quantity,

526
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,300
and each time it's the same quantity.

527
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:26,560
I have +20 <i>dB</i>/decade - 20 <i>dB</i>/decade,
which will give me 0 <i>dB</i>/decade.

528
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:33,506
So that gives us a flat Bode diagram
until I get here, <i>ω1</i>.

529
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:38,061
For the asymptote here, I have
+20 <i>dB</i> on one side,

530
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:39,961
and on the other I have
-20 <i>dB</i>,

531
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:45,861
but after that, I have
+20 <i>dB </i>- 20 <i>dB</i>/decade

532
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:50,611
and also a second
-20 <i>dB</i>/decade,

533
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:53,891
which is going to give me
-20 <i>dB</i>/decade here.

534
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:57,891
And when I add all that together,
you see in red

535
00:31:57,891 --> 00:32:03,251
the asymptotic diagram of
the entire function

536
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:08,201
and you see above it the values
which would have been measured

537
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:12,431
if you had taken the output voltage
and measured it

538
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:17,121
in comparison with the input voltage;
you would have seen that at low frequency,

539
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:21,121
the output voltage is low in comparison
with the input voltage

540
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:23,591
and then it is going to be amplified,
amplified, amplified,

541
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:30,551
and arrive at point <i>ω2</i> where
we have an attenuation of -3 <i>dB</i>.

542
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:32,828
Which is the same as at <i>ω1</i>.

543
00:32:32,973 --> 00:32:36,313
And we find that the real curve passes
just below

544
00:32:36,313 --> 00:32:38,253
the asymptotic diagram.

545
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:43,433
And afterwards, it continues
asymptotically on -20 <i>dB</i>/decade

546
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:49,663
such that the frequencies increase when
we arrive at <i>ω2</i>,

547
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:53,863
then remain more or less constant,
and afterwards, start to be attenuated.

548
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:58,903
And there, the pulsation between <i>ω2</i>
and <i>ω1</i> creates a section where

549
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:02,073
we more or less see the greatest gain,

550
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:05,433
we call that the band-pass filter,
where I allow through

551
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:10,563
a frequential frequency-band between
the two pulsations <i>ω2</i> et <i>ω1</i>,

552
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:13,643
otherwise we would be attenuating on
both sides.

553
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:16,581
So we see the usefulness of this
representation

554
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:21,141
and we will see the usefulness when
each function that you see there

555
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:24,141
becomes an electronic function that
we are going to create

556
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:25,891
with electronic circuits.

557
00:33:25,891 --> 00:33:28,081
And when we place
them one after another,

558
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:31,311
we have no need to analyse
the entire circuit,

559
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:34,661
it is sufficient to analyse one
independently of the other,

560
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:37,991
draw the Bode diagram
and see all of it

561
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:41,281
simply by graphically adding
what happens.

562
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:45,345
Now that we have fully analysed
what happens

563
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:48,315
with the function of the Bode module,

564
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:51,275
and we have thus seen that,
for a transfer function,

565
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:53,785
in a Bode diagram module,
it is going to describe for us

566
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:57,475
what happens with the output voltage
in terms of amplitude

567
00:33:57,475 --> 00:34:00,135
in comparison with the input voltage
in terms of amplitude.

568
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:04,025
We will take the same form again, or
the same canonical forms.

569
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:06,231
I will represent them for a second time

570
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:08,581
and this time I am going to be more
interested in the phase.

571
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:10,717
So, we have a complex number.

572
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:15,281
If I have a real, complex number,
the <i>K</i> that you see there,

573
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:19,281
I am going to find the argument
for a real number,

574
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:21,421
meaning the arc tangent of <i>K</i>.

575
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:25,932
Otherwise, if we are working with a
complex number <i>j(ω/ω_Z0)</i>,

576
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:29,932
I am going to look for the argument
of a transfer function

577
00:34:29,932 --> 00:34:31,302
which is pure and imaginary

578
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,172
and I will do the same for all
the rest

579
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:35,462
and I know that the arguments
are going to add up.

580
00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:38,342
The same goes as for the modules,

581
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,662
by paying attention to the argument,
we will find that the arguments

582
00:34:42,662 --> 00:34:45,082
are going to give us diagrams

583
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:48,952
where, if we draw independently
from one to another,

584
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:50,872
and if we add graphically,

585
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:54,872
we will see that happens
with the whole of the function

586
00:34:54,872 --> 00:34:58,872
once it has been created
by separate electronic functions

587
00:34:58,872 --> 00:35:03,342
for which we have mastered the
canonical forms in both mathematical

588
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:04,802
form, with a complex number,

589
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,232
and in terms of implementation
as electronic elements -

590
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:09,252
e.g. in terms of which type of
circuit to build,

591
00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:11,362
which will be studied in the
electronics course.

592
00:35:12,461 --> 00:35:17,811
I am going to begin with a transfer
function for real, pure numbers.

593
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:23,985
So we take the <i>arc tangent</i>
of a real, pure function

594
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:30,025
and I know that if the argument is
equal to 0, I am on the real axis,

595
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:34,025
and then, I can say that the value,

596
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:39,325
the 0 axis, this axis here,
I have <i>ω</i>

597
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:41,285
and there, I have the phase.

598
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:46,375
And if the function <i>K</i> is
negative,

599
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,995
and if I then place an amplifier
there with a positive gain.

600
00:35:48,995 --> 00:35:51,295
So, let us take a two-port network

601
00:35:51,295 --> 00:35:55,125
and added a positive gain,

602
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,655
for example, one that is equal
to 10.

603
00:35:57,236 --> 00:36:01,236
If it is a real pure number equal
to 10, for example,

604
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:03,206
and it is thus strictly positive,

605
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:07,956
we will find ourselves with voltage <i>U2</i>
and voltage <i>U1</i>

606
00:36:07,956 --> 00:36:09,216
which are in phase.

607
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,750
The voltages will not be out of phase.

608
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:17,005
However, if this constant <i>K</i>
is negative,

609
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:20,395
we will be out of phase by 180 degrees,
so we will have an inverter.

610
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:24,395
We are thus going to talk about
positive or negative gain.

611
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:29,505
And positive gain gives us the <i>x</i>
axis, and there is now dephasing.

612
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:32,145
And on this axis,
where we have the phases,

613
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:37,495
if the gain is negative, we are going to have
a dephasing of 180 degrees, of <i>π</i>,

614
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,835
which means that I have inverted the
output voltage

615
00:36:39,835 --> 00:36:41,785
by comparison with the input voltage.

616
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,685
We call this an <i>inverter</i>.

617
00:36:44,557 --> 00:36:47,007
The order that we used

618
00:36:47,007 --> 00:36:49,817
for performing the analysis
for the modules,

619
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:51,467
is the same one we will use
for the phases.

620
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:56,071
So here, we will take the canonical
form <i>j(ω/ω_Z0)</i>,

621
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:57,991
which is pure and imaginary,

622
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:00,301
and we are going to analyse
what happens to it.

623
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,271
And there, we will see, it is very
simple.

624
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:04,521
We know that one is on the
imaginary axis

625
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:07,311
and we will have a dephasing
equal to <i>π/2</i>.

626
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:08,771
So, for the pure imaginary,

627
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:12,771
the imaginary axis will give us a
dephasing of <i>π/2</i>.

628
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:15,061
So, for a function such as this one,

629
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:17,571
when we create it with electronic
components,

630
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:22,121
each time I change the pulsation,
I will find at the output

631
00:37:22,121 --> 00:37:29,121
a dephasing equal to a constant
which is equal to 90 or <i>π/2</i> as a phase.

632
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,540
We will now take its inverse,

633
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,180
i.e. <i>1/j(ω/ω_P0)</i>.

634
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:40,841
Here again, it is the <i>arc tangent</i> of 1
minus the <i>arc tangent</i> of the section

635
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,161
which is found at the denominator and
which will surely give us

636
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,611
a dephasing of <i>-π/2</i>.

637
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:51,291
So we find ourselves with a
dephasing of <i>-π/2</i>,

638
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:55,051
which means that the output voltage
compared to the input voltage

639
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:58,221
in my two-port network, has a phase
delay

640
00:37:58,221 --> 00:38:00,231
equal to <i>π/2</i>.

641
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:04,983
A function which is a little
more developed,

642
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,883
is the one where we have a real
and an imaginary part.

643
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:13,103
So the <i>arc tangent</i> of this
will of course be

644
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:15,663
<i>Arctg (ω/ω_Z1)</i>.

645
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,140
So, once more, we are going to
draw the function <i>arctg(ω/ω_Z1)</i>,

646
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,810
which we know well,

647
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,840
and which has an asymptote
when <i>ω</i> approaches infinity.

648
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,840
So if this term is equal to infinity,
the imaginary part

649
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,000
is much more determinant than
the real part

650
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,080
which is equal to 1,

651
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,080
and I can thus simplify this 1 and
find myself with a complex number

652
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,590
<i>j(ω/ω_Z1)</i> of which the tangent
arc is what we have just drawn

653
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:47,970
a moment ago, when we drew the
first asymptote of <i>j(ω/ω_Z1)</i>,

654
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,490
the pure imaginary.

655
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:53,150
It is the same where <i>ω</i>
approaches 0; this term,

656
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,540
or this transfer function,
becomes real and pure

657
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,640
and is equal to 1.

658
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,640
So we have two asymptotes

659
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,920
and we do the same again,
as in the module,

660
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,580
by making <i>ω</i> equal to
<i>ω_Z1</i>

661
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,420
and we will find the complex number
<i>1+j</i>,

662
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,720
which corresponds with a dephasing of 45
degrees, which is of course equal to <i>π/4</i>.

663
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:19,025
And here is the diagram of the Bode phase
of such a function.

664
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:23,166
So, asymptotically, I have this axis

665
00:39:23,585 --> 00:39:25,195
and that axis.

666
00:39:25,645 --> 00:39:28,305
We have found that there is
the <i>x</i> axis,

667
00:39:28,305 --> 00:39:30,585
thus the <i>ω</i> axis,

668
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:36,455
and we have a dephasing of 90 degrees,
of <i>π/2</i>, which will be the second axis.

669
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:42,381
Meanwhile, we have a particular point at which
pulsation <i>ω</i> is equal to <i>ω_Z1</i>

670
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:43,921
which corresponds with this point.

671
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,088
To draw the asymptotic diagram that
corresponds with a real diagram

672
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:55,808
that you see in a dotted line just below,

673
00:39:55,808 --> 00:40:02,808
we multiply the particular value
<i>ω</i> equal to <i>ω_Z1</i> by 10

674
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:05,028
and we divide it by 10.

675
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:09,155
And we have this point and that point

676
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:13,155
and we draw this straight blue line

677
00:40:13,155 --> 00:40:18,125
between <i>10ω_Z1</i> and <i>1/10ω_Z1</i>

678
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:22,665
and that gives us, in blue, the asymptotic
phase diagram

679
00:40:22,665 --> 00:40:27,515
of the function <i>1+j(ω/ω_Z1)</i>.

680
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:30,175
And the real curve,

681
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:34,175
when we draw it with a calculator
or a computer,

682
00:40:34,175 --> 00:40:36,505
or whether we measure the values
because we have created

683
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:38,425
electronic circuits capable of
doing so,

684
00:40:38,425 --> 00:40:41,775
we will see that it develops
asymptotically

685
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,215
on the <i>x</i> axis.

686
00:40:44,697 --> 00:40:47,777
We will have the curve passing from
the other side of this straight line

687
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,417
up to <i>ω_Z1</i>.

688
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:54,367
It will pass again above this straight
line, to then return

689
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:56,617
and develop asymptotically above it.

690
00:40:56,791 --> 00:41:03,176
And the error is 5.7 degrees
when one is at <i>10ω_Z1</i>

691
00:41:03,176 --> 00:41:05,906
and <i>0,1ω_Z1</i>.

692
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:11,276
So, in practice, we are satisfied,
when it comes to manual sketches,

693
00:41:11,276 --> 00:41:13,266
with the asymptotic diagram

694
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:16,356
and we know exactly what
happens with the real curve,

695
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:20,606
with this real error that we have
for this point <i>10ω_Z1</i>,

696
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:23,746
which corresponds with the order
of magnitude of six degrees

697
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:26,656
greater or less than, according
to where we are.

698
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:30,096
And otherwise, in relation to the
asymptotic straight line,

699
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:33,286
we will find ourselves on one side or the
other according to where we are in <i>ω_Z1</i>.

700
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:37,036
But, as for the sketches, we draw the curve
in blue.

701
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,176
And for the measures, we find
this curve

702
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:42,466
which is approximated by the
curve in blue.

703
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:47,875
And you have also really understood
that if you take the 1 on the function

704
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,365
that we have just drawn,

705
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:54,775
we then only have to take the same
curve, place a minus sign before the

706
00:41:54,775 --> 00:41:57,895
argument, and we will have
axial symmetry,

707
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:02,515
and we thus find that this
same explanation reappears

708
00:42:02,515 --> 00:42:07,155
with axial symmetry in relation to
the <i>x</i> axes.

709
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:11,567
And, lastly, the example which has
been given and drawn

710
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:16,507
for the transfer function module,
I will use it again to draw

711
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:20,507
the argument of this transfer
function.

712
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:24,674
So we will see our three canonical
forms again.

713
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:28,611
We will see the examples
for <i>ω1</i> and <i>ω2</i> again.

714
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:32,291
We will find a dephasing of 90 degrees
for what is marked in red.

715
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:39,216
This counts for both <i>1/(1+j(ω/ω1))</i> and
<i>1/(1+j(ω/ω2))</i>,

716
00:42:39,216 --> 00:42:41,726
and we find the two asymptotic diagrams

717
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,376
which have the same form, but with a delay.

718
00:42:44,376 --> 00:42:48,066
For <i>ω1</i>, we are at 45 degrees here.

719
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:49,727
Sorry, I meant for <i>ω2</i>.

720
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:54,617
And for <i>ω1</i>, we are always at
-45 degrees

721
00:42:54,617 --> 00:42:56,647
for the second curve,

722
00:42:56,647 --> 00:42:59,467
otherwise the form of the curve is
the same

723
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:02,027
and here we have only to add
graphically.

724
00:43:02,027 --> 00:43:05,177
So, I am going to add graphically
these three curves

725
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:11,427
and I am going to find the Bode phase
function of this transfer function

726
00:43:11,427 --> 00:43:13,097
which will be this one.

727
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:14,879
There it is.

728
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:23,447
Here I have added the curve
which is in light blue, or cyan.

729
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:26,233
You see the asymptotic diagram.

730
00:43:26,425 --> 00:43:30,425
And there, the dotted lines correspond
with the real function of the phase.

731
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:37,335
We start at low frequencies and a phase
equal to <i>π/2</i>.

732
00:43:37,634 --> 00:43:42,134
And when the frequency increases and
the pulsation is beyond

733
00:43:42,134 --> 00:43:46,334
by an order of magnitude of 10 000,
we begin to see a dephasing

734
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:49,714
of <i>-π/2</i>.

735
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:53,714
And between the two,
the phase changes

736
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,714
according to the addition of
three curves which, in reality,

737
00:43:57,714 --> 00:44:03,034
correspond with three electronic
functions places one after the other.

738
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:07,308
We have just seen, in this annex which
has been added to this MOOC,

739
00:44:07,308 --> 00:44:10,268
all of the canonical Bode diagrams

740
00:44:10,268 --> 00:44:12,798
which might be used in this MOOC.

741
00:44:12,798 --> 00:44:15,158
So, these Bode diagrams allow us

742
00:44:15,158 --> 00:44:18,208
to find the electronic functions.

743
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:21,358
And when we create them, they
will allow us to understand

744
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,358
the frequential behaviour easily,
just by analysing

745
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,998
the module and phase Bode diagrams
of each electronic function,

746
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:34,618
whether they are derivators, integrators,
or a simple gain,

747
00:44:34,618 --> 00:44:38,078
i.e. the linear functions which are given
as examples

748
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:39,468
in this course.

749
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,488
Those who have not taken a course
on Bode functions

750
00:44:42,488 --> 00:44:44,291
will thus be able to understand this.

751
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:46,991
And this is thus an annex to this MOOC.
