1
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:09,298
Now I would like to
start with rectifying a signal,

2
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:11,548
but do the opposite
to what we did earlier.

3
00:00:11,548 --> 00:00:15,028
Earlier,
we made a non-inverting rectifier,

4
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:17,088
now, we are going to make
an inverting rectifier.

5
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,988
We would like
to make a function

6
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:23,478
if the input voltage <i>v1</i> is positive,

7
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:28,918
I would like the output voltage
<i>vL</i>, to be equal to zero.

8
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:33,978
However,
if my <i>v1</i> voltage is negative,

9
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:36,678
I would like
the output to be opposite,

10
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:37,968
so it's positive.

11
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:41,603
So I'll take
the negative component of <i>v1</i>

12
00:00:41,603 --> 00:00:44,103
and rectify it,
I'll make it positive.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,200
And if <i>v1</i> is positive,
I'll put the <i>vL</i> voltage equal to zero.

14
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,119
And we are going to analyse the montage
based on an inverting montage.

15
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:57,824
I am going to outline it without diodes.

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,440
Compared to the montage
that we've just analysed,

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,850
I'm dealing with two diodes.

18
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:05,224
Earlier, I used
a single diode.

19
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:07,864
You will see why
I need two diodes.

20
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:09,854
But I'm going to outline it without diodes.

21
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:12,524
I'm going to outline an inverting
montage without diodes.

22
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:17,097
So I will try to modify this
like that in real time,

23
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:21,227
if I eliminate this diode  <i>D2</i>,
which is no longer there,

24
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:29,081
and in place of this  <i>D1</i> diode,
that I will also remove,

25
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:35,651
I'll replace that with a short-circuit
which will join this node here to that node there.

26
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:38,257
And I'll look at this circuit.

27
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,332
This circuit, it's an inverter
as we studied before

28
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:47,392
whereby the <i>vL</i> voltage is equal
to <i>-R2/R1</i> times <i>v1</i>.

29
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,319
So I can write it here:

30
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:56,219
<i>vL = -R2/R1</i>

31
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:58,909
which multiplies the <i>v1</i> voltage.

32
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:02,369
So if <i>v1</i> is positive,

33
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,949
I will have a current which
will leave the amplifier

34
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:06,569
and descend in the charge.

35
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:09,494
Sorry, I was wrong.

36
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:12,424
If <i>v1</i> is positive,
I will have <i>vL</i> which is negative.

37
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:15,734
So I will have a current
which will go in this direction there.

38
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:19,844
If, however <i>v1</i> is negative,
<i>vL</i> will be positive

39
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:21,834
and the current will go in this direction there.

40
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,854
And now, we are going to add
these diodes

41
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:26,154
and we will do exactly
as we did earlier

42
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:28,404
and by analysing the two conditions:

43
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:31,754
once <i>v1</i> is positive,
and once <i>v1</i> is negative.

44
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:36,483
I'll start with the case of
<i>v1</i> is positive.

45
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,928
I'll take my plan,
how do we analyse this circuit?

46
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,050
To analyse this circuit,
you will always reason

47
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,840
as if the diodes didn't exist

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,840
and you will tell yourself
that <i>v1</i> is positive,

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,540
<i>vL</i> should be negative.

50
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,510
So there's going to be a current
which will go in this direction.

51
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,880
And now, we will add the diodes.

52
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:02,394
So we place the condition
as if the diodes didn't exist,

53
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:04,234
I'm dealing with an inverter.

54
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:07,044
I place <i>v1</i> and I look at <i>vL</i>

55
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:08,414
and after I add my diodes

56
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:11,124
and I will see how
these diodes will behave.

57
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,864
So I took <i>v1</i> as positive,
I expect <i>vL</i> to be negative

58
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:17,424
because it will be opposite,
there is a minus sign.

59
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:19,587
The current will want to pass like that.

60
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,803
It comes into this node, this current.

61
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,509
There is this diode there.

62
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:28,224
This diode will block its path,
it won't let it pass.

63
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:31,444
So it's as if
this diode will be removed,

64
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,414
and so what I'm going to do straight away,

65
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,274
as if <i>D1</i> wasn't there.

66
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:38,134
So this <i>D1</i> here will disappear

67
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,724
and I have this montage.

68
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:42,274
Look at what I have now.

69
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:44,004
This diode is useless.

70
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,944
A blocked diode,
we can't see it in the plan.

71
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:49,734
So my current
which would like to go in there,

72
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:51,264
it can't go.

73
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:54,945
And so, what is happening
to this diode?

74
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,916
If <i>v1</i> is positive
and when <i>v1</i> is positive,

75
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,916
I will have <i>v1</i> which,
theoretically, will appear there.

76
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:08,636
And there, I will have a <i>v1</i> voltage.

77
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:15,324
I have 0V there and the 0V, it's copied
by the counter reaction here.

78
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:19,132
And there, you must listen
to what happens

79
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:23,752
because we will see that this 0V,
which is what I can see here,

80
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:24,952
is copied there.

81
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,920
So if this 0V here,

82
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,620
and this 0V here,

83
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,790
that is the real 0V
and that is the virtual 0V,

84
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,480
I have no current at all
which can't cross this resistance,

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,100
when this diode is a conductor.

86
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,060
Having added this diode there,

87
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,640
this diode will have <i>v1</i> and <i>i1</i>
which would like to pass like that.

88
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,550
So if <i>i1</i> arises here,

89
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:54,352
it comes into this node here.

90
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:56,422
Can <i>i1</i> pass through this diode?

91
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,762
Yes, the diode is in the right direction.

92
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:00,562
It would be able to let <i>i1</i> pass.

93
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:02,972
So the <i>i1</i> current will pass through the diode.

94
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,542
And if the <i>i1</i> current passes
via the diode,

95
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:06,592
passes in the amplifier,

96
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:09,112
that's it, we have a counter reaction
established.

97
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:11,312
When this counter reaction is established,

98
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,322
the potential here is copied here.

99
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,972
And there, I have 0V.

100
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:19,972
So having 0V,
thanks to this diode there,

101
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:23,102
if this diode hadn't been here,

102
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:25,672
I would have no chance at all
of having a copy of this potential

103
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:27,062
towards this potential.

104
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:31,062
This potential will rely on
<i>R1</i>, <i>R2</i> and <i>RL</i>

105
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:34,862
and I will have <i>v1</i> which will be
on the terminals of these three resistances

106
00:05:34,862 --> 00:05:37,942
and that will have a given potential
thanks to that.

107
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:42,712
But the diode, when it conducted,
created a counter reaction

108
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:45,902
so the amplifier created
the virtual mass.

109
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:49,902
So I have 0V there and I have 0V here

110
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:55,882
because 0V from there to there doesn't allow
a current to pass through <i>RL</i> and <i>R2</i>

111
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:57,902
which gives me <i>i' = 0</i>

112
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:00,332
and therefore I have
zero current.

113
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:02,962
And I have the voltage <i>vL = 0</i>.

114
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:08,052
So we've just found straight away
that if <i>v1</i> is positive,

115
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:09,712
a diode creates the counter reaction,

116
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:12,632
the other, we can't see it
on a plan.

117
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:17,472
And this enables us to have <i>vL = 0</i>
and this gives us that.

118
00:06:17,472 --> 00:06:19,912
What happens with <i>v2</i>?

119
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,912
<i>v2</i>, is from this node towards the mass.

120
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:28,136
And this potential is the same as this one
so <i>v2</i>, I have it here.

121
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:32,285
So that is exactly the <i>v2</i> voltage.

122
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:35,510
So <i>v2</i>is equal to a <i>-Uj</i> voltage.

123
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,510
When the diode will conduct,
it will create a connection voltage

124
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,660
that I call <i>Uj</i>.

125
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,020
So <i>v2</i>, it's from this node here
to this node there,

126
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,410
on the terminals of the same diode

127
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,110
so <i>v2</i> is located at <i>-Uj</i>.

128
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,570
I would just like to insist on that.

129
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:50,939
In the case of a non-inverter
rectifying amplifier,

130
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:52,759
that we studied earlier,

131
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,759
we found that
when the output voltage was zero,

132
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,829
we found that
<i>v2</i> was equal to <i>-Vsat</i>.

133
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,249
There, it's already better.

134
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:04,629
Instead of going towards the saturation
voltage which is quite high,

135
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,629
to a relatively weak voltage
compared to <i>Vsat</i>,

136
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:14,309
which is on an order of -0.6 to -0.7V
which is a connection voltage.

137
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,426
We will now analyse what will happen
with the same plan,

138
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:23,856
but taking an alternation
for which <i>v1</i> is negative.

139
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:27,066
So I'll put <i>v1</i> negative.
Same logic.

140
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,546
If I apply a negative voltage,

141
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:32,366
I reason as if
my diodes didn't exist

142
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:34,666
and I would say
in an inverter amplifier

143
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,616
when <i>v1</i> is negative,

144
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:39,486
I will find myself with
a <i>vL</i> postive voltage.

145
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:42,906
So the current will want to come
in this direction there.

146
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:44,642
There is a diode.

147
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:48,362
This diode this time is
in the right direction of the current flow.

148
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:51,762
So the amplifier which provides the current
passes through the diode

149
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,812
and continues its path.

150
00:07:53,936 --> 00:08:00,356
So the counter reaction is established
through the <i>R2</i> and <i>R1</i> resistances

151
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:03,346
and allows the counter reaction to happen.

152
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:06,251
But what happens
with the <i>D2</i> diode?

153
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:09,321
The <i>D2</i> diode has 0V here,

154
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,181
so the counter-reacting amplifier
will impose 0V there.

155
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:15,082
And there, the voltage will be positive.

156
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,412
So we said <i>v1</i> negative,

157
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:21,412
<i>vL</i> will be positive,
so this voltage is quite high.

158
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:25,038
So if this voltage is quite high,

159
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,038
this voltage there will also
be high compared to zero.

160
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:31,668
So <i>v2</i> is positive
and higher than zero,

161
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:34,348
so this diode is blocked,

162
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,248
so we can remove it.

163
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,210
We can imagine
that this diode doesn't exist.

164
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,780
I'll remove it from my circuit
and I have a circuit

165
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:50,160
in which there is simply a <i>D1</i> diode
which created the counter reaction

166
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,130
and the inverter plan,

167
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,290
we can also demonstrate
like earlier,

168
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,090
that adding a serial <i>Uj</i>
threshold voltage,

169
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,680
if you bring this voltage to the input,

170
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,550
you will take <i>Uj</i> divided
by the gain of the amplifier

171
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,790
which is very, very big,

172
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,670
so <i>Uj</i> divided by infinity,

173
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,670
there's no real effect of <i>Uj</i>
if the gain is very, very big.

174
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,010
In this case, in this type of plan,

175
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,670
we can clearly see that the amplifier
becomes an inverter amplifier,

176
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,400
as we know, as usual,

177
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,300
which will take a <i>vL</i> voltage

178
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,070
and which will multiply
by a constant <i>-R2/R1</i>

179
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,090
multiplied by <i>v1</i>,

180
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,850
which is what we expect
from an inverter amplifier

181
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,850
and which will give us a slope which,
for a negative voltage,

182
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,990
makes it positive. It multiplies it
by a <i>R2/R1</i> value.

183
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:44,600
And that's it, we have this famous relation
that the negative voltage <i>v1</i>

184
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,210
would be multiplied by a minus sign
so it becomes positive again,

185
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,990
multiplied by a constant <i>R2/R1</i>.

186
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:57,348
And the <i>v2</i> voltage is always behind
compared to the <i>v1</i> voltage

187
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:01,348
of a quantity which is equal
to this <i>Uj</i> voltage.

188
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:04,108
So this <i>Uj</i> voltage
is always the voltage

189
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:06,108
that we will see between these
two curves.

190
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:11,178
So we have two curves following each other,
with a <i>Uj</i> voltage between <i>vL</i> and <i>v2</i>,

191
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,168
and we can clearly see that here.

192
00:10:13,869 --> 00:10:19,929
And to finish, here is our complete plan
with the two diodes,

193
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,729
with the characteristics
that we analysed earlier.

194
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:24,869
It's a non-linear function.

195
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:27,469
When the voltage is positive,
the output is zero

196
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:30,879
and when the voltage is negative,
the output becomes positive.

197
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,209
And we have
this type of plan.

198
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,839
There is a big advantage,
it's that the <i>v2</i> voltage will never

199
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,779
look for a saturation voltage,

200
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,009
so a high voltage.

201
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,719
So we are less irritated
by the <i>slew rate</i> of the amplifier

202
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,659
because the variation of <i>v2</i>,

203
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:48,319
when we pass from a positive voltage,

204
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:51,459
when the <i>v1</i> voltage passes
through zero,

205
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:57,699
we see a variation
in size order from 1.2 to 1.4V

206
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,659
because it's equal to two times <i>Uj</i>,

207
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,949
contrary to what we saw
earlier

208
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,429
which was 15V plus 0.7V.

209
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,519
So the difference is clearly minimal

210
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,329
and the impact on the output voltage
of a limitation of the amplifier,

211
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:12,209
which is the <i>slew rate</i>, is lower.

212
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,849
So we always wish,
as much as possible,

213
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:20,759
to appeal to this type of montage
rather than the alternating simple rectifier

214
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,759
when the output is positive,
we prefer to use this montage

215
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,539
to take advantage of this effect
that we've just discussed.

216
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:33,075
Here is our input voltage
which is in yellow

217
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:35,905
and certainly, we will see the
rectified voltage at the output,

218
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:39,285
i.e. the positive alternation
will give us a zero,

219
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:43,285
however, our negative alternation
will be rectified

220
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,985
and that is what we can see now
on this oscilloscope.

221
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:49,952
I would really like, at this stage,
to illustrate what will happen

222
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:54,942
with this type of amplifier
when it passes through zero

223
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:59,262
and see what problems will occur,
linked to the <i>slew rate.</i>

224
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:02,262
So remember that an
operational amplifier suffers

225
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:03,472
from an imperfection

226
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,052
when we have a voltage
deviation at the output

227
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:10,442
and with this voltage deviation,
when it has to do be done quickly,

228
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:13,122
there is a phenomenon
called the <i>slew rate</i>,

229
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:14,642
as it's called in English.

230
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:21,462
And this voltage deviation limits
the voltage variation at the output

231
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:23,252
that we can see there.

232
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:25,142
So you see the blue curve.

233
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:29,142
When the voltage in yellow
passes through zero,

234
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:32,722
of course, this diode there,
is the one that was conducting,

235
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:35,482
the amplifier is counter reacted

236
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:37,092
by the two resistances,

237
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:42,312
but when it passes through zero,
it will rectify the voltage

238
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:46,312
and it will pass from <i>-Uj</i> to <i>+Uj</i>
and we can see this phenomenon here.

239
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:50,157
This phenomenon shows us
that there's a small change

240
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:52,557
and then, we have this slope

241
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:56,557
and this slope isn't exactly
a sinusoidal voltage.

242
00:12:56,757 --> 00:13:00,757
It's the tangent slope to the
passing through zero of a sinusoidal voltage

243
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:05,287
because the amplifier will
take time to follow <i>-Uj</i> to <i>Uj</i>

244
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:10,907
and it will affect the linearity
of the rectified voltage at the output.

245
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:14,006
And to solve that,

246
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:17,326
as we saw when we studied
the chapter on imperfections,

247
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:20,516
you can lower the voltage
and have fewer deviations.

248
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:23,226
There is another phenomenon
that I would like to comment on,

249
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:27,226
it's what happens
when this diode there will conduct.

250
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:32,065
So this diode here will conduct,
it will make a counter reaction.

251
00:13:32,065 --> 00:13:36,255
So it will rejoin the current
which will pass directly

252
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:38,305
by a counter reaction through
the diode

253
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:42,305
by having a drop in <i>Uj</i>
voltage in this direction there.

254
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:45,406
That means that at the moment
when this diode will conduct,

255
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:49,406
the amplifier will act
like a voltage follower

256
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:52,686
it has a plus here,
it will place it there,

257
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:56,686
the zero, it will place it here
and we would have a follower.

258
00:13:56,686 --> 00:14:01,986
And the voltage follower corresponds
exactly to what happens there.

259
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:05,166
The amplifier is counter reacted
by the <i>D2</i> diode.

260
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:09,166
And rightly, when it arrives there,

261
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:14,434
when it arrives here,

262
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,080
the amplifier is changing
the type of counter reaction.

263
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,150
At the start, it was counter reacted
by this <i>D1</i> diode.

264
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,760
And then, it is counter reacted
by the <i>D2</i> diode.

265
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,770
And we can see small oscillations
that appear here

266
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,270
because this amplifier can't
quickly follow

267
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,720
this passage from one diode to the other

268
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,370
and it will take a certain amount
of time to counter react

269
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,370
and we can see it here by an oscillation
which is quite common for these components.

270
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,530
To resolve this and to have fewer
oscillations which appear here,

271
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,690
you need to increase the amplifier's gain

272
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,520
and the amplifier's bandwidth,
if possible.

273
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,260
And that's it, with that,
we were able to see

274
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,540
that using an active
amplifier,

275
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,540
which has stability rules
that aren't yet studied

276
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,810
at this level in electronics,

277
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,110
we would still have a rectified voltage
which can sometimes suffer

278
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,280
from the amplifier's imperfections.

279
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,330
And it was the right moment
to mention them.

280
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,380
And what we've just seen
with this amplifier

281
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,010
by using the two diodes
is much more drastic

282
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:21,870
and has a much more limiting effect
when the amplifier is non-inverting.

283
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,670
I understand that the montage
that we studied at the start,

284
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,420
where it's a non-inverting rectifier,

285
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,850
this type of phenomenon is
much more drastic

286
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,580
and strongly limits
using this amplifier

287
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,000
with applications that have very, very
weak frequency

288
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,550
and the output voltage deviation
is extremely weak,

289
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,270
especially when passing through zero.

290
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,930
I remind you that when the rectifier
is non-inverting,

291
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,790
the output voltage of the amplifier
has to leave from <i>-Vsat</i> to <i>+Uj</i>.

292
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,320
And there, we already see this phenomenon
when it leaves from <i>-Uj</i> to <i>+Uj</i>

293
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,980
so in size order from 1.4V,

294
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,990
and in the case of the non-inverter,
there's a lot of voltage which passes

295
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,100
and the <i>slew rate</i> sometimes has to
change from voltages like -15V to 0.7V,

296
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,840
which is enormous.
