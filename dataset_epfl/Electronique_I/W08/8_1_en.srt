1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,880
Once we've finished with
linear applications,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,200
we're going to move on to
non-linear applications.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,400
A non-linear application means

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,720
that the relationship between
input and output is not linear.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,400
It's not y = x.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,480
Typically, under non-linear
applications

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,720
we often study rectifiers.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,350
So, we take a circuit which
manages to replace the famous diode.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,560
So this component which lets
the current pass in only one direction,

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,480
we can do it with components
such as diodes,

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,200
but to which we've added
an operational amplifier arrangement.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,360
So, fulfilling the dream of an
engineer is the super diode.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,840
Because a diode is
unfortunately a passive component.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,520
The output voltage, when we leave
it, when we use a diode,

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,240
there's a junction voltage

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,600
that we lose between the applied
voltage and the output voltage,

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,640
and this junction voltage is
around 0.6 to 0.7V,

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,200
or even less in some types
of diode.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,280
We'd like to rectify a voltage
with an amplitude of 100 mV.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,080
We can't use a diode,

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,240
because the diode needs
a certain level of voltage,

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,160
and above that, it starts to act

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,760
like a circuit which lets the current
pass in only one direction.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,720
So, we're going to do it
with operational amplifiers

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,120
and by using diodes.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
To begin,

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,840
I'd like to speak about the non-
inverting half-wave rectifier.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,360
I'm going to analyse this
line here,

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,160
which shows what this
arrangement can give us.

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,920
The VL output voltage,

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,160
the V1 input voltage,

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,800
and we've added a diode.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,960
Of course, we have our
operational amplifier

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,200
which is here.

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,800
This is what we expect of
this circuit.

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,520
I'm going to present and
comment on it here, and analyse

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,400
why we get something like
this from this circuit.

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,080
If you look at what happens
to the V1 voltage here,

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,840
as opposed to the V2 voltage

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,680
then...

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Sorry, I rather want to talk
about the VL voltage.

42
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,480
If you look at what happens
with the VL voltage,

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,280
compared to the V1 voltage,

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,100
then we can see that VL
in accordance with V1,

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,960
corresponds to this
straight line here,

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,040
where the output voltage,
in relation to the input,

47
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,760
has a slope = 1,

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,040
so V1 = VL.

49
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,000
This voltage is equal to that,
when V1 is positive.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,840
The red line corresponds to
the output VL.

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,120
And we see that this red line
will only follow the V1 voltage

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,480
when V1 is positive.

53
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,840
If V1 becomes negative, there
it is, VL becomes equal to 0.

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,880
So, VL = 0 if V1 is negative.

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,760
VL = V1 if the V1 voltage is positive.

56
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,360
Therefore it's non-linear.
It's a non-linear curve.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
It's not a straight line.

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,960
That's absolutely not the case.

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,640
It's simply: look at the sign of
the voltage and rectify it.

60
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,560
So, if the voltage is positive,
we find the component positive.

61
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,160
And if the voltage is negative,
the output voltage is cancelled out.

62
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,320
We're going to analyse this
circuit in the following way.

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,280
I would like to analyse this
circuit step by step,

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,400
and explain how we analyse
this type of circuit.

65
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,600
So, you've seen that there
is a diode.

66
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,400
If we disregard this diode,

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm going to draw the circuit
which is that without the diode.

68
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,800
So, we have an operational amp,

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,560
we have a voltage follower,

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,720
and we have an input here,

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,360
and here, we've connected
a V1 voltage.

72
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,480
And we're looking at the
VL output voltage.

73
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,880
So, theoretically,
this type of circuit gives

74
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,640
V1 = VL,

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,680
this voltage equals this voltage,
this voltage is the same as the output,

76
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,400
there's no current passing here,

77
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
it's the amp which provides
the output current.

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,480
And we have a voltage follower.

79
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,519
We add a diode.

80
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,920
This diode will be inserted
between the amp output

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,640
and the charge that we
connected there.

82
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,920
I started first by
analysing what happens

83
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,400
if the V1 voltage is negative,

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
what happens with the VL
voltage at the output.

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
I said if V1 is negative.

86
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,560
Logically, in this circuit,
if V1 is negative,

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,120
VL is negative.

88
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,040
When we say:
a VL voltage is negative,

89
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,000
if that voltage had been negative,
the current passes in this direction,

90
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,400
I deliberately connected an
RL resistor

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,600
to simplify it and make it
easier to understand.

92
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,360
So, if you look at what happens
with this resistor

93
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,000
when it has a negative voltage,
we expect there to be a current

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,640
that passes from the earth
and which should come out like that,

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,360
arrive in this node here.

96
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,960
It can't go over here,

97
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,960
because the amp doesn't absorb
current at the negative terminal.

98
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,480
Generally, it passes the amp.
It continues its path towards -VCC.

99
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,920
But it can't do it,
because we added a diode,

100
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,640
and this diode blocks in
this direction.

101
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,120
So, this current can't at all
get past this diode

102
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,400
to go towards the amp.

103
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,560
So, what will happen

104
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,330
is that this current arrives,
it can't go in this direction,

105
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,840
i = 0 here,

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,440
i = 0 here.

107
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,640
And we'll get a voltage VL = 0.

108
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,360
If we want to look at this
arrangement another way,

109
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,880
you just have to imagine it
with a blocking diode.

110
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,320
The current wants to cross it,

111
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,480
so, logic says: it's as if
we don't have this diode,

112
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,920
as if this diode had disappeared.

113
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,080
We have nothing at all here.

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,600
Look what happens with this circuit.

115
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,920
You find yourself with a circuit
which is exactly this.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,200
The diode disappeared, because
it has no role to play.

117
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,560
The current here can't pass
through there.

118
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,640
The voltage, here, it finds
itself on the positive terminal.

119
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,360
But what can be found here
as potential?

120
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,680
We definitely have an iL = 0.

121
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,000
In a charge where there's no
current, the voltage VL = 0.

122
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,280
So, your terminal or
the negative input of your

123
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,840
amp is connected to earth,

124
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,400
through a resistor that plays
no role,

125
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,840
because there's a potential
difference equal to zero,

126
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,760
there's no current passing
through anywhere,

127
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,160
So you find yourself

128
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,200
with a V2 voltage from
your amplifier,

129
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,960
disconnected from VL,

130
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,640
and VL will show you a
voltage equal to zero.

131
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,000
And this is only applicable
when V1 is negative.

132
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,240
So analysing that on the curve,
it's what I've described there.

133
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,880
If V1 is negative,
so we're below zero,

134
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
VL = 0, we can see that here.

135
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:12,000
V2, unfortunately, at that moment
sees this potential connected to zero,

136
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
sees this potential with a negative
value, we can imagine at -1.

137
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,040
If you have -1 here and 0 there,

138
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,040
it's going to tell you that
your amp will act as a comparator.

139
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,160
It compares the -1 to 0,

140
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,280
and it'll find itself with the
0 > -1,

141
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,200
so it'll saturate towards Vsat −.

142
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,200
The output of your amp will
then have V2 = −Vsat.

143
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,840
And that corresponds to
what we've just seen here.

144
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,240
V1 negative,

145
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,640
V2, which we can't see, because
we subdue it at the output.

146
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,200
But at the output, our VL = 0.

147
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm going to take the same

148
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,200
setup and this time analyse
the case when V1 is positive.

149
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,080
This time, V1 is positive.

150
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,760
If you remember,
the feedback,

151
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,600
when V1 is positive and has
a voltage follower,

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,800
we expect VL to follow V1,

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,880
so VL will have the value of
V1, it'll be positive.

154
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,720
A positive voltage means that

155
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,160
the current iL is passing in
this direction in the RL resistor.

156
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,520
That means that there's a current
which will come out of my amp

157
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,800
through this diode, but this time
the diode is in the right direction.

158
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,240
And in this direction which
lets the current flow,

159
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,440
if the current passes through,

160
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,880
there will definitely be a
threshold voltage equal to Uj.

161
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,240
The output of my amp
which is there, V2,

162
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,080
will see a Uj voltage plus
the VL voltage.

163
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,720
And we can see it here.

164
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,600
So, when this current
passes through this diode,

165
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,800
the feedback is established.

166
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,880
And I'm going to show now

167
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,600
that the fact we added a diode
won't hugely change

168
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,600
what happens with this type
of arrangement.

169
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,080
We have V1

170
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,520
equal to this node here.

171
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,480
Remember that when an
amplifier

172
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,840
has feedback,

173
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,120
this V1 here is copied there,
and if you follow this line,

174
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,680
it will go towards VL,
so V1 is equal to VL.

175
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,720
And that's exactly what
we want from this circuit.

176
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,040
We want it to become a
follower when V1 is positive.

177
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,080
So the positive component is
returned at the output.

178
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,360
I just wanted to give
a little demonstration.

179
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,480
By taking our
operational amplifier,

180
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,760
saying, as we've always seen,

181
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,400
that the potential on
the negative terminal,

182
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,320
and the potential on
the positive terminal,

183
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,040
that's <i>V+ − V−</i>,

184
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,320
is multiplied by the
amplifier's gain,

185
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,240
and this gain is infinite.

186
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,800
If that gain is infinite,

187
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,800
and we have the equation
that V2 which is here,

188
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,680
equals this infinite gain,
which multiplies <i>V+ − V−</i>,

189
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,400
and that this V2 voltage,
I'll write it,

190
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,360
this voltage is equal to Uj,

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
if I take the Kirchhoff circuit
laws from here to here,

192
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,040
I'll say that <i>V2 = Uj + VL</i>,

193
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
which is written here.

194
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,320
So, this <i>V2 = Uj + VL</i>,

195
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,080
and if I replace V+ and V− by their
values, V+ = V1, which I put here.

196
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,920
V− = VL,

197
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,560
connected through here,

198
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,440
and I write this equation.

199
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,400
And I'd like to look at VL
in accordance with the rest.

200
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,880
This is saying that
<i>VL = (A.V1 − Uj) / (A + 1)</i>.

201
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,640
Remember that A is infinite.

202
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,120
Remember that if A is infinite,
and we look at ∞ + 1,

203
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,680
I can easily say that I can
discard this 1,

204
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,600
in relation to this A.

205
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
I also have A.V1,

206
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,800
minus a certain relatively
small amount,

207
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,360
which is from around 0.6
to 0.7 V,

208
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,680
this is the junction voltage
at the diode's terminals.

209
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,000
So I can also discard

210
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,360
this component here.

211
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,160
At that moment,
I only have to look at

212
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,920
the equation which is left,
which is, of course...

213
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,920
an estimation.

214
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,840
It's <i>A.V1/A</i>,
so I can eliminate A and A

215
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,880
and I get VL = V1,
which is exactly what I expected.

216
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,400
Definitely this Uj enters into
our equation,

217
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,880
but compared to <i>A.V1</i>
with a gain which is extreme,

218
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,680
this doesn't affect it at all,

219
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,920
or really affects this type of
circuit very very lightly.

220
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
So, with that we've got
what we wanted.

221
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,480
With that we've got

222
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,080
that when the V1 component
is positive,

223
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,440
the V1 output will follow,

224
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,680
or rather the VL output follows
the V1 voltage, we see it there.

225
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,600
When this is positive,

226
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,080
we have a voltage follower

227
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,920
with V2 which is still affected
by Uj compared to VL,

228
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,600
so that corresponds to this
straight line here.

229
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,520
To summarise,

230
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,080
our circuit is this,

231
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,000
with the results we got.

232
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,480
If the voltage is positive

233
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,800
at the input, the output
will follow it.

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,560
If the voltage is negative,
the output will be equal to 0.

235
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,960
So, there's another thing
which makes this circuit have,

236
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,160
or which gives this circuit

237
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,320
a factor which could pose
a problem when we

238
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,440
want to go towards
higher frequencies.

239
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,480
Remember when we talked

240
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,240
about one of the imperfections
of the operational amplifier,

241
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,840
what we called the <i>slew rate</i>.

242
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
So, the famous <i>slew rate</i>
of an amp,

243
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,760
is this component or rather
this effect,

244
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,220
which says: unfortunately, the
amp output can't

245
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,280
vary from one value to another
at an extreme speed,

246
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,240
and the manufacturer shows us

247
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,520
what the maximum speed is
at which we can vary V2.

248
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,640
And it's linked to an amount
of consumption that the

249
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,920
manufacturer has already established
to make the inside of its amp.

250
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,240
And we can find this in this diagram.

251
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,320
When V1 passes from a negative
value to a positive one, we're here,

252
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,480
when V1 passes from a negative
value to a positive one,

253
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,500
the V2 voltage that you see here,
should go from −Vsat to +Uj.

254
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,120
If you increase your amp
to supply voltages

255
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,480
equally as high, such as if we have
here something equal to −15V,

256
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,480
and you tend towards a
voltage of around 0.7V,

257
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,640
you have something from
−15 to 0.7,

258
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,440
which poses quite a danger
to our amplifier.

259
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,720
Every time the voltage we
wanted to rectify

260
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,440
goes from a negative value
to a positive one,

261
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,680
the amplifier doesn't manage
to follow

262
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,600
if the amplitude of the
V2 voltage is high.

263
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,490
So, remember that the
<i>slew rate</i> affects

264
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,160
the frequency response
of the operational amplifier,

265
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,640
but the <i>slew rate</i>,
if you lower the value of V1

266
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,200
so in this case V2,
so in this case VL,

267
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,800
you perhaps manage to
better follow,

268
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,680
but this difference is
quite excessive,

269
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,000
and this has a big impact
on the frequencies

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,560
that we can get when we
use a circuit like this.

271
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,080
So we have really
a big frequency

272
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,680
limitation on this type
of circuit.
