1
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:11,376
Suppose that now we want to
do a full-wave rectifier.

2
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:15,996
So a full-wave rectifier
means that

3
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:21,266
the positive component
at our input,

4
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:24,416
it is sent to the output,
and it will remain positive.

5
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,326
On the other hand, the negative
component is rectified

6
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:28,626
and becomes positive.

7
00:00:28,626 --> 00:00:31,226
So this is a full-wave
rectifier.

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:38,800
The voltage <i>vL</i> is equal to
the absolute value of <i>v1</i>.

9
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:42,244
So this voltage <i>v1</i>,
whether it's positive or negative,

10
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:44,464
will always become positive
at the output.

11
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:48,464
So we direct everything
towards the upper level.

12
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:51,924
<i>vL</i> is always positive,
we can never have <i>vL</i> as a negative,

13
00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:53,664
regardless of the value of <i>v1</i>.

14
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:57,544
When <i>v1</i> becomes negative,
the circuit rectifies the positive position.

15
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:01,734
We can do this easily
by taking the two circuits

16
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:05,254
that we have seen before and
putting them in parallel.

17
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:10,004
Here is a half-wave
rectifier circuit.

18
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:17,538
This here is positive.

19
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:19,768
So what is positive will remain positive.

20
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:22,388
This here, which is negative,
will be made positive.

21
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:26,504
To put in parallel will generate
this type of behaviour.

22
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,194
Unfortunately, when
you put the two in parallel,

23
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:32,554
you'll benefit from
this type of circuit.

24
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:35,884
We've just said
that the <i>slew rate</i> effect of the amp

25
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:38,934
is less visible
compared to the first circuit.

26
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:42,934
Putting them in parallel
means that this here

27
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,574
will limit your frequency.

28
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:47,254
On the other hand, here,  it will limit
your frequency less.

29
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:51,174
So we don't take advantage of the benefit
of one against the other.

30
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:54,014
We're quite annoyed
by the existence of this circuit.

31
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,834
Are there any other solutions
to resolve this problem? Yes.

32
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:00,234
So here is a very well-known technique.

33
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:04,234
This technique consists in using
this type of diagram.

34
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,563
So there, just to give
another example,

35
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:10,563
of course by inverting the diodes,
we can go back to the previous diagram

36
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,273
but just to illustrate
another example,

37
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:17,553
I have used an inverting amplifier,

38
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:20,353
so this is an inverting rectifier,

39
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:22,113
with a summer.

40
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:27,525
I think you remember
that this type of connection from here to here

41
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:28,885
is a summer.

42
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:31,475
We will take a voltage there

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,990
and a voltage here

44
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,430
and add them in.

45
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,430
The voltage that is added here,
is multiplied by this resistor

46
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,650
divided by this
with a negative sign

47
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,240
to which we add the ratio
of this resistor over this resistor

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,790
with a minus sign,
and send this to the output.

49
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:53,875
We can analyse this circuit
by focussing on a sinusoidal voltage.

50
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:55,958
We have a sinusoidal voltage here.

51
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:59,158
I have drawn the negative
component in red,

52
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:01,688
and the positive component in blue.

53
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,253
I will analyse what first appears
at the output of the rectifier.

54
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:10,265
And well, at the output of the rectifier,
there is a gain equal to -1.

55
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:16,056
So I will take
the negative part in red,

56
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:18,376
which I've drawn in a dotted line here,

57
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:22,376
and I will multiply it by -1,
so I keep the same amplitude

58
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:23,976
and I rectify it.

59
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:26,964
So the negative part
has become positive.

60
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,493
This is what we have just
analysed and studied.

61
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:36,565
Now, I put this in a summer
and I multiply it by 2.

62
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:39,705
So I take this positive part
and I multiply it by 2.

63
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:43,135
I have doubled this and I add
a minus sign.

64
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:47,815
So what is drawn in blue
will find itself inverted again

65
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,075
and multiplied by 2.

66
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:51,535
It will be doubled and inverted.

67
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,659
And I have just added
all of my signal to it.

68
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:58,919
I will take all this,
invert it

69
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,233
and add it in.

70
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:03,903
I will let you do
this little exercise for yourself

71
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:06,573
so you realise that
at the output,

72
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:11,193
you will find yourself
with the negative,

73
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:14,573
and positive components

74
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:16,883
that are found on the same side

75
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:18,523
in this case, on the negative side.

76
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:22,523
So all the sinusoidal input signal
that we have added

77
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:25,703
is now rectified at a double wave.

78
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:28,763
So we don't lose
the half-wave of our voltage at all

79
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:33,243
but all the half-waves are brought back
to a value less than zero

80
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:35,373
which is clearly explained.

81
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:37,923
So the voltage <i>vL</i>
is always negative

82
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:42,343
and the value <i>vL</i> is always negative,
regardless of <i>v1</i>.

83
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:45,523
When <i>v1</i> becomes negative,
it will stay that way until the output.

84
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:50,803
And when <i>v1</i> becomes positive,
the output <i>vL</i> will become negative.

85
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:55,133
So we are going to connect it
and look at what happens

86
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,533
on an oscilloscope

87
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:59,373
which shows us
that this type of circuit essentially

88
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:02,233
gives us a double wave
such as this one.

89
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:04,202
Here is our input voltage.

90
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:07,772
As usual, we have a voltage,
which we can track in yellow.

91
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:12,032
And there, we will observe it
after the first stage of rectification.

92
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:14,752
So we see the negative half-wave
which is rectified

93
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:15,962
and has become positive.

94
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:18,692
And the positive half-wave which
has become equal to zero.

95
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:23,772
And we will see what happens
at the output of the summer.

96
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:26,682
It's difficult to see
what is going on on this oscilloscope

97
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:29,132
because there are several lines
which are confused,

98
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:31,452
but we can see the output of the summer.

99
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:35,452
It's enough to delete the other lines
and keep the only voltage source

100
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:38,152
at the output of the summer.

101
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:42,152
And there, we have a negative double wave.

102
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:44,282
So what will stay with us at the output,

103
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:48,282
is an entirely negative voltage,
as well as the positive part,

104
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,712
the positive half-wave and
the negative half-wave.

105
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:56,092
To continue with
non-linear circuits,

106
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:58,832
here is also a technique
that we use

107
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:02,252
by adding in diodes
that we call Zener diodes.

108
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:05,612
A Zener diode is a diode
that we draw with a small <i>Z</i>

109
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,432
which is added here.

110
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:09,656
It has a forward-bias direction.

111
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:12,861
So in this forward-bias direction,
it is like a normal diode.

112
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,781
So if I have a positive voltage
in this direction here,

113
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:20,401
I will have a voltage of <i>Uj</i>,
like a normal diode.

114
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:24,401
So this is a junction voltage
to the order of 0.6 to 0.7

115
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:25,761
per silicon.

116
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:30,663
On the other hand, when the current
crosses it in this direction here,

117
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:36,537
you will find yourself
with a voltage in this direction here

118
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,857
which is equal to the voltage <i>vZ</i>.

119
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:44,293
We have taken two similar diodes
and we have put the two diodes head-to-foot.

120
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:48,507
So there will be a current in this direction
or in this direction.

121
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:51,437
And if you look if the
current is positive in this direction here,

122
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:56,987
you will see <i>Uj</i>  and a voltage here
equal to <i>vZ</i>.

123
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:02,034
If you follow a current that
will pass in the direction of this arrow here,

124
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:07,554
you'll find yourself
with a voltage equal to <i>Uj</i>

125
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:10,134
and a voltage  <i>vZ</i> in this direction.

126
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:12,624
Which means that
your amplifier,

127
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:16,624
instead of overloading
the voltages to saturation,

128
00:07:16,624 --> 00:07:22,514
it will linearly amplify the voltage <i>v1</i>
and multiply it by a gain <i>R2/R1</i>

129
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:25,274
and these two diodes here,
will never intervene.

130
00:07:25,274 --> 00:07:30,024
But when we start to exceed <i>vZ1+Uj</i>

131
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:32,514
and <i>-vZ2-Uj</i>,

132
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:37,026
your amplifier will cap the signal
and give an effect

133
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:38,986
similar to a saturation effect

134
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:41,506
but which is independent
from the saturation of the amp.

135
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:45,646
So if you want to avoid
the feeder voltages of the amp

136
00:07:45,646 --> 00:07:47,486
finding themselves at the output,

137
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:49,546
you can add this type of circuit

138
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,606
and it's you who decides
on the saturation voltage of the amp,

139
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,436
not the power
of your amplifier.

140
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,739
To finish, we're going to analyse a circuit

141
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:02,499
which is called a linear-logarithmic
converter.

142
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:07,629
This type of converter is used to
amplify, or rather to convert

143
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:12,569
the signals between <i>v1</i> and <i>v2</i>
which will have a logarithmic relationship.

144
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,779
But it acts only
on increases

145
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:15,999
on smaller signals.

146
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:19,149
So when <i>v1</i> is very weak,
a <i>Δv1</i>,

147
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,599
you'll find with your
<i>Δv1</i> voltage,

148
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:26,829
I'm talking about an increase,
so this weak amplitude here,

149
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:31,239
which will give you a current <i>i</i>
equal to <i>v1/R</i>.

150
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,550
This current will cross through a diode.

151
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:37,706
So the increasing diode,

152
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:40,036
when the diode is reversed,

153
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:43,586
which is found around an
operating point of this diode,

154
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:45,696
it has an exponential law

155
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:51,226
which will link the current that flows through
to the voltage to its terminals <i>vD</i>

156
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,316
through this exponential law.

157
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:57,293
The current <i>iS</i> is a current
which is provided by the manufacturer

158
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:58,473
of the diode.

159
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:02,929
The variable <i>n</i> is a variable
of correction for this relationship

160
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:04,816
and it must be known.

161
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:06,936
The thermodynamic voltage,
as we knew it,

162
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,916
is 26mV
at room temperature.

163
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,733
So when the voltage <i>v2</i>,

164
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:16,733
which is also an increase
that appears here,

165
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:21,555
equal to <i>-vD</i>,
we have replaced <i>vD</i> with <i>-v2</i>.

166
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:24,115
And we can develop this.

167
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:28,289
And we will find a relationship
which links the voltages <i>v1</i> and <i>v2</i>

168
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:29,989
by a logarithmic law.

169
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:33,989
So <i>v2</i> is in reality proportional
to the logarithm of <i>v1</i>.

170
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:39,605
This circuit doesn't seem interesting
or difficult to use,

171
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:40,845
which is true.

172
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:46,502
Having to add
increases poses a problem.

173
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,612
There are variants
that I won't talk about now

174
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:53,612
but which use transistors,
which exacerbate this effect.

175
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:57,612
But on the other hand, suppose that
you have this type of convertor

176
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:03,532
which converts a voltage <i>v1</i>
with the logarithm of this voltage,

177
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:08,532
know that it's an extraordinary measure
to use when we want to carry out

178
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:11,552
a multiplication operator

179
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:13,002
because until today

180
00:10:13,002 --> 00:10:16,342
we used the op amplifier
to add them together.

181
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:19,172
We used the op amplifier
to subtract.

182
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:21,242
And if you want to multiply,

183
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:24,682
the ideal is to use
two sorting circuits like this

184
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:25,924
with a summer.

185
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:27,034
Why?

186
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:31,905
Because the sum of a function
where we have the logarithm,

187
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:37,485
and well, if we add
two logarithms to the output,

188
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:40,435
we can transform this
into a multiplication

189
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:42,875
by looking for an inverse conversion,

190
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,205
which means looking for
the exponential of this.

191
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:48,515
We know very well that the logarithm,
when we add it in,

192
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:52,515
we have the advantage of carrying
out multiplications

193
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:55,215
between the voltages
when we add in two logarithms.

194
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:57,765
I'll just mention this idea in passing.

195
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:00,625
But this type of circuit
can be used to carry out

196
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,685
a multiplication operator
and a division operator

197
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,965
that haven't been present here,

198
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,535
because they go through
a logarithmic conversion.

199
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:13,304
Ok, we've just finished
a series of examples

200
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:15,834
with non-linear sorting circuits.

201
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:18,964
We have especially focussed on rectifiers

202
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:21,234
and we have looked
at different types of rectifiers.

203
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:25,234
We have also looked at
how to achieve saturation values

204
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:27,014
which are limited.

205
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:31,474
We have just finished looking
very quickly at the logarithmic converter

206
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,494
without giving examples,

207
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,994
while there are still
other non-linear functions

208
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:37,844
with the operational amplifier

209
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:41,271
I think that the listener
now has the capacity to analyse

210
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,611
this type of circuit.
